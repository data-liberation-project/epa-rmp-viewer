      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\nThe Salt River Project Agricultural Improvement and Power District (SRP) owns and operates the Coronado Generating Station (CGS), a coal fired power plant, located approximately 7 miles northeast of St. Johns, Arizona off Highway 191. CGS operates two coal fired units (Unit 1 and 2) which have a combined electrical output of 912 gross megawatts (MW).\n\nIn August 2008, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) reached a settlement agreement with SRP which required CGS to reduce its 2007 emissions of nitrogen oxide (NOx) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) by 21,000 tons per year.  To meet these emission reduction requirements, SRP implemented the Coronado Emissions Control Project (CECP).  As part of the CECP, SRP installed a selective catalytic reduction (SCR) system on Unit 2 at CGS. In 2024, modifications will be made to the SCR system so that both Unit 1 and Unit 2 will have SCR.  To accomplish this, the Unit 2 SCR will be split. The north tower will serve Unit 1 and the south tower will serve Unit 2. No changes are planned to the amount of ammonia stored on site.  The existing ammonia tank farm will serve both units.\n\nThe SCR system reduces NOx emissions using anhydrous ammonia. Due to the storage of anhydrous ammonia in a quantity greater than the threshold value of 10,000 pounds, SRP is required to meet the Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions contained in Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (40 CFR) Part 68 and the Process Safety Management (PSM) provisions under 29 CFR \u00a71910.119.  Through the development and implementation of this Risk Management Plan (RMP), as contained herein, SRP is satisfying all requirements under 40 CFR 68 and 29 CFR \u00a71910.119.  This executive summary is prepared in accordance with the requirements of 40 CFR \u00a768.155.\n\nThis RMP/PSM plan is being updated effective 12/11/2023 to incorporate revisions that have been made to the plan since the original publication in February of 2014.  \n1.1\tACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTI"

      "SummaryText": "ON AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\nSRP is committed to preventing accidental releases at CGS.  Anhydrous ammonia storage and distribution at CGS is covered by an accidental release Program 3 Prevention Program developed and implemented by SRP.  In addition, SRP has developed a site emergency response program, which includes, but is not limited to, procedures for response to an accidental release, procedures for informing public and local emergency response agencies, and employee training on emergency procedures.\n1.2\tSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\nCGS utilizes anhydrous ammonia in their SCR system for the purpose of reducing NOx emissions.  The anhydrous ammonia is a regulated substance under 40 CFR Part 68 and is stored at quantities greater than the RMP threshold of 10,000 pounds.\n \n1.3\tGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\nIn accordance with the requirements of 40 CFR \u00a768.10(i)(2), SRP has implemented a Program 3 Prevention Program for the ammonia system at CGS.  This program contains a variety of measures to prevent accidental releases, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\n?\tPeriodic hazard reviews and updates\n?\tPeriodic audits of the system and its operation\n?\tEmergency response plan that is coordinated with local emergency response agencies.\n\nThe anhydrous ammonia system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with all applicable regulations.  CGS employees responsible for handling anhydrous ammonia are thoroughly trained on safety procedures and operation and maintenance procedures for the anhydrous ammonia system.\n1.4\tFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia from the covered process at CGS in the past five years that have resulted in death, injury, or property damage on site, or known offsite impacts (deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering-in-place, property damage, or environmental damage).\n1.5\tEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM"

The key components of this program include:\n\n?\tProcedures for reporting an emergency.\n?\tProcedures for informing public and local emergency response agencies.\n?\tProper first aid and emergency medical treatment\n?\tProcedures for safely evacuating the facility.\n?\tProcedures for response after an accidental release\n?\tTraining for all employees\n \n1.6\tPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nA process hazard analysis (PHA) was completed in 2011 for the anhydrous ammonia system in accordance with the RMP Program 3 Prevention Program requirements.  The PHA was performed using the \u0093What If\u0094 analysis method.  The PHA identified 49 recommendations which, in general, fell into the following categories:\n\n?\tTraining\n?\tProcedures\n?\tPreventative Maintenance\n?\tPhysical Design\n\nThe PHA has subsequently been updated and revalidated in May 2016 and March 2021 using the \u0093What If\u0094 analysis method.  In August of 2023, the PHA was again updated using the HAZOP method as part of the Management-of-Change process for the spilt SCR project.\n\nAs required by 40 CFR \u00a768.190(b)(1), the PHA will continue to be updated and revalidated at least every five years (more frequently if needed based on the Management-of-Change process) to update safety measures and implement improvements as needed to ensure the ongoing safe operation of the anhydrous ammonia system at the CGS facility."
