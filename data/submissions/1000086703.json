Hazard reviews are performed on an established schedule of every five years.\r\n\r\nThe hazard review provides a means for determining if the process is designed and operated in accordance with standard industry codes and federal and/or local regulations.

One part of these systems is the risk management program which helps manage the risks at the facility and complies with the requirements of the 40 CFR Part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule). One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit an RMP describing the risk management program at the facility. \r\n\r\nThis document satisfies the requirements of the RMP rule and provides the public with a description of the risk management program at The Wastewater Treatment Facility.\r\n\r\n2.1\tDevelop and Implement a Management System (40 CFR 68.15)\r\n\r\nThe Wastewater Treatment Operator at facility is responsible for the development and implementation of the RMP and process safety management for the facility.

It is the Sewerage Commission's policy that in the conduct of its activities it will strive to protect and promote the health and safety of its employees, customers, and others who may be affected by these activities, and to limit adverse effects on the physical environment. As part of this policy, the Sewerage Commission has established systems to facilitate safe operation of the process at this facility. One element of this system is preparation and submittal of a risk management plan (RMP) in conformance with the United States Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68 Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions. The Wastewater Treatment Facility is categorized as a Program 2 facility.\r\n\r\nThe Wastewater Treatment Facility operates a process that has more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance in a process, as determined under 40 CFR 68.115. The process is defined as the disinfection and dechlorination of wastewater. The Wastewater Treatment Facility has over the threshold quantities of 2,500 pounds (lbs) for chlorine and 5,000 lbs for sulfur dioxide on site. An offsite consequence analysis shows that the release of a toxic chemical has an endpoint which would reach a public receptor. However, since the facility is not subject to OSHA process safety management standard, 29 CFR 1910.119 or does not have a qualifying NAICS code, the facility is assigned a Program 2 designation.\r\n\r\n2.0\tEXECUTIVE SUMMARY \r\n\r\nThe Wastewater Treatment Facility is committed to operating in a manner that is safe for the plant workers, the public, and the environment.
