THE FACILITY POLICY: The owners, managers, and employees of Trenton Cooperative \n\nEquity Exchange are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous \n\nammonia by utilization of proper equipment, regular inspections, and maintenance and \n\ntraining of all persons that work with the materials.\n\n               Should an accidental release occur, the facility has orientated the local fire                   \n\n            Department and the local emergency planning committee so they can plan for Response     \n\n            to any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment?\n\n2.    FACILITY INFORMATION: The primary activity at the facility as the storage for sale to \n\nfarmers. Anhydrous Ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a \n\ncrop production nutrient. The maximum quantity stored would be 78000 pounds in the \n\nfacility?s storage tank.\n\n3.    The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of the storage tank \n\nrelease as a gas over 10 minutes. The maximum quantity released would be 78000 pounds, \n\nwhich represents the volume of the storage tank at 85% capacity as limited by design \n\nstandards and company procedures. The distance to the endpoint of dispersion based on the \n\nmodel used is 1.16 miles.\n\n                The Alternative-case release scenario is assumed to be a release from the                      \n\n               rupture of a 2 inch line, with 12000 pounds released over 2 minutes.  The                           \n\n               distance to the endpoint of dispersion is .56 miles.\n\n4.    THE ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PROGRAM:  The facility complies with the            \n\nrules and Regulations relating to the handling of Anhydrous Ammonia and Low Pressure \n\nNitrogen Solution, Equipment, Containers and Storage Facilities.  These regulations \n\nadministered by the Illinois Department of "

THE FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY: There have been no accidental releases of \n\nanhydrous ammonia for the covered process in the past five years that have caused any \n\ndeaths, injuries, or significant property damage on sit nor to our knowledge, have any \n\naccidental releases resulted in off site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, \n\nproperty damage or environmental damage.\n\n6.    THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:  The facility has a written emergency action \n\nplan in accordance with OSHA standard 29CFR 1910.38 and provide state and local \n\nauthorities the emergency planning and community right-to know information as required \n\nunder SARA Title III of EPCRA. Our emergency response action plan has been reviewed \n\nwith the local fire department and provide to the local emergency planning committee for \n\ncoordination in the community response planning.\n\n7.    PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY: Safety improvements are an on-going \n\nprocess at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe \n\npractices and operations.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia Safety \n\nrecommendations for implementation at this time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            ________________________\n\n            Keith Wall\n\n            Trenton Co-op\n\n"
