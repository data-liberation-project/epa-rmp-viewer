Established in 1988, Responsible Care is a voluntary program focused on achieving improvements in environmental, health and safety performance beyond levels required by the U.S. government.\n\n\n\nIn addition to detailing practices for the safe use of materials and requiring audits, the Responsible Care initiative requires its member and partner companies to develop mechanisms for outreach within the communities in which they operate. Community Advisory Panels (CAP) serve as important links between chemical facilities and their neighboring communities. \n\n\n\nThe Honeywell facility is an active participant in the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and in the Hopewell Community Industrial Panel (HCIP), a CAP. Both organizations provide for ongoing cooperation and information-sharing with city leaders, citizens, and industrial neighbors on emergency planning , process safety, and related issues. \n\n\n\nHoneywell Hopewell Facility\n\n\n\nThe Honeywell Hopewell facility employees nearly 800 people and is the largest Caprolactam manufacturing site in the world. Ammonium sulfate, a granular fertilizer high in nitrogen and sulfur content, is produced as a co-product and is sold and distributed globally. \n\n\n\nThe site requires three main raw materials (natural gas, sulfur and phenol) to produce a variety of other products in addition to caprolactam and ammonium sulfate.  These include:\n\n* Cyclohexanone \n\n* Cyclohexanol\n\n* Adipic acid \n\n* Specialty chemicals:\n\n* Aldicarb oxime \n\n* Acetaldehyde oxime \n\n* Methylethyl ketoxime \n\n* Other oximes\n\nThese products are sold to other industrial customers for use in manufacturing various consumer products such as fertilizers, tennis shoes, lingerie, videotapes, paints and shellacs.\n\n\n\nOf the many chemicals at the Hopewell plant, seven are identified on the EPA list of highl"

The process safety and risk management initiatives are implemented as proactive approaches to minimize the potential for accidental releases.  Policies and procedures have been implemented to guide the plant to meet the requirements of the federal mandates.  \n\n\n\nEach of the seven chemicals on the EPA list at the Honeywell Hopewell facility have been evaluated based on EPA's guidelines.  Specific information related to each chemical is supplied in our risk management plan, available from the EPA.  In all of these cases, there are numerous safety devices to prevent and/or reduce the chance of a release occurring.  Examples of these devices include:\n\n* Remote operated shutoff valves\n\n* Remote detectors\n\n* Continuous process monitoring \n\n* Containment dikes \n\n\n\nAccidental releases are also minimized by safe plant design, frequent equipment modernization, computer-controlled alarm and shutdown interlock systems, and end-of-pipe control systems when appropriate.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\nThe Hopewell facility has established specific guidelines and procedures for compiling and maintaining written information for the chemical processes we operate.  Specific responsibilities for maintaining this process safety information have been identified and assigned to qualified individuals.  The facility's hazard communication program communicates the health and environmental effects of chemicals to our employees.  We also maintain comprehensive evaluations of the process chemistry and operating conditions of all processes.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\n\n\nWe analyze each chemical process utilizing a method designed to evaluate the process for hazards such as fire, chemical release, and explosions.

The process safety analysis approach is applied to major modifications and also to minor operating changes.  Each process change or process modification undergoes rigorous technical evaluation using the highest standards of personal and community safety as the focal point.  We review the process hazard analyses on a continuing 5-year cycle so that we maintain a high degree of process safety integrity.  Each PHA uses the appropriate methodology to analyze potential hazards and their effects and provides for timely resolution of recommendations.  Recent hazard analyses have shown the need for additional redundant environmental control systems for those rare occasions when the primary control system requires preventative maintenance.  These recommended controls have been installed.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nWritten operating procedures are structured to cover all aspects of plant operation including startup, shutdown, normal operations, upset conditions and emergency response. Each operating area of the plant has specific operating procedures developed by those people most knowledgeable in the plant operation, including operators and area supervisors.  Other process operators and supervisors review these procedures for accuracy and consistency.  After review, the department manager verifies that they are accurate and up-to-date and annually certifies the operating procedures.  Operators work closely with process engineers as process modifications take place to make sure the operating procedures include information relating to the process changes.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\n\n\nBesides standard operating procedures, the Hopewell facility has developed extensive training materials to support the development of individuals into highly trained and qualified process operators.

Operators are trained on computers that simulate real-life plant situations before they can qualify to work in the operating areas of the plant.  The Hopewell plant operators are required to complete a multi-year training program before becoming fully qualified.  To assist in documenting and tracking employee training, we have installed a software program which involves self-directed learning, online information databases and integrated procedures and training manuals. \n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\n\n\nMechanical integrity of plant equipment is another way we reduce the probability and consequences of accidental releases.  We assure that equipment is fit for its intended service.  Extensive on-going inspection programs are key to maintaining the process equipment. Guidelines and procedures have been developed and are followed by employees performing the inspections.  These individuals are trained and qualified to analyze data and provide operations with timely information for continued safe equipment operation.  Quality assurance of new equipment, processes and spare parts provide additional confidence that the equipment containing the process chemicals will perform as designed.  For example, process vessels holding chemicals are inspected/evaluated on a preset timetable using visual, ultrasonic thickness testing, and/or other non-destructive techniques as needed.  Based on the results of these tests, appropriate actions are taken to assure that the vessels continue to be fit-for-service. \n\n\n\nManagement of Change\n\n\n\nManaging change is a key activity associated with process safety and risk management.

These checklists serve as a reminder and give guidance for support groups as they evaluate the requested changes.  The support groups provide written documentation to the owning departments verifying that the requested change has been thoroughly reviewed and will be implemented in a safe manner.  \n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\n\n\nCompliance audits serve as verification that the process safety and risk management programs are functioning as per the federal mandates.  Formal, comprehensive audits are performed at least every three years on the entire prevention component of RMP (Process Safety Management).  Targeted audits are performed on a more frequent basis to maintain an on-going level of process safety. A monthly  safety audit program often includes PSM elements as the primary topic. The Honeywell corporate audit team provides an additional level of evaluation for enhanced compliance.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\n\n\nThe facility has specific procedures for addressing unplanned events.

Due to the variety of flammables used in the plant, it is mandatory that any hot work be thoroughly reviewed and strict adherence to the procedure is required. A permit system with very detailed and specific check-off requirements is used in order to achieve our goal of safe hot work.\n\n\n\nContractors\n\n\n\nThe Hopewell plant's contractor safety program encompasses contractor screening for suitability to perform to Honeywell standards.
