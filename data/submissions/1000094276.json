Two entrepreneurs opened Albemarle, Tyrone Plant for business in 1976.  In 1986, Albemarle, Tyrone Plant was bought by First Chemical Company of Pascagoula, MS.  First Chemical Company is a subsidiary of First Mississippi Corporation, who was restructured under the name of ChemFirst Inc. in late 1996. Albemarle Corporation purchased the site in July of 2001.  WR Grace purchased the site on June 1, 2021. \n\n\n\nThe facility is designed for maximum flexibility and is continuously upgraded to ensure safe operation, minimal waste, and top efficiency.  We have more than 80,000 gallons of reactor capacity and a complete range of solids handling equipment.  The plant is especially well equipped for complex, multi-step synthesis.  WR Grace, Tyrone Plant's production operations consist of the batch production of specific and finite campaigns to produce chemicals for our customers.\n\n\n\nThe facility's Quality and Environmental management systems are ISO 9001 (Quality) and RC 14001 (Environmental and Safety) registered.\n\n\n\nFACILITY POLICIES FOR ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVETION AND EMERGENCY REPSONSE\n\n\n\nCompany environmental and safety/health policy statements stress the importance of protecting the safety and health of our employees as well as that of the community and the public.  \"The world's natural resources of air, water, and land are finite and must be conserved and protected.

These chemicals and their maximum intended inventory levels are: anhydrous ammonia, 77,000 pounds; diethyl ether 40,000 pounds; and chlorine 22,000 pounds.\n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is a gas delivered by truck and maintained in pressurized tanks.  Diethyl ether is stored in tanker trucks, and chlorine is stored in one ton cylinders.    In addition to minimizing the inventory of these and other chemicals that are needed for our production operations, we also try to remove the chemicals from our site when they are no longer needed for a production campaign.\n\n\n\nWORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\n\n\nWorst-case release scenarios have been modeled for anhydrous ammonia, ethyl ether, and chlorine.  An alternative release scenario has also been modeled for each substance as well. Some of the releases have off-site impact. \n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammonia for the worst-case scenario the pressurized tanks leaks and releases 77,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia  (the entire contents of the pressurized tank) in 10 minutes.  This scenario DOES NOT take into account the plant's safety and prevention systems and assumes nothing is done to minimize the release.\n\n\n\nFor diethyl ether the tanker fails and releases 40,000 pounds of diethyl ether (the entire contents of the tanker) in 10 minutes. A vapor cloud explosion occurs. This scenario DOES NOT take into account the plant's safety and prevention systems and assumes nothing is done to minimize the release.\n\n\n\n \n\nFor chlorine, the cylinder fails and releases 2,000 pounds of chlorine gas (the entire contents of the cylinder) in 10 minutes.  This scenario DOES NOT take into account the plant's safety and prevention systems and assumes nothing is done to minimize"

The Engineering Department develops relief system design using a computer program and often customer recommendations.  The R&D Department develops material balances for the reactions.  The Engineering Department generates a list of safety systems and engineering controls (i.e., interlocks, pressure relief devices, computer alarms and controls), which are used during a project.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis:  The Production Project Coordinator, Safety Department, Engineering, Production, and Customer representatives conduct a Process Hazard Analysis for each project under the direction of Tyrone's Process Safety Advisor.  Administrative control of the projects is maintained by the use of a Production Batch Record for each batch that is produced, Production Shift Supervisor Checklists for each shift, and Production Coordinator weekly production reports.  Facility siting concerns are reviewed using a checklist developed by the Engineering Department.  Human factors are covered during the PHA.  The Production Department has established Standard Operating Procedures for corrective action systems for both ISO 9001 and RC 14001.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures:  Production Coordinators write Batch Records for each project.

Annually, all employees receive training in their duties under the plan, and the evacuation plan is practiced at least once each year.  Each shift has a trained Emergency Response Team that is equipped to respond to fires, spills and releases, and medical emergencies.  Each Team is comprised of employees and is led by its shift supervisor, who assumes the role of Incident Commander during any on-site emergency.  WR Grace, Tyrone Plant emergency response personnel receive appropriate training (i.e., confined space rescue, SCBA, fire fighting, spill response); some members are also certified in CPR and first aid response.  Drills are conducted at least twice/year for each crew's response personnel.  The safety department determines the scenario for each drill.  After the drill is completed, it is critiqued; the findings and recommendations are used to help design future drills and training exercises.  Using this approach, each Team addresses specific response areas that need improvement.\n\n\n\nAll production and maintenance employees are also trained to respond to spills and releases, and all employees receive training in the use of handheld fire extinguishers to extinguish incipient stage fires.  In addition, the facility is protected with a foam sprinkler system, and is also equipped with several outdoor fire monitors and wheeled fire extinguishers that may be used in the event of a larger fire.
