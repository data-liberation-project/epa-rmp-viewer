      "SummaryText": "Introduction and Policies \r\n\r\nThe Flint Hills Resources (FHR) Pine Bend Refinery is located at 12255 Clark Rd. in Rosemount, MN.\r\nFHR is committed to managing all operations in a manner that protects the environment and the health and safety of employees, customers, contractors, and the public while fully complying with applicable laws and regulations. FHR's management philosophy goals are achieved through the implementation of its Environmental, Health, and Safety Management Systems, by the personal commitments of employees and contractors, and by open communication with employees, customers, neighbors, and regulators.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this Risk Management Plan is to provide information about operations at the facility, programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, emergency response plans in the event of an accidental release, the five-year accident history of the facility, and planned changes to improve safety at the plant. \r\n\r\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances \r\n\r\nFHR Pine Bend is an oil refinery located in Rosemount, Minnesota. The facility has a 320,000 barrels per day capacity. The refinery produces a variety of products, including asphalt, aviation gasoline, gasoline, fuel oil, butane, propane, etc. These products are distributed via pipelines, trucks, barges, and railcars.\r\n\r\nThere is one covered process at the Pine Bend Refinery. The refinery contains flammable mixtures, hydrogen sulfide, and anhydrous ammonia in amounts greater than the threshold quantity.\r\nThe facility is subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard, 29 CFR 1910.119, and regulated under EPA Risk Management Program 40 CFR Part 68 - Program Level 3 requirements. \r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies \r\n\r\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs in place at the facility are part of the high standards adopted by FHR. These high standards include: \r\n\u00bfOperating in compliance with required environmental permits and regu"

This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our processes. Pine Bend adheres to process safety policies, guidelines, and best practices that have been developed based on company and industry experience over the years. FHR's practice is to implement the controls necessary to prevent releases of regulated substances to the environment. However, if a release does occur, trained FHR personnel will respond, to control and contain the incident. \r\n\r\nPrevention Program \r\n\r\nFHR Pine Bend is operating under the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Program. Ongoing analysis of the potential hazards of the process, detailed training of employees and emphasis on safety has contributed to process safety. The facility has had no RMP incidents over the last 5 years. Part of this program has also involved identifying and taking steps to avoid potential accidental chemical releases, as part of a detailed prevention program. A few examples of the prevention features implemented at this facility include: \r\n\u00bfDedication to becoming a Learning Organization, implementing Human & Organization Performance (HOP) principles to better understand human factors in incident investigations\r\n\u00bfUsing power applications to improve visibility of PHA results and layers of protection data to the organization and affected employees\r\n\u00bfPlanning of high-risk work using formalized review process\r\n\u00bfManagement of change processes ensure changes a"

Or, if hazards are identified, ensure proper mitigations are identified. \r\n\u00bfProcess Hazard Analysis are completed to ensure hazards within the site are identified and safeguards are in place to ensure risk is reduced.\r\n\r\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/ exposure treatment considerations, is provided in safety data sheets (SDS). This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known hazards associated with handling and exposure to the chemicals. The refinery has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition, flow, pressure) in a Key Process Parameter Document. The refinery ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\r\n\r\nFive-Year Accident History \r\n\r\nEPA requires that all incidents involving regulated chemicals that resulted in any off-site impact or significant on-site impact be reported in this document. Within the last five years there were no releases of hazardous materials that resulted in onsite injuries, death, or property damage. \r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program \r\n\r\nThe facility continues to conduct emergency response preparedness activities and coordinate any emergency response actions necessary with the Rosemount Fire Department and Dakota County Emergency Preparedness Department. The Minnesota State Police, local hospitals and other coordinating agencies also continue to be involved in emergency response for the facility.\r\n\r\nThe Pine Bend Vice President/Manufacturing Manager and Environmental Health & Safety Director are responsible for coordinating the emergency actions, in coordination with the site's full time Fire Chief/Emergency Response Coordinator.

The Emergency Response Program provides the essential planning for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  \r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety \r\n\r\nCompliance with the RMP Prevention Program forms the framework for continuous safety improvement. Some of the key components of the safety program are: \r\n\u00bfThe Management of Change provisions ensure that the potential safety and health impacts of changes made to process chemicals, technology, equipment or procedures are considered. \r\n\u00bfThe Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) provisions serve as a tool to ensure timely evaluation of potential hazards, thereby leading to continual improvements in safety standards. \r\n\u00bfThe Mechanical Integrity provisions ensure that process equipment and instrumentation are designed, constructed, installed, and maintained to minimize the risk of hazardous releases, thereby serving as an integral part of the safety program. \r\n\r\nSpecific actions that will be taken at the facility in the future to improve the level of safety include: \r\n\u00bfThermal PSV isolation management system\r\n\u00bfEffort to automate or improve human-dependent actions credited as PHA layers of protection\r\n\u00bfIdentify hazards of atmospheric release devices and ensure proper mitigation is in place"
