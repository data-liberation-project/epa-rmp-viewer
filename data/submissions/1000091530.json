FHR's management philosophy goals are achieved through the implementation of its Environmental, Health, and Safety Management Systems, by the personal commitments of employees and contractors, and by open communication with employees, customers, neighbors, and regulators.\n\n\n\nThe purpose of this Risk Management Plan is to provide information about operations at the facility, programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, emergency response plans in the event of an accidental release, the five-year accident history of the facility, and planned changes to improve safety at the plant. \n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances \n\n\n\nFHR Pine Bend is an oil refinery located in Rosemount, Minnesota. The facility has a 320,000 barrels per day capacity. The refinery produces a variety of products, including asphalt, aviation gasoline, gasoline, fuel oil, butane, propane, etc. These products are distributed via pipelines, trucks, barges, and railcars.\n\n\n\nThere is one covered process at the Pine Bend Refinery. The refinery contains flammable mixtures, hydrogen sulfide, and anhydrous ammonia in amounts greater than the threshold quantity.\n\nThe facility is subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard, 29 CFR 1910.119, and regulated under EPA Risk Management Program 40 CFR Part 68 - Program Level 3 requirements. \n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies \n\n\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs in place at the facility are part of the high standards adopted by FHR. These high standards include: \n\n?Operating in compliance with required environmental permits and regu"

This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our processes. Pine Bend adheres to process safety policies, guidelines, and best practices that have been developed based on company and industry experience over the years. FHR's practice is to implement the controls necessary to prevent releases of regulated substances to the environment. However, if a release does occur, trained FHR personnel will respond, to control and contain the incident. \n\n\n\nPrevention Program \n\n\n\nFHR Pine Bend is operating under the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Program. Ongoing analysis of the potential hazards of the process, detailed training of employees and emphasis on safety has contributed to process safety. The facility has had no RMP incidents over the last 5 years. Part of this program has also involved identifying and taking steps to avoid potential accidental chemical releases, as part of a detailed prevention program. A few examples of the prevention features implemented at this facility include: \n\n?Dedication to becoming a Learning Organization, implementing Human & Organization Performance (HOP) principles to better understand human factors in incident investigations\n\n?Using power applications to improve visibility of PHA results and layers of protection data to the organization and affected employees\n\n?Planning of high-risk work using formalized review process\n\n?Management of change processes ensure changes a"

Or, if hazards are identified, ensure proper mitigations are identified. \n\n?Process Hazard Analysis are completed to ensure hazards within the site are identified and safeguards are in place to ensure risk is reduced.\n\n\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/ exposure treatment considerations, is provided in safety data sheets (SDS). This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known hazards associated with handling and exposure to the chemicals. The refinery has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition, flow, pressure) in a Key Process Parameter Document. The refinery ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History \n\n\n\nEPA requires that all incidents involving regulated chemicals that resulted in any off-site impact or significant on-site impact be reported in this document. Within the last five years there were no releases of hazardous materials that resulted in onsite injuries, death, or property damage. \n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program \n\n\n\nThe facility continues to conduct emergency response preparedness activities and coordinate any emergency response actions necessary with the Rosemount Fire Department and Dakota County Emergency Preparedness Department.
