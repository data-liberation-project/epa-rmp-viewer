The Westvaco De Ridder Chemical Plant will be subject to the regulation because aqueous ammonia in greater than threshold quantities (20,000 lb of NH3 in concentrations exceeding 20%) are presently used.  \n\nEPA recognizes that some processes that are regulated under this program would not pose an off-site hazard in the event of an accidental release.  Such processes, classified as Program 1, have simplified requirements because off-site emergency response is not required.  To qualify for Program 1, a facility with a regulated toxic chemical needs to meet two requirements:\n\n1) no release over the most recent 5-year period has resulted in off-site injury or environmental damage; and \n\n2) dispersion modeling demonstrates that a worst-case release (as defined by the regulation) will not result in concentrations at public receptors that exceed the toxic endpoint.\n\nThe Risk Management Plan requirements for Program 1 processes are as follows:\n\n7 Registration\n7 Accident history\n7 Hazard assessment for worst-case releases\n7 Coordinate emergency response procedures with local emergency planning and response organizations\n7 Certification\n\nThe following sections of the Risk Management Plan executive summary demonstrate that the ammonia process at Westvaco De Ridder qualifies for Program 1.\n\n 3.0   HAZARD ASSESSMENT\n\n3.1    Five-Year Accident History\n\nIn conjunction with the current ARP programs in place at the Westvaco Chemical facilities, there is a standard management practice that requires immediate internal reporting of unusual events, including those in which any abnormal emission of regulated chemicals is observed"

The incident information is reviewed by supervisory staff and a determination is made as to whether a reportable quantity of any chemical listed as requiring reports to regulatory authorities is involved.  If so, the appropriate authorities are promptly notified. \n\nDuring the past 5 years there has been no accident involving aqueous ammonia that qualifies for reporting under 40 CFR Part 68.  This means that no accident has resulted in reportable on-site injury, off-site injury, off-site evacuation or sheltering in place, or off-site damage to property or the environment.  Thus, Westvaco's De Ridder facility meets Program 1 accident history requirements.\n\n3.2  Worst-Case Release Assessment \n\nAs defined by 40 CFR Part 68, a worst-case release for a liquid is an instantaneous spill of the largest contents of any single vessel onto a flat, non-absorbing surface, accounting for passive mitigation (such as a dike or enclosure).  To standardize and simplify to a practical level the many factors that can potentially occur in an accidental release situation, worst-case assumptions do not take into account the available active preventive measures or mitigation methods that would diminish or even eliminate the implied risks that are suggested by \"worst-case\" analyses.  \n\nFor the Westvaco Chemical Division De Ridder, LA facility, the worst-case release scenario is a spill under stable meteorological conditions (see section 3.2.1, below) of 15,599 gallons (80,500 lb) of a 30% ammonium hydroxide solution into a diked area. The available surface area in the dike is 1018 sq. ft and the dike is 1.5 ft deep.  This will effectively limit the spill area and reduce the rate of release of ammonia to the atmosphere in the event of a release.  The storage tank and dike are surrounded by buildings, tanks, and structures of varying height which, as the pool of spilled ammonium hydroxide evaporates into the atmosphere, will help increase the rate of dispersion.\n\n3.2.1 Worst-Cas"

      "SummaryText": "e Evaporation and Dispersion \n\nEPA regulation requires that worst-case analyses be conducted using stability class F and 1.5 m/sec wind speeds. These conditions, consistent with minimal mixing, occur during the night under clear skies and light winds.  The EPA has published RMP Off-site Consequence Analysis Guidance\n (OCAG, May 1996) which provides a basic approach to estimate endpoint distances. However, the\n lack of precision in the OCAG dispersion tables requires the application of more refined techniques.  The evaporate emissions calculations in the OCAG are based on a temperature of 770 F.  The rule requires that if dispersion techniques other than the OCAG are applied, the maximum daily temperature be used.  A review of climatological data for the National Weather Service reporting station at Lake Charles, LA indicated a recorded high temperature of 1010 F.  This higher value was conservatively assumed as the temperature of the air, surface, and spilled solution even though such a high temperature is inconsistent with the worst-case dispersion conditions.  Under more realistic meteorological conditions, the evaporation rate of ammonia would be much less and the area affected by the spill would be much smaller.\n\nBecause a higher temperature than 770 F was used, the evaporation calculation contained in the OCAG was not applicable.  Rather, a specialized ammonia evaporation model, NH3POOL1 was used.  NH3POOL is a spreadsheet-based model that accounts for the variability of the evaporation rate according to temperature, wind speed and the ammonia solution concentration.  NH3POOL provides results that are equal to the OCAG for a 770F temperature.  The emissions model was then run using the higher 1010F temperature.  The maximum emission rate that would occur during the first 10 minutes after the spill is used in this assessment.  After this time, the emission rate would decrease along with the decreasing concentration of ammonia in the pool.\n\nAmmonia is a buoyant g"

Thus, emissions from a ground-level aqueous ammonia spill will have the tendency to rise above the ground and disperse more rapidly than would a passive tracer. \n\n3.2.2  Toxic Endpoint\n\nThe toxic endpoint for ammonia of 200 parts per million (ppm) as set by the Emergency Response Planning Guideline, Level 2 (ERPG-2), is protective for permanent or escape impairing injury for exposures up to one hour.  Thus, the use of the maximum 10-minute emission rate is conservative. \n\n3.2.3 Modeling Method\n\nThe area surrounding the Westvaco De Ridder plant is predominantly rural.  The release site is also dominated by large structures which generate a great deal of turbulence that will enhance the rate of dispersion in the vicinity of the ammonia tanks. EPA has developed model algorithms to simulate the effects of building wakes on dispersion of continuous releases.  These algorithms are included in the SCREEN3 dispersion model.\n \n SCREEN3 requires the specification of building dimensions to simulate aerodynamic wake effects. A review of building and structure dimensions near the ammonia storage tank indicates that dispersion of the ammonia plume will be affected for all wind directions.  The height of the tank farm including the superstructure is approximately 20 ft and the minimum horizontal dimension is 46 ft. SCREEN3 was then applied with the NH3POOL emission rate, with building dimensions corresponding to the tank farm and worst-case meteorological conditions.\n\nThe buoyancy associated with ammonia is accounted for in a spreadsheet-based program called LIFTOFF2, which estimates the reduction in ground-level concentration of ammonia from ground-level spills as a function of downwind distance.  The LIFTOFF factor is then applied to the SCREEN3 results to estimate the ground-level concentration associated with the buoyant plume. The modeled SCREEN3/LIFTOFF"

Dispersion was simulated using the SCREEN3 model in the rural mode, assuming the pool is a ground-level point source subject to aerodynamic downwash.  The worst-case endpoint distance associated with a ground-level concentration of 0.14 g/m3 is 250 m (820 ft) whereas the closest Westvaco facility boundary is located 305 m (1000 ft) from the ammonia tank. Thus, the worst-case modeled endpoint distance is well within the Westvaco site boundary and fenceline where access to the public is not allowed.  As such, no public or environmental receptors would be adversely affected by a worst-case ammonia release. Thus, the Westvaco process that uses aqueous ammonia is eligible for Program 1 under EPA's Accident Prevention and Risk Management Regulations (40 CFR Part 68).\n \n\n4.0   ACCIDENT PREVENTION\n\nProgram 1 requirements under 40 CFR Part 68 do not mandate a formal accident prevention program.
