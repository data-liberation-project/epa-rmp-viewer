Ton containers of chlorine are used to sanitize produce wash water.  Chlorine is utilized during the potato packing season only, and is not typically maintained above threshold quantities on site during the remainder of the year.  Therefore, this initial RMP submission coincides with the date on which chlorine is again seasonally present in the water treatment process, above the threshold quantity, in accordance with the RMP rule.\n\nWORST CASE SCENARIO\nThe worst case toxic gas gas release scenario is considered to be a ton container of chlorine releasing its entire contents in ten minutes.  The worst case is neither realistic nor likely to occur, but is addressed in the federal regulations primarily as a baseline reference of comparative risk.  Theoretically speaking, a complete volatilization of the ton container of chlorine in ten minutes time could produce a vapor cloud of harmful concentrations which may extend over a considerable distance.  If such a release were even physically plausible, there could be residential populations (depending on wind direction) and industrial sites affected.  Such would not necessarily be the case for the more credible alternative release scenario.\n\nALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO\nThe alternative toxic gas release scenario is considered to be a slightly damaged valve or fusible plug on the chlorine ton container with a predicted release rate of 15 pounds per minute.  This is a more credible worst case scenario and could result in a chlorine vapor cloud of harmful concentrations which may extend a relatively shorter distance from the facility as compared to the theoretical worst case re"

All regulated substance storage areas will be labeled with the appropriate National Fire Protection Agency (NFPA) hazard warning placards."
