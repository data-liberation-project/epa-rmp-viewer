The accidental release prevention and emergency response policy includes working with the surrounding community and local emergency response agencies to promote a spirit of cooperation and teamwork, to orchestrate an effective contingency plan in the unlikely event of a process incident occurring at the facility. The emergency action plan includes procedures for notifying the North Attleborough Fire Department, if necessary.\n\n\n\n(b) The Stationary Source and Substance Handled: The North Attleborough Wastewater Treatment Facility is a stationary source operating for the purpose of treating industrial and domestic wastewater from the Town of North Attleborough as well as the Town of Plainville.   Chlorine, which is a regulated, toxic substance, is used as part of the treatment process.\n\n\n\n(c) General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:  The Town of North Attleborough has implemented a comprehensive program to safely manage chlorine at the North Attleborough Wastewater Treatment Facility located at 65 Cedar Road in North Attleborough, MA.\n\n\n\nThe North Attleborough Wastewater Treatment Facility is a public utility, though on March 9, 2018, a legislative bill was passed which applies OSHA standards to municipal workers in the Commonwealth of Mass"

Based on the Risk Management Program, Program Level applicability provisions, the covered process at the North Attleborough Wastewater Treatment Facility meets the criteria of a Program Level 3 process.\n\n\n\nThe North Attleborough Wastewater Treatment Facility has developed an accidental release prevention program and implemented chemical-specific prevention steps to manage the covered process.  The program includes both a documented compliance manual and administrative procedures to manage the program.  Specific elements of the program include, but are not limited to:\n\n-A documented management system\n\n-Completion of routine hazard assessments, including an offsite consequence analysis\n\n-Assembly and retention of chlorine safety information and other process safety information\n\n-A process hazard analysis program to evaluate the controls and safeguards of the process\n\n-Written standard operating procedures for chlorine management and operations\n\n-A written training program for the risk management program, inclusive of applicable operating, maintenance, and emergency response procedures\n\n-A chlorine system, mechanical integrity program\n\n-A management of change process to evaluate process changes\n\n-A prestart-up safety review program to review applicable process changes\n\n-A system for routine compliance audits, inclusive of third-party audits, as applicable\n\n-A written incident investigation program\n\n-A written employee participation program to involve applicable employees in the program\n\n-A hot work permit program, inclusive of hot work permits\n\n-A contractor selection and evaluation program \n\n-A written emergency response program\n\n-A documented Risk Management Plan\n\n\n\nIn addition to the covered process, accidental release prevention program, the facility has an active safety program, involving a"

Additionally, select facility personnel receive ongoing safety training, including First-Aid/CPR, and ongoing training to maintain professional certifications.\n\n\n\n(d) Five Year Accident History:  There have been no accidental releases meeting the definition contained in 40 CFR ?68.42(a) within the last five years of operation, or in the history of the plant.\n\n\n\n(e) The Emergency Response Program: The North Attleborough Wastewater Treatment Facility has developed a comprehensive Emergency Response (i.e. Action) Plan. The plan addresses fires, explosions, spills or releases of hazardous chemicals (including chlorine), severe weather, and other potential emergency conditions. The plan details response actions by facility personnel for such emergencies, safety and emergency equipment, communication responsibilities, and coordination with off-site responders, as well as notification of local, state, and federal agencies.\n\n\n\nThe Emergency Action Plan includes emergency response to chlorine releases. Should an emergency release of chlorine occur at the facility, the facility will be evacuated, the North Attleborough Fire Department will be notified, and the Fire Department will assume Incident Command.\n\n\n\n(f) Planned Changes to Improve Safety: The North Attleborough Wastewater Treatment Facility completed its most recent Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) in the second quarter of 2019. As a result of the PHA review, a number of improvements to the risk management program have either been completed or are planned.  The improvements are intended to improve the safety of the process and minimize the potential for a release.
