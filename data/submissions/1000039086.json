Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the plant has\r\nprocedures in place to ensure that contractors, (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) are aware of any\r\nhazards in the workplace, (3) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (4) understand\r\nand follow site safety rules, and (5) inform plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.\r\n\r\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSR's): The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures,\r\npersonnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup before placing modified equipment into\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity: The Plant has well established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels,\r\npiping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems\r\nin safe operating condition.\r\n\r\nSafe Work Practices and Procedures: Examples of safe work practices include methods for controlling plant\r\nentry, presence and exit of support personnel, and lockout/ tagout procedures to ensure isolation of energy\r\nsources for equipment undergoing maintenance, hot work procedures and permits for work with the\r\npotential for generating ignition sources in the presence of flammable or combustible material, and confined\r\nspace entry permits and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry is allowed\r\ninto a permit required confined space.\r\n\r\nTraining: The plant has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in\r\noperating a process. The program includes Classroom, OJT, and computer-base"

Employees are\r\ntested to demonstrate competency.\r\n\r\nManagement of Change: Changes are reviewed to ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any\r\nnew hazards and to verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.\r\nIncident Investigation: The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts concerning an incident or near\r\nmiss and to develop corrective actions to prevent recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.\r\nCompliance Audits: Audits are conducted on a regular basis to ensure that the facility is in compliance with\r\napplicable RMP / PSM / SIP procedures and regulations.\r\n\r\nFive-year Accident History:\r\n\r\nNo reportable release of a regulated substance has occurred in the last 5 years.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program Information:\r\n\r\nThe Plant maintains a written emergency response program to protect employees, contractors, public and\r\nthe environment from hazards associated with accidental releases of regulated substances. The program\r\nconsists of procedures for responding to releases of regulated substances, including the possibility of\r\nassociated fires or explosions. The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including\r\nevacuation plans, accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response\r\nagencies and the public, if a release occurs. Employees receive training in these procedures annually to\r\nperform emergency response duties. The program is updated when necessary based on modifications made\r\nto the gas plant processes. Emergency response program changes are administered through the MOC\r\nprocess. The overall emergency response program for the Plant is coordinated with The McPherson County\r\nEmergency Planning Committee (LEPC). This coordination includes attending periodic meetings of the\r\ncommittee, which includes local emergency response officials and industry representatives. The Plant has\r\n24-hour communications capability with the LEPC. The Plant conducts"
