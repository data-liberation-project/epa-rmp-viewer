It includes required actions by plant employees as well\n\nas required notification and coordination with local responders and agencies. All employees are trained in the\n\nexecution of the Emergency Response Plan and drills are conducted annually.\n\n\n\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated substances:\n\n\n\nNatural Gas Liquids (NGLs) (i.e., varying mixtures of demethanized NGLs, ethane, propane, iso-butane,\n\nnormal butane, natural gasoline, and Naptha) are stored in caverns at ConWest for subsequent delivery by\n\npipeline to other facilities. The total volume of the available cavern storage is fixed. However, each individual\n\ncavern may be used for more than one NGL, depending on marketplace requirements.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program:\n\n\n\nThe ConWest Plant has implemented all the elements of a Program 3 Risk Management Plan (RMP) and all\n\nthe elements of OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) program. The plant has also implanted all the\n\nelements of Williams Midstream's System Integrity Plan (SIP), which contains additional environmental,\n\nhealth, and safety standards. Key element of these programs include:\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information: A variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of\n\nthe process.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA): A systematic examination of the plant to identify possible hazards and ensure\n\nthat adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures: The Plant maintains written procedures tha"

Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the plant has\n\nprocedures in place to ensure that contractors, (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) are aware of any\n\nhazards in the workplace, (3) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (4) understand\n\nand follow site safety rules, and (5) inform plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.\n\n\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSR's): The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures,\n\npersonnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup before placing modified equipment into\n\nservice.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity: The Plant has well established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels,\n\npiping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems\n\nin safe operating condition.\n\n\n\nSafe Work Practices and Procedures: Examples of safe work practices include methods for controlling plant\n\nentry, presence and exit of support personnel, and lockout/ tagout procedures to ensure isolation of energy\n\nsources for equipment undergoing maintenance, hot work procedures and permits for work with the\n\npotential for generating ignition sources in the presence of flammable or combustible material, and confined\n\nspace entry permits and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry is allowed\n\ninto a permit required confined space.\n\n\n\nTraining: The plant has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in\n\noperating a process. The program includes Classroom, OJT, and computer-base"

The program\n\nconsists of procedures for responding to releases of regulated substances, including the possibility of\n\nassociated fires or explosions. The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including\n\nevacuation plans, accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response\n\nagencies and the public, if a release occurs. Employees receive training in these procedures annually to\n\nperform emergency response duties. The program is updated when necessary based on modifications made\n\nto the gas plant processes. Emergency response program changes are administered through the MOC\n\nprocess. The overall emergency response program for the Plant is coordinated with The McPherson County\n\nEmergency Planning Committee (LEPC). This coordination includes attending periodic meetings of the\n\ncommittee, which includes local emergency response officials and industry representatives. The Plant has\n\n24-hour communications capability with the LEPC. The Plant conducts"
