As part of this commitment, we have established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility.  One component of this system is a Risk Management Program (RMP) that helps manage the risks involved with using regulated hazardous substances at our facility and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit an executive summary in the risk management plan (RMP) describing the risk management program at Foley Cellulose LLC.  This document is intended to satisfy the executive summary requirement.\n\nOur risk management program consists of three elements:\n1. A hazard assessment designed to help us understand (a) the potential offsite consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and (b) accidents that have occurred during the last five years associated with the substances regulated by the RMP rule - see Sections 3 and 5 below.\n\n2. A prevention program to help maintain and safely operate processes containing significant quantities of substances regulated by the RMP rule - see Section 4 below.\n\n3. An emergency response program to help respond to accidental releases of regulated substances from processes covered by the RMP rule - see Section 6 below.\nInformation further describing these elements is provided in this executive summary.\nAlthough our Risk Management Program helps ensure that our facility is maintained and operated in a safe manner, it is only one component of the safety program.  In fact, we have a comprehensive safety program that establishes many levels of safeguards against accidental releases and against the injuries and damage that could occur from"

PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nWe strive to improve the safety of our processes using recommendations developed through the prevention program and a critical hazard program with focus on hierarchy of hazard controls of elimination (most effective), substitution, engineering controls, administrative controls, and personal protective equipment (least effective). We have eliminated sulfur dioxide from the pulp drying area by substituting weak sulfuric acid in its place and from other processes by substituting with sodium bisulfite. We have completed an exposure survey around the covered process areas and commissioned fixed chlorine dioxide monitors in the process areas."

However, any affected employees made a full recovery shortly after each incident, and neither the public, the community, nor the environment were affected in any way.\nFoley Cellulose LLC investigates all releases of hazardous chemicals that occur at the facility - regardless of whether they meet the threshold for inclusion in the RMP five-year accident history - to ensure that the site learns from each release and, where appropriate, puts in place additional safeguards to help reduce the likelihood of a catastrophic release.\n\n5.  EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAMS\nWe have established a written emergency response program to help ensure the safety of personnel who respond to accidental releases of hazardous substances.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for:\n* Informing Taylor County Emergency Management about accidental releases that could reasonably result in offsite consequences\n* Providing proper first aid and emergency medical treatment for accidental human exposure to hazardous substances\n* Obtaining outside assistance to control and contain accidental releases of hazardous substances, including the use of emergency response equipment\n* Inspecting and maintaining emergency response equipment\n* Reviewing and updating the emergency response plan\n\nEmployees are trained to recognize and report emergency situations.  Our personnel are trained in evacuation procedures.  Taylor County Emergency Management is responsible for notifying the public of the emergency situation, if necessary.\nThe written emergency response plan complies with other federal contingency plan regulations [e.g., OSHA regulation 29 CFR 1910.38(a)], and a copy of the plan has been provided to the fire department. Also, a Hazardous Material Storage and Location Plan has been provided to Taylor County Emergency Management, and Foley Cellulose LLC"

We have a program in place to help ensure that contractor activities at our facility are performed in a safe manner.  We explain to the contract supervisors (a) the hazards of the processes on which they and their employees will work, (b) our safe work practices, and (c) our emergency response procedures.  The contractor is required to ensure that training has been performed for each of their employees who will work at the facility before that worker begins work at our facility.\n \n3.2  Chemical-specific Prevention Steps\nIn addition to the required prevention program elements, we have implemented safety features specific to the regulated substances used at our facility.  The following paragraph describes some of these safety features.\n\nChlorine is supplied in 90-ton railcars that are approved by the Department of Transportation (DOT) and designed and maintained in accordance with good engineering practices established by the Chlorine Institute.  Chlorine is fed through braided metal flexible hoses into process piping.  We have installed video cameras near likely release points (e.g., at the chlorine unloading station) to alert operators of a release of hazardous material. Additional chlorine monitors and railcar movement devices have been installed that automatically isolate the rail and process in the event of a leak.  For the chlorine dioxide system, automatic and manual shutoffs, emergency air supply, and excess flow devices are used to help prevent or mitigate releases of this substance. \n\n4.

We audit our covered processes every three years to be certain our prevention program is effectively addressing the safety needs of our operations.  We assemble an audit team that includes personnel knowledgeable in the PSM and RMP regulations and in our process designs, and this team evaluates whether the prevention program satisfies the requirements of these two regulations and whether it is sufficient to help ensure safe operation of the process.  The results of the audit are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate enhancements to the prevention program are implemented.\n9) Incident investigation.  We investigate all incidents that could reasonably have resulted in serious injury to personnel, the public, or the environment so that similar accidents can be prevented in the future.  We train our employees to identify and report any incident requiring investigation.  An investigation team is assembled, and the investigation is initiated within 48 hours of the incident. The results of the investigation are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate process improvements are implemented.\n10) Employee participation.  We have a written employee participation program for covered processes to help ensure that the safety concerns of our workers are addressed.  We encourage active participation of personnel in the prevention program activities of all processes at the facility.  Employees are consulted on and informed about aspects of our accidental release prevention program.\n11) Hot work permits.

We maintain our process equipment to help prevent equipment failures that could endanger workers, the public, or the environment.  Our mechanical integrity (preventive maintenance) program includes (a) an inspection and testing program to help identify equipment deterioration and damage before the equipment fails and (b) a quality assurance function to help ensure that new and replacement equipment meet the strict design standards required for service in our processes.\n6) Management of change.  We evaluate and specifically approve all proposed changes to chemicals, equipment, technology, and procedures to help ensure that the change does not negatively affect safe operations. Changes other than replacement-in-kind (e.g., replacing a valve with an identical valve) must be approved through the full management of change program.  This helps ensure that inadvertent consequences of process changes are prevented, safety consequences of changes are addressed, affected process safety information and procedures are updated, and affected employees are notified of the changes.\n7) Pre-startup safety review.  We recognize that new or newly modified processes are historically more likely to be involved in accidental releases.  Therefore, we perform safety reviews of new or modified processes before placing them into service to help ensure their safe operation.

The following sections briefly describe the elements of our prevention program that address the RMP rule requirements.\n \n3.1  Prevention Program\nOur accident prevention program consists of the following 12 elements:\n1) Process safety information.  We maintain a variety of technical documents, including the Foley Cellulose LLC Contingency Plan and the Environmental Procedures Manual, to help ensure that our employees and local emergency responders know about the hazards associated with our facility.  These documents address (a) physical properties of the hazardous substances we handle, (b) operating parameters for our equipment, and (c) design basis and configuration for our equipment.  We ensure that this process safety information is available to employees and contractors.\n2) Process hazard analysis.  We perform and periodically update process hazard analyses of our cove"

When we must use a hazardous substance, we consider the potential for this substance to adversely affect our workers, the public, and the environment and take steps to prevent any such effects.\n\nPreventing releases of the hazardous substances used at the facility:  When a hazardous substance is used, the equipment used to contain it is carefully designed, built, and operated to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release.  Industry and government standards are closely adhered to in the design, construction, and operation of the equipment.\n\nLimiting damage from a release, if such a release occurs:  We work daily to prevent accidental releases from occurring.  However, we also train our workforce to recognize accidental releases, quickly assess the severity of a release, and respond to mitigate and stop the release, if one would occur. We work closely with Taylor County Emergency Management to ensure appropriate plans are in place to minimize the impact of the release on our workers and the community.\n\nOur safety program consists of a number of elements, only some of which are required by the RMP rule.
