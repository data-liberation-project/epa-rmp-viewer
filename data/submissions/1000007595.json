Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Ashby Equity Association in Ashby, Minnesota are strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is an inherent part of our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  We coordinate our response efforts with the Ashby Fire Department, which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n  2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities include support services for crop production.  We have anhydrous ammonia stored in one 26,000-gallon tank and nineteen 1,000-gallon nurse tanks at our facility in Ashby, Minnesota (Figure 1).  The maximum amount stored at  85% standard maximum storage capacity is 38,250 gallons (196,834.5 pounds) including the capacity of the on-site nurse tanks.   The largest single storage vessel at our facility contains 113,726.6 pounds at  85% standard maximum storage capacity.\n\n  3.
