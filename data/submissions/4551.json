The substances subject to the above regulation, which addresses the potential off-site hazards of accidental releases, are chlorine  (Cl2) and hydrochloric acid (HCl).\n\nThe EPA Risk Management Regulation identifies three levels of requirements for industrial processes.  Program 1 can be applied to any process which has not had a \"significant\" release of a regulated substance over the five year period prior to the June 1999 compliance date and for which the worst-case release does not affect \"public receptors\" (e.g., residences, parks and recreation areas, commercial/industrial facility, hospitals).  Program 2 applies to any process that is ineligible for Program 1 and is not subject to Program 3.  Program 3 applies to all processes, such as those present at the HoltraChem facility, that are subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management Standard (PSM).

For toxic gases such as Cl2 stored at ambient temperatures it is assumed that the release occurs over a 10-minute period. Toxic liquids, like HCl, are assumed to spill instantaneously and spread to a depth of 1 cm in an undiked area or to cover a diked area.  The duration of the release is based on the evaporation rate of the toxic liquid and the amount spilled. The regulated substance with the most extensive zone of influence, defined as the distance to specified toxic \"endpoints\", is considered the worst-case release for each facility.  Only passive mitigation (e.g., dikes, enclosures) and administrative controls may be accounted for in the evaluation.\n\nEPA has established \"toxic endpoints\" for various chemicals based on the American Industrial Hygiene Association (ACGIH) Emergency Response Planning Guideline, Level 2 (ERPG-2), which protects individuals from health-threatening or escape-impairing injury.  The ERPG-2 is defined as:\n\n\"the maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to 1 hr without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms which could impair an individual's ability to take protective action.\"\n\nGiven that the worst-case is a 10-minute release duration with a 10-minute concentration averaging time, the actual hazard zone is typically overestimated by the ERPG-2.

The surface roughness affects the amount of dispersion that occurs within a released plume and influences the distance to toxic endpoint. The surface roughness used in determining the distance to toxic endpoint should be characteristic of the transport path of the plume from the release point to the endpoint distance.  'Urban' surface roughness indicates areas where there are many obstacles, such as industrial buildings or trees.  'Rural' indicates that there are no buildings in the immediate vicinity of a facility and that the terrain is generally flat and unobstructed. \n\nIn the immediate vicinity of the HoltraChem Orrington facility, the aerodynamic surface roughness is 'urban' in nature, due to the buildings, tanks and structures at the site.  At greater distances, although the area is heavily vegetated, the surface roughness becomes more 'rural', especially along the river valley.  In order to report the most conservative 'distance to toxic endpoint' estimates in the Risk Management Plan, HoltraChem has elected to model the worst-case release scenario assuming 'rural' surface conditions. However, it should be noted that under actual conditions, plume dispersion would be enhanced by the 'urban' type surfaces located near the facility, and result in shorter distances to toxic endpoint.\n\nThe EPA's RMP Off-site Consequence Analysis Guidance (1999 Revised OCAG) was utilized to determine distance to toxic endpoint values for the worst-case release scenarios. The OCAG guidance lists a number of refined dispersion models that are also available for off-site hazard assessment applications for risk management programs.

One of the models listed in the OCAG  commonly used for heavy-gas releases is SLAB.  SLAB, developed by Lawrence Livermore Laboratory, can be utilized to model scenarios that are not directly addressed in the 1999 Revised OCAG.   For these reasons, the OCAG was used to determine the endpoint distances for the worst case releases, while SLAB was used to determine the endpoint distances for the more complex alternative release scenarios.\n\nIn accordance with 40 CFR Part 68, the worst-case modeling is conducted assuming a very stable atmosphere with limited dispersion (F stability and 1.5 m/sec wind speed).  Analysis of four years of meteorological data from the National Weather Service at the Bangor International Airport, ME, indicates that these dispersion conditions occasionally occur in the area.  The most predominant directions of transport are to the north and southeast. \n\nWorst-case dispersion modeling conducted with EPA's RMP 1999 Revised OCAG indicates that, among the two regulated substances, chlorine would result in the greatest distance to toxic endpoint. The toxic endpoint for Cl2 is 0.0087 mg/L.  Since the resulting planning zone predicted for the \"worst-case\" Cl2 toxic release potentially affects public receptors, regulated processes at the HoltraChem Orrington facility are subject to Program 3 requirements.  40 CFR Part 68 requires that the substance with the largest distance to toxic endpoint be reported in the Worst-Case Release section of the Risk Management Plan.   Therefore, only the Cl2 release results are included in the Data Elements section.\n\n3.1.1\tWorst-Case Release: Chlorine\n\nThe worst-case scenario for the Orrington facility consists of a 10-minute gaseous ground-level release of 300,000 lbs of stored Cl2, dispersed under atmospheric conditions of F stability and 1.5 m/sec wind speed.

Even if the storage tank were to breach, liquid Cl2 would spill to the ground in a boiling pool.  If a hole were to form in the vapor space of the storage tank, the flashing vapor in the tank would cause the tank to auto-refrigerate, thereby gradually reducing the release rate with time.  The selection of the worst-case release for Cl2 should, therefore, be viewed as a regulatory required program element, rather than a realistic representation of a worst-case release event.\n\nThe modeling results indicated that under 'rural' surface conditions the worst-case Cl2 release would result in a distance to toxic endpoint of greater than 25 miles.  The worst-case impact zone encompasses a resident population of approximately 130,000, based on the 1990 Federal Census, and estimated by applying EPA's Landview III program.  Public receptors were identified using 1:24,000 scale U.S.G.S maps, supplemented with comprehensive maps of the local area (DeLorme Street Atlas USA, Version 5).   The potential worst-case hazard zone includes schools, hospitals, prisons, public recreation areas, and industrial/commercial areas.

Each scenario was evaluated and the scenarios most likely to occur and to result in off-site impacts were selected for modeling. In order to determine the most conservative off-site consequence estimates, HoltraChem has chosen to include in the Risk Management Plan the alternative release scenarios that resulted in the greatest toxic endpoint distance for each regulated substance.\n\nIn accordance with the RMP rule, alternative releases are modeled under typical (rather than worst-case) dispersion conditions.  The EPA OCAG default dispersion conditions are neutral atmosphere, with dispersion neither enhanced nor limited (D stability and 3 m/sec wind speed). A review of climatological data for Bangor, ME, confirmed that these conditions are typical of the area and therefore are suitable for the evaluation of alternative releases. Unlike the worst-case release (for which an instantaneous spill or 10-minute ground-level gas release is assumed), alternative scenarios can account for the actual release configuration, and account for both active and passive mitigation.\n\nAlternative dispersion modeling was conducted using the SLAB dense gas dispersion model.

If so, the appropriate authorities are promptly notified.\n\nDuring the past 5 years (June 1994 to June 1999), there has been one accident involving an ARP regulated substance that qualifies for reporting under 40 CFR Part 68. The accident which occurred on an evening in November 1997,  did not result in any injuries, deaths or property damage, but involved off-site site emergency response, provided by the Orrington Fire Department.  This accident involved collision of a railcar with a chlorine railcar that was in the process of being loaded.  An estimated 1600 lbs of chlorine was released. The release, which was effectively stopped after about ten minutes, was also reported by HoltraChem via telephone to the Maine State Police, Penobscot County Sheriff and the National Response Center.  The subsequent accident investigation determined that operator error was the key factor in the accident.  Steps were immediately taken to review loading and switching procedures and reinforce training of personnel on safety and environmental procedures to preve"

In addition, a remotely actuated valving system was installed to close the chlorine loading line valves in the event of an emergency.\n\n\n6.0  EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\nHoltraChem's Orrington plant has established an Emergency Action Plan that is designed to address foreseeable emergency situations at the facility and provide appropriate hazard and emergency preparedness information to employees, contractors, emergency response personnel, and the community.  In regards to chemical releases, HoltraChem has developed a dedicated command structure and specific procedures that must be adhered to in the event of a chemical emergency.  These procedures define the criteria for identifying, classifying, and notifying the appropriate emergency response staff of potential emergency events. \n\nPlant operations at the Orrington facility can present various types of potential hazards and HoltraChem recognizes the need to have a well trained and prepared work force to safely and effectively deal with any emergency situation.  The HoltraChem Orrington facility insists on continuous training of responsible staff and the exercise of important communication links with the community, in order to maintain an appropriate state of readiness for emergency situations.  HoltraChem Orrington plant staff attend  periodic meetings with local industry and emergency response planning officials and have participated in emergency response training exercises.  HoltraChem staff have a \"First Response\" capability and are able to administer basic first aid and CPR.  HoltraChem and local emergency response planning officials also rely on the Orrington Fire Department  to offer paramedical assistance and transportation to the health center.\n\n\n\n7.0  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nHoltraChem's Orrington plant, under the recent RMP program, as well as its existing PSM and earlier SARA Title III Community Right-to-Know Act compliance programs has orga"

Both the advanced planning aspects of process design, operating procedures, and emergency preparedness, and the operational elements of system maintenance, safe operating practices and ongoing personnel training are necessary to support a continual improvement in facility safety.  These programs are thoroughly documented so that information about the safe handling of chemicals present at the facility is available to all employees, and can be readily interpreted by emergency response team staff and the Incident Commander. This is especially important when questions arise from public safety officials regarding potential risks to the community.  All of these features of the RMP and the integrated risk management program at the Orrington plant lead to operations that are safe today, but will be even safer tomorrow.\n\nHoltraChem Orrington's safety program incorporates continuous improvement through use of audits, inspections, and on-going evaluations of in-plant safety and program effectiveness.  The information gathered is evaluated and improvements that are identified are incorporated into the program.  \n\n\n\nHoltraChem Manufacturing Co.
