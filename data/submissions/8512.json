When a hazardous substance is used at the mill, the equipment is carefully designed, built, and operated to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release.  Industry and government standards are closely adhered to in the design, construction, and operation of the equipment.\n\nThe Cypress Bend Mill limits damage from a release, if such a release occurs.  Potlatch Corporation trains workers to respond to an accidental release, reducing the consequences of a release if it occurs.  \n\nThe safety program at the Cypress Bend Mill consists of a number of elements, only some of which are required by the RMP rule.  This RMPlan is primarily intended to describe those parts of the safety program at Potlatch Corporation that are required by the RMP rule.\n\n1.1  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nPotlatch Corporation is committed to the safety of employees and the public, and the preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  The Cypress Bend Mill implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances.  These controls include training programs for personnel; programs to help ensure safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of processes in the mill; and programs to evaluate the hazards at the Cypress Bend Mill.\n\nIn the event of an accidental release, the Cypress Bend Mill controls and contains the release in a manner that will be safe for employees and will help prevent injury to the public or the environment.  The mill provides response training to its employees and designates an emergency response coordinator to oversee response activities.  The Cypress Bend Fire"

The mill produces approximately 750 tons per day of bleached kraft pulp and operates a coated paperboard machine. Potlatch Corporation handles three regulated substances in sufficient quantities to be covered by the RMP rule, as shown in the following list of RMP-covered processes at the Cypress Bend Mill.\n\n\n\nProcess\tProgram Level\tRegulated Substance\tProcess Quantity\nChlorine Dioxide Generation, Storage, and Transfer\t3\tChlorine Dioxide\t11,100 lbs\nChlorine Pulp Bleaching Unloading and Transfer\t3\tChlorine\t360,000 lbs\nChlorine Water Treatment\t3\tChlorine\t56,000 lbs\nAnhydrous Ammonia \nStorage and Transfer\t3\tAnhydrous Ammonia\t70,000 lbs\n\n1.3  Offsite Consequence Analysis\n\nThe Cypress Bend Mill performed an offsite consequence analysis to estimate the potential for an accidental release of a regulated substance to affect the public or the environment.  The offsite consequence analysis consists of evaluating both worst-case release scenarios and alternative release scenarios.  The Cypress Bend Mill does not expect a worst-case release scenario to ever occur.  An alternative release scenario represents a release that (1) might occur at a facility similar to the Cypress Bend Mill and (2) would result in the greatest potential offsite consequences if the release occurred.\n\nThe RMP rule includes specific requirements for the worst-case and alternative release scenarios that must be reported by the Cypress Bend Mill.  These requirements are:\n\n7 one worst-case and one alternative release scenario for chlorine bleaching, \n7 one alternative release scenario for chlorine water treatment,\n7 one alternative release scenario for chlorine dioxide, and\n7 one alternative release scenario for anhydrous ammonia.\n \n The following information"

The maximum distance to the toxic endpoint concentration is 9.3 miles.  The U. S. Census indicates that 1,000 people live within this distance from the mill.  Several public receptors are located within this distance (e.g. Bunge Corporation Grain Terminal, Arkansas City Schools, Delta Schools, the Desha County Courthouse, the Mississippi River, and McCallie Public Access on the Mississippi).  One environmental receptor, the Rohwer Relocation Camp Memorial, is also located within this distance.\n \n The alternative release scenario for chlorine is the rupture of a 2 chlorine transfer line from the chlorine vaporizers to the bleach plant mixers.  This scenario assumes that the release occurs outside a building and that workers require 20 minutes to detect and stop the leak.  The maximum distance to the toxic endpoint is 3.2 miles.  The U. S. Census indicates that 70 people live within this distance from the mill.  Public receptors within this distance include Bunge Corporation Grain Terminal, the Mississippi River and McCallie Public Access on the Mississippi River.\n \n1.3.2  Water Treatment Chlorine Storage and Transfer (1 ton cylinders)\n\nNo worst-case scenario is reported for one (1) ton chlorine cylinders because the effects of the chlorine located in the pulp mill for bleaching operations exceeds those of the worst-case scenario for an accidental release from a one (1) ton cylinder.  The alternative release scenario for chlorine one ton cylinder is the rupture of 1 inch supply tubing on a one ton cylinder located at the river influent treatment station.  This scenario assumes the cylinder is full (2000 pounds) and operators require 90 minutes to detect and stop the leak.  The maximum distance to toxic endpoint is 0.5 miles.  The U. S."

Beginning in 1992, the mill formalized this prevention program for the Chlorine Unloading and Transfer, the Chlorine Dioxide Generation, Storage, and Transfer, and the Anhydrous Ammonia Storage and Transfer processes to comply with the 14 elements of the OSHA process safety management (PSM) prevention program.  In 1996, the EPA RMP rule established similar requirements for Program 3 processes.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the Cypress Bend Mill's Program 3 prevention program that address the EPA RMP rule prevention program requirements.\n \n 1.\tProcess Safety Information.  Potlatch Corporation maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to help ensure safe operation of the mill processes.  These documents address (1) physical properties of hazardous substances handled at the Cypress Bend Mill, (2) operating parameters of the equipment, and (3) design basis and configuration of the equipment in the mill.  The Cypress Bend Mill ensures that this process safety information is available to all Potlatch employees and local fire and emergency response personnel.\n \n Material safety data sheets (MSDSs) document the physical properties of hazardous substances handled at the Cypress Bend Mill, including regulated substances in RMP-covered processes.  MSDSs for hazardous substances handled in each process are available to mill operators for ready reference. \n \n The engineering design documents include the operating parameters and the design basis and configuration of the equipment in each covered process.  The available information includes:\n \n7 operating parameters\n7 block flow or simplified process flow diagrams\n7 process chemistry\n7 maximum intended inventories\n7 saf"

Many of the operating parameters are included in the operating procedures to help with the safe operation of the process.  These documents are used (1) to train employees, (2) to perform process hazards analyses, and (3) to help maintain the equipment.\n\n2. Process Hazard Analysis.  The Cypress Bend Mill performs and periodically updates process hazard analyses (PHAs) of the covered processes to help identify process hazards and generate recommendations that might improve the safe operation of the process.  A team composed of personnel with engineering and process operating experience and a leader with process hazard analyses experience is assembled to analyze the hazards of the process.  The Cypress Bend Mill primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) technique to perform this analysis.  The PHA team prepares a written report describing the results of the analysis, including a list of recommendations.  Responsibility to resolve the recommendations is assigned to mill personnel and, when appropriate, changes to enhance the safety of the process are implemented.  \n3. Operating Procedures.  Potlatch Corporation engineers, operators, and supervisors work together to develop and maintain operating procedures to define how tasks related to process operations should be safely performed.  The operating procedures (1) are used to train employees, and (2) serve as reference guides for appropriate actions to take during both normal operations and process upsets.  Cypress"

The mill requires that the contractor supervisors train each of their employees who will work at the mill before that worker begins work at the site.   The Cypress Bend Mill periodically reviews contractors' training documents and work performance to help ensure that safe work practices are followed. \n\n1.5\tChemical-specific Prevention Steps\n\nIn addition to the required prevention program elements, the Potlatch Corporation has implemented safety features specific to the hazardous substances used at the Cypress Bend Mill.  \n\nChlorine.  Chlorine is supplied in Department of Transportation (DOT) approved 90-ton rail cars.  Chlorine detectors and alarms are provided in areas containing chlorine.\n\nChlorine is also supplied in one ton cylinders for use in water treatment in various areas of the mill.  \n\nChlorine Dioxide.  Chlorine dioxide is produced at the Cypress Bend Mill and stored as a dilute aqueous solution to avoid the necessity of transporting large quantities of the solution.  Chlorine dioxide is produced in the chlorine dioxide generator and piped to an absorber column, where a 1 weight percent chlorine dioxide solution is generated.  Storing this substance as a solution helps to reduce the consequences of a release.  A curbed area around the storage tanks further reduces the consequences of a release.\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia.  Anhydrous ammonia is purchased and stored on site in the wastewater treatment area of the mill.  Utilities department operators make routine visual inspections of the wastewater treatment area, noting anhydrous ammonia tank levels and transfer equipment conditions.  \n\n1.6\tFive-Year Accident History\n\nThe Cypress Bend Mill has had no releases during the last five years while handling either chlorine, chlorine dioxide, or anhydrous ammonia that have resulted in any offsite public or environmental effects.
