Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and insure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nTEPPCO primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) and What-if/Checklist method analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  The analyses are conducted using a team of TEPPCO staff which has operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps insure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help insure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the terminal periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, t"

These procedures provide guidance for experienced operators and also provide the basis for training new operators.  Operating procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The review and certification process involves both operators and technical staff.\n\nThe intent of the operating procedures is to provide workable, useful and clearly written instructions for conducting operating activities.  To have effective operating procedures, the task and procedures directly and indirectly related to the covered process must be appropriate, clear, consistent and most importantly communicated to employees.  Operating procedures are specific instructions or details on what steps are taken or followed in carrying out the stated procedures.  The specific instructions include the applicable safety precautions and appropriate information on safety implications.\n\nTraining\n\nIn addition to training on operating procedures, the Greensburg Terminal has a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating the terminal.  New employees receive basic training in pipeline, storage and terminal operations.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to insure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.

This is accomplished by providing contractors with an orientation session that covers (1) a process overview, (2) information about the safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements and (4) safe work practices prior to beginning their work.  In addition, the Greensburg Terminal evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the contractor selection process.  TEPPCO personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to insure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\nPre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR)\n\nThe Greensburg Terminal conducts a PSSR on any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to insure that safety features, procedures, personnel and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe Greensburg Terminal has well established practices and procedures for maintaining process equipment.

This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.  In addition to periodic meetings with members of the LEPC, the Greensburg Terminal conducts periodic site orientations and emergency response briefings for emergency response organizations.  The Greensburg Terminal also provides periodic refresher training to local emergency responders regarding the hazards of regulated substances in the terminal.\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe Greensburg Terminal resolves all findings from PHA\u00bfs, some of which result in modifications to the storage and loading operations.  Additionally, employee recommendations to improve the safety of the storage and loading operations are reviewed and implemented if they are judged to be effective in improving terminal safety or reducing accident risk.  At the present time,  a project is being planned to relocate the truck loading rack, and possibly the three above ground propane storage tanks, to a location farther away from the adjacent county road and the closest nearby residences."

This helps insure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\nSafe Work Practices\n\nThe Greensburg Terminal has long standing safe work practices in place to help insure worker and process safety.  Examples of these include: (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to insure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous substances before process piping and equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work) and (5) a permit and procedure to insure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.  These procedures, along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help insure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely\n\nManagement of Change\n\nThe Greensburg Terminal has a comprehensive system to manage change to all covered processes.  This system requires that changes to items such as terminal equipment, technology (including terminal operating conditions), procedures and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to insure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and to verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the changes.\n\nIn"

      "SummaryText": "cident Investigation\n\nThe Greensburg Terminal promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to gather the facts, determine the root cause, and develop corrective action to prevent the reoccurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendation(s) to prevent a reoccurrence and forwards these results to the business management team for resolution.\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nTo help insure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, TEPPCO periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.  Compliance audits are conducted at least every three years.  Both hourly and staff personnel participate as audit team members.  The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to terminal management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team\u00bfs findings are tracked until they are resolved and completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.\n\n\nChemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe processes at the Greensburg Terminal have hazards that must be managed to insure continued safe operation.  The following is a description of existing safety features applicable to prevention of accidental releases of regulated substances in the facility.\n\nUniversal Prevention Activities\n\nThe accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all RMP covered operations at the Greensburg Terminal.  Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\n\nSpecialized Safety Features\n\nThe Greensburg Terminal has safety features to help contain/control a release, to quickly de"

Over the past five years there have been no large or small releases, with no injuries or offsite consequences.  \n\n\nEmergency Procedures Information\n\nThe Greensburg Terminal maintains a written emergency procedure, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The procedures are for the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address notification of local emergency response agencies if a release occurs.  Employees receive training in emergency procedures.  The emergency procedure is updated when necessary based on modifications made to the terminal facilities.  The emergency procedure changes are administered through the Management of Chan"
