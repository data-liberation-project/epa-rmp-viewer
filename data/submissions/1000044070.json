Executive Summary\n\n\n\nThis program is intended to meet the spirit and intent of the following regulations:\n\n\n\n*California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program - Title 19 CCR, Chapter 4.5\n\n*Federal EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) - Title 40 CFR ?68\n\n*California Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 8 CCR ?5189\n\n*Federal Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 29 CFR ?1910.119\n\n\n\nHereafter this program will be referred to as the RMP-PSM program.\n\n\n\nThis program is intended to be a \"living document\". As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible and updated as necessary. To accomplish this, BWC Time Room has elected to use PSMWriter, software developed and distributed by Resource Compliance, Inc. This software will assist us with updating, maintaining, scheduling, and tracking RMP-PSM related activities. \n\n\n\n1.1 BWC Time Room, Risk and Process Safety Management Program\n\n\n\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that BWC Time Room has updated their unified RMP-PSM Program. This program has been prepared to address the risks involved in operating and maintaining the following process which have the presence of hazardous chemicals above threshold quantities: \n\n\n\nProcess Name     Process Chemical     Process Quantity(lbs.)\n\nAmmonia Storage  Anhydrous Ammonia    82,000\n\n\n\nOur RMP-PSM program promotes overall plant, worker, and public safety. The program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of hazardous chemicals. Overall, the program is designed to prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, illnesses and physical property damage.\n\n\n\nOur company has many policies and procedures in place to promote overall plant, worker and public safety. We have: \n\n\n\n1. Prepared a unified program based on the PSM plan to meet CalARP and RMP obligations as well\n\n2. Organized the program so that it mesh"

Utilized PSMWriter software to ensure that all necessary employees have access to relevant information (SOPs, PHAs, audits, etc.)\n\n\n\nThe RMP-PSM program sets forth rules, procedures and practices that will help our employees and neighbors protect themselves.\n\n\n\n1.2 Process Description\n\n\n\nButtonwillow Warehouse Company - Time Room is a fertilizer storage and resale facility. The ammonia process operates as follows. Ammonia is supplied by a vendor into the ammonia storage tank. From there it is stored until a sale is made, at which time a Buttonwillow Warehouse Company - Time Room employee transfers ammonia from the storage tank into a smaller trailer-mounted nurse tank. The nurse tanks are towed by trucks off site for the fertilizer application.\n\n\n\nThe ammonia process at Buttonwillow Warehouse Company - Time Room consists of vessels which are co-located such that a release of ammonia could impact the ability to operate vessels that are not directly connected.  Therefore, the ammonia storage and nurse tanks are treated as a single process.\n\n\n\n1.3 General Accident Release & Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\n1.3.1 General \n\n\n\nWe inform our employees engaged in process operations of the dangers of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia in annual safety meetings. During these meeting we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\n\n\n\nBWC Time Room has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the ammonia storage process. These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release. The results of the analyses are reported in PSMWriter and hard copy binders. \n\n\n\n1.3.2 Anhydrous Ammonia\n\n\n\nThe ammonia storage process at the BWC Time Room facility is an integral part of the overall business and operates most of the year. The ammonia process contains a total charge of approximately 82,000"

Management is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.\n\n\n\nOur storage personnel monitor the ammonia storage process and keep an active log book of all procedures and transactions that pertain to ammonia. \n\n\n\n1.4 Five Year Accident History\n\n\n\nBWC Time Room has had one accidental release in the last five (5) years. A summary of the accident is included in the table below:\n\nRelease Date: November 16, 2013\n\nFacility: Time Room\n\nDescription: Transfer operation release and injury\n\nContributing Cause(s): Human error\n\nCorrective Action(s) Taken: Additional signage, Additional training\n\n\n\n1.5 Emergency Action and Response Plan\n\n\n\nBWC Time Room's emergency action and response program has been developed to satisfy the following requirements:\n\n\n\n*California \"Emergency Action Plan\" - Title 8 CCR ?3220\n\n*Federal \"Emergency Action Plan\" - Title 29 CFR ?1910.38 \n\n\n\nStrategically, we will respond \"minimally\" to a release. Under this plan we will call emergency personnel and evacuate the facility. All response activities would be done in coordination with the Local Fire Department and their Hazardous Materials Response Team. \n\n\n\nEvery year we review with our employees our evacuation procedures in the event of an emergency, including a hazardous chemical release.\n\n\n\n1.6 Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nBWC Time Room has implemented many policies and procedures to promote overall plant, worker and public safety. Nevertheless, BWC Time Room continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.\n\n\n\nBy utilizing PSMWriter software, all necessary employees have access to every aspect of the RMP-PSM program. This has improved BWC Time Room's ability to communicate hazardous situations to employees and contractors. In addition, PSMWriter tracks all RMP-PSM related events so that BWC Time Room's management team can e"

When a RMP-PSM program requirement is completed (i.e. mechanical integrity inspection, process hazard analysis, compliance audit, etc.) any specific action items related to that event are entered into PSMWriter, assigned a responsible person, and given a due date. Once the action item has been completed, the resolution can be documented using PSMWriter as well. A list of current or past due action items can be accessed at any time by those with access to PSMWriter.\n\n\n\nIn addition to utilizing PSMWriter to create, schedule, track, and document events, BWC Time Room has also entered into a contract with Resource Compliance to obtain help with RMP-PSM program implementation.\n\n\n\nFor the future, BWC Time Room now thinks of the RMP-PSM program as a \"living document\". It is an interactive framework that guides safe action for BWC Time Room employees, but allows for feedback and continual improvement. Through the RMP-PSM program BWC Time Room will continue to maintain overall plant worker and public safety."
