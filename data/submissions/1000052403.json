Like our local community and industrial neighbors, the people who work at the Bucks plant want a clean, safe environment, with no illnesses or injuries at work, home, or play.  That is why US Amines has a zero incidents goal.  We are committed to reducing emissions and continuously improving our performance toward zero injuries and zero environmental incidents.\r\n\r\nThe US Amines Bucks Plant participates in a local community advisory panel and works with other area industrial facilities to promote safety in our operations.  The Lemoyne Community Advisory Panel was one of the first community advisory panels established in the United States.  The Lemoyne Industrial Park companies have been recognized by local, state, and national organizations for outstanding cooperation.  This continued partnership ensures that the community where we all live and work will be a safe place now and in the future.\r\n\r\nOur Facility and Substances Handled:\r\n\r\nWe manufacture several different chemicals called alkyl amines.  Our products are used to produce agricultural chemicals, water treatment chemicals, and drugs.  Our Isopropylamine is a chemical combination of isopropyl alcohol (the same chemical as in rubbing alcohol) and ammonia (the same chemical as in home floor cleaning products).  This is sold to other chemical manufacturers who make herbicides and agriculture products like the popular home and farm products.  The chemicals that we handle and report on include the following RMP listed chemicals: ammonia, isopropylamine, cyclohexylamine, and propionitrile.  We have about 50 site employees (about 35 company employees and 15 resident contractors).\r\n\r\nPlant Safety Activities and Release Prevention Program:\r\n\r\nThe plant has a plant manager who oversees all plant activities.

The BEST team members are trained in the specifics of incident command, emergency response, rope rescue, and medical response.  The plant conducts weekly tests of the plant alarm system and conducts emergency response drills with local industrial facilities, local fire departments, and the county emergency response team, Mobile County EMA.\r\n\r\nThe US Amines Bucks plant complies with RMP and OSHA 1910.119, (the OSHA Process Safety Regulation) through our consolidated Process Safety Management Program.
