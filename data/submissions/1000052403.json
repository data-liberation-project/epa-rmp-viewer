              "Description": "Amines Plant No. 1 - U.S. Amines:\n\n\n\nThe plant is subject to and operated in accordance with OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations and the EPA-RMP program.  The site maintains one PSM plan which includes application of the OSHA PSM rule and the EPA-RMP rule.  Amines Plant No. 1 includes the following RMP listed chemicals above the RMP threshold:\n\n\n\n1.  Ammonia\n\n2.  Isopropylamine\n\n\n\nAmmonia\n\n\n\nOperations of the storage locations for ammonia and the operations using ammonia fall under the site PSM program.  Ammonia is stored as a liquefied gas.  There are three storage tanks for pure ammonia which do not have storage containment dikes because dikes would not contain the ammonia from evaporation.  Storage for ammonia within the process unit does include dikes as the ammonia stored in the process is not pure and dikes would contain some of the material that would not immediately evaporate. The storage areas are serviced by fire water spray nozzles that would be used in the event of a large spill.  Ammonia is readily soluble in water and water would be effective in mitigating a large spill.\n\n\n\nIsopropylamine\n\n\n\nOperations of the storage locations and production of isopropylamine fall under the site PSM program.  The storage locations are covered by automatic and/or manual fire suppression systems.  The storage areas are curbed or diked with hold-up volume adequate to contain all of the tank contents.  The storage areas are serviced by fire water spray nozzles that would be used in the event of a large spill.  Isopropylamine is readily soluble in water and water would be effective in mitigating a large spill.\n\n\n\nThe site PSM program has policies that go beyond the OSHA PSM and EPA-RMP rules.  Some of those policies are listed below:\n\n\n\n1.  Sight glass use: Sight glass use is discouraged in hazardous chemical service.  In cases where sight level indicators are needed, magnetically coupled, metal gauges are used or other provisions are made to protect against releases from breakage.\n\n2.  Quarter-turn valves (1\" size or less) are fitted with oval handles to reduce the risk of releases from bumping a straight handle valve open.\n\n3.  Qualitative risk assessment is incorporated into our PHA and MOC process in order to provide more consistent evaluation of risk.  This provides better guidance in reducing risk, over the HAZOP only type of analysis.\n\n4.  The plant belongs to and participates in the Mobile County EMA, the local county emergency planning committee.  The plant also participates in the local Lemoyne Community Advisory Panel (LCAP), a group of local chemical and industrial facilities that meet with the community several times per year to discuss safety and risk management issues within the local industrial park.\n\n5.  All operators are trained and certified in the jobs they perform. All employees have the authority to shut down any process or stop any job, in order to maintain safe operation.\n\n6.  The plant has numerous recorded video surveillance cameras for added security.\n\n7.  Employee training programs covers job specific tasks, principles of chemical engineering, safety, and regulatory issues.  This includes: monthly safety meetings, monthly computer based training classes, annual and tri-annual training and recertification programs.\n\n8.  All plant operators are trained in emergency response.\n\n9.  The plant has an extensive fire fighting system with monitor nozzles, hoses, foam generating capability and water reservoir.\n\n10.  The plant has a portable emergency command vehicle complete with air monitoring equipment, radio and cellular phone systems, emergency response and decontamination materials.\n\n11.  The plant alarm system and fire water systems are tested weekly.\n\n12.  Emergency response personnel are trained in first aid and CPR.\n\n",

              "Description": "Amines Plant No. 2 - U.S. Amines:\n\n\n\nThe plant is subject to and operated in accordance with OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations and the EPA-RMP program.  The site maintains one PSM plan which includes application of the OSHA PSM rule and the EPA-RMP rule.  Amines Plant No. 2 includes the following RMP listed chemicals above the RMP threshold:\n\n\n\n1.  Cyclohexylamine\n\n2.  Propionitrile\n\n\n\nCyclohexylamine\n\n\n\nOperations of these storage locations and production of cyclohexylamine fall under the site PSM program.  Manufacture of cyclohexylamine has been discontinued temporarily, but we still have a small inventory of the substance.  The storage locations are covered by automatic and/or manual fire suppression systems.  The storage areas are curbed or diked with hold-up volume adequate to contain all of the tank contents.\n\n\n\nPropionitrile\n\n\n\nOperations of the storage locations and production operations using propionitrile fall under the site PSM program.  The storage locations are covered by automatic and/or manual fire suppression systems.  The storage areas are curbed or diked with hold-up volume adequate to contain all of the tank contents.  Special personal protective equipment is used with propionitrile to prevent absorption of liquid or vapors into the skin.  The vapor space of the storage tank is purged with nitrogen to prevent the formation of an explosive atmosphere condition.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe site PSM program also has policies that go beyond the OSHA PSM and EPA-RMP rules.  Some of those policies are listed below: \n\n\n\n1.  Sight glass use: Sight glass use is discouraged in hazardous chemical service.  In cases where sight level indicators are needed, magnetically coupled, metal gauges are used or other provisions are made to protect against releases from breakage.\n\n2.  Quarter-turn valves (1\" size or less) are fitted with oval handles to reduce the risk of releases from bumping a straight handle valve open.\n\n3.  Qualitative risk assessment is incorporated into our PHA and MOC process in order to provide more consistent evaluation of risk.  This provides better guidance in reducing risk, over the HAZOP only type of analysis.\n\n4.  The plant belongs to and participates in the Mobile County EMA, the local county emergency planning committee.  The plant also participates in the local Lemoyne Community Advisory Panel (LCAP), a group of local chemical and industrial facilities that meet with the community several times per year to discuss safety and risk management issues within the local industrial park.\n\n5.  All operators are trained and certified in the jobs they perform. All employees have the authority to shut down any process or stop any job, in order to maintain safe operation.\n\n6.  The plant has numerous recorded video surveillance cameras for added security.\n\n7.  Employee training programs covers job specific tasks, principles of chemical engineering, safety, and regulatory issues.  This includes: monthly safety meetings, monthly computer based training classes, annual and tri-annual training and recertification programs.\n\n8.  All plant operators are trained in emergency response.\n\n9.  The plant has an extensive fire fighting system with monitor nozzles, hoses, foam generating capability and water reservoir.\n\n10.  The plant has a portable emergency command vehicle complete with air monitoring equipment, radio and cellular phone systems, emergency response and decontamination materials.\n\n11.  The plant alarm system and fire water systems are tested weekly.\n\n12.  Emergency response personnel are trained in first aid and CPR.\n\n",
