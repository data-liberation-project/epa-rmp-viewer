      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nNewfield Production Company produces oil and gas from the Greater Monument Butte Field located in the Uinta Basin in Uintah and Duchesne Counties in north eastern Utah.  Approximately 11 million standard cubic feet/day (MMSCF/D) of natural gas produced by Newfields 1100 existing oil wells is rich in hydrocarbon liquids to the extent that it exceeds specifications for gas pipeline transportation and sales.  The Monument Butte Liquids Conditioning Gas Plant was constructed to remove sufficient hydrocarbon liquids to reduce the heat content of the gas to within pipeline specifications.  The gas plant is designed to remove approximately 16,000 gallons per day from a 13 MMSCFD gas stream.   Liquid hydrocarbons are removed from the gas and are stored in two 30,000 gallon NGL storage tanks.  The liquid hydrocarbons are then transported via high pressure tanker truck to a fractionation facility for further processing.\n\nThe Monument Butte Liquids Conditioning Gas Plant is located over six miles south of the city of Myton, Utah.  The gas plant is located NW1/4, SW 1/4, Section 25 T8S, R16E in Duchesne County Utah in a remote area surrounded by oil field wells sites.  There are no public receptors in the area.  The Newfield field office is located approximately three and a half miles northwest of the gas plant in Section 10 T4S, R1W.  The gas plant is normally unmanned, however the facility is inspected daily by Newfield personnel and tanker truck personnel.  The emergency shut off for the gas plant is located at the Monument Butte Compressor Station located approximately half a mile south.\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at your facility.   \nThis facility complies with NFPA-58 requirements for LP-Gas storage, and it is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to isolate, shutdown gas plant operations from the emergency shutoff, and stay away unt"
