Fifty-five (55) gallon drums, totes and partial tank trucks are filled by ChemQuest Chemicals according to customer requests.  Any vapors generated during filling or unloading activities are vented back to a scrub tank.  It is the policy of ChemQuest Chemicals to operate the 29% aqua ammonia unit in a safe and environmentally sound manner reducing to the greatest extent possible any hazards associated with processes and reducing any subsequent risk to the surrounding community, employees and the environment.  It is also ChemQuest Chemicals policy to work with the surrounding community and local emergency response agencies to promote a spirit of cooperation and teamwork, to orchestrate an effective contingency plan in the unlikely event that a process incident at the facility was to occur.\n\n\n\nChemQuest Chemicals plans to increase the volume of 29% aqua ammonia stored to reach full capacity of 20,000 gallons (or approximately 149,000 lbs).  This volume of the 29% aqua ammonia stored requires a Risk Management Plan (RMP) under Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, codified under 40 CFR Part 68, hereafter referenced to as \"the Rule\".  In response to the Rule, an accidental release Prevention Program has been put into place.  This Program consist of chemical and process safety information, a process hazard review and written operating procedures and preventive maintenance procedures.  \n\n\n\nProcess equipment is operated and maintained in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendation and/or best practice.  Safe practices are incorporated into the operating and maintenance procedures to reduce exposure of potential hazards to personnel, the public and/or the environment.   These procedures are supported by training to ensure personnel, operators and mechanics in particular, associated with the 29% aqua ammonia p"

A Management of Change (MOC) Procedure is followed to assess the risk of any administrative or facility changes (with the exception of Replacement-in-Kind) and to ensure that if there are additional actions to be performed to reduce risk, procedures/drawings to be revised and/or training to be conducted; it is performed as specified by the MOC.  Actions are tracked to closure as outlined in the Corrective Action and Preventive Action (CAPA) Procedure.  This procedure defines how actions will be tracked and ensures responsible personnel and target completion dates are assigned to all actions.\n\n\n\nAll incidents must be reported and investigated according to the Incident Reporting and Investigation Procedure.  Results of the investigation and lessons learned are then shared with appropriate personnel to prevent future recurrence.  Any actions resulting from the incident investigation are tracked to closure using the CAPA Procedure.\n\n\n\nChemQuest Chemicals has never had a significant release of hazardous substance defined by this Rule for the 29% aqua ammonia process.  In the event there is a release, ChemQuest Chemicals has an Emergency Response Program (ERP).  The ERP describes requirements that must be followed in the event 29% aqua ammonia is released or if an emergency arises during maintenance or the loading or unloading of this substance.  Since ChemQuest Chemicals' employees will not respond to releases of regulated substances, the ERP defines the response organizations on call, emergency notification procedures (internal and external), facility evacuation, site communication and best practices to be used in the event an incident should occur.  The ERP also includes procedures for informing the public in the event of a release.  The ERP is reviewed and updated at least once per year to ensure compliance with RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate any facility changes.\n\n\n\nChemQuest"
