It is prepared industrially from natural gas, steam and air.  Some of this ammonia is used for direct injection into croplands as a fertilizer.  A large amount of industrial ammonia is reacted with carbon dioxide to make urea fertilizer, or reacted to make ammonium nitrate fertilizer.  Ammonia is also frequently used as a refrigerant for the storage of perishable foods.\n\nAmmonia vapors can be irritating to the nose, throat, eyes and skin.  Direct liquid contact to the skin can cause severe burns.\n\nFarmland has considered potential worst-case releases from the refrigerated atmospheric storage tank which is passively mitigated by a secondary containment dike and a bullet tank, the two largest vessels onsite.\n\nFarmlands hypothetical worst-case scenario involves an anhydrous ammonia release from the terminals 30,000-ton refrigerated  atmospheric storage tank.  The worst case release assumes, as required by the rule, that this entire quantity is released as a result of a catastrophic failure of the tank,with subsequent evaporation from the diked pool.  This unlikely event was modeled with a publicly available model (DEGADIS).  The impact of this release scenario is predicted to extend beyond the facility boundary and impact public receptors.\n\nThis scenario, we believe, is a hypothetical worst-case event dictated by the rule and extremely unlikely to occur for many reasons.

These include local fire departments, law enforcement agencies and hospitals.\n\nEmployees receive annual training on the facility emergency response plan and also receive additional safety training, both in general, and in the competencies relative to their required roles in the emergency response plan.\n\nFive-year accident history\n\nThe RMP rule requires inclusion of the facilitys five-year accident history for all accidental releases of regulated substances that resulted in deaths, injuries or significant property or environmental damage on or off site. \n\nFarmlands Sgt. Bluff terminal has an excellent five-year accident record with no RMP reportable releases.\n\nHazard Assessment\n\nSynopsis of worst and alternative-case release scenarios:\n\nThe hazard assessment element of the RMP rule requires the evaluation of potential off site effects of \"worst-case\" and \"alternative-case\" release scenarios of regulated substances, in a Progam 3 process.\n\nThe EPA has defined a worst-case scenario as the release of the largest quantity of a listed chemical from a vessel or process line failure, taking into account passive mitigation and administrative controls.  The impact of these potential releases must be quantified in accordance with release criteria dictated in the rule.  The projected impact distance is determined using EPA defined atmospheric conditions and is intended to provide a conservative estimate of the maximum possible area that might be affected.  According to the EPA, the worst-case scenario is intended to ensure that no potential risks to public health are overlooked, but the distance to an endpoint estimated under worst-case should not be considered a \"public danger zone.\""

Generally, significantly lower quantities are involved, due to numerous shutdown safeguards present, as they are through out the terminal, and operator intervention which tend to mitigate and limit the consequences of failures.\n\nThe hypothetical ammonia alternative release scenario considered for this process is a release of ammonia due to the failure of a 4\" transfer pipe.  The pipe is assumed to fail and release ammonia for several minutes before employee intervention activates the Emergency Shut Down System which stops the release.  The impact of such a release was modeled with the DEGADIS model which shows that, under typical ambient conditions, the impact of the release would extend off-site.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes for Safety Improvements\n\nSafety improvements are a continual and ongoing process at the facility which is facilitated by the Prevention Program/Process Safety Management Program.  Formal process hazard analysis is conducted at least every five years, but review is constant through management of change procedures, operator training, incident investigation and mechanical integrity programs.  As a result, changes relevant to safety occur continuously as needs are identified through these procedures and policies."
