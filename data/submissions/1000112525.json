      "SummaryText": "Fairmont Wastewater Treatment Plant     Risk Management Plan Executive summary.  The Fairmont wastewater treatment system utilizes chlorine gas for disinfection purposes.  The facility utilizes one-ton cylinders of chlorine gas which are received at the facility on a once-per-month basis.  Up to three cylinders are maintained on-site at any one time.  All three cylinders are stored inside the wastewater treatment plant chlorine cylinder storage room.  The process utilizes one cylinder on-line at any one time.  One additional cylinder is connected to an automatic transfer system.  The automatic transfer system allows the second cylinder to go on-line as soon as the chlorine from the first cylinder has been totally utilized.  The average chlorine usage rate at this facility is 100 lbs. per day.  The Fairmont wastewater system utilizes a Wallace and Tiernan (WT) chlorinator system.  This system operates such that the chlorine transfer from the cylinder to the chlorinators is under vacuum versus pressure.  This type of arrangement provides for minimal potential for leaks of chlorine through the piping.  The facility has a preventive maintenance (PM)program which is designed to maintain the equipment that handles chlorine gas in a good operating mode.  Weekly PM is performed for this equipment through scheduled work orders.  Chlorine cylinders are received from the vendor and the transfer of the cylinders from the truck to the chlorine storage building is always performed during daylight hours and is attended by the truck driver and a Fairmont wastewater treatment plant operator.  The Fairmont wastewater treatment plant is not continuously manned, but all alarms are monitored by a SCADA control system which alerts off site personnel to alarm conditions for immediate response.  There are three (3) chlorine sensor located at the facility.  These sensors are designed to detect any chlorine release within the chlorine cylinder storage area, the chlorinator room and the vent"

      "SummaryText": "location.  Both the chlorinator room and chlorine storage room are designed with exhaust fans that automatically start if a chlorine release is identified by the sensors.\n\nThe alternative scenario identified for this facility would be for a failure of the yoke piping which connects to the cylinder.  If this piping and related regulator valve failed, a maximum of 50 lbs. per hour of chlorine gas could be released from one cylinder.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROCEDURES\n\nIn the event of a severe chlorine release, FWWTP employees are instructed to call 911 and request assistance from the Fairmont Fire Department.  The Fire Department personnel can respond within 5 minutes and have the adequate personal protective equipment to isolate valves in the event of such an incident.  Regarding lower volume incidents involving minor leaks, FWWTP has a contract with a Contract Chlorine Supplier. FWWTP also has the proper equipment including SCBA equipment and regulators for small gas leaks. Once the chlorine usage area has been adequately ventilated and the release of chlorine stopped, FWWTP personnel will enter into the area to perform the repair work necessary.  FWWTP personnel have been instructed to never enter into a chlorine usage area in the event of an alarm situation.  Should community evacuation or shelter in place become necessary, FWWTP will utilize the Marion County Office of Emergency Management to coordinate the evacuation/shelter in place activity.\n\nTRAINING\n\nFWWTP personnel receive annual chlorine awareness training from the Contract Chlorine Supplier.  This training is performed to ensure that personnel understand the hazards of dealing with chlorine gas and are familiar with the routine tasks associated with their jobs, as well as aware of the emergency response procedures necessary to be followed in the event of a chlorine release.  \n\nFWWTP personnel are also provided with CPR training on an annual basis as well as basic first aid training.  This training is provided"

FWWTP personnel also receive annual training for use of Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA) from the Fairmont City Fire Department.  The Fire Department also provides periodic inspection of the SCBA units.\n\nAFFECTED AREA\n\nIn the event of a release, either a catastrophic release or the alternate scenario type release, there would be a immediate impact of recreational area, in that the FWWTP is located adjacent to the Monongahela River.  This river is used for a variety of recreational purposes including boating, fishing, and swimming."
