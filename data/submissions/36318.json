Hill Brothers Chemical Company staff is well trained and utilizes modern equipment to monitor its facilities to provide safeguards, while effectively employing these chemicals.  \n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nHill Brothers Chemical Company has an emergency response plan in effect to handle potential emergency situations at this facility.  This plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n1.) To save lives.\n2.) To minimize and avoid injuries.\n3.) To protect the environment.\n4.) To minimize property damage.\n \nHill Brothers Chemical Company policy is to conduct all operations in a safe and conscientious manner to prevent accidental releases of any hazardous material, including substances regulated through the Federal Accidental Release Prevention Program.  Hill Brothers Chemical Company trains its employees at this facility to properly handle and store hazardous materials to minimize the possibility of adversely affecting its worker's health, the workplace, the public, and the environment.  Hill Brothers Chemical Company Accidental Release Prevention policy is implemented through the management system contained in its RMP.\n\nHill Brothers Chemical Company emergency response policy is contained in its current written Hazardous Materials Business Plan.

The Tucson Facility is initiating a highly cooperative relationship with the Tucson Fire Department to ensure a full understanding of normal storage practices and emergency response and evacuation procedures related to regulated substances.  \n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\nThe Hill Brothers Chemical Company Tucson Facility stores and distributes chlorine 150-pound cylinders and one-ton containers.  Covered processes include unloading, loading and storing pre-packaged chemicals for resale to commercial accounts.  No manufacturing is performed at this facility. \n\nChlorine stored at the warehouse is contained in metal vessels designed to Department of Transportation standards.  Each chlorine container delivered, stored, and distributed at the warehouse has a steel valve protection cap which covers the container valve or valves.  These steel protective caps are never removed from the container and the container valves are never opened or operated in any way at the warehouse.  All cylinders are inspected upon arrival at the facility to ensure that they meet all applicable safety codes.  The containers are stored in a concrete building with a wood roof and a fire sprinkler system for fire protection.\n \n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nHill Brothers Chemical Company has a PSM program in place to manage handling of regulated substances, which complies with Federal RMP and PSM requirements.  The program includes strict requirements for written operating procedures, personnel training, contractor safety, equipment maintenance, incident investigation, process hazard analysis, management of change and periodic review or audit of program elements.  Management of change element addresses proper implementation of system updates to ensure that all changes are reviewed properly by knowle"

Process Safety Management also requires a pre-startup safety review to ensure that the system is properly reviewed before it is put back into service after a major change.  \n\nBecause the regulated substances are pre-packaged and remain in original containers at all times under normal operations, Hill Brothers Chemical Company prevention program emphasizes thorough training for its employees in hazard communication; proper handling, transfer, and storage methods; and awareness level emergency response.  Hill Brothers Chemical Company standard operating procedures include routine observation of container integrity during loading and unloading of these cylinders.  For example, two people are always present during loading and unloading to ensure safe container handling using forklifts or hand trucks.  Cylinders, skids and one-ton containers are stored with valve caps or covers in place, and strapped, blocked, or chained in accordance with OSHA requirements for compressed gases.\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nThe five-year accident history (June 1999 to June 2004) for the Hill Brothers Chemical Company Tucson Facility reveals that there were no reportable accidents during this period.\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nHill Brothers Chemical Company Tucson Facility is taking additional steps to further public safety.  Several studies have been conducted recently to examine mitigation measures and additional steps to further ensure public safety at the Hill Brothers Chemical Company Tucson Facility.  The changes primarily include detailed reviews and updates of formal operating, maintenance, and emergency response procedures to address comments and recommended actions identified through various analyses.  All recommended changes from the Process Hazard Analysis, Pre-Startup Safety Review and Seismic Assessment have been reviewed and implement"
