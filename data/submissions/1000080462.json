      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\r\nVan Drunen Farms (VDF) located in Momence, IL.supplies an extensive line of conventional and organic dehydrated, whole-food fruits, vegetables, herbs and other natural, functional food ingredients, and frozen herbs and vegetables, for use in a variety of applications spanning the processed food industry. The products that are produced at VDF use different methods to produce the finished product. One of the methods is through the freeze-drying application that involves the use of anhydrous ammonia. Fruits, vegetables, and other food ingredients are dehydrated through vacuum chambers. Anhydrous ammonia is used to chill and condense the water coming from chambers to execute the drying process. Refrigeration storage and quick freezing are the other methods that require anhydrous ammonia usage. \r\n\r\nThere are two VDF plants separate of each other equipped with anhydrous ammonia refrigeration systems, each plant having two large separate systems. All four refrigeration systems are two stage systems. Each system is at or under the Process Safety Management (PSM) standard threshold limit of 10,000 lbs. VDF as required by law has developed a PSM Safety Program encompassing all of the required elements of the standard. The accidental release prevention and emergency response programs were developed to meet those requirements and to provide safe measures to prevent or minimize releases. Each element of the VDF prevention program is explained below individually:\r\n\r\nEMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION\r\nAll employees affected or potentially affected by the ammonia refrigeration systems operating at VDF facilities are part of the PSM Program. Employee participation is part of the development, implementation and review of elements covered under the PSM standard. Employees have access to PHA analyses and all other information developed under the PSM standard. New employees are made aware of ammonia refrigeration systems and the PSM elements as a part of the initial orientation"

There are ammonia odors that occasionally come from packing valve stems, draining oil, and refrigeration cooling coils. These are repaired in a timely manner and investigated. VDF is committed to improve process safety by investigating incidents that would cause, or reasonably could have caused, significant injury or damage, and taking steps to eliminate the causes.\r\n\r\nAn incident investigation is performed if an ammonia odor is reported by non-refrigeration personnel, or when an incident results in, or could have reasonably resulted in, a large ammonia release.  Two primary types of investigations are provided for: Odor Investigations and Major Incident Investigations. The appropriate type of investigation is left up to the team leader which includes assembling an investigation team, completing the appropriate forms, documenting pertinent information, and implement corrective measures\r\n\r\nHOT WORKS\r\nA hot works permit procedure is used at VDF for safe execution of burning, welding, or other types of Hot Works. This procedure defines minimum requirements for preparation of equipment and the protection of personnel prior to and during Hot Works. The Hot Work Permit System is part of the overall VDF Safety and Health Accident Prevention Program. This applies to VDF employees and contractors on site involved with Hot Works.  This procedure must be used with the Lockout/Tagout Procedure when Hot Works is to be performed on machinery or equipment that needs to be de-energized before work can begin.

In addition VDF has implemented a line break procedure and permit system anytime a line break in the ammonia system has to be done.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION\r\nProcess Safety Information (PSI) enables affected employees and contactors working in the ammonia processes to identify and understand the hazards posed by those processes.  This is accomplished through a program which compiles and maintains written Process Safety Information.  \r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information for existing systems begins by collecting component data (manufacturer, model number, NB number, etc) from the field.  More detailed information may be available from existing company files. New installations and modifications, information is generally obtained from the manufacturers by contractor doing the change. Information gathered is filed electronically on a VDF network drive in a series of folders reserved and labeled for that purpose. A project in which field components are added or substituted for another (with different specifications), is purged of obsolete information from the file, and new information is added.  Field changes are made following the Management of Change and Pre-Startup Safety Review programs. These procedures provide a specific guide as to what information must be added, and then a check to verify completion. \r\n\r\nSafety Data Sheets for ammonia, compressor oil, and any other chemicals necessary to support the ammonia system is compiled and maintained by the Safety department as part of the Hazard Communication program. \r\n\r\nProcess technology is defined on documents such as a simplified PFD, a statement of maximum intended inventory, safe upper and lower limits for process parameters, and evaluations of the consequence of deviation from those limits.

The relief design and relief design basis are given.  The design basis for the ventilation system is given.  Codes and standards by which the portions of the system were developed are defined.  Safety systems are defined by type and function.\r\n\r\nWherever possible, PSI documents demonstrate equipment complies with recognized and generally accepted good practices.  Existing equipment designed and constructed in accordance with codes, standards, or practices that are no longer in general use, documentation shows equipment is designed, maintained, inspected, tested and operating in a safe manner.  \r\n\r\nPROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS\r\nVDF now performs Process Hazard Analyses internally using methods that provide a thorough, orderly and systematic analysis of the process hazards.  Typically, the What-if or What-if/Checklist method is used.  A PHA form is available for use.  Pages can be used on paper or in electronic format. The VDF Process Hazard Analysis addresses:\r\n\u00bf\tThe hazards of the process\r\n\u00bf\tThe identification of any previous incidents with a likely potential for catastrophic consequences\r\n\u00bf\tEngineering and administrative controls and detection methods\r\n\u00bf\tFacility siting\r\n\u00bf\tHuman factors\r\n\u00bf\tA qualitative analysis of the safety and health affects of failures of controls on workers\r\n\r\nPHA's are performed by a team having knowledge of engineering and process operations.

The MOC is a 3 step procedure that uses forms to document the process.\r\n\r\nA VDF employee initiates a change by completing Step 1 of the Management of Change Form and submitting it to the process engineer or his delegate.  The MOC# is obtained from the MOC log using sequential numbers.  The process engineer completes much of Step 2, defining what must be done to meet Process Safety requirements.  A meeting is then held with those performing and those approving the change to clarify the reasons and requirements for making the change.  Once the team agrees on the task list and assigns the tasks, approval is given for the change to proceed by signature in Step 3.  Completed forms are scanned and stored with other PSM documentation. If a change is to be made in the field, a Pre-Startup Safety Review is required before ammonia is charged to the new system.  The exceptions are a Replacement-in-Kind or a very minor change.\r\n\r\nMECHANICAL INTEGRITY\r\nMechanical Integrity remains the highest priority and is the nuts and bolts of the PSM program.

The PSM Committee provides guidance and support as necessary. Mechanical Integrity applies to all vessels, equipment, controls, ESD systems, relief devices and systems, and piping in the ammonia systems. Procedures for maintaining mechanical integrity of the equipment are written and implemented.\r\n\r\nPreventive Maintenance (PM) is performed with the assistance of a mechanical refrigeration contractor and by VDF refrigeration personnel. PM is performed on all four of the VDF ammonia systems. PM is conducted weekly, monthly, quarterly, and annually. PM is documented with the use of checklists for each time period. In addition each engine room has a log book of the work activity and inspections that remains in the engine room for review.\r\n\r\nInspection and testing is performed on the equipment in accordance with generally accepted good engineering practices, and on a frequency consistent with manufacturer's standards and good engineering practices. Relief valves are changed every five years.\r\n\r\nDeficiencies outside acceptable limits are corrected before further use or in a timely manner when means are taken to assure safe operation. Only equipment that is suitably fabricated for that purpose is used in the construction of new plants and equipment.  The Change Leader who oversees the implementation construction of a new project is required to assure equipment is installed properly and consistent with manufacturer's instructions.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPRE STARTUP SAFETY REVIEW\r\nThe primary objective of the Pre Startup Safety Review Program (PSUSR) is to verify that the items specified on the Management of Change (MOC) are completed as specified by the approvers before the full implementation of the change in the field.

If support is required from the Police or Fire Departments, the IC interfaces with their leaders to define those needs.  During the entire emergency response, the IC and the Safety Officer have responsibility for the safety of all members of the team.  One IC can relieve another during a response, but in all cases the lines of authority go to the active IC.\r\n\r\nThe greatest share of the planning is performed and documented ahead of time during Pre-emergency planning sessions by the Pre-plan sub-team.  Their work is documented on drawings which show the floor plan of the buildings as well as pictures of the valves or controls that need to be operated to best mitigate a release in each area.  Additional planning is done at the beginning of each response to tailor the general Pre-plans into the Action Plan for that situation.  This Action Plan is then executed by the Operations group.  \r\n\r\nAdditional work that may be necessary such as neighborhood evacuations, more extensive security, or EMT services is normally provided by the Momence Police and Fire Departments. \r\n\r\nTRADE SECRETS\r\nIf a person is required by the PSM standard to know information which is considered a trade secret, VDF ensures that information is made available to him/her.
