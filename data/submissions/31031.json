The HAZMAT team along with members of the Forrest City Fire Department underwent training on 11-03. The facility is equipped with ammonia detectors in critical areas that, in the event of a leak will trigger alarms in the refrigeration control room as well as the guardshack. The plant has practice evacuations semi annually and the Forrest City Fire Department has been in the plant on safety inspections and will be with the plant personnel in an emergency response situation. The Boar's Head Forrest City Arkansas facility has been in operation for eight years without a single toxic release or accident with the ammonia refrigeration system.",

Inc. operates a meat processing facility located at 2530 West Broadway Street Forrest City Arkansas, the plant employs 490 production and maintenance personnel distributed on three shifts. The facility uses Anhydrous Ammonia (NH3) as a heat transfer media. Most of the facility is cooled to 35 to 40 degrees F in order to preserve the meat and meat products. The ammonia refrigeration system is computer controlled and the facility is manned 24 hours a day 7 days a week. The materials used in the covered process are of the highest quality and standards available to the refrigeration industry and the Boar's Head management and engineering team maintains that the contractors used to install and maintain the the ammonia refrigeration system meet the highest qualifications dictated by the P.S.M. standard. The facility has ammonia detectors located in strategic locations throughout the refrigeration system. The facility is operated under the P.S.M. standard and complys with all O.S.H.A. and federal as well as state and local codes and ordinances.\n\nPROCESS TECHINICAL DESCRIPTION:\nThe refrigeration operates as a single stage ammonia refrigeration system @ 3:1 recirculation rate.\nDefrost is achieved by utilizing hot gas taken from the compressor discharge header.\nIn the compressor room there are eleven (11) Frick rotary screw compressors which service the various air cooling evaporators throughout the facility as well as the glycol and water chillers. The ammonia is cooled utilizing eight (8) evapco evaporative condensers.\n\nCONTINGENCY PLAN:\nSee the attached document\"THE ONE PLAN ARKANSAS\"\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nWORST CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS:\n#1 Worst case scenario, coil leak at one of the evaporative condensers due to impact by crop dusting airplane.

He or she will give the location and a brief description of the emergency problem.  The Supervisor or Manager will investigate the reported emergency problem and will determine if the Integrated Contingency Plan needs to be activated.  The Supervisor or Manager will then notify the guardhouse of the situation and give the predetermined codes.  Depending on the situation and its severity, the guard on duty will notify the Plant Manager.  The Plant Manager will make the decision on what type of evacuation should take place (total or partial).  When complexity so indicates, the HAZMAT team will be notified.\n\n\n\nII. INITIAL RESPONSE:\n\n\n\nA. PROCEDURES FOR INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL NOTIFICATIONS:\n\n\n\n1. Once the severity of the situation is determined, the HAZMAT team shall be notified.  The Safety Officer will contact the Incident Commander and the Refrigeration Supervisor and a determination will be made on whether the emergency response management system needs to be established.\n\n\n\n2.

A catastrophic release is a release that proves to be fatal to several people.  The PHA team came up with the following hazard using the Risk Matrix system.\n\n\n\na. Ammonia Detectors are in the interstitial (attic) area, and are interlocked with the exhaust fans in this area , and also connected to an audible and visual alarm system, that upon activation shall alert the refrigeration technicians as to the affected area and concentration of ammonia. \n\n\n\nG. PROTECTION\n\n\n\n1. All equipment, components and materials used in the system will be designed and manufactured for ammonia refrigeration service, will comply with ASME code B31.5-1992 and will meet system pressure and temperature requirements.                    \n\na. Protective booming shall be used when applicable, in those areas that may have a potential of contaminating the surrounding environment.\n\n\n\nb. In the event there is a release of anhydrous ammonia and it had the potential to harm the surrounding communities, measures would be taken on notifying those individuals with the assistance of local authorities and emergency services.  The Arkansas Department of Emergency Management will be contacted at (501) 730 - 9751 or (800) 322-4012 for assistance.  The St. Francis county sheriff's office will be contacted at 911.  It shall be noted here that Boar's Head Provisions is located in a primarily industrial area away from any public receptors.\n\n\n\nc.

Due to circumstances that may arise, the bermed wall may prove to be inadequate.  If this is the case, the contaminated area shall be diked and absorbent hydrocarbon pellets shall be scattered on the affected area.  These pallets are biodegradable.\n\n\n\nc. If the spill is in excess of 100 gallons or more, then the spill shall be reported to the EPA and the ADEM.

There is an above ground #2 fuel oil tank with a capacity of 10,000 gallons.  This tank is bermed by a  22.5' x 21' x 4' berm wall.  The wall should be adequate to contain any size spill.  The spill would be reported to the EPA and disposal shall be in accordance to local, federal and state laws.\n\n\n\nb. Due to circumstances that may arise, the berm wall may prove to be inadequate.  If this is the case, then the contaminated area shall be diked and absorbent material shall be put down to stop any storm drain contamination.  Absorbent hydrocarbon pellets shall be placed down to help contain and stop the flow of the spill.  As stated above, these hydrocarbon pellets are biodegradable.\n\n\n\nc. If the spill is in excess of 100 gallons or more, then the spill shall be reported to the EPA and the ADEM.

Preventive measures shall be taken to deter the spill away from storm drains and tributaries.\n\n\n\n\n\n* Storage drums\n\n\n\na. There are two 55-gallon storage drum areas, each containing chemicals, used oil or empty barrels.  The chemical storage areas also contain 330-gallon totes.  Most of the storage drums have been eliminated and the chemicals and oils are stored in bulk containers.  This procedure is in accordance to Boar's Head's established spill prevention control and countermeasure plan.\n\n\n\nb. Due to circumstances that may arise, a spill may occur.

Due to the circumstances that may arise, there may be an ammonia release.  The release may be (minor) tolerable or major (intolerable).  A minor release is a release of anhydrous ammonia in concentrations less than 200 PPM.  If a release is minor, the supervisor will be notified and the plant manager will be notified.  Refrigeration technicians shall respond to the situation and control after contacting the refrigeration supervisor.  If a release is termed a major release, the above steps shall be taken, plant evacuation will occur and the HAZMAT team will be called upon.  A major release would be a release in excess of 200 PPM.
