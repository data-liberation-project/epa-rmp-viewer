      "SummaryText": "It is the intent of Kentucky-American Water Company (KAWC) to protect its employees as well as the communities it serves from the dangers that are associated with hazardous chemicals.  In order to achieve this goal at KAWC, specific controls, policies and procedures are in place to prevent and/or to minimize the risk to the community.  This program and the corresponding Process Safety Management Program (PSM), which has been in effect at KAWC since May 1993, are intended to prevent and minimize the impact of the accidental release of chlorine and ammonia.\n\nKAWC developed the PSM and this RMP to include full employee participation in this program.  Employees who are involved in working with covered chemical processes have been involved in all aspects of these programs including the process hazard analysis.  All affected employees have received training relative to performing their job as well as the technician level of hazardous waste operator training.  Employees involved included both union and management personnel from all areas of expertise including risk management, water quality, production and maintenance.  The following positions were instrumental in the implementation of both the PSM and the RMP: Director Loss Control, Director Water Quality, Kentucky River Station Water Quality Specialist and Operations Supervisor, Richmond Road Station Water Quality Specialist and Operations Supervisor and union operating/maintenance personnel.  \n\nWritten standard operating procedures have been developed for all treatment chemicals utilized by Kentucky-American Water Company.  The operating procedures for the hazardous chemicals in this plan, chlorine and ammonia, include steps to perform during normal and emergency operation limits, consequences of limit deviations, means to avoid such deviations, safety and health considerations (precautions, controls and equipment) and safety systems."
