The tanks are located adjacent to the plant on the hillside in a mountainous rural setting.  The 55 employees mentioned in the application are distributed across three daily shifts.  The maximum number of employees at the plant is anticipated to be 20.  \n\nFor more information, visit our web site at www.magnumcoal.com or contact the Plant Manager.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\nThis facility is operated in accordance with the USEPA prevention program requirements.  A written management system is in place along with written operating procedures.  The management system procedures ensure training for operations employees, numerous management checks and balances, and strict attention to changes in the operations with a thorough review and examination of potential incidents that could lead to an accidental release.

This facility has emergency medical treatment information readily available for use in an emergency. \n \nFive-year accident history: \n\nWe have never had a release of anhydrous ammonia that resulted in or could have resulted in an offsite impact. \n  \nThe emergency response program:\n\nOur employees will not respond to accidental releases of the regulated substance but will rely on the local emergency responders when there is a need for response.  Our employees regularly undergo training in defensive emergency response activities.  This facility has a written emergency response plan that is updated regularly.  \n\nPlanned changes to improve safety:\n\nOur facility continually evaluates and implements employee suggestions.   We make changes to improve safety based on comments and information developed within our organization and the industry.  Toward continuous improvement we are looking at ways to minimize risk through process improvement and re-design."
