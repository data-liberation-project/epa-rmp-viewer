Our New Bloomington Branch, in addition to handling grain, is also involved with providing crop services and supplies to local farmers.  Part of this supply business includes the selling anhydrous ammonia.  Farmers use this anhydrous ammonia as a source of nitrogen for their corn.  In terms of processes, ours is a very simple one.  We purchase anhydrous ammonia in bulk truck transports and then  it is transferred to smaller nurse tanks which are then taken to the fields for application.   When our anhydrous ammounia storage area was established, it was inspected and certified by the State of Ohio Department of Agriculture.  Our storage tanks are locked out at all times.  What this means is that the valves are padlocked for safety and security.  In addition to locking out the tanks, there are other safety features such as excess flow valves, and pressure relief valves to insure that the highest level ofsafety and security are maintained.  These safety features are indicative of the commitment to safety that is shared by all employees of Central Ohio Farmers Co-op from the top down.  This commitment to safety is evident by the mandatory attendance to regular safety meetings, the training updates and reviews, and an overall genuine concern for our employees well being.We will perform periodic evaluations to assess our equipment.  \n\n\n\nEmergency Response Plan - We have an entire emergency response plan established and ready if the need arises.

Our employees have been trained to know where to go and what to do in case of an emergency.  We also have good relationships with utilites and contractors if need be, and have designated e"
