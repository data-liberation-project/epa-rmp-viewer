If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other quthorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.  The primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.  Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.\n\nThe maximum quanity of anhydrous ammonia that can be stored would be 120,000 pounds.\n\n3.  The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents fo a storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quanity released would be 120,000 pounds, which represents the volume fo the largest storage tank as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint of .14mg/L for the worst-case scenario is 1.0 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario based on the most likely potential incident is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint of .14mg/L for the alternative scenario is .19 miles.  This release has the possibility of extending beyond the facility boundary.\n\n4.  This facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.  This facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonis, K-61.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc. as adopted by state regulation and the standards of the U S Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".\n\n5.
