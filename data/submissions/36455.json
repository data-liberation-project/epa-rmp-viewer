      "SummaryText": "American Chemical Service, Inc., (ACS), is a speciality chemical manufacturer located in Northwest, Indiana in the county of Lake. ACS has developed an Integrated Contingency Plan (ICP) in accordance with the guidelines and recommendations of the National Response Team.\n\nThe purpose of the ICP is to minimize hazards to human health and to protect the environment from fires, explosions, spills or a toxic gas release of hazardous materials.  The ICP manual contains procedures, instructions, data, methods, tables, forms and general assistance for the operation of the production facilities at American Chemical Service (ACS) during other than normal operations.  This manual is a part of the ACS Quality System that is designed to produce high quality products that meet customer requirements.\n\nACS has completed a Process Safety Management Program (PSM) and a Risk Management Program (RMP). The PSM and RMP are a portion of the ICP. The accidental release prevention programs and policies along with the emergency response policies are addressed and included in the ICP, PSM and RMP.\n\nACS has a site specific Safety and Health Plan for its facility. Accidental release prevention and emergency response polices are also addressed in this program, however, to a lesser degree than they are addressed in the ICP.\n\nACS has identified and trained four emergency coordinators whose responsibility is to proactively respond to releases or potential releases of hazardous substances on site and/or other off site releases that may be affecting the facility. At least one of these individuals can be reached twenty-four (24) hours a day. These individuals also are members of the PSM and RMP planning and audit committies."
