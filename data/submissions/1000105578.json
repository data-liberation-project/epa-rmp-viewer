The facility maintains a written Emergency Response Plan to document specific procedures to be implemented in the event of various emergencies, including ammonia release. The Emergency Release Plan includes procedures for facility evacuation, as well as for notification of the local emergency response agencies, which are responsible for notifying the public. The plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within the facility that would require modified procedures.\n\nFood Lion Distribution Center # 20 has devised a comprehensive emergency response program, designed to protect both employees and the community in the event of a release. This program is fully described in a document entitled EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN (ERP) in order to facilitate response efforts in the event of an off-site anhydrous ammonia release.  Included in the plan are measures to be taken internally by Food Lion Distribution Center # 20 as well as measures to be taken by off-site response agencies.  \n\n\nTo assure that the local governmental response agencies are familiar with Food Lion Distribution Center # 20 emergency response procedures, Food Lion Distribution Center # 20 has provided copies of the ERP for review and approval by the local agencies and has provided on-site Fire Department training in 2023 . \n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\nFood Lion Distribution Center # 20 aim is to provide a professional service as efficiently as possible while minimizing the use of toxic materials wherever and whenever prudent.  In this effort our highest priority will be the proactive pursuit of cost-effective process changes that reduce or eliminate the use and/"
