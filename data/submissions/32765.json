The Shelbyville Power, Water and Sewerage Systems accidental release prevention and emergency response program for the Shelbyville Water Plant was created by system personnel and outside agencies that specialize in hazard assessment and prevention.\n\nThe Shelbyville Water Plant is located on Scudder Drive next to the Duck River at mile 221.9.  The Shelbyville Water Plant provides potable water for the City of Shelbyville and the Flat Creek Water co-op as well as an emergency water supply for the Bedford Utility District and the City of Wartrace.  The water plant uses gaseous chlorine as a disinfectant in the water treatment process.  The chlorine storage room can store up to a maximum of six one-ton cylinders.  In general, two of the six cylinders are hooked up to the chlorine feed header.  An adjoining room contains the vacuum chlorinators and chlorine injectors.\n\nOur safety philosophy is oriented toward affirmative control and minimization of risk at the greatest extent possible. To this end, every reasonable effort will be made in achieving the goal of accident prevention and health preservation. We have had zero accidental releases of chlorine in the last five years. We completed and implemented a Process Safety Management Plan and emergency response procedures concerning chlorine storage and handling. These plans include, but are not limited to, employee training on safe handling of chlorine and response procedures to a chlorine leak, and a review of the chlorine system including a process hazard analysis. \n\nThe chlorine system building includes the following safety equipment; chlorine detectors to notify personnel of chlorine concentrations in air, visual and audible alarms to alert personn"

Additionally, the water plant is surrounded by an earthen berm, which according to experts in the business of preventing, controlling and cleaning up toxic releases, would prevent migration of the bulk of a worst case release.  The water plant is also staffed 24 hours a day with operators performing routine visual checks of the chlorine process.\n\nThe Shelbyville Water Plant has coordinated their response plans with the Bedford County Emergency Management Director, Shelbyville Fire Department, Shelbyville Police Department and a contracted Emergency Response Team to properly respond to and mitigate any accidental chlorine releases.  Thereby limiting the severity of such releases and their impact on both public health and environment."
