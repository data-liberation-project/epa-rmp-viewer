All refrigeration operators are HAZWOPER Technician Level trained. The Super Store Industries\u0092 Emergency Response Plan is designed to meet the regulatory requirements and give our employees and community the maximum protection in the event of an ammonia release. \n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY \n\nEmployees, community safety, the environment and product care are primary concerns at this facility. Several PHA studies have been conducted at Super Store Industries and each time the study team made recommendations for additional safety. \n\nSuper Store Industries will respond to all suggested mitigation measures promptly. Super Store Industries has established completion schedules for proposed actions either within the allotted time frame given by regulation or based on the timetable agreed upon between the facility and San Joaquin County CUPA.

Together these activities improve the overall safety of the employees, environment, and the surrounding community. \n\n\u0095 Compliance Audit \nThe audit process is a valuable tool to confirm Super Store Industries\u0092 compliance with the RMP / PSM program and whether each of the elements in the prevention program has been implemented and properly documented. Super Store Industries has established a Management System to address any shortcomings which the audit may find. A priority list is developed, and target dates are set for any changes or corrections. \n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY \nAn investigation into the Super Store Industries' Lathrop facility accident history revealed that there have been no releases of ammonia that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 100 pounds over the past five years (May 2019 \u0096 May 2024). In addition, there have been no injuries resulting from an ammonia release. \n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM \nThis Emergency Action and Response Plan, otherwise referred to as the EARP or the Plan, has been developed to ensure adequate preparedness with rapid and appropriate response to emergency situations. The purpose of this Plan is to protect Super Store Industries (SSI) employees, contractors, visitors, the environment, and assets. \n\nThis Plan was designed to be applicable to those types of emergencies that may affect SSI and provides an organizational and procedural framework for the management of emergency incidents. The Plan also describes the coordination of SSI and outside agencies to further protect SSI employees and property, as well as the surrounding community and environment. \n\nThe Plan is based on the concept that the elements of eme"

The facility chills and stores a variety of food products in the cold storage warehouse. The facility also manufactures ice. \n\nSuper Store Industries Lathrop uses anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant within the facility\u0092s refrigeration system. The systems, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycle ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, then back to high pressure liquid) to provide refrigeration for cold storage rooms and ice manufacturing. Changes in pressure are directly related to changes in temperature. For example, lowering the ammonia pressure lowers its temperature. Low pressure (cold) liquid ammonia provides refrigeration by removing ambient heat. Removal of ambient heat causes the liquid ammonia (contained within the system) to vaporize. \n\nHeat is later removed from the ammonia as it is condensed back into a liquid. Typical operating conditions range from 0 - 6 psig on the low pressure side of the system to 100-160 psig on the high side. The refrigeration system is a closed-loop system without any regular emissions or releases. Any leaks are noted and repaired immediately. \n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM \n\nSuper Store Industries prevention program is described in the PSM program.
