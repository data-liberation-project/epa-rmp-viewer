The RMP and the Plan meet and address the requirements of Title 40 Code of Federal Regulations Part 68.\n\nThis executive summary briefly describes the following elements:\n-    The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the stationary source;\n-    The stationary source and regulated substances handled;\n-    The worst-case release scenario(s) and the alternative release scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario;\n-    The general accidental release prevention program and chemical specific prevention steps;\n-    The five year accident history;\n-    The emergency response program; and\n-    Planned changes to improve safety\n\nTo address concerns of an accidental release prevention and emergency response, all plant are trained in ammonia emergency response procedures and use of appropriate protective equipment.  Refresher training and emergency response drills are conducted on a periodic basis to ensure personnel are equipped, trained, prepared, and practiced in responding to ammonia emergencies.\n\nAs a demonstration of managements high degree of commitment to public safety steps are being taking to decrease the risk of ammonia exposure to the public by implementing recommendations made during the Process Hazards Analysis (PHA), Compliance Audits and Off-site Consequence Analysis.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is used as a refrigerant in this facilities refrigeration system.  The liquid is circulated as needed to the evaporators where heat is absorbed and removed from the medium.  The anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system is a closed loop industrial refrigeration system.  The ammonia is not used or mixed in any manner with other chemical processes.\n\nA ?Worst-Case Scenario Off-site Consequenc"

      "SummaryText": "e Analysis? and an ?Alternative Scenario Off-site Consequence Analysis? were performed using RMP Comp.  Also as part of the analysis all public and environmental receptors within the toxic endpoint concentration radius of 0.14mg/L were identified.  \n\nEmergency response is discussed in Section 9 of the RMP Submittal.  The facility has a detailed Emergency Response Plan (ERP) for their facility.  The purpose of this plan is to provide the means for rapidly determining the appropriate response for any emergency that may develop at the facility such as an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  The ERP outlines procedures for conducting scheduled drills of the emergency response plan.\n\nThe current owners have not owned the facility for five years and there have been no reportable releases since the change in plant ownership.  To prevent and/or minimize any potential future release of anhydrous ammonia, The facility is implementing a detailed Process Safety Management (PSM) level 3 program.  The PSM program provides extensive maintenance and operator/mechanic training to ensure system mechanical integrity is maintained for the life of the covered process.  The PSM program also incorporates administrative controls when modifications are made to the covered process (ammonia refrigeration system), so that the training and preventative maintenance programs are updated as the system expands and changes.\n\nAll recommendations resulting from the Process Hazard Analysis, Compliance Audits, Off-site Consequences Analysis, Incident Investigations, and Mechanical Integrity Inspections will be considered and implemented if deemed necessary and feasible.  The flexibility of the program allows the facility to respond effectively to prevent or minimize any potential of exposing employees, the surrounding public, and/or the environment receptors to a release of anhydrous ammonia."
