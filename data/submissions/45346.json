      "SummaryText": "Background Data:\n\nIn accordance with Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations Chapter 68 (40 CFR 68) promulgated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Bryan Foods, Inc. (Bryan) submits this Risk Management Plan (RMP) for operations at their West Point, Mississippi, facility.  Bryan's operations include the manufacturing of pork and beef food products for public consumption packaged under the familiar brand name \"Bryan\".  Bryan has been in operation at this facility for over 66 years providing quality meat products and approximately 1800 jobs to the local community.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy:\n\nBryan is committed to protecting the health of its employees, the surrounding community and the environment; therefore it is Bryan's policy to maintain compliance with 40 CFR 68 as well as Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations promulgated as Title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 1910, Section 119 (29 CFR 1910.119) and OSHA's Hazardous Operations and Emergency Response regulations (29 CFR 1910.120).\n\nStationary Sources and Regulated Substances:\n\nBryan is subject to 112 ? because ammonia, a regulated substance, is present at the facility in amounts greater than 10,000 pounds.\n\nBryan is required to maintain low temperatures in the food processing areas of the plant that are within standards required by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) to ensure quality in the final products.  Bryan uses anhydrous ammonia (a 112? regulated substance) as a refrigerant to maintain the facility within the required range of operating temperatures.  Anhydrous ammonia is as industry-standard refrigerant for meat processing plants.  Bryan's refrigeration system consists of receivers, compressors, evaporators, condensers, piping, pumps, valves and recirculators.\n\nRelease Scenario:\n\nIn accordance with 40 CFR Subpart B, Sara Lee Foods evaluated off-site consequences for re"

      "SummaryText": "leases of anhydrous ammonia.  Both a worst case scenario and an alternate case scenario were developed.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program:\n\nAmmonia\nTo prevent and mitigate accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia, Bryan has implemented several precautionary measures.  Bryan has developed and implemented a PSM program pursuant to OSHA regulations and as such, has evaluated the system for the potential of anhydrous ammonia releases.  Some of the controls installed to prevent catastrophic releases of ammonia are process equipment (vents, pressure relief valves, backup pumps and manual shutoffs) and automated controls (automatic shut-offs and electrical distribution system grounding).\n\nBryan has developed standard operating procedures for all employees and contractors that have contact with the refrigeration system that incorporate safety measures into the procedures.  These safety procedures were developed by system operators and are reviewed at a frequency sufficient to assure that they reflect current operating practice, including changes that result from changes in the technology, the equipment and the facility.  Bryan encourages employee participation in development of the control measures used at the plant by means of company newsletter and training sessions.  Pursuant to written management of change procedures established by Bryan, any changes to the operating procedures are communicated to affected employees.\n\nBryan understands that maintaining the refrigeration system in good working order is essential to preventing accidental releases; therefore Bryan has implemented preventative maintenance programs.  Each preventative maintenance program is scheduled, documented and managed using log sheets to ensure that regular maintenance occurs on the system.  These log sheets are maintained in the Engineering Department for three years.  Also, to ensure the mechanical integrity of critical system components, equipment tests are performed.\n\nTo ensure that Bryan's co"

      "SummaryText": "ntrol measures are effective in maintaining the safe operation of the plant, regularly scheduled audits are performed on the refrigeration system:\n\nIn accordance with the PSM program, Bryan conducts detailed PSM compliance audits as least every three years.  Each audit incorporates review of process safety information, process hazard analysis, operating procedures, training programs, system mechanical integrity, management of change, pre-start up review procedures, compliance audit procedures, incident investigation procedures, employee participation programs, hot work permit procedures and contractor safety procedures.\n\nIn addition, Bryan is audited by the local fire department.\n\nBryan is audited by the USDA on a continual basis.  The USDA maintains a team of personnel at the Bryan facility.\n\nBryan's insurance carrier also conducts independent audits on a variable annual to biennial basis.\n\nFive-Year Accident History:\n\nAmmonia\nWithin the five years prior to the revision of this RMP plan, there has been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia which resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\nEmergency Response Program:\n\nBryan has documented emergency response procedures in a document entitled Emergency Response Action Plan (ERAP) in order to facilitate response efforts in the event of an off-site hazardous substance release.  Included in the ERAP are measures to be taken internally by Bryan as well as measures to be taken by off-site response agencies.\n\nBryan has trained approximately 16 on-site personnel to respond to accidental hazardous substances releases.  These personnel are trained in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.120, OSHA's Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response regulations according to their duties and function.  These personnel receive initial training and annual update training thereafter.\n\nTo assure that "

      "SummaryText": "the local government response agencies are familiar with Bryan's emergency response procedures, Bryan will provide copies of the ERAP and future major revisions for review by the West Point/Clay County EMA (Emergency Management Agency).\n\nTo plan for a hazardous substance release with off-site effects, Bryan's ERAP includes procedures/equipment to mitigate the release, procedures to inform local response agencies, evacuation procedures and procedures for public communication.\n\nIn addition to the West Point/Clay County EMA (Emergency Management Agency), Bryan has arranged emergency response assistance with a local clean-up contractor:  Ferguson Harbour, Inc.\n\nIn the event of a hazardous substance release with off-site effects, the general public will be warned using the following methods:\n\n-Facility alarm whistle.\n\n-Police and fire vehicles equipped with public address systems.\n\n-Door-to-door notification of residents (if necessary).\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\nAmmonia refrigeration is a mature industry employing known technology.  Yet, the plant remains abreast of current innovations that improve safety.  To this end, the Sara Lee Corporation is an active member of International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) and the Refrigeration Engineers Training Association (RETA).  This involvement enables the facility to learn and implement the most modern safety system improvements as they emerge within the ammonia refrigeration industry.  Recently installed computer maintenance management systems enhance reliable operation of the RMP covered process.  Some of the most recent planned improvements include location of ammonia alarm systems and improved ventilation systems in remote engine rooms."
