              "Description": "An Accidental Release Prevention Program is in place to minimize the risk of hazardous chemical releases in accordance with USEPA Risk Management Program (40 CFR Part 68) requirements.  This prevention program covers those processes that handle regulated substances above the threshold amount. The prevention program provides a structured approach to preventing accidents. Some of the specific activities in the prevention program include:\n\n- Process safety information is accessible at all times;\n- A hazard review was conducted as part of the preparations for RMP compliance;\n- Written operating procedures are used for training and guiding the work of the    operators;\n- Training is provided to all employees that operate the system;\n- A program is in place to properly maintain the system and equipment;\n- Incidents are investigated and actions are taken as part of a continuous improvement effort; and \n- Routine audits are conducted to assure that safe practices are being followed\n\nThe processes at the facility subject to RMP are designed with extensive safeguards to protect against the accidental release of a hazardous material. An example of safety equipment in place includes foam fire suppression systems. \n\nIn addition, process operators receive extensive training in the safe operation of the process, and are required to follow detailed operating procedures to help ensure safety. The facility has also implemented a maintenance program to monitor the physical condition of the process equipment, and replace or repair equipment before it fails.\n\nIn the unlikely event of a spill or a release involving a hazardous material, the facility has developed an emergency response plan providing the procedures to be followed to minimize the potential impacts of a fire from the facility. In the event of a release, the facility will call the Bedford Park Fire Department located at the facility boundary.",

Presently approximately 215 permitted aboveground storage tanks are available (approximately 111,000,000 gallon capacity) for storage and distribution of customer products or for support activities.  Materials are received at the terminal by tank trucks, rail cars, barge, and pipeline.   \n\n\n\nOf the permitted aboveground storage tanks, one tank, Tank 5-15 (for storage of vinyl acetate) is covered by the RMP regulation. Tank 5-15 has a total capacity of 215,000 gallons, but is restricted to a maximum working volume of 137,347 gallons to limit air emissions.\n\n\n\nPolicies to Protect Health, Safety and the Environment\n\n\n\nRisk management and safety are important concerns at the Argo Terminal.  This RMP formalizes and documents these activities.  The facility is committed to conducting its operations in a safe and responsible manner and to reducing risks to human health and the environment. KMLT Argo Terminal reviews its safety and operating procedures annually to ensure accurate information is presented therein.\n\n\n\nPrevention Program \n\n\n\nAn Accidental Release Prevention Program is in place to minimize the risk of hazardous chemical releases in accordance with the EPA Risk Management Program requirements (40 CFR 68). This prevention program covers those processes that handle regulated substances above the threshold amount.  The prevention program provides a structured approach to preventing accidents. Some of the specific activities in the prevention program include:\n\n\n\n- Keeping process safety information accessible at all times.\n\n- Conducting a hazard review as part of the preparations for RMP compliance.\n\n- Using written operating procedures to train and guide operators.\n\n- Providing training to all employees that operate the system.\n\n- Operating a program to properly maintain the system and equipme"

The worst-case release scenario for toxic liquids assumes that the total quantity in a vessel is spilled instantaneously onto a flat non-absorbing surface to form a pool.  Passive mitigation systems, such as dikes, are taken into account in the consequence analysis.  The release rate to air is estimated as the rate of evaporation from the pool of spilled toxic liquid.  Each tank at the Argo Terminal is located within a diked area. \n\n\n\nFor Tank 5-15 (capacity 187,700 gallons), it is assumed that the contents of the tank empty instantaneously to a diked area.  The diked area is capable of holding the capacity of the largest tank, plus sufficient freeboard to allow for precipitation.  The evaporation rate is then determined using U.S. EPA's RMP*Comp program to determine the distance to the toxic endpoint. \n\n\n\nFor the Butane Blending process, The \"Worst-Case\" scenario assumes a catastrophic system failure resulting in a total release of the flammable substance (Butane) from the single largest vessel (approximately 51,000 gallons [water capacity]) and the resulting vapor cloud explosion. The distance of the release and overpressure endpoint is determined by using U.S. EPA's RMP*Comp program.\n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nFor the 2015 RMP update, KMLT reported that no accidents had occurred during the previous five years. No accidents have occurred since the prior update was submitted.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Plan\n\n\n\nThe RMP regulations require that \"response actions have been coordinated with local emergency planning and response agencies\" (40 CFR 68.12(b)(3)).   Emergency response activities at the Argo Terminal are coordinated with the Cook County Central LEPC and Bedford Park Fire Department.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nSafety and Emergency Preparedness is a part of the facility's activities.
