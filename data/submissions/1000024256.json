Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nSNF FLOPAM Plaquemine Facility is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances and to protect people, property and the environment.\r\n  \r\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nOur facility's primary activities encompass the manufacture of Acrylamide.  We have two regulated substances above the RMP threshold quantity present at our facility.  These substances are Chlorine and Acrylonitrile.  Chlorine is used in the water treatment process.  Acrylonitrile is used for feedstock in the manufacture of Acrylamide. \r\n\r\n3. The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario.\r\n\r\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have acquired the services of Global Environmental Solutions Incorporated (GESI). The details of the chosen scenarios are located in the SNF EHS department files.\r\n\r\nWorst-Case Scenario Description\r\n\r\nSince there are no buildings in the immediate area around the Flopam facility and the terrain is generally flat and unobstructed, rural topography conditions were selected for the evaluation. \r\nThe worst-case release scenario for the toxic substance was assumed to be a catastrophic release from a railcar not connected to the process. Per the OCA Guidance, the worst-case scenario was assumed to be the release of the entire railcar quantity.  \r\nAcrylonitrile was evaluated as a toxic li"

      "SummaryText": "quid release. For the worst-case release scenario, the total quantity of the railcar was assumed to be instantaneously released into a pool. The release rate for acrylonitrile was assumed to be the rate of evaporation from the pool formed by the released liquid. Passive mitigation measures (e.g., dikes and buildings) were taken into account in determining the area of the pool and the release rate. Per U.S. EPA regulations, the evaporative rate of the release for acrylonitrile was determined assuming the pool of liquid was at 104\u00b0F and surroundings were at the selected ambient conditions (77\u00b0F).\r\nPer OCA Guidance, chlorine was evaluated as a toxic gas release. For the consequence analysis, a gaseous release of the total tank quantity was assumed to occur in 10 minutes.\r\nThe toxic endpoints are listed in the EPA OCA Guidance and in 40 CFR 68.22. These endpoints were chosen by EPA as the thresholds for serious injury from exposure to the toxic substances in the air.\r\n\r\nAlternate Release Scenario Descriptions\r\n \r\nToxic Substances\r\n\r\nThe alternate release scenario that was examined for acrylonitrile involved a release from the uncoupling or rupture of a hose during unloading operations. This scenario was identified as a probable event due to the frequency and, when compared to other operations, the higher likelihood for a release or spill to occur. To determine the release rate, the pumping rate of acrylonitrile was used since it is greater than the discharge rate. The release time from the hose or vessel was assumed to occur over a five minute period based on information provided by the facility. This response time considers that railcar unloading operations are closely supervised.\r\nThe release (evaporation) time was estimated to be less than 10 minutes since the unloading area drains into a covered containment area.\r\nThe alternate release scenario that was examined for chlorine involved a release due a faulty valve, leaking gasket, diaphragm, or packing nut, based on a"

The release time was assumed to occur over a thirty minute period based on guidance from literature for chlorine releases that require repair.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the accidental release prevention and process safety managements programs that are in place at our facility.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information (PSI)\r\n\r\nSNF Flopam Plaquemine maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\r\n\r\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is \"HAZOP\" and/or \"What If\".  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering, process operations, and environmental, health and safety, and will be revalidated at a regular interval of five years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner. Layer of Protection Analysis (LOPA) are also performed on critical nodes within the HazOp. A parameter of total node failure was added to the HazOps nodes to ensure the worst case was correctly identified.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\n\r\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, we maintain written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is reviewed annually and is readi"
