Included in our line of products is 2,4-D which has been used by farmers for weed control for over 40 years. Dimethylamine is used in the production of 2,4-D. We also produce a formulation of glyphosate. Glyphosate uses isopropylamine. Dimethylamine and isopropylamine are the only chemicals handled on this site that are included in the Risk Management Plan. We receive dimethylamine in railcars and tank trucks. We have a 15,000-gallon tank in our tankfarm in which we store dimethylamine as a 60% aqueous solution. We receive isopropylamine in railcars and have three 13,000-gallon storage tanks for 70% isopropylamine. Both chemicals are unloaded from railcars as anhydrous amines and are immediately diluted with water before storage.\n\nOur facility has had a very successful safety experience with no reportable incidents in the last 5 years. Albaugh, Inc. is committed to safety from the senior management level and throughout the company. Compliance with federal and state regulations is a priority. Several company safety programs are in place; Process Safety Management, Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasures Plan, Hazard Communication and Community Right-To-Know, Safety Committee, written emergency procedures, and employee training. Each new employee is given Right-To-Know training and is issued a copy of the safety rules. These programs combined with safe operating procedures, controls, and equipment contribute to the overall climate of safe working conditions.\n\nAlbaugh, Inc. plant is located on 32 acres of flat terrain in an industrial area of the community. We are located within the flood plain with a general slope from northeast to the southwest. Within the facility, a storm water drainage system manages water runoff. This system operates under an NPDES Permit issued by the Missouri Department of Natural Resources (MDNR) and required monitoring of the outflows from this system is done by mo"

There are several drainage systems that flow from the southeast to northwest across the facility, flowing in turn into a drainage system alongside the northwestern edge of the property. This system flows to the southwest and contains a containment basin with an emergency capacity of 40,000 gallons. The containment has a chamber where treatment chemicals or absorbent materials could be added in the event of a spill. A valve on the downstream side of the containment basin controls the flow through the basin. There are several valves upstream of the containment basin, and there is one valve downstream of the containment basin at the point where the drainage system leaves the property. After passing through the containment basin, surface water leaves the property at the western corner of the site and flows west to St. Joseph Light and Power where it surfaces. It continues to flow in a westerly direction, crosses a levee, and enters Brown?s Branch. Brown?s Branch flows northwest until it reaches the Missouri River. The area of the site that contains oil storage tanks is protected from the 100-year flood by a levee.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program:\nThe facility operates under OSHA Process Safety Management. Additionally, the facility operates under a Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasures Plan (SPCC Plan). This plan outlines procedures for plant operations pertaining to oil products and by extension all other liquid chemical products handled at this facility. This plan covers operations pertaining to transfer, loading, unloading, piping, storage, and containment of liquid chemical products. The amine unloading area is dedicated specifically for that use. The amine dilution process is conducted in a building with special design features to reduce the probability of a release and to mitigate the potential effects of any release.\n\nEmergency Response:\nFacility personnel do not respond to emergency situations.

The fire department annually receives the facility EPCRA report.\n\nAccident History:\nDimethylamine has been used at this facility since 1972 and there have been no explosions, fires, in that time associated with the dimethylamine process. There has been one release that is now included in the accident history that led to one employee injury on site. A small amount of dimethylamine mist and vapor was released and carried by a gust of wind into the employee's face and eyes. The exposure to the employee's eyes required minor medical treatment. Isopropylamine is a new chemical for this facility and there is no accident history associated with its use.\n\nPlanned Changes:\nWe plan to have evacuation drills at least annually. A RMP compliance audit was recently completed and the action items from that audit are being resolved."
