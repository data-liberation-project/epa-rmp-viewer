Many of our employees are members of their Local Emergency Planning Committees.  Our facilities have written emergency preparedness plans that are updated regularly.  \n\nAshland facilities typically host open houses every 3 to 5 years as an opportunity for neighbors to learn about our commitment to safety.  Ashland makes an effort to support our communities through sponsorship of local activities and participation on many local organizations.\n\nA description of your facility and the regulated substances handled:  \n\nThis facility provides high purity chemicals to the semi-conductor industry.  The regulated substances handled are anhydrous ammonia, hydrochloric acid and ammonium hydroxide.  \n\nFor more information, visit our web site at www.ashspec.com or contact the Plant Manager.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario:\n\nThe USEPA RMP regulations require the worst-case release scenario to assume that the entire contents of the largest vessel of a regulated substance in a process are released.  The USEPA requires that one worst-case scenario be reported to represent all regulated toxic substances held above the threshold quantity.  Ashland reported the worst-case scenario for the anhydrous ammonia."

      "SummaryText": "  Based on our analysis using USEPA-approved methods, the worst-case release scenario could potentially affect offsite receptors.  The administrative controls and mitigation measures considered in the analysis were a limitation of storage tank capacity to 85% and containment within a totally enclosed building.\n\nThe alternative-case release scenario:\n\nThe USEPA RMP regulations require an analysis of the alternative-case release scenario.  The alternative-case release scenario represents an accidental release that is more reasonable than the worst-case, but is still highly unlikely to occur.  The USEPA requires that the results of the alternative-case release scenario analysis be reported for each toxic present.  Based on our analysis using USEPA-approved methods, the alternative-case release scenarios for anhydrous ammonia, hydrochloric acid, and ammonium hydroxide would only impact offsite commercial and industrial receptors.  The administrative controls and mitigation measures considered in the analysis included:\n\n     Enclosure and limitation of tank capacity to 85% for the anhydrous ammonia storage tank;\n\n     Enclosure, diked containment, and limitation of tank capacity to 90% for the bulk ammonium hydroxide\n     storage tank; and\n\n     Enclosure of the drummed hydrochloric acid and ammonium hydroxide.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\nThis facility is operated in strict accordance with the USEPA prevention program requirements.  A written management system is in place with written operating and maintenance procedures for the covered processes.  Our management system procedures ensure rigorous training for operations employees, numerous management checks and balances, and strict attention to changes in the operations with a thorough review and examination of potential incidents that could lead to an accidental release.

This facility has emergency medical treatment information readily available for use in an emergency.  \n\nFive-year accident history:\n\nThis facility began operation in 1998.  In the last year, we have not had a release of anhydrous ammonia, hydrochloric acid or ammonium hydroxide that resulted in or could have resulted in an offsite impact from our facility.  \n\nThe emergency response program:\n\nOur employees are trained and equipped to respond and neutralize releases of hazardous materials. Our employees regularly undergo extensive training in emergency response actions and methods.  Our facilities regularly invite local fire departments and emergency responders to tour and inspect our plants, gain familiarity with our operations, and participate in joint emergency drills.  This facility has a written emergency response plan that is updated regularly.  \n\nPlanned changes to improve safety:\n\nOur facility continually evaluates and implements employee suggestions and recommendations resulting from routine hazard reviews and process hazard analyses.  We make changes to improve safety based on comments and information developed within our organization and the industry.  Toward continuous improvement, we are looking at ways to minimize risk through process improvement and re-design.
