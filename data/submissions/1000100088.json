      "SummaryText": "Palmer Logistics is located at 4505 Ameriport Parkway, Baytown, Texas. The stationary source is a third party warehouse that receives, stores and ships products owned by its customers.\n\nAccidental release prevention starts with all employees being certified to OSHA forklift operating standards, hazardous material handling and GHS (Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labeling Chemicals). Employees are also trained on the company's procedures, emergency response plan and safety. \n\nThe product is stored in a designated hazardous storage area equipped with one hour firewall, AFFF foam fire suppression system, sloped floors with a diking curb and powered ventilation with automatic cut-off controls. Additional site training will be held to implement the Risk Management Plan. Additional changes to improve safety will be implemented upon periodic  evaluation on the handling of the product. In the case of an accidental release of the regulated substance, the warehouse employees would not respond with cleanup efforts, but rather a third-party contracted cleanup team would be called in to respond to the release. The warehouse does have an emergency response plan, but since it does not cover employee response to the regulated substance, that section has been omitted from this plan. Forklifts are used to receive, store and ship the product. SDSs are kept on site, and no hazardous products are allowed into the warehouse without the proper SDS. \n\nRoutine cleaning, sanitization and maintenance is done by warehouse employees. Some maintenance is contracted to third parties. Hazard reviews are conducted weekly with more in-depth reviews done monthly. Under the guidance of this RMP, compliance audits will be carried out at least every three years to ensure compliance with the elements in this plan. The site operates by the 33 standard operating procedures established by the operating company."
