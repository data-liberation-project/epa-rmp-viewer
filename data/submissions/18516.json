We are commited ti the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental releasa should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire company, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the relese to people and the environment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The primary activity at the facility is the storage and transfering of anhydrous ammonia to our customers in a manner so they may use anhydrous ammonia in an effective manner. The maximum quantity stored at our facility is 184,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia in our 2 tanks.                                                     \n\nThe worst case release scenario would be the release of the largest storage tank as a gas, over 10 minutes.  The maximum quanity released would be 105000 pounds which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint is 2.22 miles.  The alternative release scenerio based on industry records and the most likely potentiol incident, is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint is .83 miles.\n\nWe are heavily regulated by DOT, OSHA, EPA, and The Kansas Department of Agriculture in the proper handling of anhydrous ammonia.  In addition we coordinate our safety efforts with our community emergency personnel.  This effort includes but is not limited to emergency action plan and annual chemical reporting of our inventories.  We are proud of all of the efforts our firm has made and our efforts will continue to make the ha"
