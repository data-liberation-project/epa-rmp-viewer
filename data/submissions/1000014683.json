The Peru Facility provides employees with access to PHAs and all other process safety management information.\n\nHOT WORK PERMIT\n\nThe Peru Facility employs a hot work permit program for hot work operations conducted on or near a covered process (hot work generally involves electric or gas welding, cutting, brazing or similar spark-producing operations). If hot work is to be performed near a covered process, the Peru Facility issues a permit that documents the fire prevention and protection requirements for the operation, the date authorized for hot work, and the object on which the work is performed. Hot work permits are to be kept on file until the work is complete.\n\nCONTRACTORS\n\nThe Peru Facility has developed procedures for selecting contractors that are competent and knowledgeable and can safely perform their work. The Peru facility provides information to them about the hazards that may be present in the work area and has developed safe work practices. The Peru Facility also evaluates the safety performance and programs of the contractors as a part of their continued employment.\n\n4. Five Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of Flammable Mixture that have resulted in deaths, injuries, significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage at or associated with the Peru facility within the last 5 years.\n\n5. Emergency Response Program.\n\nThe Peru Facility has a written emergency response program that contains procedures to be followed in the case of an accidental release of a regulated substance. These procedures include steps for informing the public, proper first aid and medical treatment, the proper use of emergency equipment and emergency response training. The emergency response plan is reviewed annually and updated as necessary. Likewise, the emergency response equipme"

Teams comprised of employees and/or consultants with appropriate knowledge of audit techniques, process safety and operating experience, conduct audits every three years to verify that the procedures and practices developed are adequate and being followed. The findings of the audit team are reviewed and appropriate corrective actions are implemented and tracked until resolved.\n\nINCIDENT INVESTIGATION\n\nThe Peru Facility investigates incidents that resulted in, or could reasonably have resulted in, a catastrophic release of covered chemicals. The investigation is to be promptly conducted, commencing within 48 hours of any incident. To perform the investigation, the Peru Facility has established an incident investigation team consisting of persons with the appropriate knowledge and experience to thoroughly investigate and analyze the incident. A report is prepared at the conclusion of the incident investigation that addresses the incident, the factors that contributed to it, and recommendations resulting from the incident investigation. The Peru Facility has established a system to promptly address and resolve the incident report findings and recommendations and to document their resolution. Finally, incident reports are to be reviewed with all affected personnel.\n\nEMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION\n\nThe Peru Facility has developed a written action plan for employee participation designed to cover all aspects of its process safety management program.

The Peru Facility maintains a working PSM program, which implements a series of steps designed to prevent potential hazards associated with the process and provide a well-trained work force. The PSM program further implements its policies with onsite procedures and manuals. The Peru Facility coordinates emergency response activities primarily with the City of Peru Fire Department. In addition, in an actual emergency, the City of LaSalle Fire Department, LaSalle County LEPC, and other sources of emergency response may be called on to provide mutual aid. The Peru Facility assists local officials in the development of emergency procedures to identify resources, chemicals, contacts and material safety data sheets for participating companies. Since its certification in November 1993, the Peru Facility has been a participant in the International Standards Organization (ISO) 9002 quality management program.\n\n2.Regulated Substances.\n\nThe Peru Facility manufactures polystyrene-based products consisting of one main process area where expandable polystyrene (EPS) is produced and a tank farm where the regulated substance is stored. The polymers are produced in a batch process. The Peru Facility has one RMP-regulated substance, Flammable Mixture (flammable liquid), at the facility. The Flammable Mixture is impregnated inside the polystyrene to cause the beads to expand when heated by the end user.\n\n3. General accidental release prevention program and chemical specific prevention steps.\n\nFollowing is a brief summary of the elements that the Peru Facility has implemented to comply with the accidental release prevention req"
