Propane storage is a covered chemical under the Risk Management Program regulations. No other chemical or substance stored or transferred at LPD is subject to Risk Management Program regulations.\n\n\n\n1.2    PURPOSE\n\nLPD is a transloading facility receiving material by barge, train and truck and shipping material out by barge and truck.  Examples of materials processed at LPD include grains, road salt, fertilizer and propane.  The propane is stored in two 60,000-gallon tanks in a liquid form. At full capacity, the tanks can store up to 444,000 pounds of propane. Since LPD will be storing more than 10,000 pounds of propane, it is subject to USEPA Risk Management Program regulations codified in 40 CFR Part 68.\n\n \n\nExhibit B presents the Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) for propane.\n\n\n\n1.3    RMP CERTIFICATION\n\nManagement certification of this RMP is provided at the beginning of this document. \n\n\n\nThe date of original RMP electronic submittal to EPA (i.e., RMP*eSubmit format)  Record and any EPA approval of this RMP shall be documented in Exhibit C of this RMP.\n\n\n\n1.4    LOCATION OF RMP\n\nOne complete hard copy of this RMP is maintained in the administration building at LPD. In addition, this RMP is also available electronically.  The electronic copy of the RMP will be the official copy of the RMP. \n\n\n\n1.5    PLAN REVIEW\n\nIn accordance with 40 CFR Part 68 regulations, the Risk Management Program regulations requires a comprehensive review and re-submission every five (5) years. This Plan will be "
