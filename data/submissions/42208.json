The employees at the Sanborn Terminal & Storage are committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes (especially those using hazardous substances) in a safe and responsible manner.  We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help provide for the safety of our employees and the public, as well as protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n\n\n* A description of our facility and use of substances required by EPA's RMP regulation and the processes involved\n\n* A summary of results from our assessment of the potential offsite consequences from accidental chemical releases\n\n* Emergency Response Programs\n\n* General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n* A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals at the Sanborn Terminal that are regulated by EPA?s RMP rule.  \n\n\n\nFacility Description\n\n\n\nThe Sanborn Terminal is a liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) pipeline and propane storage/loading facility.  The process is regulated by Federal OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119 and 40 CFR Part 68.  We have entered the facility as an RMP Program Level 3 facility.\n\n\n\nThe Sanborn Terminal has two pipelines that are routed through the facility and are regulated by the Department of Transportation.  These two pipelines are in part, a mix product line (natural gasoline, naphtha, normal butane, iso-butane and propane) and a dedicated propane line.  In addition, the facility receives propane from the pipeline to two 90,000 gallon capacity storage tanks and six 6"

This material is routed from these tanks to the truck transport loading docks for whole sale or to propane retailers.\n\n\n\nA small quantity of Ethyl Mercaptan is used to stench the propane at the truck transport docks.\n\n\n\nKey Offsite Consequence Analysis Scenarios\n\n\n\nThe EPA's RMP rule requires that we provide information about the worst-case scenarios(s) and alternative release scenario(s) for our facility.  The following are brief summaries of these scenarios, including information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the exposure distances for each scenario.\n\n\n\nWorst Case Release Scenario ? Regulated Toxic Chemical\n\n\n\nAt the present time there are no regulated toxic chemicals to report for the Sanborn Terminal.\n\n\n\nAlternate Release Scenario(s) ? Regulated Toxic Chemical\n\n\n\nAt the present time there are no regulated toxic chemicals to report for the Sanborn Terminal.\n\n\n\nWorse Case Scenario ? Regulated Flammable Chemicals\n\n\n\nThis simulation involves the rupture or failure of the propane storage tanks resulting in a simulated vapor cloud explosion.  Inventory from all eight tanks are simulated due to the proximity of the tanks relative to mitigation to the simulation.  This scenario would not be mitigated due to the type of scenario model"

The quantity and endpoint of the simulation and the specifics of the simulation are available in the specified reporting of the Risk Management Plan\n\n\n\nAlternate Case Scenario ? Regulated Flammable Chemicals\n\n\n\nThe alternate release scenario is a simulated rupture of the supply pipe to the loading docks resulting in a ten minute release and simulated vapor cloud explosion.  This scenario assumed the pump continued to operate at a rate of approximately 500 gallons per minutes (gpm) for 10 minutes after the line break.  The simulation calculated that 30,500 pounds of material were released in the assumed time frame.  Mitigation measures were taken into account when selecting the alternative release scenario.  This consisted of reviewing the use of relief valves, check valves, manual shutoff valves, automatic shutoffs, startup and operating procedures, grounding equipment, and excess flow devices.  This scenario would be mitigated due to the type of scenario modeled.  Activation of the Emergency Shutdown Devices would isolate the source of the material and secure the facility.  All emergency response and early warning to the employees and the community would be exercised immediately if this were to occur.  The quantity and endpoint of the simulation is contained in the data elements.\n\n\n\nWe are using this information to help us ensure that our emergency response plan and the community emergency response plan address all reasonable contingency cases.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\n\nEnterprise maintains an integrated contingency plan, which consolidates all of the various federal, state, and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning and reporting.

The 9-1-1 system is used to notify the O?Brien County Sheriff?s Department and local Fire Departments.  Remote activation can also be accomplished from Houston Control which has area video cameras with dial up access.  In addition, there are local gas detection systems that alarm locally and in Houston Control.  If these detectors annunciate, the facility can be shutdown remotely from Houston Control or locally by Operation.  A third party contractor, 3E is under contract to effectively contact the necessary agencies if required.  \n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nEnterprise Products takes a systematic, protective approach to preventing accidental release of hazardous chemicals.  The Process Safety Management systems address each of the key features of successful prevention program, including:\n\n\n\n* Process safety information\n\n* Process hazard analysis\n\n* Operating procedures\n\n* Training\n\n* Mechanical integrity\n\n* Management of change\n\n* Pre-Startup Safety Review - \"PSSR\"\n\n* Compliance audits\n\n* Incident investigation\n\n* Employee participation\n\n* Hot work permit\n\n* Contractors\n\n\n\nAs a part of the prevention efforts, there are a multitude of programs in which Enterprise employees participate.

If something out of the ordinary is found, it is reported to management in order to expediently resolve any problems.\n\n\n\nThe engineering and administrative controls in place have been established to reduce the risk of an accidental release of identified hazards.  For example, if the gas detection system is activated, a system annunciation is sounded in Houston Control and at the local facility.
