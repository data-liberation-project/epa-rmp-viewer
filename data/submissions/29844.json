              "Description": "Airgas Specialty Gases is an industrial gas distribution facility.  This facility best fits with NAICS Code 42269.  Our safety information was last reviewed on September 21, 2002.  We are subject to the handling codes of the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA), State Fire Codes, Texas Railroad Commission Regulations, American National Standards Institute, and applicable OSHA Regulations.  These standards have been implemented through written manuals and/or procedures.  The most recent hazard review was conducted for this facility on September 21, 2002.  To prevent/limit releases, this facility uses vents, relief valves, check valves, manual shutoffs, automatic shutoffs, grounding equipment and an excess flow valve.  Operating and training procedures were also last reviewed on September 21, 2002.  The employees at Airgas Specialty Gases are trained on-the-job with demonstration and observation competency testing.  Maintenance procedures were last reviewed on April 28, 1999.  Airgas Specialty Gases utilizes outside contractors to conduct any required manual maintenance on theie processes.  The contractors knowledge of these systems, as well as the safeguards they utilize during maintenance help in the overall prevention of releases for the ethylene system.  This is a repackaging system, so the standard operating procedures and maintenance chacks on the system are the main focus of the prevention program. \n\nThere has been a release of hazardous materials from this location in the past 5 years.  This release involved two products (ethane, and methane).  This release was due to an equipment failure.   Airgas has not repackaged either of these two products since.  They expect to repackage these two products in the future, yet below levels for RMP and PSM.  This release helped trigger an investigation into the safety aspects associated with the ethylene and mehtyl chloride systems.  The release (fire) occured on February 25, 1999, and there were no offsite impacts.\n\nEmployees who are trained in the proper operating procedures of the ethylene repackaging system are knowledgeabel in the Standard Operating procedures of the system, as well as the SOPs for the filling of compressed gas cylinders.  These procedures are followed to help in the prevention of releases of ethylene into the atmosphere.  Maintenance procedures are also conducted (though limited) for the ethylene system.  These maintenance procedures involve visual inspections prior to filling cylinders with the ethylene.  If any part of the system is in need of repair, the maintenance is conducted by an outside contractor (WesMor Cryogenic Services Inc.) who is knowledgeable with the ethylene system.  The contractor can utilize the O&M manual for information regarding valve types, piping, tubing, etc. to help maintain the mechanical integrity of the system.  This manual is located in the Plant Manager's office.\n\nAirgas Specialty Gases contracted Environemtnal Data Services, which triggered a review of the safety information. operating and maintenance procedures and training.  Airgas is a Level 3 Prevention Program, and is implementing Process Safety Management for their prevention program.",

We are subject to the handling codes of the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA), State Fire Codes, Texas Railroad Commission Regulations, American National Standards Institute, and applicable OSHA Regulations.  These standards have been implemented through written manuals and/or procedures.  The most recent hazard review was conducted for this facility on September 21, 2002.  To prevent/limit releases, this facility uses vents, relief valves, check valves, manual shutoffs, automatic shutoffs, grounding equipment and an excess flow valve.  Operating and training procedures were also last reviewed on September 21, 2002.  The employees at Airgas Specialty Gases are trained on-the-job with demonstration and observation competency testing.  Maintenance procedures were last reviewed on September 21, 2002.  Airgas Specialty Gases utilizes outside contractors to conduct any required manual maintenance on their processes.  The contractors knowledge of these systems, as well as the safeguards they utilize during maintenance help in the overall prevention of releases for the ethylene system.  This is a repackaging system, so the standard operating procedures and maintenance checks on the system are the main focus of the prevention program. \n\nThere has been a release of hazardous materials from this location in the past 5 years.  This release involved two products (ethane, and methane).  This release was due to an equipment failure.  Airgas has not repackaged either of these two products since.  They expect to repackage these two products in the future, yet below levels for RMP and PSM.  This release helped trigger an investigation into the safety aspects associated with the ethylene and mehtyl chloride systems.  The release (fire) occured on February 25, 1999, and there were no offsite impacts.\n\nEmployees who are trained in the proper operating procedures of the methyl chloride repackaging system are knowledgeabel in the Standard Operating procedures of the system, as well as the SOPs for the filling of low pressure gas cylinders.  These procedures are followed to help in the prevention of releases of methyl chloride into the atmosphere.  Maintenance procedures are also conducted (though limited) for the mehtyl chloride system.  These maintenance procedures involve visual inspections prior to filling cylinders with the methyl chloride.  If any part of the system is in need of repair, the maintenance is conducted by an outside contractor (Jack B Kelly) who is knowledgeable with the methyl chloride, as well as other compressed gas tractor trailer systems.  The trailer that is leased by Airgas is serviced and maintained by Enterprise.   The contractor can utilize the O&M manual for information regarding valve types, piping, tubing, etc. to help maintain the mechanical integrity of the methyl chloride system.    The contractor can utilize the O&M manual for information regarding valve types, piping, tubing, etc. to help maintain the mechanical integrity of the system.  This manual is located in the Plant Manager's office, although since they own the same model trailer, they can utilize their own manual.\n\nAirgas Specialty Gases contracted Environemtnal Data Services, which triggered a review of the safety information. operating and maintenance procedures and training.  Airgas is a Level 3 Prevention Program, and is implementing Process Safety Management for their prevention program.",

              "Description": "Airgas Sepcialty Gases is an industrial gas distribution facility.  This facility best fits with AAICS Code 42269.  Our safety information was last reviewed in February 3, 2004.  We are subject to the handling codes of the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA), Stae Fire Codes, Texas Railroad Commission Regulations, American national Standards Institute, and applicable OSHA Regulations.  These standards have been implemented through written manuals and/or procedures.  The most recent hazard review was conducted for this facility in February 3, 2004.  To prevent/limit releases, this facility uses vents, relief valves, check valves, manual shutoffs, automatic shutoffs, grounding equipment and an excess flow valve.  Operating and training procedures were also last reviewed in February 3, 2004.  The employees at Airgas Specialty Gases are trained on-the-job with demonstration and observation competency testing.  Maintenance procedures were last reviewed in February 3, 2004.  Airgas Specialty Gases utilizes outside contractors to conduct any required manual maintenance on their processes.  The contractors knowledge of these systems, as well as the safeguards they utilize during maintenance help in the overall prevention of releases for the Ethyl chloride System.  This is a repackaging system, so the standard operating procedures and maintenance checks on the system are the main focus of the prevention program.                                                                                                              There has been a release of hazardous materials from this location in the past 5 years.  This release involved two products (ethane and methane).  This release was due to an equipment failure.  Airgas has repacked methane since.  They expect to repackage these two products in the future.  This release helped trigger an investigation into the safety aspects associated with the ethylene and methyl chloride systems.  The release (fire) occured on February 25, 1999, and there were no offsite impacts.                                                                                                               Employees who are trained in the proper operating procedures of the Ethyl chloride repackaging system are knowledgeable in the Standard Operating procedures of the system, as well as the SOPs for the filling of low pressure gas cylinders.  These procedures are followed to help in the prevention of releases of Ethyl chloride into the atmosphere.  Maintenance procedures are also conducted (though limited) for the Ethyl chloride system.  These maintenance procedures also involve visual inspections prior to filling the cylinders with the Ethyl chloride.  If any part of the system is in need of repair, the maintenance is conducted by an outside contractor (Jack B. Kelly) who is knowledgeable with the Ethyl chloride, as well as other compressed gas tractor trailer systems.  The trailer that is leased by Airgas is serviced and maintained by Enterprise.  The contractor can utilize the O&M manual for information regarding valve types, piping, tubing, etc. to help maintain the mechanical integrity of the Ethyl chloride system.  The contractor can utilize the O&M manual for information regarding valve types, piping, tubing, etc. to help maintain the mechanical integrity of the system.  This manual is located in the Plant Manager's office, although since they own the same model trailer, they can utilize their own manual.                                                                                                             Aigas Specialty Gases contacted Environmental Data Services, which triggered a review of the safety information, operating and maintenance procedures, and training.  Airgas is a Level 3 Prevention Program, and is implementing Process Safety management for their prevention program.",

      "SummaryText": "In this industrial gas distribution facility, (Airgas Specialty Gases), we handle several different types of gases.  Most of these gases are repackaged from storage vessels into tube trailers, and/or smaller cylinders.  There are four products at this location which fall under the risk management plan requirements.  These products are methyl chloride, methane, ethylene, and ethyl chloride.  The toxic and flammable characteristics of these products makes it necessary to observe certain precautions when handling these products.  These products are three different process, yet the safe prevention practices are similar in nature.  Overall, the prevention of unnecessary human exposures, reducing the threat to our own personal health as well as our co-workers, and reducing the threat to nearby members of the community is the main goal of incorporating this Risk Management Plan into our daily operations.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal and state rulesand regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle and repackage ethylene, methane, methyl chloride, ethyl chloride, combined in coordination with the operations and maintenance procedures provided to all personnel responsible for the use of these systems.\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is to store, repackage, and distribute industrial gases to the customer.  Methyl chloride and Ethyl chloride are received by tractor trailer truck.  The stroage vessels are located on the trailer itself, and the methyl chloride and ethyl chloride are repackaged directly off the trailer into low pressure cylinders.  Ethylene is recieved by truck as well, yet it is stored in a vessel on site.  The ethylene is repackaged from the storage vessel into tube trailers, and small cylinders.  Methane is received by a tractor trailer truck as well.  The storage vessel is located on the trailer, and the methane is repackaged directly off the trailer into low pressure cylinders.

The maximum amount of ethylene that can be stored on-site is 80,000 pounds.  The maximun amount of methane which can be stored in a trailer on site is 25,000 pounds.\n\nEmployees conduct proper start-up procedures for these processes.  The methyl chloride system must start with the proper setting and securing of the methyl chloride trailer utilizing wheel chocks, warning signs, and grounding equipment.  Once this accomplished, they can hook-up all items necessary to off-load the methyl chloride, and repackage it directly into low pressure cylinders.  Visual cylinder checks including but not limited to tare weight, ownership stamp, valve threadings, etc. are inspected prior to filling cylinders.  These written procedures are followed each time cylinders are filled.  Employees also have start-up procedures which they follow for starting the ethylene system.  Visual inspections are similar to that of the mehtyl chloride system, except for the cylinders are high pressure cylinders.  These cylinders go through a hammer test, which means the cylinders are tapped slightly with a hammer.  If there is a high ringing sound the cylinders should be in good shape.  If the sound is dull or muffled, the cylinders could have internal corrosion, or may have liquid in them.  These cylinders are not filled until they are properly inspected, and/or have the contents evacuated.  Employees conducted limited maintenance on these systems.  Maintenance, if deemed necessary, is contratcted out to qualified companies who have trained personnel to utilize in the proper maintnenace of these systems.

They also have a Lock-out/Tag-out program, Hazard Communication Program, Confined Space Program (if ever needed), and an Emergency Action Plan to aid in the prevention of accidental releases for this facility.\n\nThe emergency response (action) program was developed with the assistance of Environmental Data Services, Inc., the Houston LEPC (Joe Leonard, Jr.), and the Houston Fire Department.  If a release were to occur at this location, employees would be notified of the release.  Plant Manager (Victor Martinez) will get personnel organized for an emergency action and possible evacuation.  If the operator of the system in question tried to mitigate the release using manual valves, the emergency electrical shutoff switch will be utilized to turn off all electricity to the pumps and components of the plant to prevent any further operation of pumping equipment.  If the release cannot be stopped, notfication to the Houston Fire Department via 911 call will be made.  The Houston Fire Department will respond to a release at this location, and are trained in HazMat operations.  This 911 call will also notify the Houston LEPC so that notification, and if needed, evacuation of the affected area can begin.\n\nThis facility has flammable and a toxic worst case scenario.  The worst case scenarion for a toxic release would be the failure of the tractor trailer vessel storing methyl chloride.

The transfer hoses at this location are high pressure stainless steel.  Over time, the hoses begin to get crimps, which could lead to a small hole in the transfer hose.  If this were to happen with the methyl chloride, an estimated release rate would be approximately 1 pound per minute for 10 minutes.  This 10 pound release would have a toxic distance to endpoint for 0.82 mg/l of less than 0.06 miles.  Within this small area, there would be approximately 35 persons affected.
