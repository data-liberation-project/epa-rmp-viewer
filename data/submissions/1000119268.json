The document summarizes our approach to chemical safety, the prevention of accidental releases, emergency response measures, and our commitment to maintaining a safe and compliant operation.\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\nAt Fry Foods, safety is a top priority. Our policies, backed by senior management commitment, emphasize the implementation of rigorous safety protocols to prevent accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia and ensure a rapid, effective response in the event of an emergency. The facility follows a structured risk management process that includes regular safety audits, continuous employee training, and adherence to relevant regulations, such as the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard and EPA\u0092s Risk Management Plan requirements. We are committed to creating a safe working environment through effective safety management practices, equipment maintenance, and emergency preparedness.\nFacility and Regulated Substances Handled:\nFry Foods is a food manufacturing facility specializing in the production of frozen appetizers. Our facility uses anhydrous ammonia (NH?) as the primary refrigerant in our refrigeration systems, a critical component in maintaining the quality and safety of our products. The facility handles and stores approximately 27694 pounds of anhydrous ammonia divided into north and south systems. The north system contains 18,288 lbs. and the south system contains 9406 lbs. The process involves continuous monitoring and control of ammonia levels to prevent accidents and ensure safe operation at all times.\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:\nOur accidental release prevention program is"

Fry Foods complies with federal regulations, including the EPA\u0092s Risk Management Plan (RMP) Rule and the OSHA PSM Standard, which provide a framework for managing chemical hazards. We are currently implementing a combination of technological measures (automated leak detection, automated emergency ventilation and sensors around the facility) and procedural measures (regular maintenance, inspections, and safety training for employees). Additionally, our facility conducts periodic safety audits to identify and address potential risks proactively.\nFive-Year Accident History:\nOver the past five years, Fry Foods has maintained a strong safety record. There have been one significant accidental release of ammonia, there were no on site or off-site injuries or environmental impacts that occurred. There was a release of 274.4 lbs. of ammonia all contained inside a frozen storage freezer and the facility was evacuated while our refrigeration contractors arrived (Kemper Northwest) to resolve the leak. We continue to monitor and evaluate our processes to ensure that any potential risks are minimized, and we are dedicated to maintaining our record of safety and compliance.\nEmergency Response Program:\nOur emergency response program is a critical component of our safety strategy. Fry Foods coordinates with local emergency responders, including fire and police departments, to ensure a quick and coordinated response in the event of an ammonia release, Fry Foods is not a responding facility. Public notification systems are in place to inform nearby residents if an incident occurs, ensuring that the community is aware of any potential hazards.\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\nFry Foods is committed to continuous improvement in safety practices. We are currently planning the installation of additional safety features, such as advanced ammonia detection systems and impr"
