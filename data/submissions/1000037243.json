      "SummaryText": "1.0    Executive Summary\n\nDPT Laboratories Inc. (DPT) is an Aerosol Packaging Facility (APF) that stores and uses flammable mixtures that contain propane, butane and isobutane for their aerosol packaging process of finished drug products.  Since the Facility has more than 10,000 pounds of flammable substances in a single process, it is required to submit a Risk Management Plan (RMP) and comply with the requirements of 40 CFR 68. \n\n\n\n1.1    Facility Description and Regulated Substances\n\nDPT is located at 5303 Distribution Drive, San Antonio, Texas and employs approximately 31 staff.  It uses regulated flammable substances in mixtures for packaging aerosol spray cans containing finished drug products. The propellant consists of three main components in varying amounts and concentrations: propane, butane and isobutane.  The mixtures are stored in vessels located outdoors within a locked, fenced area. The storage vessels consist of a 9,200 gallon tank and up to 60 (maximum) portable LPG cylinders, ranging from 50 - 120 gallons each. The facility can store a maximum of 73,000 lbs at any given time. \n\n\n\nThe flammable mixture in the 9,200 gallon tank is composed of 47.90% (wt%) propane, 31.47% (wt%) butane and 20.63% (wt%) isobutane.   The flammable mixture is brought on-site by trucks and is unloaded into the tank.  The tank is administratively controlled to be filled no more than 90% of full capacity, such that the maximum quantity of the mixture stored in the tank is 38,000 lbs.   The flammable mixture is then hard-piped from the tank to the Gas House where it is dispensed into aerosol cans. \n\n\n\nThere is also a maximum of 60 portable LPG cylinders, each containing varying compositions of propane, butane and isobutane, stored within the same fenced area as the 9,200 gallon tank.  The portable LPG cylinders are delivered to the facility via truck.  \n\n\n\n1.2    Accident Release Prevention Program \n\nThe facility has a prevention program that is in compliance with the EPA Risk Managem"

      "SummaryText": "ent regulation (40 CFR 68), the OSHA Process Safety Management standard (29 CFR 1910.119), NFPA-58 and applicable state codes and regulations.  This prevention program is in place to assure on-going safety and compliance. \n\n\n\nDPT maintains up to date Process Safety Information that includes information such as chemical hazards, safe operating limits, safety systems and details on process equipment.  Process Hazard Analyses have been conducted on the process to identify hazards and recommend safeguards that will prevent an accidental release. Recommendations resulting from the process hazard analyses are implemented or otherwise addressed to ensure safety is continually improved. DPT has established written Operating Procedures that provide clear instructions for safely conducting activities in the covered process. The DPT personnel Training program includes emergency response plans, safety and health hazards, applicable safe work practices and facility processes. Mechanical Integrity procedures have been written to maintain the integrity of the process equipment.  These procedures outline the frequency, schedule and inspection and maintenance requirements for the process equipment. Equipment inspections, tests, and servicing are scheduled and routinely performed in order to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release caused by equipment failure. DPT has Management of Change (MOC) and Pre-Startup Review programs in place to manage changes to the process.  The MOC program is used to assure that changes to facility equipment, procedures or processes do not cause accidents.  The pre-startup review program requires that significant process changes be reviewed to ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and verify that existing controls have not been compromised. The facility completes a Compliance Audit at least every three years.  Recommendations resulting from these audits are implemented or otherwise addressed to ensure safety is continu"

      "SummaryText": "ally improved. DPT has a comprehensive Incident Investigation program in place.  Incidents that cause, or could have caused, a release are investigated and recommendations are made to prevent recurrence. DPT accomplishes successful Employee Participation by providing each employee with RMP/PSM program awareness training and encouraging employees to participate in all facets of process safety and accident prevention at the facility. DPT's Hot Work Permit policy ensures safety measures are taken for welding or other hot work performed on-site.  Hot work is planned to occur in an area away from the flammable substance storage tanks. DPT has implemented a Contractor safety program that includes procedures to hire, use and evaluate contractors who accomplish the desired job tasks without compromising the safety and health of facility or contract employees.  \n\n\n\n1.3    Emergency Response Policy\n\nDPT has an Emergency Action Plan (EAP), in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.38(a), that provides specific procedures for a release and shall be implemented in the event of a release.  It is DPT policy that personnel will comply with all applicable regulations and laws to prevent accidental releases.  To help maintain an effective EAP, DPT has established relationships with the local emergency responders including the San Antonio Fire Department.  \n\n\n\n1.5 Five-Year Accident History\n\nThe DPT Aerosol Packaging Facility has not had an RMP reportable accident in the last five years as defined by 40 CFR 68. \n\n\n\n1.7 Planned Safety Improvements\n\nIn 2013, DPT added pipe insulation around the vapor and liquid lines carrying the flammable mixture from the 9,200 gallon storage tank to the aerosol packaging area. This insulation will help protect the pipes from external damage, thus reducing the potential for release. \n\n"
