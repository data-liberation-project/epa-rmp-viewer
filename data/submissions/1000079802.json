The Land Treatment Facility has not had any chlorine accidents or incidents in the last five-year period.  If an incident were to occur, the City of Jacksonville Land Treatment Site is a non-responding facility.  Employees are trained to call the Fire Department at (910)455-0122 in the case of a chlorine incident. Signs are posted in multiple locations as a reminder.  The covered process is included in the Onslow County Local Emergency Planning Committee's response plan. The local fire departments (Southwest Volunteer Fire Department and the City of Jacksonville's Fire Department) are familiar with the covered process.  In the case of an emergency, the HAZMAT Team from the City of Jacksonville's Fire Department will respond.\r\n\r\nAs part of the RMP, meetings are held every quarter to discuss safety concerns, topics and standard operating procedures.  As a result, RMP operating procedures are reviewed and updated annually.  The discussions include all levels of personnel including managers, supervisors and general staff.  Safety training is provided throughout the year on various topics.  During the last year, the facility staff received training on topics including HAZMAT Response training provided by the City Fire Department (February 2018), Chlorine Safety for Water and Wastewater Operators provided by Jones Chemical Inc. (April 2018) and Stop the Bleed by the US Navy (August 2018).  In addition, all City staff members receive monthly training on safety topics such as PPE, Hazard Communications and Site Security.  CPR and emergency training are scheduled for 2019.  \r\n\r\nThe City of Jacksonville's Risk Management Plan was developed in accordance with the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments.

The process falls under the Program 3 eligibility requirements as it does not meet the requirements of Program 1 and is subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard.\r\n\r\nThe safety of City employees and local residents is protected in several ways.  First, the building itself acts as buffer for the surrounding atmosphere.  Second, the chlorine delivery system is a vacuum process.  This process has proven to greatly reduce chlorine leaks by reducing the amount of equipment that is exposed to pressurized chlorine.  Each chlorine cylinder has an emergency cutoff valve that is triggered by the chlorine gas detector.  In addition to the mitigation provided by the building and appurtenances within, there is a scrubber designed to minimize the effects of an accidental release of chlorine gas.  The emergency vapor scrubber system is a 'once-through three stage chemical absorption system, consisting of three horizontal crossflow packed bed sections.  The scrubber absorber is located on top of the caustic storage tank, which is an integral part of the system.  The recirculation pump drains caustic solution from the bottom of the caustic storage tank and circulates it through the three stages.  Each header has chemical distribution nozzles, which distribute caustic solution over the packing media. As the chlorine-laden gas passes through each of the three stages, chlorine is absorbed and reacts with the caustic solution and chlorine-free air is exhausted through the stack. A mist eliminator is placed at the end of the third stage to remove any residual liquid prior to the discharge of gas.  Multiple monitoring devices are used to notify personnel if a chlorine related incident were to occur.  The building interior has a sensor that detects the chlorine level in the air.  The level is accessible and monitored 24 hours a day via SCADA.  SCADA will also notify personnel in the event of chlorine detection, power failure, change to generator power and scrubber"

Young seedlings are planted to repeat the cycle.  \r\n\r\nChlorine (CAS#7782-50-5, SIC #4952) is added to disinfect wastewater prior to irrigation to protect the health of City personnel, contractors and others who may enter the spray fields.   Chlorine is delivered to the plant in one-ton cylinders, which remain on site until emptied. The chlorine gas flows from one set of four cylinders to a vacuum regulator and then to the chlorinator, which regulates the flow of chlorine (measured in lbs/day) to the point of application.  A chlorine solution rather than gaseous chlorine is applied at the point of application. The solution is created in an injector downstream of the chlorinator, where treated wastewater from the effluent main mixes with and dissolves the chlorine. The water flow through the injector creates a vacuum to draw the chlorine from the chlorinator.  The maximum intended chlorine inventory on site is 24,999 lbs. This is stored in one-ton cylinders and 150-pound cylinders. The cylinders are stored inside the chlorine feed system building which provides an acceptable environment for use and storage\r\n\r\nSection 112r of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendment requires that a site with a listed hazardous substance above a stated threshold quantity must develop a Risk Management Plan (RMP).

The physical location of the facility is 716 Firetower Road, located east of Jacksonville, North Carolina.  Section 112r of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendment requires that a site with a listed hazardous substance above a stated threshold quantity must develop a Risk Management Plan (RMP).  Chlorine (CAS#7782-50-5, SIC #4952) is the only listed hazardous substance at the facility. \r\n\r\nThe Land Treatment Facility is responsible for the treatment and land application of the City of Jacksonville's wastewater.  The system is designed to treat up to 9.0 million gallons of wastewater daily and spray irrigates 2,300 acres of pine forest.  Wastewater is transported 8 miles from Jacksonville to the facility by a 36-inch diameter force main.  First, the wastewater is treated with hydrogen peroxide for the removal of odors before flowing into the headworks facility.  At the headwork facility, the influent (raw wastewater) passes through a Huber Step Screen where material greater than 1/8 inch in size is removed.  The wastewater then flows into an aerated grit and grease removal system where inorganic material and floating materials are removed.  Wastewater then flows into a series of aerated lagoons where biological treatment of the waste occurs.  Secondary treated wastewater then flows into storage lagoons.  The storage lagoons have a capacity of 690 million gallons and provide storage of treated wastewater during periods of inclement weather and when spray irrigation of wastewater is not feasible.  The treated wastewater is chlorinated to eliminate harmful pathogens.  Then, the treated wastewater is used to irrigate 2,300 acres of pine forest on the property.
