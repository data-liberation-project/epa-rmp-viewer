THE FACILITY POLICY:  The owners, managment, and employees of Tri-Ag Inc. are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia by utilization of proper equipment, regular inspections and maintenance and training of all persons that work with the material.  Should an accidental release occur, the facility has oriented tha local fir department and the local emergency planning committee so they can paln for response to any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and enviroment.\n\n2.  FACILITY INFORMATION:   The primary activity at the facility is the storage or sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.  The maximum quanity stored would be 200,000 pounds in the facilities 4 tanks.  The capacities of each of these tanks are     1.)  90,000 # , 2.)  27,000 #, 3.) 27,000 #, 4.) 27,000 #.\n\n3.  THE WORST-CASE SCENARIO  would be the release of the total contnets of the storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes. The maximum quanity released would be 90,000 #, which represnts the volume of the storage tanks at 85 % capacity as limited bu design standards and company procedures.  The distance to the endpoint of dispersion  based on the model is .98 miles.\nTHE ALTERNATIVE-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO is assumed to be a release from the rupture of a 1 inch transfer hose, with 2901 pounds released over 2 minutess.  the distance to the endpoint of dispersion is .31 miles.\n\nTHE ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PROGRAM:  The facility complies with the Rules and Regulations relating to the Handling of Anhydrous and Low Pressure Nitrogen  Solutions, Equipment, Containers and Storage Facilites.  These regulations administered by the Illinois Department of Agriculture are consistent with ANSI K I61.1 and OSHA29 CFR1910.111 regarding storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.\n\n5. THE FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:  There have been no accidental  releases of anhydrous ammonia for"

THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:    The facility has a written emergency action plan in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38  and provide state and local  authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title lll of EPCRA.  Our emergency response action plan has bee reviewed with the local fire department and provided to the local emergency planning committee for coordination in the community response planning.\n\n7.  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:  Safety improvements  is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe practices and operations.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
