They look to us for excellent value, dependable delivery, consistent formulas and hands-on service. Since our inception in 1971, our simple goal has been to be the most reliable and responsive company in our industry.  The CSM Bakery Products management is not only committed to offering superior service, but also to maintaining a safety and environmental program to promote a safe environment for all its employees and the surround communities.  CSM Bakery Products' safety and environmental policies are administered by the Plant Director with the assistance of the Production Manager and the Safety & Training Supervisor, who oversees the entire safety and environmental programs, including the PSM/RMP/CalARP Program for the anhydrous ammonia systems.\n\n\n\nCSM Bakery Products employees conduct ongoing inspections, testing, and replacement of the critical items in the ammonia refrigeration systems and the aqueous ammonia system.  The ammonia refrigeration systems are inspected daily by the Maintenance Mechanics.  A record of the maintenance or work performed on the systems is maintained onsite.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\n\nThe CSM Bakery Products facility is located at 2111 West Valley Blvd. in Colton, California.  The facility is located approximately 0.1 mile north of the Interstate 10 and approximately 3.1 miles west of Highway 215.  The area immediately surrounding the facility is primarily urban with light commercial and residential areas.  \n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration processes are used for the chilling and storage of a variety of food products in their processing area and cold storage warehouse.  The refrigeration process, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, then back to high pressur"

For example, lowering the ammonia pressure lowers its temperature.  Low pressure (cold) liquid ammonia provides refrigeration by removing ambient heat.  Removal of ambient heat causes the liquid ammonia (contained within the system) to vaporize.  Heat is later removed from the ammonia as it is condensed back into a liquid.  Typical operating conditions for System 1 range from 8.7\" Hg on the low pressure side of the system to 180 psig on the high side.  Typical operating conditions for System 2 range from 11\" Hg on the low pressure side of the system to 180 psig on the high side.\n\n\n\nAmmonia is used as the refrigerant in two separate and independent refrigeration processes.  The ammonia inventory in the original system is 19,100 pounds, while the second system (July 2001) contains an ammonia inventory of 22,500 pounds. \n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nA prevention program is in place to minimize the risk of hazardous chemical releases in accordance with the California Occupational Safety and Health Administration (CalOSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (Section 5189 of Title 8, CCR), the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP), and the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program.  This prevention program covers those processes that handle anhydrous ammonia above the threshold quantity.\n\n\n\nAmmonia Refrigeration System\n\n\n\nThe facility operates in accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines and standards including the following:\n\n\n\n- IIAR Bulletin 107, \"Suggested Safety and Operating Procedures When Making Ammonia Refrigeration Tie-ins\"\n\n- IIAR Bulletin 109, \"Minimum Safety Criteria for a Safe Ammonia Refrigeration System\"\n\n- IIAR Bulletin 110, \"Startup, Inspection, and Maintenance of Am"

There are also ammonia detectors located throughout the facility.  There are sensors within Machine Room 1's Freezers, Cooler Dock, Processing Area, and Cooler Room which will alarm at 25 ppm.  The visual and audible alarms are activated at the Freezer Room entrance and a signal is sent to the central computer and is logged within alarm history and calls ADT.  ADT then calls the fire department and facility personnel on the contact list.  An initial shutdown occurs at 125 ppm which does the following: (1) Evaporator fans turn off and (2) Evaporator liquid supply and hot gas valves are closed.  There are also ammonia sensors within the Machine Room 1.  At 25 ppm, the audible and visual alarms are activated inside the Machine Room and a signal is sent to an auto dialer to alert ADT as well as facility's operators.  ADT is instructed to call the fire dpartment.  At 125 ppm, the following actions take place: (1) Shut down of solenoid valves in order to isolate the ammonia and (2) the emergency ventilation fan is turned on.  A final shutdown occurs at 10,000 ppm which de-energizes all of the equipment in the Machine Room including the compressors.

If a release were to occur, managers or operators can activate this prevention measure.  \n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nAn investigation into the facility's accident history showed that there was one release of anhydrous ammonia that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 100 pounds over the past five years (July 2006 to July 2011).  On August 25, 2008, there was an ammonia release through a relief valve located on the roof at 216 psig and the discharge temperature was 178F for 90 minutes.  Approximately 1,413 pounds of anhydrous ammonia was released into the diffusion tank.  This was due to the burn out of the condenser fan which caused the cooling system to fail and ammonia pressure to rise.  Also, the evaporative condenser spray nozzles and filters were clogged and dirty which inhibited the ventilation system.  The water spray nozzles/distributors are not functioning as designed; therefore, the water is not being distributed in a uniform pattern over the coils.  Another contributing factor was that the pressure relief valve activated below the setpoint of 250 psig.  In addition, the emergency exhaust fan did not work because the power was cut when the circuit breaker activated by the burn out of the condenser motor.  The ammonia alarm sounded due to a smell of ammonia outside the ammonia room.  All employees at the plant were evacuated and the fire department was automatically notified.  The fire d"

Add other computer access location outside the ammonia room \n\n\n\nThe facility has completed the following tasks:  1) replaced the electric fan motor was replaced, 2) cleaned the Evaporative Condensers' nozzles and filter, 3) changed the electrical wiring so the the electrical source of the emergency exhaust fan system is independent of the evaporative condenser fan motor, and 4) add computer access location outside of the ammonia room.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nCSM Bakery Products has an emergency response plan in effect at the facility.  In the case of an ammonia-related emergency, facility management will determine if an evacuation is necessary.  It is the policy of CSM Bakery Products to evacuate the employees and call 911 in order to reach the San Bernardino County Fire Department HazMat team who will respond to the emergency (potentially with the assistance of trained facility personnel). \n\n\n\nEmployees and contractors of CSM Bakery Products are obligated to report any significant releases or potential releases of hazardous materials including ammonia.  \n\n\n\nThe Emergency Action Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Response Program section of the PSM/RMP/CalARP (ammonia) documents, which are maintained at the facility and updated as necessary.

A Five Year Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) Revalidation study was conducted on July 20-21, 2011 for both System 1 (1999 System) and System 2 (2001 System) to satisfy the five year update requirements.  The status of the recommendations resulting from the 2008 Five-Year Mechanical Integrity Inspection, 2010 Three-Year Compliance Audit, 2010 PHA Addendum, and the 2010 Seismic Assessment Addendum were reviewed during the PH Revalidation study.  The 2011 PHA Revalidation study and the 2011 Seismic Assessment Update study generated mitigation measures (recommendations) to improve safety at the CSM Bakery Products facility located in Colton, California.  The mitigation measures include additional training, update standard operating procedures, updating the piping diagrams, and key maintenance related tests/inspection.  \n\n\n\nThe Hazard Review study for the aqueous ammonia (29%) system was performed on October 28, 2008.
