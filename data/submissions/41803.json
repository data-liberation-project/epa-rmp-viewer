If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to initiate our emergency response procedure and to notify the Phoenix Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.  Emergency evacuation in the community would be coordinated through the Phoenix Fire Department.\n\nA DESCRIPTION OF THE FACILITY AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nThis facility is a cold storage facility and distribution warehouse.  Ammonia is used as a refrigerant throughout the operation.\n\nTHE WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nOur worst-case release scenario is failure of the 6000 pound ammonia receiver resulting in the release of all the contents over a ten-minute period.  According to the EPA's RMPComp model, the distance to the endpoint is 1.0 miles.  Some outlying areas of Phoenix are within the distance to the endpoint.\n\nTHE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule, OSHA's PSM rules, and all applicable state and local codes and regulations."
