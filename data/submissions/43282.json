The facility is a producer of custom and branded pizza and dough related products for food marketers and manufacturers, the food service industry, and retailers in the United States. \n\nThe NAICS code for the facility is 311412. Many areas of the plant are refrigerated to preserve ingredients, pizza, and dough products.   \n\nThe facility uses ammonia for refrigeration, and is regulated under 40 CFR Part 68, the EPA RMP Rule. There are two (2) refrigeration systems onsite that are used for refrigerating pizza products. \n\nThe amount of ammonia currently present in the refrigeration system #1 is approximately 13,000 pounds.  Refrigeration system #1 is used to cool production rooms, holding freezers, and a frigo blast freezer.  This system is a two-stage system with four (4) high stage compressors and two (2) booster compressors.  Evaporators in the production areas are fed with high pressure pumped liquid from the receiver, the holding freezer evaporators are fed from the intercooler at 32 psi, and the frigo blast freezer is feed pumped liquid at 30 psi from another intercooler.                                                    \n\nThe amount of ammonia currently present in the refrigeration system #2 is approximately 32,000 pounds.  Refrigeration system # 2 is used to cool production rooms, spiral freezers, a cheese freezer, a holding cooler, and a plate and frame glycol chiller.  It is a two-stage system with three (3) high stage compressors and two (2) booster compressors.
