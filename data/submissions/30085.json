      "SummaryText": "The South Coles Levee Gas Plant was built in the 1940\u00bfs.  It is currently owned and operated by CENTRAL RESOURCES, INC. This is a remote facility.  All visitors onto the property must undergo a site safety orientation and check in prior to each visit.\n\nThe plant is functionally divided into three sections: Gas Plant, Compression, Storage, and Refrigeration Skid.  The main function of the facility is to extract liquid hydrocarbons and prepare produced gas for sales.  The natural gasoline liquids are stored in two pressure vessels, 40,000 gallons each.  Under normal operations, product is not stored on-site, it is shipped to North Coles Levee Fractionator.\n\nCENTRAL RESOURCES, INC. maintains a commitment to worker and public safety as evidenced by the resources invested in accident prevention and in the consideration of safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of the plant.  CENTRAL RESOURCES, INC. maintains a code of safe work practices under the umbrella of the Illness and Injury Prevention Program (IIPP).\n\nThe South Coles Levee gas plant is regulated under Cal OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 8 California Code of Regulations Section 5189.  \n\n\u00bfEmergency Planning and Response \u00bf CENTRAL RESOURCES, INC. revised the facility Emergency Response Plan in June of 2003.  The Emergency Response Plan was reviewed during safety meetings in August of 2003 which were attended by all CENTRAL RESOURCES, INC. employees at the facility. An evacuation drill of South Coles Levee was conducted in February of 2004.\n\n\u00bfCENTRAL RESOURCES, INC. maintains an emergency response plan in compliance with local emergency response agencies.  The South Coles Levee Gas Plant has a Hazardous Materials Business Plan on file with the Kern County Environmental Health Department and Certified Unified Program Agency.  \n\n\u00bfIn the event of an accidental release, the facility operators are trained to sound the alarm, contact 9-1-1, shut off the source from a safe location"

      "SummaryText": "or activate one of the emergency shutdown devices, and secure the area.   The 9-1-1 system is used to notify the Fire Department.\n\n\u00bfBased on the criteria of 40 CFR 68.10 and 19 CCR 2735.4, this facility has not had an accidental release in the last 5 years.  \n\n\u00bfThe worst case release scenario of 389,645 pounds of liquefied petroleum gasoline liquids, is based on the Environmental Protection Agency model.  The scenario indicates a 1 psi overpressure distance of 0.6 miles.  This distance does not impact public receptors. \n\nSeismic parameters were addressed by conducting a walkthrough of the facility and reviewing the mechanical integrity records in 1999.  The seismic walkthrough was conducted as a requirement of the California Accidental Release Prevention Program, 19 CCR 2735 for Program 3 facilities.  During the preliminary visits, it was believed that this facility would fall under a RMP/CalARP Program Level 3 due to the process safety management regulatory oversight.  However, after consideration of the remote location and discussions with the Certified Unified Program Agency, (Dale Hineman and Dan Starkey, April 19, 1999), the South Coles Levee Unit qualified as a Program Level 1.  External events analysis are not required for Program Level 1 filing."
