      "SummaryText": "The City of Donna Wastewater Treatment Plant accidental release prevention policy  approach integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices. The Donna emergency response policy involves the preparation of a response plan tailored to each facility and to the emergency response services available in the community. The policy adheres to EPA Prevention Program procedures where applicable, and is in compliance with EPA Emergency Response Program requirements.\n\nThe City of Donna?s Wastewater Treatment Plant is located at 1 ? Mile South Old River Road, Donna, Hidalgo County, Texas. \n\nThe chemical storage building is located on the west side of the plant.  The building is three sided and houses two 1-ton cylinders of chlorine and two 1-ton cylinders of sulfur dioxide.  One cylinder of each material is connected at one time to the system.  The two remaining cylinders are for use only as backups. The cylinders are equipped with manual shutoff valves in the event of an emergency, and an alarm activates at the occurrence of a release. Personnel oversee the facility 8-hours a day, including daily inspections of the chemical storage building.\n\nSelf-Contained-Breathing-Apparatus (SCBA) are available approximately 25 feet from the chemical storage building. The facility houses emergency air and power supply.\n\nNo accidental releases of chlorine or sulfur dioxide (anhydrous) have occurred at the site in the past five years.\n\nThe City of Donna's Fire and Police Departments reviewed the facility's emergency response program. Both departments are members of the Hidalgo County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). The program includes an emergency response decision tree and a notification plan. Emergency response drills, drill evaluations, and emergency operation and response procedures are reviewed annually."
