      "SummaryText": "Effingham Equity is committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  Our prevention program includes the use of proper equipment, regular inspections and maintenance and training for all employees that work with the material.  Should an accidental release occur, the facility has oriented the Arcola Fire Dept. and the Douglas County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  These steps have been taken to assure a quick response to any release and minimize the impact on our community and the environment.\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage of anhydrous ammonia for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.  \n\nThe facility has developed a worst case and alternate case scenario, however it has been withheld from this Executive Summary as security sensitive information as requested by the EPA.\n\nEffingham Equity complies with all rules and regulations relating to the handling of anhydrous ammonia including the Illinois Department of Agriculture regulations as well as OSHA 29 CFR - 1910.111 regarding the proper storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia for the covered process in the past five years.\n\nEffingham Equity has a written emergency action plan in accordance with OSHA 29 CFR - 1910.38.  Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know information is provided to the Illinois Emergency Management Agency, LEPC and the local fire department as required by SARA Title III of EPCRA.  \n\nImproving safety at Effingham Equity is an on-going process.  Periodic evaluations are perfomed to assess the maintenance of safe practices and operations.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implimentation at this time."
