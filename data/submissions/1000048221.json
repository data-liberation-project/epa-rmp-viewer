The FC facility at Allison is in the business of selling anhydrous ammonia to farm customers as a form of nitrogen fertilizer.  The location includes anhydrous ammonia storage tanks, nurse tank filling risers, electrical panels and lighting, and anhydrous ammonia safety equipment.  The facility is manned year round during normal business hours.\n\n3. FC's acidental release prevention plan is based on the following key elements:\n\n* Annual training of all personnel required to handle ammonia and what to do in an emergency.\n\n* Facilities constructed and maintained according to the Iowa fertilizer Law.\n\n* Use of usual anhydrous ammonia safety equipment.\n\n* Use of effective operating procedures according to Agricom's anhydrous ammonia safety procedures handbook and training videos.\n\n* Annual inspections by IDALS of stotage tanks, piping for leaks, nurse tanks, applicators, transfer risers, riser hoses, safety equipment, pressure relief valves, etc.\n\n* FC site inspections by safety committee members at least twice a year.\n\n4. No accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia have occurred at this facility in the past five years.\n\n5. This facility has an emergency response program, which has been coordinated with the Allison Fire Department, which is partnered with the Butler County Emergency Management Agency (LEPC).  This program includes a response decision tree and a notification plan.  Emergency operations plans and"
