Approach To Regulatory Compliance\n\nThis program is intended to meet the spirit and intent of the California Accidental Release Prevention Program (CalARP), CCR Title 19, Chapter 4.5 and the California Process Safety Management Program, CCR Title 8, Section 5189 as enforced by the local Certified Unified Program Agency and the Fed/EPA.  \n\nThis program is intended to be a ?living document.?  As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible. To accomplish this elements have been organized in a way that is consistent with the corporate organization, how frequently different elements are accessed, and who needs to refer to the program.  The order of elements within this organization is not the same as they are listed in the regulations, and in some cases portions of elements may be found in more than one location.  Therefore, for the purposes of auditing and regulatory review the following table is provided to provide concordant information regarding the program and the required regulatory elements. \n\n1. THE  LA JOLLA COLD STORAGE, RISK & PROCESS SAFETY MANAGEMENT PROGRAM\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that La Jolla Cold Storage has prepared a unified Risk & Process Safety Management Program.

At the Federal level, Title 40 CFR Part 68), and California OSHA?s ?Process Safety Management (PSM) of Acutely Hazardous Materials? standard (in California CCR Title 8, Section 5189, ?Process Safety Management of Acutely Hazardous Materials,? and Federally Title 29 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 1910.119).  This program has been prepared to address the risks involved with the presence of anhydrous ammonia in an amount in excess of 10,000 lbs., which is contained in our refrigeration system. \n\nOur program promotes overall plant, worker, and public safety. The program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of anhydrous ammonia. Overall, the program is designed to prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.\n\nOur company has an exemplary safety record, one that we are quite proud of. Our company has many policies and procedures in place to promote overall plant, worker and public safety.  We have: (1) prepared a unified program based on the PSM plan to meet CalARP obligations as well; (2) reorganized the program so that it meshes more closely with general La Jolla Cold Storage business practices; and (3) reviewed plan documentation forms and responsibilities.  The unified Risk & Process Safety Management Plan sets forth rules, procedures, and practices that will help our employees protect themselves and our neighbors.\n\n2. DESCRIPTION OF AMMONIA SYSTEM\nLa Jolla Cold Storage will be operating a commercial cold storage for grapes.  Our facility has one  ammonia system which will operate with a charge of 23,600 lbs.  The system provides refrigerating capacity to two cold storage rooms equipped with forced air cooling and four cold storage rooms for palleted product.  A hallway between the rooms is also refrigerate"

      "SummaryText": "d.\n\nThe systems operate as follows.  High pressure liquid from our main receiver is piped to each cold room, where it passes through an expansion valve into low temperature & pressure accumulator vessels.  From the accumulators, cold liquid ammonia is circulated through evaporator coils.  As heat is absorbed, the liquid ammonia vaporizes to form low temperature & pressure gas which is returned to the accumulator vessel.  The ammonia vapor is returned from the accumulator vessels through a suction return line to our engine room, where it passes through a compressor.  The high pressure discharge from the compressor is sent to a water cooled condenser where the high pressure gas ammonia is cooled, liquified and returned to our receiver. \n\nThe facility was built by professional refrigeration engineers in accordance with standard design, and installation of ammonia mechanical refrigerating systems.  It was also built in compliance with the Uniform Mechanical Code and Uniform Building Code applicable at the time of construction. The system contains numerous safety devices including sensors which stop the compressors if temperatures or pressures exceed or drop below established limits, and safety relief valves which vent ammonia gas to an ammonia adsorption system if the pressure in the system exceeds their set point.  Lastly, an emergency ?dump box? contains switches and valves to turn off equipment and vent ammonia if necessary.\n\nThe ammonia system at our facility consists of vessels which are interconnected, or which are co-located such that a release of ammonia could impact the ability to operate vessels that are not directly connected.  Therefore, we are treating our facility as a single process.\n\n\n3. GENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE & AMMONIA SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\nThe ammonia refrigeration system at the La Jolla Cold Storage facility is an integral part of the overall business.   The system contains a total charge of approximately 23,600 lbs. It is extremely important th"

Management is committed to making sure that all employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.\n\nOur refrigeration personnel monitor the ammonia refrigeration system/process and keep an active journal of all procedures and transactions that pertain to ammonia.  In addition, the system/process is checked frequently by our outside refrigeration contractor, California Controlled Atmosphere, who also performs an annual pre-season preventative maintenance review of our system/process equipment. \n\nWe inform our employees of the dangers of an accidental release of ammonia in pre-season safety meetings.  New employees are made aware of the potential risk of ammonia in an employee orientation meeting.  During these meetings we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\n\nOur ammonia refrigeration system was designed and built by professional refrigeration engineers in accordance with ANSI/IIAR 2-1992 ?Standard for Equipment, Design, and Installation of Ammonia Mechanical Refrigerating Systems.?  It was also built in compliance with the Uniform Building Code and Uniform Mechanical Code applicable at the time of construction.\n\n4. FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nLa Jolla Cold Storage has not had any reportable accidents within the last five years.\n\n5. EMERGENCY ACTION PLAN\nThis facility?s emergency response program is based on the Cal/OSHA requirements for Emergency Action Plans (in California CCR Title 8, Section 3220, ?Emergency Action Plans.?  Federally, Title 29 CFR 1910.38 and 1910.119), HAZWOPER (standard (in California CCR Title 8, Section 5192, ?Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response,? and Title 29 CFR 1910.120). \n\nStrategically, our plan is ?Minimal Response?.

Steps might include stopping the flow of ammonia to a leak point, or using the compressor to suck ammonia away from a leak point. Further response requiring the donning of personal protective equipment would be performed by an outside agency.  All response activities would be directed by the local fire department and the Kern County Fire Department Hazardous Materials Response Team.\n\nEvery year at the beginning of the season we review with our employees our evacuation procedures in the event of an emergency, including an ammonia release. \n\n6. PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nOur company has an outstanding safety record, one that we are quite proud of.  Many policies and procedures have been implemented to promote overall plant, worker and public safety.  Nevertheless, La Jolla Cold Storage continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.  The updating of this Risk & Process Safety Management Program has been the primary recent improvement, and implementation of the program is our plan for improved safety in the near future.\n\nThe Risk & Process Safety Management Program has been written so that program elements are aligned with La Jolla Cold Storage business practices rather than the order presented in the law.  Thus, Safe Operating Procedures are grouped together for the benefit of our system operator.  Safe Operating Policies are grouped together so that appropriate office staff may administer them.  The Emergency Action Plan is now separated out and distributed widely through the plant for easy reference.  \n\nThe Risk & Process Safety Management Program documentation forms and company policy forms pertaining to employee, contractor, and community safety have been carefully reviewed so as to prevent unnecessary complexity and redundancy.  Our operator assisted in the writing of Standard Operating Procedures, and they are presented in a format that is easy to use.  \n\nFor th"
