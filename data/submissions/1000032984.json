Executive Summary\r\n\r\nThis program is intended to meet the spirit and intent of the following regulations:\r\n- California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program - Title 19 CCR, Chapter 4.5\r\n- Federal EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) - Title 40 CFR \u00a768\r\n- California Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 8 CCR \u00a75189\r\n- Federal Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 29 CFR \u00a71910.119\r\n\r\nHereafter this program will be referred to as the RMP-PSM program.\r\n\r\nThis program is intended to be a living document. As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible and updated as necessary. To accomplish this, Giumarra Brothers has elected to use PSMWriter, software developed and distributed by Resource Compliance, Inc. This software will assist us with updating, maintaining, scheduling, and tracking RMP-PSM related activities. \r\n\r\n1.1 Giumarra Brothers, Risk and Process Safety Management Program\r\n\r\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that Giumarra Brothers has updated their unified RMP-PSM Program.

The program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of hazardous chemicals. Overall, the program is designed to prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, illnesses and physical property damage.\r\n\r\nOur company has many policies and procedures in place to promote overall plant, worker and public safety.

The facility has an ammonia refrigeration system that provides refrigeration capacity to the following:\r\n- (3) Precoolers\r\n- (7) Cold Storage Rooms\r\n- (1) Staging Area\r\n\r\nThe refrigerated spaces are equipped with air-cooling evaporators and accumulators as required for flooded operation. All control valve groups are mounted on the roof to provide easy access. The refrigeration machinery is contained within a refrigeration machinery room or directly outside near the machinery room. A partial list of system components includes:\r\n- (1) Vilter VSR-151 Compressor\r\n- (1) Vilter VSS-301 Compressor\r\n- (1) Vilter VSS-1051 Compressor\r\n- (1) Vilter VSS-1201 Compressor\r\n- (1) 24 Dia. x 6'-0 Long Thermosyphon Vessel\r\n- (2) B.A.C.

As heat is absorbed, the liquid ammonia vaporizes to form low temperature and pressure gas which is returned to the accumulator vessels. The ammonia vapor is returned from the accumulator vessels through a suction return line to the main suction accumulator inside the machinery room.  From the main suction accumulator, ammonia is piped to the suction inlet on the compressors. The high pressure discharge from the compressors is sent to water cooled evaporative condensers where the high pressure gas ammonia is cooled, liquefied and returned to the thermosyphon vessel and then to the high pressure receiver.\r\n\r\nGiumarra Brothers was built in 1995 by California Controlled Atmosphere.  The system was built in accordance with the codes and standards in place at the time of construction.  The system contains numerous safety devices including sensors which stop the compressors if temperatures or pressures exceed or drop below established limits, and pressure relief valves which vent ammonia gas to the atmosphere if the pressure in the system exceeds their set point.  Each entrance to the machinery room contains emergency refrigeration and ventilation controls for use during an emergency situation.\r\n\r\nThe ammonia system at Giumarra Brothers consists of vessels, equipment, and valves which are interconnected by piping.  As such, the refrigeration system at Giumarra Brothers is treated as a single process.\r\n\r\n1.3 General Accident Release & Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\n1.3.1 General\r\n \r\nWe inform our employees engaged in process operations of the dangers of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia in annual safety meetings.

Nevertheless, Giumarra Brothers continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.\r\n\r\nBy utilizing PSMWriter software, all necessary employees have access to every aspect of the RMP-PSM program.

In addition, PSMWriter tracks all RMP-PSM related events so that Giumarra Brothers' management team can ensure that the RMP-PSM program is being implemented.\r\n\r\nGiumarra Brothers has implemented all aspects of the RMP-PSM program. When a RMP-PSM program requirement is completed (i.e. mechanical integrity inspection, process hazard analysis, compliance audit, etc.) any specific action items related to that event are entered into PSMWriter, assigned a responsible person, and given a due date. Once the action item has been completed, the resolution can be documented using PSMWriter as well. A list of current or past due action items can be accessed at any time by those with access to PSMWriter.\r\n\r\nIn addition to utilizing PSMWriter to create, schedule, track, and document events, Giumarra Brothers has also entered into a contract with Resource Compliance to obtain help with RMP-PSM program implementation.\r\n\r\nFor the future, Giumarra Brothers now thinks of the RMP-PSM program as a living document. It is an interactive framework that guides safe action for Giumarra Brothers employees, but allows for feedback and continual improvement. Through the RMP-PSM program Giumarra Brothers will continue to maintain overall plant worker and public safety."

The ammonia process contains a total charge of approximately 58,200 lbs. It is extremely important that this process is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner.
