Our commitment to protect our employees and the communities that are home to our operations is an integral part of KEMIRA's way of doing business.  KEMIRA has established safety, health, emergency response and environmental policies and standards to meet all regulatory requirements.\r\n\r\n(b) THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\r\n\r\nOur facility has 2 processes that involve a regulated substance.\r\n\r\nThe Pilot Plant makes water-soluble organic polymers and mining chemicals used for the development of new technologies and improving on existing formulations in the mining, water treating and paper markets.   The regulated substance involved with this operation is 29.4% ammonium hydroxide solution.\r\n\r\nThe polyacrylamide emulsion manufacturing process (EPAM) makes water-soluble organic polymers that are used to remove solids from a number of different wastewater applications.   The regulated substance involved with this operation is 29.4% ammonium hydroxide solution \r\n\r\n(c) THE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nKEMIRA's general accidental release prevention program includes:\r\n\r\n- EPA 40 CFR 68 - Risk Management Plans\r\n- OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119 - Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals \r\n- OSHA 29 CFR 1910.120 - Hazardous Waste Operations & Emergency Response\r\n- Other EPA, OSHA, DOT and State regulations\r\n- Generally recognized & accepted engineering codes and standards, and\r\n- KEMIRA Safety, Health, Environmental and Engineering standards\r\n\r\nThe following engineering and administrative controls help prevent a release of ammonium hydroxide:\r\n- Process Hazard Analysis Reviews (PHA)\r\n- Pre-Start up Safety Reviews (PSSR)\r\n- Storage tank high level alarm/interlock\r\n- Storage tank high level switch and associated interl"

The procedures are designed to be implemented in case of fire, explosion, chemical release which may arise as a result of our own operations, adjacent operations or the forces of nature.  These procedures are set up to be implemented in two primary areas; 1.) in plant and 2.) in conjunction with the community.\r\n\r\nThe in plant portion of the emergency response plan provides for employee notification of an emergency through an alarm system and in plant response with operations personnel to take immediate remedial actions.  The Mobile Fire and Rescue Hazmat Team and fully trained and equipped contract services are readily available.  The in plant emergency response protocols also provide for communications, notifications, procedures for emergency shut down, and mitigation.  The in plant system is tested on a frequency ranging from weekly, for the alarm and communications system, to bi-annually for in-plant musters and drills.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the in plant portion of the emergency response plan, the Mobile Plant also maintains an active community based emergency response program.  This is done through participation in the Mobile County LEPC as well as with the Mobile County Emergency Management Agency which coordinates mutual aid for the entire Mobile area chemical manufacturing community.  Participation is achieved through planning meeting"
