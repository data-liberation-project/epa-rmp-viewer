The employee immediately closed the valve and sustained an ammonia burn on his abdomen during the event.  The employee was transported to the Woodward, OK. Hospital Emergency Room for treatment.  The injured employee received a prescription medication for the burn and was off work for three days with an additional four days of restricted duty.  No off-site impacts occurred.   \n\nEmergency Response Program:\nThe Woodward Plant has a comprehensive Emergency Response Program which includes a written plan that is coordinated with local authorities, a 60-plus member emergency response team, and emergency notification system that utilizes both in-plant sirens and the Community Alert Network telephone system.  Woodward Plant personnel are active members of the Woodward County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  The plant exercises its emergency response plan annually and also participates in countywide drills that are staged by the LEPC and other local emergency response authorities."
