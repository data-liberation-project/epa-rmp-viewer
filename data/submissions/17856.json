Accidental release prevention and emergency policies:  This facility complies with NFPA-58 requirements for LP-gas storage, and it is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.\n\n2. Description of facility and regulated substances handled:  The primary purpose of this facility is to repackage and distribute propane to wholesale customers.  Propane is used by our wholesale customers as a fuel.  Propane is received by railcar and truck (transports) and stored in six (6) 30,000-gallon storage tanks.  Propane is distributed to wholesale customers by truck (transports and bobtails).  This facility has equipment for loading and unloading transports, unloading railcars, and loading bobtails.  Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel, and authorized contractors.  The regulated substance handled at this distribution facility is propane.\n\n3. Worst-case and alternative release scenarios:  Our worst-case scenario is failure of one (1) 30,000-gallon storage tank when filled to the greatest amount allowed (88% at 60F), resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  The resulting distance to the endpoint extends offsite, and public receptors are within the distance to the endpoint.  Our alternative release scenario is a pull-away causing failure of a 20-foot length of 2-inch hose.  The excess flow valves function to stop the flow.  The contents of the hose would be released, resulting in an explosion.  The resulting distance to the endpoint extends offsite, and public receptors are within the distance to the endpoint.\n\n4. General accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:  This facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.  The propane system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with NFPA-58 and state law.\n\n5. Five-year accident history:  We have never had an accident involving propane t"

Emergency response program:  In the event of an emergency involving our propane system, it is our policy to notify the Attalla Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.\n\n7. Planned changes to improve safety:  Replacement of relief valves, excess flow valves, block valves, line valves, pressure gauges, thermometers, hydrostatic relief valves; installation of fencing at compressor station and railcar unloading entrances.\n\n8. This facility is only staffed by employees when product transfer is taking place."
