As specified in \u00a7 68.155, the owner or operator must provide an executive summary that includes a brief description of the Risk Management Plan. At Detroit Wastewater Treatment Plant (DWWTP), chlorine is used to disinfect the treated wastewater and it is stored in 90 ton tank cars. The construction of a new chlorination facility is in its final phase at DWWTP. The new facility is expected to be in operation by the second quarter of 2003 and chlorine will be stored in 90-ton tank cars. The existing chlorination facility will be in use until the new facility is successfully in operation. DWWTP recently started using sulfur dioxide to remove residual chlorine, or to dechlorinate the treated wastewater to protect organisms in the river when it is discharged. The new dechlorination facility has been in operation since September 24, 2002. Sulfur dioxide is also stored in 90-ton tank cars. MIOSHA did the site consultation at DWWTP for the existing chlorination facility on January 27, 2001, for the new dechlorination facility on May 22, 2002 and for the new chlorination facility on January 27, 2003. The following elements describe the Risk Management Plan as per \u00a7 68.155, for the existing Chlorination, the new Dechlorination, and the new Chlorination processes at the Detroit Wastewater treatment Plant.\n\n1.\tThe accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the stationary source.\n\n\tDetroit Water and Sewerage Department, under which DWWTP is being operated, is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.

The new chlorination process will also meet the good engineering practices and will have preventive maintenance programs when it is in operation. The chemical supplier makes the tank car inspection, cleaning, repair, interior system tests and relief valve tests currently and also in the future. \n\n\tAt DWWTP, a set of nine (9) detectors is placed throughout the roof of the administration building and at the junction chamber.  Their function is to warn of chlorine gas in the air and to activate the automatic shut off mechanism of the air intake to the various parts of the building affected. The signals from these detectors are transmitted to the Computer Control Room and the Special Laboratory in addition to the annunciator in the chlorine room.\n\n\tA sulfur dioxide or chlorine leak will be detected by the gas detector system in the new facilities. The sensors are located in the tank car storage building, chemical feed equipment room, and in the basement. The area of the alarm or malfunction will be indicated on the control panels. Alarm information will be sent to annunciator panels in the tank car storage building, Chlorination and Dechlorination facility maintenance room, Chlorination and Dechlorination control room and to the scrubber.\n\n\tThe caustic soda air wash system chemically neutralizes chlorine as well as sulfur dioxide from a leak inside the building before the gas escapes to the outside atmosphere.\n\n\tFlashing red lights are provided at the entrances to the chlorination and dechlorination buildings.

Ferric chloride and/or ferrous chloride are added to the raw wastewater for phosphorous removal. The wastewater is pumped from the Intermediate Lift Pump Station to the secondary treatment facilities where treatment is provided by the activated sludge method.  Following final clarification, the wastewater is disinfected by the addition of chlorine, dechlorinated by the addition of sulfur dioxide, and discharged to the Detroit River.
