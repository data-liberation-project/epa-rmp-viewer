(CDPI) are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is the basis of having a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with all processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls, both engineering and administrative, to prevent possible releases of not only regulated substances, but all potentially hazardous materials. If such a release were to occur, we are prepared to work closely with the local Emergency Response agencies such as the Fire Departments and LEPCs in providing trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\r\nFacility Overview\r\nChemDesign Products, Inc (CDPI) is a custom manufacturer of a wide variety of fine organic chemicals with the end uses of our products many and varied.  It offers a broad range of manufacturing flexibility for its customers and produces materials for the paper, electronics, agricultural and other industries.  Sales are worldwide.\r\nBuilding 52 is designed to offer a wide range of manufacturing capability and be modified quickly to suit our customers needs.  This building serves as the major area of production of CDPI.\r\nBuilding 38/70 us a two-part building generally housing CDPI's long term processes as well as thin film evaporator and product flaking operations.  The CDPI Risk Management Plan covers chemicals for this facility, methyl chloride is handled in this building.\r\nBuilding 69, is a facility for small volume campaigns and limited large volume work.  Although all the equipment has the same functions as building 38, much of it is smal"

      "SummaryText": "ler in .  Vinyl acetate will also be handled in this area.\r\nBuilding 69 also houses CDPI's laboratory operations support production.  The chemist who staff the Process Development Labs research the safest and most efficient means of producing various chemical products.  The Quality Control Laboratory assures that products meet customer expectations.\r\nWorst Case Scenarios\r\nMethyl Chloride\r\nChemdesign  receives methyl chloride from bulk trucks, which are off loaded directly into our methyl chloride bulk tank system.  Inventory control requires that less than 20,000 pounds remain in inventory before a shipment is received.  The maximum load on a bulk truck of methyl chloride is 40,000 pounds resulting in a maximum on-site inventory of 60,000 pounds.  The bulk tank is designed for pressure storage with extra thick walled construction and double weld seams.  Due to the evaporative nature of this material, no dike or containment walls exist at this tank.  The worst case scenario is the release of the entire contents of the full tank (60,000 pounds) over ten minutes.  \r\n\r\nIt would take a major catastrophic event such as an airplane crash on its approach to the local airport to cause that release.  The tank is located in a protected area of the plant adjacent to the building it feeds.\r\nThe material is charged from the bulk tank to a pressure rated \"day tank\" for each reaction.  The contents of the day tank are then metered into the reaction at a controlled rate.  This reduces the amount of material that could be potentially released in the event there were a problem with the feed rate or system to the reactor.  A rupture disk which discharges through a re-seating pressure release valve to a containment tank protects the \"day tank\".\r\nAlternative Case Scenarios\r\nMethyl Chloride\r\nMethyl chloride is charged to the process through the use of a \"day tank\" or staging pressure vessel.  This vessel holds enough material for one reaction.  This reduces the amount of potential release"

      "SummaryText": "in the event of an upset condition.  The \"day tank\" is protected by a rupture disk and then a re-seating pressure release valve.  The tank vents back to the bulk tank when filling. This tank offers the most possible alternative case scenario.  In the event the vent line were not completely open the day tank could over pressurize and rupture the burst disk.  The pressure release valve would in turn open, relieve the pressure and then re-seat in about 3 seconds releasing about 25 pounds.  The material would flow to the pressure containment tank and release the contents to the atmosphere through a controlled point.  This would have a potential range of effect of 0.06 mile radius potentially affecting the public recreation area of the Menominee River where fishing is a popular sport.\r\nAdministrative controls in the operating procedures are in place to minimize the potential for venting line plugging or reduction.\r\nWorst Case Scenarios\r\nEthyl Chloride \r\nEthyl Chloride will be received as a liquefied gas either via bulk tank truck, isotainer, or ton cylinder.  For bulk tank trucks and isotainers, the liquid ethyl chloride will first be offloaded to pressure vessels rated to 90 psig using a compressor on the vessel to provide positive pressure to feed the liquid from the portable bulk container.  Gas feed to the reaction will then be done from the bulk storage vessels or ton cylinders via mass flow meter set for the appropriate stoichiometric quantity.  The reaction will be done under blocked in conditions to ensure full conversion of ethyl chloride to the desired product prior to venting off the reactor to the caustic scrubber prior to work up and isolation. The worst case scenario is the release of the entire contents of both pressure vessels for a total of  45,000 pounds over ten minutes.  The estimated distance to endpoint is approximately .2 miles, with no public areas affected. \r\n\r\nIt would take a major catastrophic event such as an airplane crash on its approach to"

The tank is located in a protected area of the plant adjacent to the building it feeds.\r\nThe storage vessels are equipped with redundant pressure relief devices, i.e. rupture disk followed by a pop-valve, to eliminate the chance of releasing the entire contents of the tank simultaneously during an over-pressurization.  Both  storage vessels have the capability to be cooled at all times as both are a jacketed vessel.\r\n\r\nAlternative Case Scenarios\r\nEthyl Chloride \r\nEthyl Chloride is charged to the process through the use of pressure vessel s which offers the most possible alternative case scenario.  In the event of a leak from a short pipe or valve vent line not completely open the hold tanks could over pressurize and rupture the burst disk.  The pressure release valve would in turn open, relieve the pressure and then re-seat in about 1 min. releasing about 500 pounds.  The material would flow to the pressure containment tank and release the contents to the atmosphere through a controlled point.  This would have a potential range of effect of <0.1 mile radius, with no public areas affected. \r\nAdministrative controls in the operating procedures are in place to minimize the potential for venting line plugging or reduction.\r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\r\nDue to the nature of constantly changing production capabilities of the custom chemical manufacturing business, a broad range of Federal, State and local regulations governs CDPI.\r\nAll the major OSHA regulations including Process Safety Management, Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response, Right-To- Know are integral to our efforts to minimize the potential for any chemical incident, not just the \"covered\" chemical.  We also fall under the Environmental Protection Agency's standards for air, water and land protection by compliance with such regulations as the Clean Air Act, RCRA, TSCA and FIFRA to name a few.  \r\nDetailed programs are in place to address"

      "SummaryText": "the needs of process safety, employee safety, employee health, environmental protection, facility and equipment loss and downtime and much more.  Key to the process safety efforts, covering both OSHA and EPA requirements and more, is our formal five part program conducted on all processes before any are begun.  This program consists of:\r\n1. Hazard Assessment Profiles (HAP) consisting of a detailed review of all chemical hazards specific to the process, \r\n2. Development of Custom Chemical Checklists (CCC) which consists of a documented detailed review of the hazards compared with regulatory requirements, \r\n3. Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) usually consisting of a 'What If' method of analysis, as well as CDPI Chemical Operator Involvement/feedback.\r\n4. Thorough training programs for all operators and maintenance personnel on the operation of the process, it's hazards and methods of minimizing the potential for upset conditions,\r\n5. Pre Start-Up Safety Tours to be sure all is in order before any chemicals are introduced to the process, this step also involves the involvement/feedback of CDPI Chemical Operators.\r\nDuring this process, efforts are made to minimize inventory requirements, minimize waste generated, maximize product conversion efficiency and enhance employee and environmental safety.  Engineering controls are integral to the operation and are enhanced where ever economically feasible and provides a direct benefit to the efficiency or safety of the operation. Departments consisting of full time Process Engineers and Process Development Chemists oversee all processes to ensure safe operations.\r\n\r\n\r\n5 Year Accident History\r\nThere have been no reportable incidents over the last 5 years concerning Methyl Chloride or Ethyl Chloride. \r\nEmergency Response Program\r\nCDPI is located on the border of two states and as such believe we have a responsibility to ensure the safety our staff members, our community and the environment from upset conditions should they occur at"

We also work closely with the two Fire Departments both for training as well as drilling purposes.  The City and County have detailed emergency notification systems and our internal Contingency Plan clearly outlines our means of communicating with these organizations.  We have both a detailed Contingency Plan detailing our response mechanisms for any type of situation and an Off-Site Plan filed with the State detailing our capabilities for offsite assistance. The Marinette Fire Department is located less 2 miles from our site with a response time of less than five minutes.  CDPI is very proud of our working relationship with the local Emergency Responders and provides yearly tours and training opportunities for all local response agencies. \r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\nCDPI is constantly looking to discover new and better ways to enhance our safety programs.  We are currently engaged in an active one-on-one dialogue between all personnel and top management to determine how we can further increase the effectiveness of our safety and environmental programs.  Active safety, regulatory and technical training is provided to all personnel on a monthly basis with specialized, process specific training given on a more frequent as needs dictate basis.  \r\nSafety, whether employee safety, environmental safety or process safety is integral to the way ChemDesign  Products does business.
