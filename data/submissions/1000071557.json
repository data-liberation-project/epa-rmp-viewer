      "SummaryText": "The Elliott Company (\"Elliott\") operates a product testing facility in the City of Jeannette, Pennsylvania.  At this facility, cryogenic pumps and expanders undergo factory acceptance testing prior to being shipped to the customer.  The facility is subject to both the PSM and RMP regulations due to the use of Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) and Liquefied Propane Gas (LPG) at the site.   \n\n\n\nElliott's policy is to prevent any release of any chemical which could cause illness or injury to employees, visitors, or contractors or which could impact the community or the environment.  Regarding emergency response, it is Elliott's policy to maintain open relationships with local emergency responders, including the City of Jeannette Fire Department, to ensure a prompt response to emergency situations.  \n\n\n\nElliott's general accidental release prevention program consists of providing secondary containment for bulk containers, storing drummed material indoors, and conducting routine inspections of material storage and handling locations.  Due to the unique nature of the chemicals used at the product testing facility, additional release prevention measures specific to LNG and LPG are in place.  These include:\n\n\n\n?    Design and installation of storage tanks and process piping to ASME and NFPA standards,\n\n?    Automated control systems and interlocks,\n\n?    Manual emergency stops,\n\n?    Routine inspections of process piping and tanks,\n\n?    Prohibition of smoking anywhere on the testing facility's property; and\n\n?    A comprehensive hot work program\n\n\n\nThe product testing facility is a new construction, and so has had no accidents in the past five years.  \n\n\n\nThe emergency response program at the product testing facility is based on rapid response from the City of Jeannette Fire Department to high-LEL events as well as actual fires.  The fire department is automatically notified whenever a stationary combustible gas analyzer detects high concentrations of either propane or methane or when any fire su"
