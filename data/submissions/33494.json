      "SummaryText": "Vopak Logistics - DEER PARK\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\nGENERAL DESCRIPTION OF FACILITY\n\nVopak Logistics Services USA Inc.- Deer Park has two basic operations: a commercial hazardous waste management facility and a railcar cleaning facility.\n\nThe Vopak Disposal Facility is a commercial treatment, storage, and disposal facility, which utilizes biological waste treatment, physical-chemical treatment, dewatering, filtration, solidification, fixation and deepwell disposal processes.  As a hazardous waste management facility, Vopak eliminates or minimizes the hazardous characteristics and the amount of hazardous substances from streams that might otherwise have contributed to harming the health of the community or contaminating the environment.  \n\nThe Vopak Railcar Cleaning Facility is a service operation, which purges, cleans, and sandblasts railcars.   In providing the railcar cleaning service for surrounding industries, Vopak provides a safe means for cleaning railcars.   All wastes generated from the railcar cleaning processes are sent through the Vopak's Disposal Facilityand other approved disposal sites for safe and environmentally sound disposal.\n\nVopak, only the Railcar Cleaning Facility falls under the requirements of 40 CFR 68 or the Risk Management Plan regulations.   Therefore, the majority of the Executive Summary will deal with the Railcar Cleaning Facility.\n\n\nPROCESS DESCRIPTION FOR RAILCAR CLEANING FACILITY  \n\nThe cleaning process for a railcar begins with Customer Service Department.  After Customer Service Department reviews the railcar and the contents of the railcar with the Railcar Manager, the contents of that railcar are then determined to meet the safety and regulatory criteria of the facility.   The railcar's content will be checked against or added to an Approved Chemical List.  \n\nThe Approved Chemical List signifies that the treatment of the chemical, cleaning procedures, disposal requirements and safety provisions for a particular chemical have been e"

No chemical is accepted for cleaning until this process has been completed.\n\nAfter a chemical has been added to the Approved Chemical List, the Product Clearance and Inquiry (PC&I) form is completed to address and develop written procedures for cleaning the railcar, disposing of the waste, and providing adequate personal protective equipment.  The PC&I informs the operator of the necessary controls, such as the thermal oxidizer, the caustic scrubber, or the flare, for vapor emissions and for personal protection.  The PC&I is reviewed by Quality Asurance Manager, Environmental department, the Safety and Health department, the Railcar Manager and the Disposal Manager.  Each PC&I is chemical specific.  This allows Vopak to provide the best means for protecting the health and safety of our employees, guard against any impact to our community and eliminate any contamination to our environment.\n\nWhen the PC&I has been completed and approved, the railcar is allowed on the facility site for cleaning.  All railcars are weighed before acceptance for railcar cleaning.  If the railcar contains a product heel, Vopak notifies the customer to determine the return of the product heel.  The product heel becomes a waste at the time the customer declines the return of the heel.  Vopak then becomes the generator of that waste.   More often than not the heel is returned as product.   \n\nDuring the cleaning process, the PC&I, the Work Order and the Material Safety Data Sheet or General Waste Profile remain with railcar.  This allows all information to be readily available to the operator.   \n\nIf the railcar contains a manifested waste, the railcar is cleaned in the RCRA Permitted Part B containment area. All washwaters from this area are sent to Vopak's Wastewater Treatment Facility or to the Deepwell Injection Treatment Facility for proper disposal.  In compliance with 40CFR ? 264.175 and 40 CFR ?264.193, this area has secondary conta"

Vopak analyzed a total release of all chemicals that may be in on site due to railcar cleaning services under weather conditions consisting of F Stability with 1.5 mile per hours, ambient temperatures of 77oF, and 50% humidity.  After analyzing the Worst Case Scenario, it was determined that Furan will cause the largest offsite impact.  According to the Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance published by the EPA, a total release of 1,000 gallons of Furan will affect a 24 mile radius area.  Within this area, there are hospitals, schools, residential areas, industrial facilities and parks and recreational facilities.  Approximately 1,750,000 people will be exposed to a release of 1000 gallons of Furan with no mitigation measures or emergency response programs initiated.  Since Vopak has an Accident Prevention Program and an Emergency Response Program in place, VopakK feels confident that the probability of this event is very low.\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nAfter reviewing internal reports, Vopak has estimated a more probable heel as being 100 gallons for a liquid heel or 100 pounds for a solid heel.  Vopak has determined the most likely release scenario for 11 chemicals.  Due to the nature of removing heels, Vopak has determined the most likely release scenario to be a leaking transfer hose.  This release will occurr in the beginning stages of a deteriorating hos"

Within this area, hospitals, schools, residents, industry, and parks and recreational facilities may be impacted.   Approximately 19,000 people will be affected by a release of 524 pounds of Furan.  An accidental release of 465 pounds of Acrolein may also have the potential of impacting a 1.9-mile radius area.  Within this area, this release may have the potential to affect commercial, office or industrial areas.  In most of our Alternate Release ScenaVopak is confident that the actual impact will not be as significant as the calculated impact due to our Accident Prevention Program and Emergency Response Program.\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nIn the last five years, Vopak has had total 1 accidental releases with:\n\n            2 releases involving spills of hazardous waste occurring in 1999, \n            1 release involving a release of chlorine occurring in 1998, \n            0 releases occurring in 1997, \n            1 releases occurring in 1996 involving a fire, and\n            2 releases involving spills of hazardous waste occurring in 1995.\n\nAll events were responded to and contained within a timely manner.   No offsite impact resulted from these accidental release events. Detailed information is available in the RMP Submit Report.\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nSince Vopak is a railcar cleaning facility, all railcars are weighed before the cleaning process begins.  Those weights of railcars that indicate a weight greater than a product heel weight are immediately returned to the customer.  This practice greatly reduces the probability of a large quantity release occurring within the facility.\n\nOther means of preventing accidental releases includes employee training.

The operator also completes a 24-hour Hazwoper Training Class, so that he is able to respond to emergency situations appropriately.  When the operator's performance record has been reviewed and approved, the operator is then allowed to work on his own.  During the course of the following year, the Railcar Cleaning operator receives an 8-hour refresher training, which includes Lock Out/Tag Out, Hot Work Permit, RCRA, Confined Space Entry, Fall Protection and Personal Protective Equipment.  In the event an operator fails to properly follow procedures and policies, he will receive a one-on-one counciling session.  If this fails, the operator ultimately faces termination.\n\nAlong with employee training, the Product Clearance and Inquiry (PC&I) was developed to inform the operator of hazards and methods to safely manage these hazards.   Chemical specific instructions are listed on the PC&I for the cleaning of a specific railcar.  Before the railcar is brought on site for cleaning, the PC&I must be developed.  The Tquality Assurance Manager initiates the PC&I by providing chemical and physical information for the chemical to be removed.  To protect the employees from any unnecessary exposures, the Safety and Health Department determines the proper personal protective equipment needed.  To minimize accidental releases to the environment and to eliminate any offsite impacts, the Environmental Department determines appropriate emissions controls.  The Disposal Manager establishes the correct disposal methods for the waste streams. Next, the Railcar Manager develops special cleaning instructions for the railcar.  After each section is completed and approved, the PC&I is then reviewed by operations.  At this point, any questions or concerns are addressed before the cleaning process begins.  In conclusion, the PC&I is a "

Other means of controlling emissions include our Wastewater Treatment System for biological treatment and metals removal.  Our Wastewater Treatment System has destruction efficiency of 95%.  When wastewater cannot be biologically treated, the Deepwell Injection System is used. \n\nTo ensure properly functioning equipment, a quarterly preventive maintenance schedule was developed.  Each quarter all equipment is inspected for leaks, corrosion, and cracks.  All moving parts are inspected for any signs of wear.  If problems are found, the equipment is taken out of service, repaired, and returned to service.\n\nAlso, as part of Accident Prevention Program, the operator must inspect the railcar cleaning facility daily.  During the daily \"walk-around\" compliance inspection, the operator notes and reports any questionable areas that might have the potential to impact the safety and health of co-workers, the community, and the environment. \n\nVopak has also developed an employee participation program, Safety Awareness Team (SAT).  The members of SAT include Disposal and Railcar operators, Maintenance employees, Administrative personnel and Laboratory Technicians.  SAT involves the employee in the decision-making process by allowing employees to develop safety procedures, to inform management of the need for improved personal protective equipment and to alert others of potentially hazardous situations.
