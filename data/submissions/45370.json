      "SummaryText": "As good neighbors Cooperative Plus Inc is comitted to keeping the community safe.  We comply with all Federal and State standards regarding anhydrous ammonia storage.  The Cooperative Plus Inc facility located at 8111 12th place, Somers, WI, complies with OSHA 29 CFR 1910.11 \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".  Cooperative Plus Inc's emergency response plan includes procedures for notifying the local fire authority and police department, as well as the Kenosha Emergency Services.  The telephone numbers for the previously named public services are posted on an emergency board in plain sight in case of an emergency.  At the facility located in Somers, WI, anhydrous ammonia is stored and distributed for resale to farmers.  The anhydrous is received by rail car or truck and stored in an 18,000 gallon tank.  It is distributed for direct application.   The maximum amount stored at the facility is 80,000 lbs (18,000 gallons times 5.5 lbs per gallon times 85%).  Worst case scenario is a gas release of 80,000 lbs due to a tank rupture.  The anhydrous ammonia would be released as a gas for a 10 minute period at a rate 8000 lbs per minute.  Under urban conditions the distance to the endpoint is 3.3 miles (using the RMP Comp model).  Alternative scenario would be a transfer hose failure cauing a 5% release of 4,000 lbs (2,000 lbs per minute for 2 minutes).  The release being stopped by human interaction.  Under urban conditions the distance to the endpoint is .3 miles.  There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past 11 years that have resulted I any deaths, injuries, or property damage on or off site.  Safety, both to the community and our employees, is an ongoing process at this faciltiy.  Planned periodic maintanence evaluations are done to ensure that safe conditions and equipment are in use."
