Facility Policy\n\nThe Owners, management, and employees of Helm Fertilizer Terminal, Inc. (the facility) are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information\n\na. The primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers and co-ops.\nb. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for both direct application and for blending into mixed-grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients.\nc. The maximum quantity stored would be 18,940,000 pounds in our main storage tank.  The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a barge holding 5,000,000 pounds.\n\n3. The Worst-Case Release Scenario and Alternate Release Scenario\n\na. The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of our main storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 18,940,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 25 miles.\nb. The alternate release scenario based on the most likely potential incident is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 0.3 miles\n\n4. The Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".\n\n\n\n5. The Five-year Accident H"

The Emergency Response Program\n\nThe facility has:\n\na. a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA Standard, 29 CFR 1910.38;\nb. provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are preformed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time.\n\n    \n\n\n                    \n\n"
