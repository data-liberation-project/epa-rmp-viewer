Agave Energy Company purchased the Duke Dagger Draw Gas Plant in May 2005 and combined operations with the existing Agave Gas Plant to operate as the Agave Dagger Draw Gas Plant. The facility has been successfully operating for approximately five years with no accidents to report.\n\nThe operation of the Agave Dagger Draw Gas Plant is intended to process 40 MMSCFD of gas.  The gas \nis treated to remove acid gas components, dehydrated to remove water and processed to remove \nheavy (liquid) hydrocarbons from the gas stream.  Several plant systems will be involved to perform these \nfunctions.  The acid gas that is removed by the amine unit will be disposed of by either acid gas injection \ninto a disposal well or by incinerating in a flare.  The preferred method of disposal will be to compress the \ngas and inject it into the well.  Under emergency situations, the gas will be flared to prevent the emission \nof lethal hydrogen sulfide to atmosphere.  The cryogenic unit is designed to liquefy natural gas liquids \nfrom the sweet, dehydrated inlet gas by removing work (heat) from the gas be means of the turbo \nexpander. The cryogenic unit recovers natural gas liquids (NGL) by cooling the gas stream to extremely \ncold temperatures (-130?F) and condensing components such as ethane, propane, butanes and heavier.  It \nis the presence of these flammable NGL that cause the facility to be subject to the OSHA PSM process \nand thus the RMP process.\n\nThe off-site consequence analysis assumed that the unit with the largest amount of NGL (cryo unit 1) had \neither a catastrophic failure (worse case scenario) or a small leak (alternative scenario).  The flammable \nmaterial is composed of a mixture of methane, ethane, propane, butane, isobutane, pentane, and \nisopentane.  For both the worse case and alternative scenario, the mixture was assumed to be composed \nentirely of t"
