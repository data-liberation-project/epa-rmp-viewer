      "SummaryText": "\nDalton Utilities? Risk Management Plan for Safe Chlorine Handling at the Land Applica-tion System involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices to monitor potential chlorine hazards and minimize the risk of accidental chlorine releases.  All applicable procedures of 40 CFR 68.170 are addressed in the plan, which seeks to provide for employee safety, public health and response agency interaction. \n\nThe Dalton Land Application System (LAS) is contained within a 9000-acre site bounded on three sides by the Conasauga River.  The site is fenced and public access is controlled.  The site consists of primarily forested land and most of the bordering property is also for-ested; much of it in commercial timber production.  \n\nThe LAS utilizes chlorine to disinfect treated effluent from its three wastewater treatment plants prior to land application.  The chlorine is introduced at Pump Stations B and C.  These pump stations have similar configurations and pump the disinfected wastewater out to the individual spray fields via a pipeline distribution system for spray irrigation. The chlorination process is identical at Pump Stations B and C and includes chlorine cylinders, chlorination equipment, electrical equipment, and process specific safety equipment.  Chlorination for disinfection of treated wastewater is not part of the SIC codes listed by EPA in 68.10(d), and the municipal facility is not subject to OSHA Proc-ess Safety Management (PSM) requirements.  Consequently, this qualifies the LAS chlorination process as a Program 2 process.\n\nFor each chlorination process, accidental release modeling was performed for the respective area to determine potential consequences associated with operating failures resulting in an accidental chlorine release.  The first ?worst case? scenario, defined by EPA, states that ?the owner or operator shall assume that the ? maximum quantity in the largest vessel ? is released as a gas over 10 minu"

      "SummaryText": "tes.?  The ?alternative scenario? is defined as ?more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario?.  Each chlorination process is a new process; therefore, no previous incidents exist and an incident history review was not applicable.  However, valuable experience in chlorine handling and use at our water treatment plants has been applied to these new installations.\n\nIn each accidental release modeling case, atmospheric dispersion modeling was per-formed with the use of RMP*COMP software to determine the distance traveled by the chlorine released before its concentration decreased to a theoretical ?no effect level?.  This is defined by the American Industrial Hygiene Association as ?the maximum air-borne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be ex-posed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing life-threatening health ef-fects.?  The residential population within a perimeter corresponding to the no effect level distance was defined to estimate the population potentially affected.\n\nThe worse case release scenarios were determined for each of the two pump stations.  Though unlikely, the worse case release scenario would possibly result from a 2000 pound loss of liquid chlorine due to the failure of a faulty packing nut on the cylinder valve stem assembly.  For each pump station, a no effect distance of 3.0 miles was ob-tained for the described worse case release scenario.    \n\nThe alternative release (more likely) scenario for the chlorination process at each pump station involves the mechanical failure of one flexible manifold connection (pigtail) al-lowing an accidental release from one ton cylinder of chlorine over a ten minute period, at which time the failure is repaired.  Under these conditions, similar atmospheric model-ing was performed with the RMP*COMP software.  For each pump station, a release ra-dius of less than 0.2 miles was obtained.  Within this radius, any impact to residential population is h"

This review included a facility tour, overview of training program and a discussion about release response.\n\nDalton Utilities takes a proactive approach to risk management and emergency response through information sharing sessions between Dalton Utilities' employees, our HAZ-WOPER qualified emergency response contractor and local response agencies.  These preventative measures will provide for the continuous improvement of communications and will maintain effective procedures for the safe handling of and timely emergency re-sponse to potential chlorine hazards."
