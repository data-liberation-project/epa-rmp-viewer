These programs provide for the implementation of detailed prevention and response procedures when storing and handling hazardous chemicals. The program objectives are to ensure worker and public safety and to provide environmental protection.\n\n\n\nLegendary Meats is a domestic producer of custom cuts beef, poultry, pork, veal, lamb, seafood and dry goods for foodservice and retail operators.  The Legendary Meats plant is located at 1058 King Industrial Dr. in Marietta, GA, Cobb County.  \n\nThe substance regulated under the Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions (40 CFR 68) that is located on site, in various locations and quantities is anhydrous ammonia.\n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is utilized on site for the \"Refrigeration Systems.\" Approximately 10,753 lbs. for the Front Engine Room (ER1) and 6,181 lbs. for Back Engine Room (ER2) of ammonia is used as a refrigerant in the facility's two systems.  A total of 16,934 lbs. of ammonia onsite. Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled onsite is anhydrous ammonia.  The ammonia is contained in various vessels, piping, condensers and evaporators used throughout the ammonia refrigeration system.  Anhydrous ammonia is the only substance at the facility that is regulated under the PSM and RMP programs. This is the same type of ammonia commonly sprayed on fields by farmers to fertilize crops. Anhydrous ammonia is used as a refrigerant throughout the plant to maintain desired meat temperatures in coolers, freezers and working areas.  Expelling heat caused from altering the ammonia between a liquid and a gas state creates refrigeration in the facility.  This refrigeration system consists of a series of compressors, condensers, evaporators, v"

How to determine the WCS & ACS was derived from the EPA approved ALOHA & CAMEO Software and Gaussian Dispersion.  \n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is operated with a variety of safety devices employed within the system, included are: high and low level automated shutdown systems and high and low pressure automated shutdown systems. Alarm systems are utilized to provide early detection of problems within the system before shutdowns occur.\n\nThis facilities emergency response program is an action plan to respond to and resolve incidents associated with the ammonia refrigeration system. The Fire Department will be notified so that they can provide assistance during an incident. If it is necessary to contact the public regarding an ammonia release, the local fire department will be contacted to coordinate with the police department. The police department will notify residents and business locations.\n\nThis facility has not had a reportable release in the past five years.  The facility utilizes Process Hazard Analysis, Compliance Audits, Pre-Startup Safety Reviews, Mechanical Integrity inspections, Preventative Maintenance activity, equipment inspections, and training to ensure mitigation and control of potential incidents.\n\nThe facility will make changes to the system and train as necessary to resolve items noted during the Process Hazard Analysis, Compliance Audit, Pre-Startup Safety Reviews, and Mechanical Integrity inspections to improve the safety of the system. Changes will be placed on an action list, evaluated, and implemented in a timely manner.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies \n\nLegendary Meats is committed to employee, public and environmental safety.
