Executive Summary\n\n\n\nThis program is intended to meet the spirit and intent of the following regulations:\n\n\n\n*California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program - Title 19 CCR, Chapter 4.5\n\n*Federal EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) - Title 40 CFR ?68\n\n*California Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 8 CCR ?5189\n\n*Federal Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 29 CFR ?1910.119\n\n\n\nHereafter this program will be referred to as the RMP-PSM program.\n\n\n\nThis program is intended to be a \"living document\". As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible and updated as necessary. To accomplish this, BWC Corcoran Yard has elected to use PSMWriter, software developed and distributed by Resource Compliance, Inc. This software will assist us with updating, maintaining, scheduling, and tracking RMP-PSM related activities. \n\n\n\n1.1 BWC Corcoran Yard, Risk and Process Safety Management Program\n\n\n\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that BWC Corcoran Yard has updated their unified RMP-PSM Program. This program has been prepared to address the risks involved in operating and maintaining the following process which have the presence of hazardous chemicals above threshold quantities: \n\n\n\nProcess Name                 Process Chemical   Process Quantity(lbs.)\n\nAmmonia Storage and Reactor  Anhydrous Ammonia  84,000\n\n\n\nOur RMP-PSM program promotes overall plant, worker, and public safety. The program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of hazardous chemicals. Overall, the program is designed to prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, illnesses and physical property damage.\n\nOur company has many policies and procedures in place to promote overall plant, worker and public safety. We have: \n\n1. Prepared a unified program based on the PSM plan to meet CalARP and RMP obligations as well\n\n2. Organized"

Utilized PSMWriter software to ensure that all necessary employees have access to relevant information (SOPs, PHAs, audits, etc.)\n\n\n\nThe RMP-PSM program sets forth rules, procedures and practices that will help our employees and neighbors protect themselves.\n\n\n\n1.2 Process Description\n\n\n\nButtonwillow Warehouse Company - Corcoran Yard is an ammonium polyphosphate production facility which requires the storage and use of anhydrous ammonia. The ammonium polyphosphate production process operates as follows:anhydrous ammonia is pumped from a large storage tank through piping and valves into the heat exchanger where the liquid ammonia is heated as it is used to cool ammonium polyphosphate. From there, the liquid ammonia continues to the reactor where it is mixed with super phosphoric acid. A chemical reaction occurs in the reactor which results in the formation of ammonium polyphosphate.\n\n\n\n1.3 General Accident Release & Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\n1.3.1 General \n\n\n\nWe inform our employees engaged in process operations of the dangers of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia in annual safety meetings. During these meeting we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\n\n\n\nBWC Corcoran Yard has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the ammonia storage process. These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release. The results of the analyses are reported in PSMWriter and hard copy binders. \n\n\n\n1.3.2 Anhydrous Ammonia\n\nThe ammonia storage process at the BWC Corcoran Yard facility is an integral part of the overall business and operates most of the year. The ammonia process contains a total charge of approximately 84,000 lbs. It is extremely important that this process is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner. Management is co"

Under this plan we will call emergency personnel and evacuate the facility. All response activities would be done in coordination with the Local Fire Department and their Hazardous Materials Response Team. \n\n\n\nEvery year we review with our employees our evacuation procedures in the event of an emergency, including a hazardous chemical release.\n\n\n\n1.6 Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nBWC Corcoran Yard has implemented many policies and procedures to promote overall plant, worker and public safety. Nevertheless, BWC Corcoran Yard continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.\n\n\n\nBy utilizing PSMWriter software, all necessary employees have access to every aspect of the RMP-PSM program. This has improved BWC Corcoran Yard's ability to communicate hazardous situations to employees and contractors. In addition, PSMWriter tracks all RMP-PSM related events so that BWC Corcoran Yard's management team can ensure that the RMP-PSM program is being implemented.\n\n\n\nBWC Corcoran Yard has implemented all aspects of the RMP-PSM program.

It is an interactive framework that guides safe action for BWC Corcoran Yard employees, but allows for feedback and continual improvement. Through the RMP-PSM program BWC Corcoran Yard will continue to maintain overall plant worker and public safety. \n\n"
