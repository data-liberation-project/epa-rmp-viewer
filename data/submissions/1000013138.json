Tulsa, OK 74117. The management and employees at the 56th Street North facility are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of Hydrogen. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate the release and minimize the impact of the release to the surrounding community and environment.\n\n\n\nThe primary function of this facility is the packaging, storage and distribution of liquefied and compressed gases in cylinders and bulk delivery transport vehicles. The most critical of these functions is the storage and transfilling of hydrogen. Liquefied hydrogen is delivered to this location via bulk transport vehicle and is placed inside a 15,750 gallon vertical bulk storage tank located on the east side of the facility. The liquefied hydrogen is vaporized and compressed into compressed gas cylinders and compressed gas cylinder trailers, both of which are manufactured to DOT specifications.\n\n\n\nPortable compressed gas cylinders of various s, holding up to 330 cubic feet of gaseous hydrogen, are filled inside a stand-alone flammable gas filling building. Empty hydrogen cylinders are stored inside concrete flammable storage bunkers located on the north portion of the property. Pryor to filling, all cylinders are inspected for correct color, proper valve, pressure rating and various DOT markings. Once filled, they are stored inside concrete flammable gas containment bunkers on the north portion of the property where they await shipment to Airgas retail facilities. Flammable gas containment bunkers are designed so that, in case of an emergency event such as a leak or fire, the event will be contained within a single bunker, therefore not impacting other hydrogen or hazardous material processes. \n\n\n\nH"

      "SummaryText": "ydrogen cylinder trailers containing multiple large DOT specification compressed gas cylinders are filled in designated fill bays located on the east side of the property. Hydrogen trailers are capable of holding up to 141,866 cu. ft. (739 lbs.) of gaseous hydrogen, depending on . Empty hydrogen tube trailers are stored directly north of the hydrogen tube trailer fill bays located on the east side of the property. Once trailers are filled, they are stored briefly on the west side of the property before being transported to customer locations.\n\n\n\nConsidering the hydrogen storage and filling processes, the Process Hazard Analysis Team determined the following to be the most likely worst case and alternative release scenarios:\n\n\n\n-  Hydrogen Worst Case Scenario A? Uncontrolled, complete loss of 15,750 gallon hydrogen storage tank. Using RMP*Comp, the distance to endpoint for a Vapor Cloud Explosion is 0.2 miles with an ambient temperature of 77&#730; and wind speed of 3.4 miles/hour.\n\n\n\n-  Hydrogen Alternative Scenario A? Uncontrolled release of 11,519 cu. ft. (60 lbs. of gaseous hydrogen from a single tube on the largest hydrogen compressed gas (tube) cylinder trailer in the fleet. Using RMP*Comp, it was determined that the distance from release point to 1 psi overpressure is approximately 0.03 miles with an ambient temperature of 77&#730; and wind speed of 6.7 miles/hour.\n\n\n\nAirgas Mid South manages the safety of regulated processes by means of operating procedures, equipment testing and inspections, safety devices (e.g. alarms, shutdowns, instrumentation, relief devices) inherent to the design of the facility and other controls and systems designed to prevent accidental release of hazardous chemicals. Safe work practices and training of our personnel supplement the inherent safe design of the plant.\n\n\n\nOur emergency response plan includes procedures for notifying the local fire department hazardous materials response unit so that the appropriate measures can be take"

      "SummaryText": "n by local emergency response personnel to control accidental releases.\n\n\n\nThis document has been prepared in accordance with EPA's RMP regulation (40 CFR, part 68). The substances and processes considered during the preparation of this RMP and the scenarios described were selected based on criteria established in the regulation.\n\n\n\nBecause this is a newly operated facility for Airgas, there have been no accidents involving or accidental releases of product that have resulted in death, injury or property damage on site. \n\n\n\nAt this site, employees are trained to recognize emergencies and initiate response from outside agencies. Employees and contractors are trained on the emergency response plan prior to commencement of work. The emergency response plan is tested and reviewed twice a year to insure it is current. \n\n\n\nDuring the Process Hazard Analysis, which included a thorough review of process equipment and procedures, a number of action items were identified to improve the overall safety for this facility. Implementing each of these items will be an ongoing process which we hope to complete no later than June 30, 2010.\n\n"
