The plant refrigeration system is continuously computer monitored including alarms and therefore staff can respond to any system alarms.  An ammonia detection system within the compressor room and warehouse rooms is in place which alarms if ammonia is sensed and shuts down the refrigeration system.  The ammonia refrigeration system is also protected by specific safety systems/hardware and safety cutouts including pressure, temperature and level control.  Safety relief valves protect the compressor discharge and vessels from the hazards associated with overpressure.  \r\n\r\nAccidental release prevention program:  \r\n\r\nAll elements of the PSM/RMP are followed and the process has numerous safe guards including:  \r\n\u00bf\tAmmonia is not corrosive in this service.    \r\n\u00bf\tIn areas where forklifts are utilized, all ammonia lines are elevated to eliminate any contact.    \r\n\u00bf\tThe plant has an overall safety program that includes employee awareness and training to minimize the potential for an accident or incident involving the ammonia refrigeration equipment.  \r\n\u00bf\tA process hazard analysis (PHA) was conducted in 2019.  A team with expertise in engineering, operations, maintenance, and safety evaluated the existing refrigeration system in depth and developed recommendations to improve the safety and operability of the system.  The PHA addressed: (1) process hazards; (2) previous incidents (none reportable); (3) engineering and administrative controls applicable to the hazards; (4) the consequence of control failure; (5) facility siting; (6) human factors; and (7) a qualitative evaluation of possible safety and health effects of control system failures.  \r\n\u00bf\tWritten Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) were prepared to provide the basis for proper and safe operation of the a"

      "SummaryText": "Hanson Logistics - Hartford Division facility located in Hartford, Michigan is a cold storage warehouse that has a closed loop refrigeration system containing ammonia. The primary purpose of this warehouse is to store products for various companies at either subzero temperatures or at refrigerator temperature to preserve and / or extend the life of the product.  \r\n\r\n\r\nRegulated substance handled: \r\n\r\nAmmonia is the only covered chemical at the plant and is used at the warehouse to refrigerate rooms to maintain a correct temperature as required by the customer.  Ammonia is a valuable chemical used in the warehouse refrigeration system, providing the means to maintain specified temperature and / or remove heat from the products being handled.  Ammonia is contained in equipment in the warehouse and is compressed, condensed and evaporated to remove heat from rooms within the warehouse.\r\n\r\nSince ammonia is classified by EPA as a toxic chemical, it is necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling the chemical to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the health threat to our own workers, and reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle ammonia combined with the safety devices inherent in the design of this plant.  \r\n\r\nAccidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\r\n\r\nIt is the intent of this facility to comply with OSHA's Process Safety Management and EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations. \r\n\r\nThe plant ammonia refrigeration operators are trained using various methods such as on the job training and contractor explanation and training (refrigeration contractors are members of IIAR) and off-site classes if warranted.  This program consists of having an effective preventative maintenance program and employee training to insure adequate response to equipment integrity.

The SOPs include procedures for normal operations, startup, shutdown, emergency operations, and emergency shutdown.  \r\n\u00bf\tFor plant projects, a management of change procedure and a pre-startup safety review are in place to ensure that system changes or expansions are safe and that the changes are consistent with the engineering design and in condition to be operated prior to startup.  \r\n\u00bf\tContractors that are used to work on, or adjacent to, the refrigeration system are pre-qualified based upon their knowledge of ammonia refrigeration, understanding of applicable codes and standards, and their demonstrated ability to work safely.  Each of these contractors is evaluated from a safety perspective.  \r\n\u00bf\tThe plant has a program for replacement of all pressure relief valves every five years.\r\n \r\nFive year accident history: \r\n\r\nThe plant has had no reportable RMP qualifying releases in the past five-year history.  \r\n&#8195;\r\nEmergency response program:  \r\n\r\nThe plant has an emergency response program based upon federal guidelines as they apply to this facility.  The Emergency Action Plan (EAP) includes in-house response capabilities in the event of a small release, evacuation procedures if warranted, procedures for notification of the local fire authority, local emergency response agencies.
