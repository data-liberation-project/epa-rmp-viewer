The Facility Policy:\r\nThe owners, management, and employees of Poole Chemical A\u00bf Oakley, KS are committed to the\r\nprevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the\r\nfacility is prepared to work with the local fire department, and other authorities, to mitigate any release and\r\nminimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\r\n2. Facility Information:\r\nA\u00b7 Anhydrous ammonia is received, in rail cars until it can be converted to fertilizer.\r\nA\u00b7 The maximum quantity stored would be 157590 pounds in a 36,000 gallon rail car. Due to the rounding\r\nrequirements of the RMP Submit Program the 157590 pounds is rounded to 160000 pounds.\r\n3. The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario:\r\na. The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a tank car released as a gas\r\nover 10 minutes. The maximum quantity released would be 157590 pounds, which represents the volume of\r\nthe largest rail car at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards. Due to the rounding requirements\r\nof the RMP Submit Program the 157590 pounds is rounded to 160000 pounds. The distance to the endpoint\r\n(point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 2.6 miles.\r\nb. The alternative release scenario based on the five-year accident history (or the most likely potential\r\nincident) is a release from a break in a transfer hose. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200\r\nppm) is 1.1 miles.\r\n4. The accidental release prevention program:\r\nThe facility has referred to the provisions of A\u00bfSafety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of\r\nAnhydrous Ammonia, Kk-611., published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the\r\nstandards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, A\u00bfStorage and\r\nhandling of Anhydrous AmmoniaA\u00bf.\r\n5.

There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\r\nA\u00b7 Have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor\r\nA\u00b7 To our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property\r\ndamage, or environmental damage.\r\n6. The Emergency Response Program:\r\nThe facility has:\r\na. A written Emergency Action Plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38;\r\nb. Provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as\r\nrequired under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\r\nc. A written emergency response program, in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.120, including preemergency\r\nplanning and employee training.\r\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety:\r\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the\r\nmaintenance of safe conditions. There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety\r\nrecommendations for implementation at this time."
