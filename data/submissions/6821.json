Part of CHAMPION'S RMP compliance philosophy has been the reduction of the use of hazardous substances covered under this regulation. When a hazardous substance is used, CHAMPION considers the potential for this substance to adversely affect CHAMPION workers, the public, and the environment and takes steps to prevent any such effects.\n\nCHAMPION works to prevents releases of the hazardous substances used at the facility.  When a hazardous substance is used at CHAMPION, the equipment is designed, built, and operated to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release.  Industry and government standards are adhered to in the design, construction, and operation of the equipment.\n\nCHAMPION limits damage from a release, if such a release occurs.  CHAMPION trains workers to respond to an accidental release, reducing the consequences of a release if it occurs.  In addition, CHAMPION works with the local fire department and with the local emergency planning committee (LEPC) to help ensure that injuries and/or environmental damage will not occur if a release does occur.\n\nThe safety program at CHAMPION consists of a number of elements, only some of which are required by the RMP rule.  This RMPlan is primarily intended to describe those parts of the safety program at CHAMPION that are required by the RMP rule.\n\n1.1 Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nCHAMPION is committed to the safety of workers and the public, and the preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  CHAMPION implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances.  These controls include training programs for personnel; programs to help ensure safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of processes at CHAMPION; and programs to evaluate the hazards at CHAMPION.\n\nIn the event of an accidenta"

Executive Summary \n\nChampion International Corporation (CHAMPION) is committed to operating in a manner that is safe for CHAMPION workers, the public, and the environment. As a demonstration of that commitment, CHAMPION has developed and implemented Environmental and Workplace Health and Safety Policies to serve as guiding principles for all it's employees and operations. The Environmental Policy includes the following:\n\nCHAMPION strives to minimize the environmental impacts of all our operations, processes, and products in a manner responsive to the needs of our shareholders, customers, employees, the communities in which we operate, and the public.\n\nThe Workplace Health and Safety Policy further includes:\n\nThe protection of our people and property as well as the prevention of all accidents, injuries, and illnesses, are core values at Champion International Corporation. As such, they are also key considerations in everything we do. Our success depends greatly on a work environment that is safe and healthy for all employees, visitors, contractors, and the residents of the communities in which we operate.\n\nCHAMPION believes that following these policies is the responsibility of every employee. CHAMPION has put in place an organizational structure to demonstrate its commitment to that belief. At the corporate level, the Senior Vice President of Environment, Health, and Safety reports directly to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.

One component of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at CHAMPION and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMPlan) describing the risk management program at CHAMPION.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMPlan requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at CHAMPION.\nThe risk management program at CHAMPION consists of three elements:\n\n1. a hazard assessment to help understand the potential offsite consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and a history of accidents that have occurred during the last five years associated with the use of substances regulated by the RMP rule (regulated substances) - see topics 1.3 and 1.5\n2. a prevention program to help maintain and safely operate the processes containing more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance (covered processes) - see topic 1.4\n3. an emergency response program to help respond to accidental releases of regulated substances from covered processes - see topic 1.6\n\nInformation further describing these elements is provided in this RMPlan.\n\nAlthough the risk management program at CHAMPION helps provide assurance that the facility is maintained and operated in a safe manner, it is only one component of the safety program at CHAMPION.  In fact, CHAMPION has a comprehensive safety program in place establishing many levels of safeguards against release of a hazardous substance and injuries and damage from a release of a hazardous substance.\n\nCHAMPION limits the use of hazardous substances."

The alternative release scenarios were selected to help the local emergency planning committee improve community emergency response plans.  An alternative release scenario represents a release that (1) might occur at a facility like CHAMPION's and (2) would result in the greatest potential offsite consequences if the release occurred.  While CHAMPION believes that such releases are unlikely to occur at our mill, nevertheless we have evaluated the offsite impact of the releases in accordance with the regulatory requirements.  It is important to note that no release with offsite consequences has ever occurred at CHAMPION's Pensacola Mill.\n\nCHAMPION has conducted the offsite consequence analysis for the worst-case release scenario using the EPA's guidance document which includes look-up tables that were developed to provide highest estimate of the possible offsite consequences of such releases. The main objective of performing the offsite consequence analysis is to determine the distance at which certain effects might occur to the public because of an accidental release (called the endpoint distance).  The tables were developed to provide information on the estimated distance to the toxic endpoint for a chemical of concern. CHAMPION has not conducted a more detailed analysis of these scenarios because we believe the potential for such releases is unlikely and because more refined analysis of such events will not provide additional information that would be useful.\n\nWhile the tables provide the required data to meet regulatory requirements, they do not provide detailed information on the travel time or concentration of the chemical in the plume.  CHAMPION believes such data can be valuable to local emergency planning agencies for alternative release scenarios and therefore has elected to conduct air quality modeling to characterize offsite impacts due to alternative release scenarios.

CHAMPION maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to help ensure safe operation of the covered processes.  These documents address (1) physical properties of hazardous substances handled in these processes, (2) operating parameters of the equipment/process and (3) design basis and configuration of the equipment in a part.  This process safety information is available to all CHAMPION employees, and the local emergency planning committee (LEPC).\n\nMaterial safety data sheets (MSDSs) document the properties of hazardous substances handled at CHAMPION, including regulated substances in covered processes.

TRACE has the capability to model ground level or elevated releases in the form of dense clouds or buoyant plumes. SCREEN3 was used to simulate the release of chlorine dioxide due to a loss of scrubber water flow in the bleach plant control system.  TRACE was used to evaluate the release of chlorine dioxide due to a leak in a chlorine dioxide transfer pipe.\n\nTypical information input to the model to characterize a chemical release is:\n\n* Physical State:  gas, liquid, aerosol, and multi-phased\n* Release Type:  continuous, instantaneous, point (stack releases), and area (releases from a pool)\n* Release Condition:  height, substrate type (concrete, soil), area and height of berm, exit velocity, release diameter, and exit temperature\n* Chemical Properties:  molecular weight, specific gravity, vapor pressure, density, latent heat, and other properties depending upon the model\n\nIn addition to the physical parameters that characterize a release, meteorological data is needed by the model to characterize the ambient relea"

Meteorological data is used in dispersion models to calculate the distance that the pollutant plume moves downwind and the concentration of the pollutant at any given time or distance.  The meteorological variables that affect the dispersion of a chemical release are as follows:\n\n* Wind Speed and Direction: The wind speed is used to determine the plume dilution, plume transport, plume rise, evaporation rate, and magnitude of the concentration.  Wind direction defines the direction in which the plume travels.\n* Temperature:  Temperature is used to calculate plume rise and evaporation rates.\n* Atmospheric Pressure: is used to calculate gas and liquid release rates.\n* Atmospheric Stability: Stability is an indication of atmospheric turbulence.  The turbulence is depended upon thermal (heating of the ground) and mechanical (surface roughness and wind speed) effects.  Turbulence also acts to dilute the plume and reduce concentrations.  \n\n\nFor the RMP modeling performed the following meteorological parameters were used for the alternate release scenarios: \n\nWind Speed:\t\t\t3 m/s\nAmbient Temperature: \t\t68 deg F\nSolar Radiation:\t\t0.3 KW/m2\nHumidity:\t\t\t50%\nStability Class:\t\tD\n\nThe main objective of performing the offsite consequence analysis is to determine the distance at which certain effects might occur to the public because of an accidental release (called the endpoint distance).  The following effects could occur at the endpoint distance.  At distances less than the endpoint distance, the effects would be greater; at distances greater than the endpoint distance, the effects would be less.\n\nWhen considering the release of a toxic substance, most people at the endpoint distance would be able to walk away from the exposure without any long-term health consequences, although some short-term consequences (e.g., strong eye or throat irritation) are likely.  Some people who are particularly susceptible to the substance released could be incapacitated.\n\nThe RMP ru"

These requirements are:\n\n* one worst-case release scenario for each Program 1 process.\n* one worst-case release scenario for the class of toxic substances in Program 2 and Program 3 processes (i.e., one scenario representing ClO2 Generation and Distribution)\n* one alternative release scenario for each of the toxic substances in a Program 2 or Program 3 process (i.e., ClO2 Generation and Distribution) \n* one worst-case and one alternative release scenario for the class of flammable substances in Program 2 and Program 3 processes.\n\nThe following information summarizes the offsite consequence analysis performed by CHAMPION. \n\n1.3.1 Program 3 Processes - Toxic Substances\n\nThe worst-case release scenario for toxic substances is rupture of the 172,000-gal (714-ton) chlorine dioxide solution (1.2 wt%) storage tank in the Chlorine Dioxide Generation and Distribution Process.  This scenario would result in offsite consequences.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for chlorine dioxide is an expansion or pipe joint leak in the chlorine dioxide distribution piping leading to the bleaching process.  This scenario assumes that 3600 gal. (15 tons) of solution is released in a 30 minute period.  This scenario could result in very minor offsite consequences.\n\n1.4 Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-specific Prevention \n\nThe Pensacola Mill has always focused on ways to prevent accidental releases of hazardous substances. Beginning in 1992, CHAMPION formally implemented the 14 elements of OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) prevention program. In 1996, the EPA RMP rule established two levels of prevention program requirements.  CHAMPION has implemented the prevention program requirements, which are as follows:\n\nProgram 3 level processes - essentially the same as OSHA PSM, except that the program also focuses on protecting the public and the environ"

A team composed of personnel with engineering and process operating experience and a leader with process hazard analyses experience is assembled to analyze the hazards of the process.  CHAMPION primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) technique, supplemented with checklists, to perform this analysis.  The PHA team prepares a written report describing the results of the analysis, including a list of recommendations.  Responsibility to resolve the recommendations is assigned to area personnel and, when appropriate, changes to enhance the safety of the process are implemented.\n\n3\tOperating Procedures.  CHAMPION operators, process engineers and supervisors work together to develop and maintain operating procedures to define how tasks related to process operations should be safely performed.  The operating procedures (1) are used to train employees and (2) serve as reference guides for appropriate actions to take during both normal operations and process upsets.\n\nCHAMPION personnel develop and maintain operating procedures that cover all phases of operations, including initial startup, normal operations, normal shutdown, emergency shutdown, startup following a turnaround or emergency shutdown, and temporary operations.  The operating procedures are used both to help in operating the covered processes and as a training guide for both new and experienced operators.  Operating procedures are updated at least annually to ensure they reflect current operating conditions.\n\n4.\tTraining. The mill trains workers to perform their assigned tasks safely and effectively. The CHAMPION training program includes both initial and refresher training that covers (1) a general overview of the process, (2) the properties and hazards of the substances in the process, and (3) a detailed review of the process operating procedures and safe work practices.

Recommendations from the operators are reviewed, and changes to the training program are implemented, as appropriate.\n\n5.\tMechanical Integrity.  CHAMPION maintains the mechanical integrity of process equipment to help prevent equipment failures that could endanger workers, the public, or the environment.  This is accomplished by: (1) an inspection and testing program to help identify equipment deterioration and damage before the equipment fails, (2) a quality assurance program to help ensure that new and replacement equipment meet the design standards required for service in the covered processes and (3) utilizing personnel who are specially trained to maintain process equipment.  \n\n6.\tManagement of Change.  The CHAMPION management of change program evaluates and approves all proposed changes to chemicals, equipment, and procedures for a covered process to help ensure that the change does not negatively affect safe operations. Process changes that are determined to be a replacement in kind (e.g., replacing a valve with an identical valve) are allowed without completing a management of change form.  All other changes must be reviewed through the full management of change program, to help ensure that inadvertent consequences of process changes are prevented, safety consequences of changes are addressed, affected process safety information and procedures are updated, and affected employees are notified of the changes.\n\n7.\tPre-startup Review.  CHAMPION performs a safety review of a new or modified process before the process is placed into service to help ensure that the process is safe to operate.  This review confirms that an employee has completed the requisite training.  The review also confirms that adequate safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency proc"

Training in the use of the Hot Work Permit Form is included in the CHAMPION safe work practices orientation.\n\n12.\tContractors.  CHAMPION has established Contractor Guidelines for Safety and Health to outline expectations related to contractor work, at Pensacola Mill including work on the covered processes.  The program reviews the safety record of all contractors to help ensure that CHAMPION only hires contractors who can safely perform the desired job tasks.  CHAMPION explains to the contract supervisors the hazards of the process on which they and their employees will work, CHAMPION safe work practices, and CHAMPION emergency response procedures.  CHAMPION requires that the contractor supervisors also train each of their employees prior to beginning their work on a covered process.  CHAMPION periodically reviews contractors' training documents and work performance to help ensure that safe practices are followed. \n\n1.4.2 Program 2 Prevention Program\n\nThere are no Program 2 processes at CHAMPION's Pensacola Mill.\n\n1.4.3 Chemical-specific Prevention Steps\n\nIn addition to the required prevention program elements, CHAMPION has implemented safety features specific to the hazardous substances used at CHAMPION.
