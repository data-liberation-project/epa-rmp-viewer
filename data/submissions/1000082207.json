Retraining is conducted annually.\n\n\n\nThe facility maintains an Emergency Procedure Manual that contains specific procedures for employees to take in the event of an emergency or accidental release. This information also contains the names and numbers of responding outside agencies.  Emergency actions and response for flammable releases have been coordinated with Tualatin Valley Fire Department.  \n\n\n\n1.6 Planned changes to improve safety:\n\n\n\nThe facility resolves recommendations from PHA and Incident Investigations, some of which may result in modifications to the plant design and operating procedures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n "
