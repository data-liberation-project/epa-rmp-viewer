The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the stationary source:\n\nThe management and employees of this facility are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia through the use of proper equipment, regular inspections, maintenance and training of all persons that work with anhydrous ammonia. Should an accidental release occur, this facility has worked with the Emergency Response Team onsite and the Apache County Local Emergency Planning Committee so they can plan for response to a release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment. \n\n\n\nB.  The stationary source and regulated substances handled:\n\nThe primary activity at this facility is generation of electricity. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for use in a Selective Catalytic Reduction System for NOx reduction.\n\n\n\nC.  The general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\nThis facility complies with the various rules and regulations governing the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia including ANSI K61.1, OSHA 29 CFR 1910.111 and regulations administered by our state agency. Training is provided on safe anhydrous ammonia operations for employees.\n\n\n\nD.  The five-year accident history:\n\nThere have been no accidents in the past five years.\n\n\n\nE.  The emergency response program:\n\nThis facility has a written emergency plan in accordance with OSHA Standards 29 CFR 1910.38 and 1910.120. Emergency planning and community right-to-know information is provided to the state emergency response commission, local emergency planning committee and local fire department as required by SARA Title III of EPCRA. \n\n\n\nF.  Planned changes to improve safety.\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at this facility. Periodic inspections and evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe practices and operations. There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommen"
