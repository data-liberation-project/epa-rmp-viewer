We shall, as a minimum: (1) consult with employees and their representatives on the conduct and development of the process hazard review and other elements of the risk management plan, and (2) provide to our employees and their representatives access to the process hazard review and all other information required to be developed under that standard.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe City of Galveston believes that preventative maintenance is the key to minimizing the potential for accidental releases.  Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) have been reviewed and revised to enable the employees to perform their work in a safe and efficient manner.\n\nThe EPA has adopted a policy for non-responding facilities (another entity has agreed in advance to respond to the release).  This facility is a non-responding facility.  The City of Galveston Fire Department is the first responder.\n\nThis emergency response program does not include responses to incidental releases of hazardous substances, including chlorine and sulfur dioxide, where the substances can be ?adsorbed, neutralized, or otherwise controlled at the time of the release by employees in the immediate release area, or by maintenance personnel?.\n\nThe City of Galveston has taken steps to train the operators, supervisors, and maintenance crews to be knowledgeable in the emergency response program.

Above all, all employees know where the phone numbers of the first responders are located should a release occur.\nThe Airport Wastewater Treatment Plant utilizes chlorine for disinfection and sulfur dioxide for dechlorination of the treated wastewater.\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis includes a worst-case release scenario and an alternative release scenario as defined in 40 C.F.R. 68.  A dense-gas dispersion model (SLAB) was used to determine endpoint distances for both scenarios.  A dense-gas model is required since both chlorine and sulfur dioxide are heavier than air.\n\nThe City of Galveston has implemented a General Accidental Release Prevention Program to minimize releases.  This Program includes:  safety information on the covered chemicals, hazard reviews, operating and maintenance procedures, training, compliance audits, incident investigations, and emergency response procedures.\n\nFive-year Accident History\n\nIn the last 5 years, there have not been any accidental releases from the covered processes that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering-in-place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe city will address the recommendations of the process hazards assessment for all areas of the prevention program and the emergency response program.\n\n\n                     ENERCON SERVICES, INC.\n\n                  8866 Gulf Freeway, Suite 380\n\n                      Houston, Texas 77017\n\n                         (713) 941-0401\n\n                       (713) 941-0402 Fax\n\n                                \n\n                                \n\n                                \n\n                                \n\n                                \n\n                      RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN\n\n                                \n\n                "

For the overall reaction  between\n\n       sulfur  dioxide  and  chlorine, the stoichiometric  weight\n\n       ratio  of  sulfur  dioxide  to  chlorine  is  0.9:1.    In\n\n       practice, it has been found that about 1.0 mg/l of  sulfur\n\n       dioxide  will  be required for the dechlorination  of  1.0\n\n       mg/l  chlorine residual.  Because the reactions of  sulfur\n\n       dioxide   and   chlorine   and  chloramines   are   nearly\n\n       instantaneous, contact time is usually not  a  factor  and\n\n       contact  chambers  are not used, but  rapid  and  positive\n\n       mixing   at  the  point  of  application  is  an  absolute\n\n       requirement.\n\n\n\n           The  various reactions involved in the sulfur  dioxide\n\n       dechlorination  process  are  shown  below.    The   first\n\n       reaction  is  the  formation  of  sulfurous  acid  in  the\n\n       sulfonator inductor:\n\n\n\n           SO2 + H2O  H2SO3\n\n\n\n        The  sulfurous  acid  reacts with  the  various  chlorine\n\nresidual species as follows:\n\n\n\n           HOCl + H2SO3  HCl + H2SO4\n\n           NH2Cl + H2SO3 + H2O  NH4Cl + H2SO4\n\n           NHCl2 + 2H2SO3 + 2H2O  NH4Cl + HCl + 2H2SO4\n\n           NCl3 + 3H2SO3 + 3H2O  NH4Cl + 2HCl + 3H2SO4\n\n\n\n           These  equations  illustrate  that  all  the  chlorine\n\n       species  can  be dechlorinated with SO2 .   The  equations\n\n       also  illustrate that acids are produced which can  affect\n\n       the  alkalinity  and  possibly  pH.   For  each  part   of\n\n       chlorine   removed,  2.8  mg/l  alkalinity  as  CaCO3   is\n\n       consumed.\n\n\n\n           The stoichiometric relationship requires 0.9 parts SO2\n\n       to  remove  1.0  part of chlorine residual.

PROCESS HAZARD REVIEW\n\n\n\n    A  Process  Hazard  Review  was  conducted  to  identify  the\n\nfollowing:\n\n\n\n   ?    The hazards associated with the chlorine and sulfur dioxide\n\n      processes;\n\n   ?    Opportunities for equipment malfunction or human error that\n\n      could cause a release;\n\n   ?     Safeguards that will control the hazards or prevent  the\n\n      malfunction or error; and\n\n   ?    Steps to detect or monitor releases.\n\n\n\n   A  What-if  and  Checklist Analysis was used  to  conduct  the\n\n   review.    The  review  team  utilized  the  What-if  Analysis\n\n   technique  to  brainstorm the various types of accidents  that\n\n   could  occur  within the chlorine and sulfur dioxide  systems.\n\n   Then the team used one or more checklists to help fill in  any\n\n   gaps that were missed.\n\n\n\n   The What-if questions covered the following areas:\n\n\n\n   ?    Movement of containers;\n\n   ?    Piping from containers to header lines;\n\n   ?    Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide headers in the Chlorination and\n\n   Sulfonation Rooms;\n\n   ?    Piping from Chlorination and Sulfonation Rooms to inductors;\n\n   and\n\n   ?    General areas.\n\n\n\n   The Checklists covered the following areas:\n\n\n\n   ?    Process Safety Information;\n\n   ?    Operating Procedures;\n\n   ?    Training;\n\n   ?    Incident Investigation;\n\n   ?    Emergency Planning and Response; and\n\n   ?

All   employees\n\n        should note the wind direction and move up-wind or cross-\n\n        wind to a release of either chlorine or sulfur dioxide.\n\n\n\n     B. TYPES OF EVACUATION\n\n\n\n              In the event of a release, employees will either be\n\n        required to evacuate the plant or be sheltered in  place.\n\n        This  will be dependent upon wind direction, severity  of\n\n        the  release, and in what part of the plant  the  release\n\n        has occurred.\n\n\n\n     C.  EMERGENCY EVACUATION AND SHELTERING\n\n\n\n              In  the  event  of  an  emergency,  the  Operations\n\n        Manager or his designee will determine if employees  will\n\n        need to evacuate the plant or be sheltered in place.   If\n\n        evacuation  is necessary, employees will be  directed  to\n\n        report to one of the four following fencelines:\n\n\n\n        ?    North,\n\n        ?    East,\n\n        ?    West, or\n\n        ?    South\n\n\n\n              Evacuation  to  these locations will  be  dependent\n\n        upon  wind  direction and where a release  has  occurred.\n\n        Evacuation routes to these locations have been posted  at\n\n        locations throughout the plant and are noted on the  site\n\n        map  that is included with this Emergency Response  Plan.\n\n        Employees  will  not be allowed to return  to  the  plant\n\n        until  they have been directed to do so by the Operations\n\n        Manager or one of his designates.\n\n\n\n             If sheltering in place is necessary, employees will\n\n        be directed to report to the following location:\n\n\n\n        ?    The Operations Building\n\n\n\n             Employees are to remain in the Operations Building\n\n     "
