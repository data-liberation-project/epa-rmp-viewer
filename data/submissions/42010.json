      "SummaryText": "Sulfur dioxide gas successfully removes free chlorine,\r\n       monochloramine,  dichloramine, nitrogen  trichloride,  and\r\n       poly-n-chlor compounds.  For the overall reaction  between\r\n       sulfur  dioxide  and  chlorine, the stoichiometric  weight\r\n       ratio  of  sulfur  dioxide  to  chlorine  is  0.9:1.    In\r\n       practice, it has been found that about 1.0 mg/l of  sulfur\r\n       dioxide  will  be required for the dechlorination  of  1.0\r\n       mg/l  chlorine residual.  Because the reactions of  sulfur\r\n       dioxide   and   chlorine   and  chloramines   are   nearly\r\n       instantaneous, contact time is usually not  a  factor  and\r\n       contact  chambers  are not used, but  rapid  and  positive\r\n       mixing   at  the  point  of  application  is  an  absolute\r\n       requirement.\r\n\r\n           The  various reactions involved in the sulfur  dioxide\r\n       dechlorination  process  are  shown  below.    The   first\r\n       reaction  is  the  formation  of  sulfurous  acid  in  the\r\n       sulfonator inductor:\r\n\r\n           SO2 + H2O  H2SO3\r\n\r\n        The  sulfurous  acid  reacts with  the  various  chlorine\r\nresidual species as follows:\r\n\r\n           HOCl + H2SO3  HCl + H2SO4\r\n           NH2Cl + H2SO3 + H2O  NH4Cl + H2SO4\r\n           NHCl2 + 2H2SO3 + 2H2O  NH4Cl + HCl + 2H2SO4\r\n           NCl3 + 3H2SO3 + 3H2O  NH4Cl + 2HCl + 3H2SO4\r\n\r\n           These  equations  illustrate  that  all  the  chlorine\r\n       species  can  be dechlorinated with SO2 .   The  equations\r\n       also  illustrate that acids are produced which can  affect\r\n       the  alkalinity  and  possibly  pH.   For  each  part   of\r\n       chlorine   removed,  2.8  mg/l  alkalinity  as  CaCO3   is\r\n       consumed.\r\n\r\n           The stoichiometric relationship requires 0.9 parts SO2\r\n       to  remove  1.0  part of chlorine residual.

We shall, as a minimum: (1) consult with employees and their representatives on the conduct and development of the process hazard review and other elements of the risk management plan, and (2) provide to our employees and their representatives access to the process hazard review and all other information required to be developed under that standard.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe City of Galveston believes that preventative maintenance is the key to minimizing the potential for accidental releases.  Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) have been reviewed and revised to enable the employees to perform their work in a safe and efficient manner.\n\nThe EPA has adopted a policy for non-responding facilities (another entity has agreed in advance to respond to the release).  This facility is a non-responding facility.  The City of Galveston Fire Department is the first responder.\n\nThis emergency response program does not include responses to incidental releases of hazardous substances, including chlorine and sulfur dioxide, where the substances can be \u00bfadsorbed, neutralized, or otherwise controlled at the time of the release by employees in the immediate release area, or by maintenance personnel\u00bf.\n\nThe City of Galveston has taken steps to train the operators, supervisors, and maintenance crews to be knowledgeable in the emergency response program.

Above all, all employees know where the phone numbers of the first responders are located should a release occur.\nThe Airport Wastewater Treatment Plant utilizes chlorine for disinfection and sulfur dioxide for dechlorination of the treated wastewater.\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis includes a worst-case release scenario and an alternative release scenario as defined in 40 C.F.R. 68.  A dense-gas dispersion model (SLAB) was used to determine endpoint distances for both scenarios.  A dense-gas model is required since both chlorine and sulfur dioxide are heavier than air.\n\nThe City of Galveston has implemented a General Accidental Release Prevention Program to minimize releases.  This Program includes:  safety information on the covered chemicals, hazard reviews, operating and maintenance procedures, training, compliance audits, incident investigations, and emergency response procedures.\n\nFive-year Accident History\n\nIn the last 5 years, there have not been any accidental releases from the covered processes that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering-in-place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe city will address the recommendations of the process hazards assessment for all areas of the prevention program and the emergency response program.\n\r\n                     ENERCON SERVICES, INC.\r\n                  8866 Gulf Freeway, Suite 380\r\n                      Houston, Texas 77017\r\n                         (713) 941-0401\r\n                       (713) 941-0402 Fax\r\n                                \r\n                                \r\n                                \r\n                                \r\n                                \r\n                      RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN"

PURPOSE AND SCOPE\r\n\r\n     The  City  of Galveston has developed this written Emergency\r\n     Response  Plan  for the Airport Wastewater  Treatment  Plant\r\n     (AWWTP)  to  provide guidance for responding  to  accidental\r\n     releases  of chlorine and/or sulfur dioxide.  The  plan  was\r\n     developed in accordance with Title 40 of the Code of Federal\r\n     Regulations (40 CFR), Part 68, Subpart E. Emergency response\r\n     procedures  are necessary because accidents can occur,  even\r\n     with  the best safety programs in place.  Emergency response\r\n     is  to be undertaken to reduce the severity of a release and\r\n     protect employees, emergency responders, and the public from\r\n     harmful exposure to chlorine and/or sulfur dioxide.\r\n\r\n     A.

CHLORINATION PROCESS\r\n\r\n   A.  Process Chemistry\r\n     \r\n          Chlorine  is used to disinfect the wastewater  effluent\r\n       prior   to   discharging   into   the   receiving   water.\r\n       Chlorination  capacities are generally  selected  to  meet\r\n       the  specific  design  criteria  of  the  state  or  other\r\n       regulatory  agencies  controlling the  receiving  body  of\r\n       water.   In  any case, where the residual in the  effluent\r\n       is  specified or the final number of coliform bacteria  is\r\n       limited,  the actual amount of chlorine must be determined\r\n       by onsite testing.\r\n     \r\n       The general chlorination equation is as follows:\r\n     \r\n               Cl2 + H2O  HOCl + H+ + Cl-\r\n\r\n           This equilibrium is the dominant one in chlorine water\r\n       from  vacuum chlorinators with a pH of 2 to 3, and at  the\r\n       instant  of contact, when chlorine water is added  to  any\r\n       water  for disinfection.  The free chlorine dominates  the\r\n       nature   of   the  reactions.   These  often   result   in\r\n       development  of  obnoxious  compounds  such  as   nitrogen\r\n       trichloride, NCl3.\r\n       \r\n       A. Process Chemistry (Continued)\r\n\r\n           To minimize these effects, high quality water is often\r\n       used  as  chlorinator  feed  water  and  flash  mixing  is\r\n       required at the point where the chlorine water is  applied\r\n       to   prevent"

In  dilute solution and at pH  levels  above\r\n       about  4, the equilibrium shown above is displaced greatly\r\n       to  the right, and very little chlorine exists as such  in\r\n       solution.   The hypochlorous acid formed is  a  weak  acid\r\n       and is very poorly dissociated at pH levels below 6.\r\n\r\n   B.  Maximum Inventory\r\n\r\n           Chlorine  is  supplied as a liquefied gas  under  high\r\n       pressure  from three (3) 1-ton containers with  three  (3)\r\n       additional 1-ton containers online in standby  mode.   The\r\n       maximum   inventory  for  chlorine  is  ten   (10)   1-ton\r\n       containers.

The appropriate chlorine\r\n       residual  is monitored and controlled by residual chlorine\r\n       testing.   The permitted limits for chlorine residual  are\r\n       1.0  mg/l  prior  to dechlorination and 0.1  mg/l  in  the\r\n       effluent prior to the receiving water.\r\n\r\n   D.
