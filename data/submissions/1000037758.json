It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal, State, and local regulations.  If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to immediately notify the Bethany Volunteer Fire Department (via a 911 call) and request that it respond to the emergency.  Incidental to the notification to the fire department, a call to the Harrison County, Missouri LEPC will be made.\r\n\r\nWhile we have planned for an emergency, it is acknowledged that a real emergency will be unexpected and may very well be much different and cannot be ensured to duplicate what may have been planned.  In reality, the situation that develops may not happen in the manner in which it has been planned.  In that event, what may have been planned will serve only as a guideline to follow.\r\nThe Emergency Action Plan for this facility describes certain procedures that are intended to minimize the hazards associated with human health and the environment from fires, explosions, the sudden and unexpected release of chemicals (i.e., Anhydrous Ammonia), tornadoes, bomb threats or other accidents or acts of God which may occur on our premises.\r\n\r\nThe primary emergency coordinator for the Bethany West location is Dean Percell, Manager.  His work and 24-hour emergency response telephone numbers are provided in the Registration Section of this document.  In addition, the following individuals (with associated work and 24-hour emergency response telephone numbers) are to be contacted in order:\r\n\r\nDean Percell, Manager\t\tAaron Mason, Territory Manager\tBrian Jennings, Laborer\r\n(W) 660 425-6343\t\t(W) 660 425-6343\t\t\t(W) 660 425-6343\r\n(24hr) 660 425-2606\t\t(24hr) 660 334-0613\t\t\t(24hr) 660 868-0593\r\n\r\nDescription of the Anhydrous Ammonia Storage/Distribution Plant and the \r\nRegulated Substance Handled at the GFG Bethany"

The Anhydrous Ammonia that is stored at this facility is distributed to agricultural crop producers in the surrounding area who utilize the Anhydrous Ammonia for crop nutrient purposes.\r\nThe system consists of (1) 30,000 gallon storage tank with associated piping, valves, liquid pump, and other miscellaneous equipment.  The NH3 plant is only operated on a seasonal basis (Spring and Fall).  At a maximum, the plant operates a total of three months (1/4 of the year).  We employe roughly 12 employees year round, however this would result in an FTE of around 4.\r\n\r\nWorst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios:\r\n\r\nSince this facility is located in relatively close proximity to the town of Bethany, provisions have been designed to notify all affected persons.  An evacuation plan is in place.  In the event of a release, we will contact the appropriate authorities within 15 minutes.\r\n\r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:\r\n\r\nThis facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable State and local codes and regulations.   The NH3 system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with ANSI Standard K-61.1-1999 and State law.\r\nIn addition the company has specific operating procedures in place intended to minimize the potential for an accidental (and potentially catastrophic) release of anhydrous ammonia.
