The refinery's principal activity is fuels manufacturing, wherein the facility converts crude oil and other feedstock into gasoline, jet fuel, diesel, and industrial fuels. The principal fuels produced are gasoline, diesel, and jet fuels. The refinery also produces butane, elemental sulfur, and petroleum coke for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nThe SFR is designed and operated to refine a variety of domestic and foreign crude oils.  Crude oil is brought to the refinery via pipeline and marine tanker.

Processing begins in the Desalter, where the oil is dehydrated and salts are removed electrically to reduce the corrosivity of the oil. Following desalting, it is sent to a distillation tower where the hydrocarbons are heated and separated into fractions by molecular weight. Lighter hydrocarbons have lower boiling points than heavier hydrocarbons. This unit  produces six different fractions: vent gas, light naphtha, medium naphtha, light diesel, heavy diesel, and vacuum resid. The second crude unit is associated with the Coker. It processes diluted San Joaquin Valley Crude into three fractions: naphtha, gas oil, and vacuum resid. The heaviest fraction, resid, is composed of very heavy hydrocarbons and is a solid at ambient temperatures. This material is sent to the Coker, where the large molecules are thermally cracked into smaller ones. These smaller molecules can then be further processed into motor fuels. The Coker also produces petroleum coke, which is shipped offsite.\r\n\r\nThe gas oil fractions from the crude units and the Coker are still too large for use as motor fuels. These fractions are catalytically cracked in the Unicracker  and the heavy gas oil Hydrocracker Unit. These units crack the hydrocarbon molecules into smaller molecules in the presence of hydrogen and a catalyst. \r\n\r\nHydrocracking is more selective than thermal cracking. Olefins and other unsaturated compounds are saturated during this hydrocracking process in addition to breaking larger chain or ringed hydrocarbons into smaller compounds. Olefins are undesirable in motor fuels because they contribute to the formation of smog during engine combustion; therefore, they must be removed.\r\n\r\nThe diesel and naphtha hydrotreating units remove sulfur and nitrogen from their feedstocks, creating hydrogen sulfide and ammonia, which are processed elsewhere.

These units are particularly important for ensuring cleaner burning fuels, since the removal of these compounds is critical to preventing smog from engine combustion of gasoline and diesel. The Unisar Unit removes aromatic compounds from its feedstock by saturating these compounds. The Unisar Unit produces finished aviation jet fuel. The reformer units rearrange hydrocarbons from straight chains into branched chains and rings. The Isomerization unit rearranges molecules to raise the octane number of the motor fuels. \r\n\r\nThe cracking processes produce very small hydrocarbons as well as the larger fractions discussed above. Units like the Gasoline Fractionation Unit separate these small molecules. The smallest molecules (one, two, and three carbons) are used in the refinery for fuel. Butanes are produced for commercial sale. \r\n\r\nThe refinery has a Steam Power Plant that produces electricity as well as high pressure, high temperature steam, which is used for heating various processes. The Steam Power Plant's demineralizer produces high quality water for use in the plant and process cooling systems. The Waste Water Treatment Plant treats water used in refinery processes. The water that is removed from crude oil prior to processing and water from other process stages, including stripped sour water, is treated by biological systems and carbon filtration prior to its permitted discharge. In addition, selenium is removed by the Selenium Removal Plant.\r\n\r\nThe sulfur and nitrogen removed from processing streams is sent to the Sulfur Complex.  The Sulfur Complex converts the sulfur in the streams (as hydrogen sulfide) into elemental sulfur. The elemental sulfur is sold to agricultural markets.\r\n\r\nDescription of Regulated Substances\r\nMost of the substances handled at the refinery regulated by the RMP are flammables.

For comparison, gasoline has a flash point of -45\u00b0F and diesel fuel has a flash point of 125\u00b0F. \r\n\r\nAs part of refining crude oil to motor fuels, some regulated toxic substances are generated in addition to the flammables. Hydrogen sulfide and aqueous ammonia are present at the refinery at quantities exceeding their regulatory limits. Hydrogen sulfide, with its characteristic rotten egg odor, is created in the processing units that remove sulfur and nitrogen from the refining streams. It is a colorless, corrosive, toxic gas and its odor can be readily detected at concentrations below concern. Hydrogen sulfide is not stored at the refinery. As soon as it is generated, it is sent to the Sulfur Complex for processing. In addition, minor amounts of hydrogen sulfide may evolve from spills of sour water. Ammonia is also created and treated by the same processing units. Ammonia is a colorless, corrosive, toxic gas with a sharp irritating odor. Its odor is also readily detectable at concentrations below concern. The SFR uses aqueous ammonia for nitrogen oxide emission control. Hydrogen sulfide and ammonia are hazardous principally through inhalation. \r\n\r\nThere are several other regulated substances present at the refinery at quantities below their regulatory thresholds, and thus not subject to RMP requirements.  No other substances at the refinery are included in the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Title 40, Part 68.130, Tables 1 and 2. \r\n\r\nThe maximum inventories of applicable RMP chemicals stored at the SFR are provided per Title 40 CFR 68.115.

An example of a detection safeguard would be that process and storage areas have leak detection systems for hydrocarbons and hydrogen sulfide. In addition, the SFR has perimeter monitors for hydrogen sulfide and sulfur dioxide as well as a fence-line monitoring system. Mitigation is also an important part of managing an accidental release. \r\n\r\nExamples of mitigation safeguards include emergency block valves, depressurizing, equipment spacing, dikes, curbs and sewers, fire-fighting access, hydrants, monitors, deluge systems, proper fireproofing of vessels, proper pipe supports, and critical instrument controls. \r\n\r\nAs part of safeguarding against escalation of an event, the refinery has a comprehensive Emergency Response Program.\r\n\r\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nThe RMP regulation requires a listing of accidents for the past 5 years from covered processes that have resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage onsite, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.
