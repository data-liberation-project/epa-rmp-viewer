              "Description": "3.PREVENTION PROGRAM 3, SUBPART D\nThe Chlorine System of Water Treatment Plant # 3 is subject to comply with Prevention Program 3.  This is based on the worst case release scenario analysis results and the Chlorine System being subject to OSHA?s PSM rule, 29 CFR 1910.119.  The City of Atlantic Beach accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices, and it is in compliance with all applicable EPA Prevention Program requirements.  This section describes the EPA and OSHA requirements the City of Atlantic Beach is fulfilling as operator of the Atlantic Beach Water Treatment Plant # 3. The plan also includes the prevention steps taken beyond this regulatory requirement.  The City of Atlantic Beach?s Document Management System (DMS) contains in it the key OSHA document which details the operation of the prevention program.\nThe City of Atlantic Beach accidental release prevention program is based on OSHA PSM program and EPA RMP Level 3 prevention program (described above in section 1.1.2).  The plant has an emergency response program, which is coordinated (reviewed by ) with the City of Jacksonville Fire Department, which is a member of Local Emergency Response Planning Committee (LEPC).  This program includes an emergency response decision tree and a notification plan.  Emergency response drills and drill evaluations are conducted annually by the operating department.  Emergency operation and response procedures are also reviewed at that time.  To ensure the public?s safety evacuation may be required during a major release.  Evacuation will begin with a minimum of 1.3 mile radius from the source.  The incident commander is advised to evacuate up to 4 miles radius based on the circumstances of the catastrophic release.  This is three times the distance recommended by the EPA Guidance.  Besides the specific emergency response program, key elements of the prevention programs are incorporated in the operating culture of the City of Atlantic Beach plant by the following:\n?High level of involvement in every aspect of the chlorine system operations including participation in :  \n*safety committee \n*chlorine PSM/RMP safety teams, \n*development of the operation procedures, \n*hazard evaluations, and \n*on-going training of the operators and other involved staff.\n?Preventive maintenance and mechanical integrity programs ensure the safe operation of the equipment and systems.\n?Use of state-of-the-art process and safety equipment that meets and/or  exceeds industry and regulatory standards. \n\n?Use of accurate and effective operating procedures written with the participation of the operators.  These documents are all controlled by  City of Atlantic Beach DMS  document control system.\n?Management of all changes to the procedures, equipment and chemicals used by the City of Atlantic Beach on the site.  Again, the DMS document control system is key to the high quality of the operation and its products.\n?Performance of a hazard review of equipment, plant, and procedures\n?Implementation of an audit and inspection program.\nChemical-specific prevention features of the plant include:  1).  the chlorine building ventilation system, 2).  chlorine detectors, 3).  Use of full face chlorine canister respirator worn by the operators during connection and disconnection of the chlorine supply, 4).  the availability of self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) in the event of a chlorine leak, 5).  employee training in operations and maintenance with emphasis on awareness of the hazardous and toxic properties of chlorine, 6).  \nThe City of Atlantic Beach has in use policies, procedures and systems as part of their prevention program.  The program addresses each of  the EPA Program level 3 listed 12 elements, plus  RMP elements needed to implement the program, and similar elements in place in the plants? OSHA PSM program.  These are maintained in the City of Atlantic Beach DMS document control system under the Key Document listed below:\nElement Title EPA 68 #    OSHA 1910-119 #\n?Management System    15    (a&e)\n?Process safety information    65    ( d )\n?Process hazard analysis    67    ( e )\n?Operating procedures    69    ( f )\n?Training    71    ( g )\n?Mechanical integrity    73    ( j )\n?Management of change    75    ( l )\n?Pre-startup review    77    ( i )\n?Compliance audits    79    ( o )\n?Incident investigation    81    ( m )\n?Employee participation    83    ( c )\n?Hot work permit    85    ( k )\n?Contractors    87    ( h )\n?Emergency Response    95    (n)\n?Trade Secrets    N/A    ( p )\nThe OSHA PSM elements which are like the RMP elements (above) of the response plan have been in place.  The program is tailored to the City of Atlantic Beach Water Plant #3 and to the emergency response services available in the Atlantic Beach, Florida community.  Finally, the plant is in compliance with the EPA Emergency Response Program requirements.",

Chlorine is used as part of the treatment process. \n\n1.2.1.SITE DESCRIPTION  (b)(1)\nThe site is owned and operated by The City of Atlantic Beach.  The site is located at 902 Assisi Lane, Atlantic Beach, Duval County, Florida.  The site is boarded by Mayport Road on the east, Modesky Park on the west, Navy Commissary and Exchange on the south and Assisi Lane on the north.\nThe Plant includes a chlorine storage and distribution system contained in a specially designed storage and process building. The boundaries of the chlorine system subject to the RMP regulation include the Bulk Chlorine Storage and Feed Control rooms and the associated vent make up and exhaust systems.  These are detailed in the Process and Instrument Drawings (P&ID) which are part of the plant Process Safety Information (PSI).\n1.2.2.REGULATED SUBSTANCE  (b)(2)\nChlorine is the only regulated substance on site which exceeds the EPA 40 CFR-68 rule threshold quantity.  The City of Atlantic Beach chlorine process was installed as part of the process of purifying water for public consumption.  It operates under permit from the State of Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP).  The chlorine is received, stored and distributed to two process control systems. \nChlorine is an EPA and OSHA-listed toxic chemical.  It is an irritant and it is corrosive.  Chlorine is a halogen with the formula Cl2.  It is a chlorinating or oxidizing agent that is not flammable.  It has a 1 ppm OSHA ceiling Permissible Exposure Limit (PEL) and a NFPA health rating of 4, severe; with immediate and delayed health hazards.  Chlorine is not a carcinogen.\n1.3.WORST AND ALTERNATIVE CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS  (c)\nTwo offsite consequence analyses were conducted which include two chlorine release scenarios.  The first is a ?worst case release?.  The second is a more probable ?alt"

The first scenario is defined by EPA, which states that ?the ? shall assume that the ? maximum quantity in the largest vessel ? is released as a gas over 10 minutes?  due to an unspecified failure.  The alternative scenario is defined as ?more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario?.\nAtmospheric dispersion modeling was performed to determine the distance traveled by the chlorine released before its concentration decreases to the ?toxic endpoint.?  The EPA  selected endpoint for chlorine is 0.0087 mg/l which equals 3 ppm. The  3 ppm endpoint is the Emergency Response Planning Guideline Level 2 (ERPG-2).  This is defined by the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) as the ?maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms which could impair an individual?s ability to take protective action.?  The residential population within a circle with a radius corresponding to the toxic endpoint distance was defined, ?to estimate the population potentially affected.?\n1.3.1.WORST CASE   (c)(1)\nAtmospheric dispersion modeling for the worst case scenario was performed using the EPA assumptions.  Results demonstrate a distance of ______ miles to the toxic endpoint.  The residential population that could potentially be affected by the release is estimated at _______ people.\n1.3.2.ALTERNATIVE CASE   (c)(2)\nThe alternative release scenario involves the failure of the yoke assembly regulator of the pressure system connected to one of the one ton-containers. This failure is equal to creating a 1/16 inch diameter hole in either the yoke assembly, the drip tube, a pipe, or even the container.  Modeling using the EPA  water guidance demonstrated the rate of chlorine release is 20.0lb./min.  The toxic endpoint distances determined is ______ miles.  The residential population potentially t"

The building is equipped with ambient ventilation storage area and a fan ventilated control room.  In the event of a chlorine leak the vent system automatically comes on.  All the vent air and any fumes are diluted and then removed from the room by a vent system.\n1.4.2.3.    Equipment Design\nThere are two types of chlorine pipe systems, high and low (vacuum) pressure.  The high pressure chlorine piping system is made of chlorine compatible steel pipes or equipment.  These materials are steel or chlorine compatible non metallic compound (not corroded by chlorine) rated to 500 psig.  The maximum pressure of the chlorine in the high pressure system is only 150 psig giving a 3 to 1 safety factor. The low pressure system operates under a vacuum pressure of 13 inches of mercury.  All the pipe, tubes, and equipment are also chlorine compatible.  The system is designed to 150 psig or complete vacuum giving it a large safety factor over the typical vacuum or positive pressure in"

The alarms and lights in the plant alert employees of a potential chlorine leak.  Plus, the alarm automatically turns on the vent fan for the room.\n1.5.FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY  (e)\nThe City of Atlantic Beach Water Plant #3 had no accidental releases of chlorine in the past five years per EPA 40 CFR 67.42 (a). \n1.6.EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM  (f)\nEmergency response procedures are contained in the City of Atlantic Beach Contingency Plan (Emergency Response Plan).  The plan includes an emergency response ?decision tree? and a notification plan.  The Plant also has site specific emergency actions defined in the plants operating procedures.  Emergency response drills and drill evaluations are conducted annually by the operating department.  Emergency operation and response procedures are also reviewed at that time.\nThe emergency response program (contingency plan) is coordinated (reviewed by) with the Jacksonville Fire Department, which coordinates with Local Duval County Emergency Response Planning Committee (LEPC) and Jacksonville Fire Department HazMat Team and with the Mayport Naval Station HazMat Team, all located in Duval County, Florida.  Copies of the program are given to key local agencies including: fire, medical, rescue,  management, and police departments in Atlantic Beach.  Besides the specific emergency response program, key elements of the prevention programs are incorporated in the operating culture of the City of Atlantic Beach Water Plant # 3.\nThe Contingency Plan procedures detail the actions and responses to chlorine spills (releases).  The plan includes training of all chlorine-area operators.  The primary response team includes the Atlantic Beach fire and rescue, plus the HazMat Team.  All of these respond to severe chlorine leak situations.  Actions include catastrophic, severe, and moderate leaks.  A Chlorine ?B? Leak Repair Kit is maintaine"
