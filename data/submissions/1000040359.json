A PHA (Fault Tree) was conducted for the\n\nmain HF and aqueous HF processes in 1989 and was revalidated (HAZOP)in 1995, 2000, 2006, and 2011. Management of change evaluations and prestartup safety reviews are conducted for all\n\nmodifications. The ultra-high purity HF process was decommisioned in December of 2003. The Boron\n\nTrifluoride trailer storage area was added in 2010.\"\n\n",

Honeywell shares the site with three other chemical manufacturing facilities. The area is predominately rural with adjacent and nearby chemical manufacturing facilities. There are no immediate residential neighbors. The plant employs approximately 180 company and about 90 contract workers.\n\n\n\nThe Honeywell Geismar Plant's five covered processes manufacture new generation ozone friendly refrigerants, inorganic acids and fluoropolymer resin. The Hydrogen Fluoride Plant manufactures hydrogen fluoride. The Multiproducts Plant manufactures 1,1,1,2 tetrafluoroethane (HFC 134a), pentafluoroethane (HFC 125) and 1-chloro-1,2,2-tetrafluoroethane (HCFC 124). The Aclon Resin Plant manufactures fluoropolymer resin. The 125 Plant manufactures opentafluroethane (HFC 125). The 245fa Plant manufactures 1,1,1,3,3-pentafluoropropane (HFC 245fa).\n\n\n\nAnhydrous hydrogen fluoride is used as a raw material in the manufacture of refrigerants, fluorocarbons, gasoline, as well as other chemical derivatives. Aqueous solutions of hydrogen fluoride are used in the manufacture of electronic components, circuit boards, steel, high-purity quartz, light bulbs televisions, and computer monitors.\n\n\n\nHFC 134a is used as a refrigerant in automotive applications.

Consideration was given to the amount of material released, injuries which may have occurred, and actual or potential impact both on and off the facility. There were four accidents which involved an affected chemical at the Honeywell Geismar Site in the past five years.\n\n\n\n5) The Emergency Response Plan:\n\n\n\nThe Honeywell Geismar site has an emergency preparedness planning and response program designed to deal with accidental releases and other unplanned events associated with the facility's use of hazardous chemicals. The site has a written Emergency Response Plan that addresses various types of contingencies including specific actions for responding to accidental releases. The Plan provides for both internal site and external community emergency alerting and notification using established protocols. The plant has multiple means of communication established to alert public safety agencies. The plan addresses emergency health care, sheltering in place, evacuation, emergency responsibilities, response, control procedures, and emergency equipment. The Plan provides for the implementation of an Incident Command System to direct and coordinate the Site's response activities. The Plan has been coordinated with the local emergency\n\nplanning committee and with the local sheriff's agencies that would direct all offsite community response activities. The Honeywell Geismar site maintains its own professionally trained Emergency Response Team (ERT) which is knowledgeable and prepared to respond to incidents involving accidental releases.

The onsite notification system can be activated at several locations including control rooms and the plant security gate. This system has siren and voice capability that can use prerecorded or live announcements. The system is tested weekly and during routine drills by Honeywell and other companies which share the site.\n\n\n\nNotification of persons off the site property is accomplished in conjunction with the local public safety agencies by activation of a regional audible warning system. This system also has siren and voice capabilities. Annually, calendars are hand delivered to residents in the audible warning region. These calendars provide residents instructions and recommendations in response to audible warnings. The system is tested weekly.\n\n\n\nIn addition to the audible warning system, community alert networks exist to alert near neighbors. These computer-assisted systems are capable of automatically alerting residents, industries, businesses, and others in the covered area by telephone.\n\n\n\n6) Planned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\n\n\nHoneywell pursues a philosophy of continuous improvement in all aspects of its operations. Improvements are identified and implemented throughout the facility's planning and operating cycles.\n\n\n\nThe plant's systematic safety review program identifies action items that improve upon the existing safeguards at the Geismar site and further reduce the potential for accidental release. The process hazard analyses for the Geismar manufacturing processes are reviewed and revalidated every five years. Continuous improvement of the plant's processes and systems provides the highest level of protection from chemical incidents.\n\n"
