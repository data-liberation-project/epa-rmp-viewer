The comprehensive accidental release prevention program covers areas such as safety, hazard analysis, operating procedures, maintenance and employee training associated with the processes at the facility.  The effective emergency response plan covers response procedures such as pre-emergency employee training, lines of authority, emergency recognition, evacuation routes and procedures and emergency medical treatment.  It is GSWSA's policy to implement appropriate measures to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\nGSWSA uses one (1) regulated substance above the threshold quantity.  The regulated substance is chlorine with a threshold quantity of 2,500 pounds.  Chlorine is used in the water treatment processes.  Chlorine is handled in one-ton cylinders and the maximum amount of chlorine handled is 30,000 pounds. GSWSA is mandated to meet Program 3 requirements.\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION \n \nGSWSA has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  The process is subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119 and is already in compliance.  The following steps are key to the prevention program:\n1. Detailed records of safety information describing the chemical hazards of chlorine, process technology, and process equipment.\n2. Comprehensive process hazard analysis is conducted to ensure that hazards are recognized and evaluated.\n3. Operating procedures have been developed and implemented which describe tasks to be preformed, dates to be recorded, ope"

Employee training program is in effect to ensure that the employees of the facilities are properly trained and aware on-going mechanical integrity program is in place to ensure safe process operation.\n6. Incident investigation procedures are in place to ensure that all unplanned events affecting process safety are properly investigated in a timely manner to identify the causes of the incident and to implement corrective action.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThe GSWSA Myrtle Beach Surface Water Treatment Plant has an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last five years.  Due to the effective release prevention policies, there have been no accidental releases during the last five years at the Surface Water Treatment Plant.  \n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\nGSWSA facility has a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of chlorine and other hazardous materials, which has been coordinated with the local emergency response personnel.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, and notification of local emergency response agencies and the public.\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVED SAFETY\n \nThe last Process Hazard Analysis was performed in June 2003.  The Process Hazard Analysis resulted in no recommended changes at the Surface Water Treatment Plant."
