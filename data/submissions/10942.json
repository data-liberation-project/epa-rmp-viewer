Facility Policy.\nA.    \n     The owners, management and employees of  Farmers Co-Op Exchange (Pella) at Ottumwa (the facility) are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of \n     \nA.    propane. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the people and the environment.  \nB.    \n1.    Facility Information.\n\nThe maximum quantity of propane stored would be 188,700 pounds. It is sold at retail.\n\n3.    Worst-Case Scenario and Alternate Release Scenario\n\n          a.    The worst-case scenario would be the release of the total contents of  the largest storage tank released as a gas. The maximum quantity released would be 94,400 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the end point (point of dispersion to 1.0 pounds per square inch or psi) is 0.4 miles.  \n\n          b.    The alternate release scenario, based on the five-year accident history (or the most likely potential incident), is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 1.0 psi) is 0.03 miles.  \n     \n4.    Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n     The facility has been reviewed for general compliance with the provisions of National Fire Protection Association Code NFPA - 58, 2nd Edition.\n\n5.    Five-Year Accident History.        \n\n     There have been no accidental releases of propane in the past five years that: have caused any deaths, injuries or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.  \n\n\n6.    Emergency Response Program.\n\n    The facility has:\n\n    a.    a written action plan, in accorda"

Planned Changes to Improve Safety.\n\n     Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific safety recommendations regarding storage or use of propane for implementation at this time."
