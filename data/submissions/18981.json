      "SummaryText": "This report is presented in response to the requirements from the United States Environmental Protection Agencies (USEPA) under 40 CFR Part 68 and 112(r) of the Clean Air Act. The KOCH Pipeline Company terminal at Junction City, Wisconsin is subject to this rule due to the storage of Propane above the threshold quantity listed in the regulations.\n\nThe person in charge of this location is Mr. Barry Bencsic.\n\nThe address of the facility is as follows:\n\nKOCH Petroleum Group, L.P.\n2267 Highway 34 North\nJunction City, Wisconsin 54443\n\nThe Junction City terminal is designed to receive propane directly from a 6\" pipeline. The pipeline is 170 miles long, originating in the KOCH refinery in Pine Bend, Minnesota. This pipeline has a loading/storage facility at its midpoint near Eau Claire, Wisconsin and terminates at the Junction City, WI terminal.\n\nThe facility has eight (8) 2,000 barrel (84,000 gallon) storage vessels (bullets) for a total storage capacity of approximately 13,600 barrels (571,200 gallons). This storage capacity is 85% of the 16,000 barrel water capacity.  The facility also has one 30,000 gallon bullet used for \"slop\" (i.e. off-spec propane). To facilitate pigging of the 6\" pipeline, this terminal also has a pipeline pig receiver.\n\nDuring normal operations the terminal will receive product at a rate of approximately 300 - 600 BPH (210 -420 GPM) however, the facility is capable of receiving at rates up to 1200 BPH. The pipeline pressure ranges from 180 psig to approximately 450 psig under normal operating conditions. The propane received into this terminal is stenched with Ethyl Mercaptan prior to going into the storage vessels. Currently, the facility is not automated such that product can be received without terminal personnel present. Therefore, the current procedure is to receive product only when terminal personnel are at the facility.\n\nThis facility also utilizes a dehydration system to dry the propane received from the pipeline. The dehydration system "

    {
      "ESSeqNum": 1,
      "FacilityID": 18981,
      "SummaryText": "consists of four (4) adsorption towers (only three (3) towers actively dry incoming propane at one time and the fourth tower is \"cooked out\" or regenerated), two (2) separators, a salt bath heater, air cooler and water collector. The design flow rate range of the dehydration system is the same as the terminal receiving rate, however, the operating pressure of the adsorption towers remains fairly constant at approximately 160 psig. The flow rate for the regeneration cycle is approximately 15 - 20 GPM. The flow path for the regeneration cycle consists of the heater, a single tower, air cooler and water collector. During normal operations the heater outlet temperature is between 480-600 degrees Fahrenheit and the temperature downstream of the air cooler is approximately 80 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nThe facility has one (1) truck-loading island for propane that is served by two (2) centrifugal type loading pumps.  Both pumps are capable of supplying approximately 485 gpm at a differential pressure of approximately 160 psi.  During normal operations the West loading pump will supply loading pressure to the West bay and the East loading pump to the East bay.  Blowdown piping is connected to a common 2\" header leading to a 6\" vent stack located to the Northeast of the propane facility.\n\nAccess to the facility is restricted by two (2) card-operated automatic gates. Customers possessing access cards may load trucks 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The terminal is manned 10 hours a day Monday through Friday, usually with four (4) KOCH employees. A terminal employee will also be on 24 hour call and perform weekend checks which will consist of a 1 to 2 hour general inspection of the facility (including the 12\" products line and atmospheric storage tanks). The weekend checks do not follow a rigid schedule, however, the morning check is to be performed sometime between 8:00 a.m. and 10:00 a.m. and the evening check sometime between 5:00 p.m. and 7:00 p.m.\n\nA summary of the terminal stor"

The result is the loss of 84,000 gallons of propane. The propane would vaporize in the atmosphere and with a detonation resulting in a vapor cloud explosion. The distance to the endpoint of impact was determined using the tables provided by the USEPA. Under this guidance, the endpoint of the worst-case scenario is 0.6 miles. Within this distance, there is estimated to be an overpressure of 1 psi or greater. \n\nThe alternate scenario for the facility involves the failure of the hose during the filling of a tanker truck. A valve failure could allow the release of the volume of the tanker truck which is 9,500. The propane would vaporize in the atmosphere and with an ignition source, create a vapor cloud explosion. The distance to the endpoint of impact was determined using the tables provided by the USEPA. Under this guidance, the endpoint of the alternate scenario is 0.3 miles. Within this distance, there is estimated to be an overpressure of 1 psi or greater.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical specific prevention steps for this facility are already in place. These items are completed because the facility falls under existing OSHA PSM and other regulatory laws.\n\nThe five-year accident history of this facility has no reportable instances as defined by the US"
