      "SummaryText": "This Risk Management Plan was prepared by Helena Chemical Company (Helena) pursuant to the requirements of the Clean Air Act (CAA) Section 112(r) as codified by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) at 40 CFR Part 68.  Helena engages in the formulation, distribution, and sale of chemicals to customers, most who use Helena's products to support agricultural operations.   The chemical stored at this location that is the subject of the RMP regulations is anhydrous ammonia.  Anhydrous ammonia is stored in several tanks located at the Eddy, TX facility.\n\nThe RMP for this facility was originally filed by Willard Grain and Feed.  Willard Grain and Feed was purchased by Helena and this RMP is an update that includes some new modeling and analysis that is different than that performed by Willard Grain and Feed.  \n\nThe liklihood of an accident at this facility of the type envisioned by the RMP regulations is rare because Helena uses numerous safety equipment including excess flow valves and specially designed hoses and fittings to ensure that anhydrous ammonia is not released to the environment during storage and transfer operations.  Helena employees are trained to handle chemicals including anhydrous ammonia.  Helena has coordinated emergency response procedures with local response agencies.\n\nIn summary, Helena is committed to operating its anhydrous ammonnia storage and transfer operations in a safe manner.  Helena has installed safety equipment and trained its employees to handle anhydrous ammonia in a safe manner."
