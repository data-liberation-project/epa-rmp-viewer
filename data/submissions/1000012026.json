Therefore, the facility is required to submit a Risk Management Plan (RMP) as defined in 40 CFR Part 68.150.  The anhydrous ammonia system at the facility is subject to RMP Program Level 3 requirements. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) RMP Rule requires that covered facilities prepare an Executive Summary.  The following pages represent the Executive Summary, summarizing the items required as described in 40 CFR Part 68.155 (a) through (f).\n\nA?68.155(a) Accidental Release and Emergency Response Policies\n\nBionol has documented emergency response procedures in place, as documented in the facilityA?s Emergency Action Plan.  This plan has been endorsed by Bionol staff responsible for the operation and maintenance of the facility. Bionol has procedures in place, including both onsite activities and coordination with offsite responders, which must be followed in the event of an anhydrous ammonia leak.  All personnel involved in handling anhydrous ammonia are trained with regard to ammonia safety and accident prevention.\n\nA?68.155(b) Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe stationary source subject to 40 CFR Part 68 is the Bionol Clearfield, LLC facility.  The regulated substance handled is anhydrous ammonia.\n\nA?68.155(c) Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nBionol has a documented Prevention Program for the anhydrous ammonia process that documents release prevention measures.  These prevention measures include elements such as Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Mechanical Integrity, Management of Change, Pre-Startup Review, Compliance Audits, Incident Investigation, Employee Participation, Hot Work Permit and Contractors.  \n    \nBionol employees who are involved in anhydrous ammonia operations and "

As such, Bionol has had no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the last five years that have resulted in on-site injuries or off-site injuries or other impacts.\n\nA?68.155(e) Emergency Response Program\nBionol is a non-responding facility, as defined by USEPA (29 CFR Part 40 CFR Part 311).  Therefore, Bionol has developed an Emergency Action Plan to ensure employee safety instead of an Emergency Response Program, as allowed by 40 CFR Part 68.90(b). The Bionol Emergency Action Plan outlines actions required to respond to an anhydrous ammonia emergency and has coordinated this plan with Clearfield County Emergency Management and Clearfield Fire Department. Fire Department personnel are the designated first responders in the event of an anhydrous ammonia emergency at the Bionol facility.  Bionol employees are not designated responders to an anhydrous ammonia release.  As specified in 40 CFR Part 68.90, BionolA?s Emergency Action Plan meets the exception listed in 40 CFR Part 68.90(b) and therefore, the facility is not required to have the Emergency Response Program of 40 CFR Part 68.95.\n\nA?68.155(f) Planned Changes to Improve Safety\nRecommendations for safety improvements were identified in the Process Hazard Analysis which was conducted for the anhydrous ammonia process at the Bionol facility in December 2009.  Recommended improvements for the Bionol facility were identified in three main categories: Standard Operating Procedures, Engineering, and Administrative.  All safety improvements were made prior to startup and were investigated concerning their impacts on other systems and/or procedures prior to implementation.  Additional recommendations may be made upon review of any accidents and/or when the Process Hazard Analysis is updated every five years or when a major process chang"
