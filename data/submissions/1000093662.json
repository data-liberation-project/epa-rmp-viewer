      "SummaryText": "Introduction\n\n\n\nIdeal Chemical and Supply Company is a distributor of industrial and commercial chemicals.  Ideal also repackages, blends and formulates a variety of powdered and liquid chemical products.\n\n\n\nThe Memphis facility is constructed on approximately seven acres of land located at 4025 Air Park Street in Memphis, Shelby County, Tennessee.  The building faces to the east with production and product storage to the north, south, and west.  Most of the drainage from the site goes to storm drains located in the lower truck lot and railroad tracks and drains west toward Getwell Road.\n\n\n\nIdeal Chemical & Supply Co. is committed to The Responsible Distribution Process of the National Association of Chemical Distributors.  This process recognizes the need for industry to meet or exceed legal requirements for the responsible management of chemicals and chemical industry practices in achieving the collective objectives of improved health, safety, and environmental performance.\n\n\n\nThe following describes just a few of the programs that have been implemented at Ideal to improve operations, reduce risks and improve safety:\n\n\n\n1.  Risk Management:  Chemical safety management affects both employees and customers.  Through evaluation and planning Ideal strives to reduce the risks associated with handling chemicals throughout their lifecycle.\n\n\n\n2.  Compliance Review and Training:  Regulations are constantly changing; Ideal Chemical recognizes the importance of keeping updated on regulatory changes that affect the facility.  Ideal makes the difference by implementing programs for compliance and sharing information upon request.\n\n\n\n3.  Carrier Selection:  Safe transportation of chemicals is essential in responsible distribution.  Our drivers are fully trained, our trucks properly maintained, and our products contained and secured.  We routinely audit our outside carriers to verify that they also meet the same safety requirements.\n\n\n\n4.  Handling and Storage:  Proper handling"

      "SummaryText": " and storage includes facility design, loading and unloading, maintenance and cleaning.  Understanding the latest information on chemical hazards safeguards against exposures, prevents accidents and reduces emissions.  \n\n\n\n5.  Job Procedures and Training:  Written operating procedures, along with job descriptions that include minimum skill requirements, standardize our operation.  Ideal Chemical recently reviewed and updated aqueous ammonia handling procedures and provided employee training on those procedures.\n\n\n\n6.  Emergency Response Plan:  Systematic emergency response requires consistent planning, both internally and in cooperation with outside agencies.  Installation of containment systems, emergency drills, communication and facility tours are a few of the steps Ideal has implemented.\n\n\n\n7.  Community Outreach:  Ideal is dedicated to interacting with the community on issues related to responsible chemical distribution.  We work with government agencies to support public policies and regulations that address community concerns.\n\n\n\nRisk Management Plan\n\n\n\nAqueous Ammonia is the only chemical handled by Ideal that is subject to the Risk Management Program. Aqueous ammonia is stored in one 8,000-gallon aboveground storage tank and in portable containers.\n\n\n\nAs required by the Risk Management Program regulations, Ideal has investigated possible accident scenarios using the U.S. EPA approved RMP*Comp model to evaluate potential offsite impacts.  As described in this RMP, Ideal believes potential accident scenarios involving aqueous ammonia could impact an area with a radius of 0.4 to O.6 miles from the facility.  \n\n\n\nIdeal has not had an accident or release involving aqueous ammonia during the last five years.\n\n\n\nIdeal is constantly evaluating its safety programs for improvement."
