Hydrogen is then purified, compressed, and fed into hydrogen pipelines.  The plant was started in 1996 and was initially not believed to be subject to 29 CFR1919.119 or 40 CFR Part 68.  An additional evaluation of the flammable threshold calculations completed in late 2015 discovered the inventory did exceed the threshold limits.  Linde has always operated and maintained the process in an OSHA PSM and EPA RMP compliant condition.\r\n\r\nRegulated Substances: \r\nThis facility uses, manufactures, or stores a chemical listed in part 68 of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, beyond a threshold quantity, as established by the EPA. The chemical is: - Flammable mixture containing hydrogen, methane, and other components, manufactured on site.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention Policy: \r\nLinde is dedicated to being the best performing industrial gas company in all aspects of our business, including safety, health, and environmental affairs. Our safety, health, and environmental policy call for a commitment to protecting the health and safety of our employees, neighbors, and the surrounding environment.\r\n\r\nThis policy is the basis for engineering and construction programs that produce equipment and process systems that minimize the possibility of accidental chemical releases and operational safety programs that ensure safe operation of our facilities. Linde is committed to the continuous improvement of these programs.\r\n\r\nLinde is an active member of the American Chemistry Council and subscribes to the council's program of Responsible Care, Employee Health and Safety Code of Management Practices.\r\n\r\nPrevention Program:\r\nIn accordance with OSHA's Process Safety Management standard and EPA's Risk Management Program rule, the Sulphur, LA facility has a comprehensive accident prevention program in place.

Following is a description of some of these safety features. -There are smoke detectors in the Control Room AC ducts, the warehouse and MCC building. -Fire extinguishers are located in key areas of the plant. They are maintained monthly and undergo yearly inspections by an outside vendor. -Plant operation emergency shutdowns (if process variable is exceeded) will shut down the Plant and isolate the process.  This location has multiple plant emergency trips located throughout the facility. -During plant emergency alarm conditions, this facility would contact the Carlyss Fire Department for a fire or medical emergency.\r\n\r\nFive-year Accident History: \r\nThere were no"

Linde employees will respond to minor incidents.  For other than minor incidents, Linde has in place an emergency response plan in coordination with the Carlyss Fire Department.  The plan requires the Carlyss Fire Department be called for any incident on site related to fire, spills or release of the covered chemical.\r\n\r\nAll facility employees are trained in their role in the emergency plan and emergency drills are conducted at least annually.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety: Linde has a commitment to safety that is expressed in a company-wide goal of Zero/Zero, which means zero accidents and zero injuries or illnesses at each and every location. We look to constantly improve the safety of our processes using recommendations developed through the prevention program and a program soliciting safety suggestions from our employees.\r\n\r\nThere are currently no major projects for safety improvements that have reached the planning stage."
