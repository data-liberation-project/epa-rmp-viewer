The facility also includes a fully permitted waste fuel storage facility that blends waste fuels for energy recovery by the rotary cement kilns.  The facility generally receives liquid waste fuel via tanker truck and railcar.\n\n(a) The facility is committed to the safety of it's employees and neighboring community.  Facility personnel receive training relevant to preventing hazards and emergency response as provided in the facility's RCRA permit.  Topics discussed to prevent hazards include: site access, inspections, location and operation of emergency response equipment, utilization of existing safety measure (e.g., berms, containment), and the handling of incompatible wastes.  Facility personnel are trained to respond to fires and spills.  In the event that the fire/spill may cause an adverse impact off-site,  the Dorchester County Emergency Services Department (ESD) and Harleyville Fire Department will respond.  Facility responders will work in conjunction with the off-site resonders.\n\n(b) The facility consists of all manufacturing equipment necessary for the production of portland and mansonry cement, including: rotary kilns, clinker coolers, raw mills, finish mills, packing machines, and bulk loading facilities.  The liquid waste fuel tank farm consists of three 80,000 gallon storage tanks and one 50,000 gallon storage tank, all of which are interconnected as well as connected to the rotary kilns.  The regulated substances handled include:  Acrylonitrile; Allyl Alcohol; Ammonia (20% concentration or greater); Carbon Disulfide; Chloroform; Methyl Chloride; Methyl Mercaptan; Titanium Tetrachloride; and Vinyl Acetate Monomer.\n\n(c) Following an evaluation of each potential release scenario, the worst case scenario has been determined to be a release of methyl mercaptan as a result of a storage tank failure.  The modeled distan"

Each of the regulated substances noted in b) above has been modeled for alternative release scenarios, including methyl mercaptan.  The distance to the endpoint for each alternative release scenario is less than or equal to 0.1 miles, which would not involve any off-site receptors.  Mitigation measures present include secondary containment, spill response equipment, and personnel training to prevent on-site hazards.\n\n(d) As part of the facility's RCRA permit, the facility provides regular employee training relevant to preventing hazards and emergency response.  Personnel are also aware of the physical and environmental hazards associated with handling/processing waste fuels.\n\n(e) The facility has not experienced a reportable incident under the criteria established during the past five years.\n\n(f) Facility personnel are trained to respond to fires and releases.  Emergency response/contingency plan training includes:  notification of appropriate personnel (company and off-site responder); hazardous material identification; release assessment; control procedures; prevention of recurrence or spread of fires/releases; and incident clean-up.  The facility maintains emergency equipment to use in the event or a fire or release (e.g., personal protective equipment (PPE), spill control equipment).  The Dorchester County ESD and Harleyville Fire Department are aware of the operations at the facility and are part of the facility's emergency response program.  \n\n(g) The facility provides refresher employee training regularly that incorporates safe handling practices, hazard prevention, and emergency response.  Off-site contractors are provided safety training as approprite.  Response equipment is regularly maintained for immediate use if necessary.
