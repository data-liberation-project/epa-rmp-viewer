In this scenario, 2,685,890 lbs. of flammable mixture (calculated as butane) is released to the atmosphere as a vapor cloud and ignites.  The distance to the 1.0 psi over-pressure endpoint from the vapor cloud explosion is approximately 1.1 miles.  The Alternate Release Scenario for flammables is a failure of Pump 4010 which releases 55,700 lbs of flammable mixture.  The distance to the endpoint is 0.3 miles.  The Toxics Worst Case Scenario involves the total failure of chlorine cylinder at 7 Reservoir Water Treatment facility.  In this scenario, 2,000 lbs of chlorine is released and the distance to the toxic endpoint is 1.3 miles.  An Alternate Release Scenario for chlorine is the failure of the 1\u00bf header connecting eight chlorine cylinders to the chlorination system releasing 1600 lbs.  The distance to the toxic endpoint is estimated at 0.3 miles.  The Toxics Worst Case Scenario for hydrogen sulfide is failure of a header at the Sulfur Complex that releases 962 lbs. The distance to the toxic endpoint is estimated at 1.6 miles.  The Alternate Release Scenario for hydrogen sulfide is a flange leak resulting in a toxic endpoint at 0.2 miles.\n\n4.0  GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at Port Arthur Refinery.  Because processes at the Refinery that are regulated by the EPA RMP regulations are also subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\n4.1  Employee Participation\n\nPort Arthur Refinery encourages and incorporates employee participation in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.

      "SummaryText": "d Analysis\n\nPort Arthur Refinery has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify reasonably foreseeable hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these potential hazards.\n\nPort Arthur Refinery uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating experience as well as engineering expertise.   This team identifies and evaluates potential hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nThe PHA team's findings are entered into a computer database (KMS) and assigned to appropriate departments for resolution.\n\nImplementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original process hazard analysis, Port Arthur Refinery periodically updates and revalidates the hazard and analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are entered into a computer"

These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The procedures are maintained current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.  Operating procedures are readily available to operators and for other personnel as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\nUpper and lower operating limits, consequences of deviation, and steps required to correct or avoid deviation from critical parameters, such as pressure, temperature, level, etc, are included in operating procedures.\n\nIn addition to Operating Procedures, Port Arthur Refinery has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.  Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous materials before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work), and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.

New employees receive basic training in refinery operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator receives on the job training to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.\n\nSkills are maintained through refresher training.  The operating procedures are grouped into modules, and each operator is required to review the assigned modules and pass the prescribed tests over a period of three years.  Thus, refresher training is a continuing effort.  All operating training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\n4.6  Contractors \n\nPort Arthur Refinery uses contractors for routine maintenance activities, maintenance during shutdown periods, and for construction activities.  Port Arthur Refinery also uses contractors for less safety sensitive work, such as security, janitorial, ground maintenance, engineering, clerical, etc.\n\nContractors performing the more safety sensitive work dealing with direct maintenance and construction activities are subjected to more stringent safety requirements to assure that they:  (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards of the workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform refinery personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.

Applicable written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training.  Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended, and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels).  If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back in service unless special approval is given to use of the equipment, after it is determined what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation.\n\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance.  Port Arthur Refinery incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs.  This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\n4.9  Hot Work Permit\n\nPort Arthur Refinery utilizes a comprehensive work permit system to safely manage all work performed at the facility.  In addition to hot work, the work permit system also includes requirements for entry into confined spaces, as well as requirements for other than hot work.

In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the changes.\n\n4.11  Incident Investigation\n\nPort Arthur Refinery promptly investigates incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts, use causal learning, and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and enters the information into a computer database for tracking.  Each recommendation is promptly assigned to an appropriate department for resolution.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented in the database, available for review by all employees and contractors who could be affected by the findings.  Incident investigation reports are retained for at least five years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidations.\n\n4.12  Compliance Audits \n\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, audits are periodically conducted to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.
