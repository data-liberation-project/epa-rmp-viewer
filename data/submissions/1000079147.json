Since the beginning the employees and management have had accident prevention and training programs in place for the safety of the general public and employees of the facility.  These programs include detailed operator training, operating instructions, maintenance procedures, active employee safety committees, safety inspections and emergency procedures.  The facility is also regulated by the OSHA Process Safety Management system. In the event that an accidental release were to occur, Dyno Nobel Inc. has established an Integrated Contingency Plan with the input of the Columbia River Fire and Rescue to ensure that the effects of a release would be minimized. \n\n\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE & REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nThe Dyno Nobel Inc. St Helens Facility produces nitrogen-based fertilizers. Seventy-five full time employees operate and manage the site, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year. During normal operation, the facility operates four inter-connected plants that produce ammonia, urea, nitric acid, and ammonium nitrate. From these base commodities, the facility is able to produce and sell the following products:\n\n \n\n?    Anhydrous Ammonia\n\n?    30% Ammonium Hydroxide\n\n?    19% Ammonium Hydroxide\n\n?    40% Urea Solutions\n\n?    32.5% Urea Solutions\n\n?    Urea Prill\n\n?    Ultra Low Biuret Urea Pellets\n\n?    86% Ammonium Nitrate Solutions\n\n?    32% Urea Ammonium Nitrate Solutions\n\n\n\nThese products are manufactured from natural gas, air and water.  For RMP planning purposes the entire site is considered the stationary source. The regulated substances handled on site in quantities larger than threshold amounts are Anhydrous Ammonia and 30% Aqua Ammonia.  \n\n\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM & CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION\n\n\n\nMany different tools and methodologies are used "

      "SummaryText": "to prevent accidental releases from occurring at the St. Helens facility. These include but are not limited to, the use of Recognized and Generally Accepted Good Engineering Practices for design changes or additions, an uninterrupted power supply for the computer system used for instrumentation and controls, redundant process alarms, remotely operated isolation valves, automatic shutdown systems, duplicate pumps and compressors, atmospheric pressure relief devices, a back-up instrument air compressor, secondary containment and curbing, and fire monitors  which are strategically located around the process.\n\n\n\nIn addition, a Process Safety Management program is in place at the facility. Elements of the Process Safety Management program include updating and maintaining process safety information and operating procedures, analyzing process hazards, development and maintenance of a training and mechanical integrity program, maintaining a process for initiating and managing change including a process for pre-startup safety review, compliance audits, incident investigation, employee participation, hot work permit, contractor safety, and emergency planning and response.  \n\n\n\nIn terms of employee participation, the plant has a strong safety culture in which all members of the team are able to voice their opinions and concerns without negative consequence. It is important to management that all groups are represented when a committee, task force, project team, or any other group meets to discuss plant operations, projects, hazards, temporary operations, etc. It is important that both salaried and hourly representatives be present as much as practicable and applicable. Examples of outlets for employee participation (cross-functional teams) at the St. Helens Plant include, but are not limited to:\n\n\n\n?    Site Safety Committee\n\n?    PHA Teams\n\n?    BEx Site Steering Committee\n\n?    BEx Implementation Task Force\n\n?    Project design reviews\n\n?    Weekly Safety Meetings\n\n?    Pre Startup Safety Review"

The purpose of the Dyno Nobel - St. Helens Integrated Contingency Plan is to provide guidance to Dyno Nobel Inc. plant personnel for preventing, responding to and minimizing hazards to human health and the environment from fires, explosions, and release of oil or hazardous substances to the air, ground, or surface waters. The plan meets the requirements presented in the following regulations:\n\n\n\n1. 33 CFR Part 154 (USCG's Facility Response Plan)\n\n2. 29 CFR Part 1910.38(a) (OSHA Emergency Action Plan)\n\n3. 29 CFR Part 1910.119 (OSHA Process Safety Management)\n\n4. 29 CFR Part 1910.120 (OSHA HAZWOPER)\n\n5. 40 CFR Part 68 (EPA Risk Management Program)\n\n\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nDyno Nobel has recently completed a Level of Protection Analysis that identified improvements to be incorporated in a new Safety Instrumented System. This upgrade is planned for the 2020 plant turnaround.   "
