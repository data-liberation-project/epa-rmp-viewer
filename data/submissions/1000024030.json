Raw water is processed and disinfected with chlorine in the treatment process.  The Well Field maintains a maximum inventory of 6,000 pounds of chlorine in one-ton containers, which is above the threshold level and is therefore subject to the requirements of the Risk Management Program.\n\n\n\nChlorine, a chemical required by regulation to be used in the disinfection process, has been in use at the Well Field since operation began.  No accidental releases of chlorine meeting the requirements of the five year accident history have occurred at the facility.\n\n\n\nPrevention Program\n\n\n\nThe Well Field is subject to Prevention Program 2 of the Risk Management Program.  In accordance with the requirements of Program 2, the Well Field maintains specifications for the equipment associated with the chlorine feed system and has documented the codes and standards adhered to in designing, constructing and operating the system.  The safe operating ranges for the chlorine system are documented, and it is operated within these safe ranges.\n\n\n\nA hazard review was conducted for the chlorine system and no identified action items were found to be necessary.  When a major process change is made to the system, there are procedures in place to conduct a hazard review.  Otherwise, a hazard review is conducted every five years.\n\n\n\nWritten procedures for the operation and maintenance of the chlorine system are in place at the Well Field.  Procedures are reviewed and updated periodically by facility personnel and whenever a major process change occurs.  Well Field operators receive training in the operation of the chlorine system through classes and on-the-job instruction.  Competency is determined through supervisor observation and operator demonstration of activities.  Operators receive refresher training at least every three years, or more often"

      "SummaryText": " as necessary.  Only qualified operators operate the chlorine system.\n\n\n\nIn accordance with the regulations, a team of facility personnel will conduct a compliance audit of the facility operations and procedures once every three years and whenever a major process modification is made.  A compliance audit checklist was developed based on American Water Works Association recommendations.  A system to correct any deficiency discovered during the compliance audit is in place.\n\n\n\nIn the event of an accidental release, or a situation that could lead to an accidental release, there are procedures in place to investigate such incidents, develop findings and recommendations for corrective action, and implement the recommendations.\n\n\n\nFacility personnel are trained to notify emergency personnel in the event of a significant chlorine leak.  In the unlikely event a chlorine release requiring the assistance of offsite emergency response personnel occurs, the City of Midland Fire Department is responsible for responding to the accident, coordinating the emergency response effort, and notifying potentially affected areas in the surrounding community."
