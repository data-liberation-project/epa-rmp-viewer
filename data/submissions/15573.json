      "SummaryText": "Del Monte Fresh Produce's N.A. (Del Monte) safety policy is based on our conviction that the well being of our employees must be one of the major considerations in all operations.  People are our most important asset, and their safety is one our greatest responsibilities.\n\nSafety in our company must be an important consideration in every managerial and supervisory position guide.\n\nThe goals of our safety program are both humanitarian and economic.  It is our duty to send each employee home to his/her family each day whole and healthy.\n\nIt is true that a good safety record is clear evidence of good management.  Industrial accidents, which result in injury or death and loss of property, are preventable.  It is our policy to do everything reasonable to prevent injury to employees, damage to property, and to protect the company, the customer, the stockholder, and the public from the results of accidents and losses.\n\nThe Del Monte facility located at 14550 La Estrella, Goodyear, Arizona utilizes anhydrous ammonia above the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 10,000-pound threshold in their refrigeration process.  In accordance with Del Monte's safety policy and proactive efforts in compliance with the regulator community, the Process Safety Management (PSM) system and Risk Management Plan (RMP) was prepared in accordance with the Occupation Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) under section 29 1910.119 and the EPA Clean Air Act for substances listed in 40 CFR 68.130."
