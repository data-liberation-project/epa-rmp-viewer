              "Description": "This system is governed by well-documented operating procedures and administrative controls which limit  the amount of ammonia held in the storage tank. The unloading of ammonia tank trucks is also governed by Plant policies and operating procedures. Operators are trained and certified.\n07/14/99 - Ammonia pump (10-110-045A)\n08/02/99 - Test Pressure Relief Valves\n07/07/99 - Stor. Tank Inspection (10-110-044)\n\nThe storage tank is housed in a concrete diked area. All nozzles on the tank are fitted with excess flow valves except for nozzles with pressure relief valves. A local level indicator is available on the  tank with a transmitter conveying the level measurement into the control room. This instrument is used to monitor and control the tank level.\n\nThe pressure relief valves are tested annually. The entire system undergoes annual maintenance which includes: external inspection, checks for any leaks, bolt tightness on the manway. Wall thickness tests are done every five years - the last test was 1997. An internal inspection of the welds was done in 1991.\n\nAmmonia is transferred to an ammonia / water mixer to prepare a solution that is pumped to a surge tank . The solution is then pumped to the chemical processing equipment and used to manufacture an agricultural product.\n\nAll changes to this system fall under the Plant's process safety management of change procedure. Process Hazard Analyses (PHAs) are conducted for all changes.",

Operators are trained and certified.\nPump 02-140-002A & B\nPump 02-130-009A & B\n\nThe storage tank is housed in a concrete diked area. The tank contents are maintained at  about 40 degrees F. This tank vents via a conservation vent to a seal pot and then to an incinerator where the fumes are destroyed. Two flare systems are used to back up the incinerator for odor control.\n\nThe tank is equipped with emergency relief devices to protect against overpressurization. Redundant level instruments and a high level switch are used to monitor and control tank level. During railcar/tank truck unloading, an excess flow switch in the unloading system is used to close the automatic valve if high flow is detected. Remote emergency shut off stations close the unloading valve if activated.\n\nThe mercaptan is pumped from the storage tank to the chemical processing equipment used to produce an agricultural product. This equipment is equipped with a high level alarm and a high level switch that is interlocked to shutdown the feed and close the automatic valve. The reactor fumes are vented via a seal pot on their way to the incinerator for destruction. This system is also governed by operating procedures used by certified operators.\n\nAll changes fall under the Plant's process safety management of change procedure. PHAs are conducted for all changes.\n\nThe entire mercaptan handling system undergoes annual maintenance and inspection as well as a five-year, vessel and piping thickness testing program and a 20 year internal inspection.",

This tank is located within a concrete secondary containment system.  The tank is equipped with overpressure protection and is rated to withstand full vacuum. The total ammonia inventory is 41,000 pounds that  includes the amount in the storage tank and associated piping that handle anhydrous ammonia. \n\nThe anhydrous ammonia handling system consists of an unloading station with secondary containment system,  storage tank, two pumps and piping.  As for all operations at this facility, this system is governed by well-established operating procedures.\n\nEthyl mercaptan is typically received by railroad tank car (about 140,000 pounds per tank car). Up to eight tank cars may be in the receiving area on the plant site awaiting unloading into the dedicated ethyl mercaptan storage tank. The maximum total inventory for the eight tank cars is 1,100,000 pounds.  When needed, a tank car is moved to the unloading area using a trackmobile operated by trained, plant personnel.  The railcar is positioned inside a concrete secondary containment system in the unloading area and is then connected to the ethyl mercaptan storage tank to unload. Ethyl mercaptan may also be received by tank truck in quantities of approximately 5,000 gallons.  Trucks are also unloaded in concrete secondary containment systems provided for unloading.\n\nThe ethyl mercaptan storage tank is located inside a concrete secondary containment system.

(Active mitigation systems were not considered according to EPA guidelines for worst cases.) Although the storage tank is designed to store approximately 48,000 pounds, plant administrative controls limit the amount to 39,000 pounds. For this scenario, it is assumed that the entire contents of the tank are released as a gas over ten minutes according the EPA requirements for a pressurized, liquified substance. The distance to the EPA-defined toxic endpoint (0.14 mg/liter) is 3.6 miles. The EPA's RMP*Comp(tm) version 1.06 was used to estimate the distance.\n\nAlternative scenario - ammonia: For the alternative scenario, it was assumed that while unloading a tank truck, the liquid ammonia unloading hose fails due to movement of the tank truck.  It was assumed that the truck was improperly set up for unloading.  Additionally, it was assumed that all systems designed to prevent ammonia release operated except the excess flow valve in the liquid line connected to the flexible hose.  It was estimated that 14,000 pounds of ammonia would be released.  The plant's ability to use the firewater system to knock down and dissolve ammonia vapors was not assumed as active mitigation for this scenario even though the system is designed for use in this type of incident.  The distance to the EPA toxic endpoint was estimated to be 0.8 miles using RMP*Comp (tm) version 1.06.\n\nWorst case scenario - ethyl mercaptan: For this scenario, it was assumed that all eight tank cars of ethyl mercaptan (which may be in inventory) are stored adjacent to each other and are involved in a common incident. In addition, it was assumed that this incident causes the simultaneous release of ethyl mercaptan from all tank cars.  It was further assumed that the total inventory (1,100.000 pou"

It was further assumed that manway on the railcar was improperly secured. The manway fails releasing the entire tank car load of ethyl mercaptan (140,000 pounds). It was assumed that ethyl mercaptan forms a pool that is ignited forming a pool fire.

The primary purpose of the program is to eliminate those events which have the potential to result in personal injury, property loss and environmental or community impact. The secondary purpose of the program is to ensure reliable and predictable operations. The objective of the program is to eliminate all unexpected events. The program consists of four fundamental elements: (1) written procedures; (2) training; (3) auditing; (4) process reviews or evaluation.\n\n(1) The written procedures include personal health and safety, work practices, equipment operation,  loss prevention, and related topics.
