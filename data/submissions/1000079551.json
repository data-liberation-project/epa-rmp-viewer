Accidental release prevention and emergency response polices.  To insure safe operation and release prevention at Tyson Foods (Chick-N-Quik; 400 W. Olrich St. 72756), this facility has implemented The Occupational Safety and Health Administrations Chemical Process Safety Management Program 29 CFR 1910.119.  All operators of systems containing the threshold amount of hazardous chemicals will undergo Chemical Process Safety Management training and operator training specific to the system. \n\nTo insure proper response to emergency situations, Tyson Foods (Chick-N-Quik; 400 W. Olrich St. 72756), has implemented Emergency Action Plans as required by The Occupational Safety and Health Administrations 29 CFR 1910.38(a) and Emergency Response Plans  29 CFR 1910.120. All safety personnel and operators of the process will be trained in these emergency procedures.\n\n\n\n2.  The stationary source and regulated substances handled.  Brief description of the facility: Chik-N-Quik is a Poultry further processing facility.                                                            \n\n (Use of regulated substances: Ammonia for refrigeration)\n\n \n\n (Amount of each regulated substance--80,000pounds.)\n\n  \n\n\n\n3.  The general accidental release prevention program.  This facility complies with the Occupational Safety and Health Administrations   Chemical Process Safety Management 29 CFR 1910.119 and the Environmental Protection Agencies Risk Management Program 40 CFR Part 68.  For ammonia systems Tyson Foods, Inc. has adopted the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration guidelines for system operation and maintenance.  Tyson Foods Inc. uses the IIAR Basic Ammonia Refrigeration Training Series or its equivalent for all operators.  \n\n \n\n4.

This team will be  trained to the Hazardous Materials Responder-Technician response capability in accordance with OSHA 29 CFR 1910.120 (q).  The team will be capable of affecting all control measures (both confinement operations and containment operations) required to remediate an incident.\n\n\n\nA written Emergency Response Plan has been developed and is on record at the Facility.  This plan includes Pre-Emergency Planning with Outside Agencies, Personnel Roles and Lines of Incident Command Authority, Facility Hazard Analysis and Emergency Prevention, Safe Distances and Places of Refuge, Site Security and Control, Evacuation Routes and Procedures, Decontamination Procedures, provisions for Emergency Medical Treatment, Emergency Notification Procedures, Chemical Response Procedures, Post Incident Critique, and Personal Protective Clothing and Emergency Equipment.\n\n\n\nAll Hazmat courses at Tyson Foods, Inc., are designed to meet training requirements of the OSHA 29 CFR 1910.120 (q) (7) and (8).  \n\nAll  (Chick-N-Quik) Hazmat Team Members will be trained 24 hours initially to the Technician level followed by 8-24 hours of refresher training per year under the direction of the on-site Hazmat Instructor at the facility. Each Instructor receives an initial 40 hours of training and 8-16 hours per year re-certification training that goes to I.C. level. \n\n\n\nThe training is designed to teach both theory and hands-on training giving the person an overall understanding of the nature of hazardous materials and the ability to assess and safely respond to the incidents in the Incident Command structure.  Technician level  training includes but is not limited to the following:\n\nA? Knowledge of basic hazards and risk assessment techniques\n\nA? Proper selection and use of appropriate and required PPE for the chemical hazard\n\nA? Terminology associated with Ha"
