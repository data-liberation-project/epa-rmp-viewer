As part of this commitment, KMCO has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility. One part of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at KMCO and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements; Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule). One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMPlan) describing the risk management program at KMCO. This document is intended to satisfy the RMPlan requirements of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at KMCO.\n\n\n\n1.1 Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nKMCO is committed to the safety of KMCO workers and the public, and to the preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances. KMCO implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances. In the event of a significant accidental release, our trained Emergency Response personnel will respond to control and contain such releases. KMCO evaluates each situation, evacuates workers as necessary, and contacts the local fire department to control and contain the release and to prevent and/or reduce the consequences of the release. KMCO, the local emergency planning committee (LEPC), and the fire department have established a program to warn the community if an accident occurs that could threaten the community.\n\n\n\n1.2 KMCO and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nKMCO handles six listed toxic substances by the RMP rule in sufficient quantities to be covered by the RMP rule:\n\n\n\nEthylene oxide is stored for use in the customer tolling processes. KMCO also handles propylene oxide"

      "SummaryText": ", formalin, ammonia, ethyl chloride, and sulfur dioxide.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.3 Offsite Consequence Analysis\n\n\n\nKMCO performed an offsite consequence analysis (OCA) to estimate the potential for an accidental release of a regulated substance to affect the public or the environment. The OCA consists of evaluating both worst-case scenarios (WCSs) and alternative release scenarios (ARSs). KMCO does not expect a worst case release scenario to ever occur. An ARS represents a release that might occur during the lifetime of a facility like KMCO.  ARSs help the LEPC improve the community emergency response plan. We have shared that information with the LEPC and other organizations involved in emergency response activities. It is also available to the public. If you are interested in this information, please contact our RMP coordinator at (281) 328-3501.\n\n\n\nThe main objective of performing the OCA is to determine the distance at which certain effects might occur to the public because of an accidental release (called the endpoint distance). The following effects could occur at the endpoint distance. At distances less than the endpoint distance, the effects should be greater; at distances greater than the endpoint distance, the effects would be less.\n\n\n\nWorst-case Release Scenarios\n\n\n\nThe worst-case release scenario for toxic substances is failure of a storage tank containing 246,000 lbs of Ethylene Oxide (EO). KMCO does not believe that a worst case scenario could ever occur. Nevertheless, a computer modeling program, RMP Comp, was used to calculate offsite impact.  The scenario is based on the following: the product is liquefied by refrigeration, release is to concrete diked contaiment, and the release rate due to evaporation is 310 lbs/minute for a duration of 792 minutes in rural surroundings.  Although mitigation measures (e.g., deluge system at the storage tanks) are available, none were assumed for the modeling. Factors such as city water service interruption and/or low water pre"

Calculation resulted in a distance to toxic endpoint of 3.5 miles, and the toxic cloud would affect the surrounding populous. \n\n  \n\nAlternative Release Scenarios\n\n\n\nThe ARS for EO is rupture of a 2-inch diameter liquid unloading line (located outside of containment) from the railcar to one of the secondary EO storage tanks. This scenario assumes the EO is liquefied under pressure, release duration is 10 minutes, with no mitigation.  (There is containment around the EO storage tank -- specifically, a 26' x 20' x 6' deep concrete \"bunker\" , with a wall thickness of 12\".  But, for this scenario, it will not be considered applicable.)  Estimated distance to toxic endpoint is 0.3 miles. \n\nOther alternate scenarios are available for each of the other substances handled.  \n\n\n\n1.4 Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the KMCO plant. Because processes at the KMCO plant are regulated by the EPA RMP regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) process safety management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\n\n\nKMCO encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention. Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team. Employees have access to information created as part of the KMCO plant accident prevention program. In addition, KMCO has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and employee safety issues. These initiatives include a Safety Committee to promote both process and personal safety. The team has members from"

These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. \n\n\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs) and available on the KMCO intranet. This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals. For specific process areas, KMCO has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in PHA documentation. KMCO ensures that the process is maintained within these limits by using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g. pressure/temperature indicators and automated shutdown systems).\n\n\n\nKMCO also maintains documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel,, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating prop9osed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\n\n\nKMCO has established programs to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.

Once again, the team findings are forwarded to appropriate personnel for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\n\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nKMCO maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent graining of new operators.

Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, KMCO has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform KMCO plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.\n\n\n\n\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\n\n\nKMCO conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information. The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service. This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all-supporting systems are operationally ready.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\n\n\nKMCO has practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition. The basic aspects of this program include: \n\n(1) conducting training, (2) developing writt"

Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended, and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits. If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or an MOC will be distributed to appropriate personnel to review the use of equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\n\n\n\nSafe Work Practices\n\n\n\nKMCO has safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety. Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous materials before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e. hot work), and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space. These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change\n\n\n\nKMCO has a comprehensive system to manage changes to processes. This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change. Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures are updated to i"

In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided with any necessary training on the change.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\n\n\nKMCO investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury. The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to the HSE Department for filing recommendations are tracked until they are complete. \n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\n\n\nCompliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years. Both hourly and management personnel may participate as audit team members and typically a third-party consultant is hired to assist in the audit. The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to KMCO plant management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the most recent audit report is retained.\n\n\n\nChemical-specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nThe processes at KMCO have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation. The prevention program summarized previously is applied to all Program 2 and 3 EPA RMP -covered processes at KMCO.  Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by (1) equipment failures and (2) human errors. \n\n\n\nIn addition to the accident prevention program activities, KMCO has safety features on many units to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release. The following types of safety features are used in various processes:\n\n\n\n    Release Detection\n\n\n\n* Ethylene Oxide detectors\n\n* Proces"
