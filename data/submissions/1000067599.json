The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  PHA team members include the process/project engineer responsible for the process/project, plant manager or knowledgeable plant personnel, a person knowledgeable in methods of hazard analysis, and others with particular expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.  \r\n\r\nImplementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk matrix assigned by the PHA team.  The matrix is based on severity (criticality) and probability (frequency).  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\r\n\r\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the PHA team periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The recommended order of analysis will be based upon the following criteria:\r\n1)\tage of process,\r\n2)\textent of process hazards,\r\n3)\tnumber of affected employees, and\r\n4)\toperating history of the process.\r\n\r\nThe results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.

The PSI is useful to the operators, the team performing the PHA, those in charge of training, contractors, those conducting pre-startup safety reviews, and those in charge of updating the emergency preparedness plans.  Process Safety Information is readily available to all employees.\r\n\r\nTETRA keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the process.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.\r\n\r\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in safety data sheets (SDS).\r\n\r\nTETRA also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes material of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\r\n\r\n3.2  Process Hazard Analysis (PHA)\r\n\r\nTETRA has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.

This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of TETRA's processes.  TETRA's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to, control, and contain the release.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.0  DESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nTETRA is located in an agricultural area that borders West Memphis, Arkansas.  TETRA produces zinc bromide, calcium bromide, and sodium bromide blends in water solutions that are used as high-density workover and completion fluids in the oil and gas industry.\r\n\r\nTETRA was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances exceeded the threshold of EPA's Risk Management Program Rule.  Based on process knowledge, TETRA personnel identified no listed flammable substances and one toxic regulated substance kept on site above threshold quantities.  The chemical, its largest quantity on site, and associated threshold quantity is presented in Table 1.\r\n\r\nTable 1.

The review is to ensure that the procedures reflect current operating practice, include changes from process technology changes, chemical changes, equipment changes, and changes to facilities.  The review and certification process involves both operators and technical staff.\r\n\r\nThe intent of the operating procedures is to provide workable, useful, and clearly written instructions for conducting operating activities.  To have effective operating procedures, the task and procedures directly and indirectly related to the covered process must be appropriate, clear, consistent, and, most importantly, communicated to employees.  Operating procedures are specific instructions or details on what steps are taken or followed in completing the stated procedures.  The specific instructions include the applicable safety precautions and appropriate information on safety implications.\r\n\r\n3.4  Training\r\n\r\nIn addition to training on operating procedures, TETRA has a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating the process.  New employees receive basic training in process operations and procedures.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every three years.  The appropria"

In addition, operating and maintenance personnel, including contractor employees, are provided any necessary training regarding the change.\r\n\r\n3.7  Pre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSR)\r\n\r\nTETRA conducts a PSSR on any new facility modification that requires a change in process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment and subject chemicals into service.  This review provides an additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with design specification and that all-supporting systems are operationally ready.\r\n\r\nThe PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.  The PSSR also ensures that procedures (safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency) are in place and are adequate.  \r\n\r\n3.8  Compliance Audits\r\n\r\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, TETRA periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.  Compliance audits are conducted at least every three years.  Both hourly and staff personnel participate as audit team members with at least one person knowledgeable in audit techniques.  The audit team develops findings in a report that is forwarded to plant management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked and documented until completion.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the appropriate enhancements to the prevention program are implemented.  The two most recent compliance audit reports are retained.\r\n\r\n3.9  Incid"

The goal of each investigation is to gather the facts, determine the root cause, and develop corrective action(s) to prevent the reoccurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The reports are maintained for five years.\r\n\r\nAn investigation team is established to investigate each process incident.  The team will consist of members involved in the incident including at least one person knowledgeable in the process involved, a contract employee (if the incident involved the work of a contractor), and other persons with appropriate knowledge and experience to thoroughly investigate and analyze the incident.  The investigation team documents its findings in a report.  The report includes dates of the incident and investigation, description of the incident, factors contributing to the incident, and develops recommendations to prevent recurrence, these results are forwarded to the business management team for resolution.\r\n\r\n3.10  Employee Participation\r\n\r\nActive employee participation and involvement in the development and implementation of TETRA's PSM program is an important step toward achieving the objective to prevent or minimize the consequences of catastrophic releases of toxic, reactive, flammable, or explosive chemicals.  Employee involvement will help to ensure that all perspectives regarding PSM are considered, and that the best ideas are implemented.
