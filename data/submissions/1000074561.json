This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of the facility's processes.  It is the practice of Culberson Midstream LLC to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances. However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to, control and contain the release.\n\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Maverick Liquids Fallout Facility is located in Culberson County, Texas is owned by Culberson Midstream LLC and is operated by Culberson Midstream LLC.\n\n\n\nMaverick Liquid Fallout Facility is a site for collecting condensate from raw gas. The inlet stream enters the slug catcher V-1115 at high pressure, roughly 1000 psig. Gas leaves the slug catcher via the offload line where it goes through the offload scrubber V-1120 and then exits the site. Liquids are sent in batches to the 3-phase 60,000 gallon surge vessel V-7010, where a pressure cut is taken between the slug catcher and surge vessel across a liquid control valve, taking the liquids from 1000 psig to about 30 psig. Any flash that occurs in the vessel is captured by overhead compressors C-2310/2315 and pressured to 1000 psig to combine back with the offload line between the slug catcher and offload scrubber. The liquids are sent in batches from the surge vessel to atmospheric tanks. Water is sent to (2) produced water tanks TK-8180/8181 and condensate is sent to (4) condensate tanks TK-8100/8110/8120/8130. The (6) tanks have a common vapor header and any flash is captured by the VRU C-0101, compressed to 35 psig, and sent to the suction of the over"

These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters, specific chemicals inventories and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Chemical specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/ exposure treatment considerations is provided in safety data sheets (SDS).\n\n\n\nCulberson Midstream LLC also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure ratings, temperature ratings and electrical rating of equipment.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nCulberson Midstream LLC primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) and Checklist method analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  The analyses are conducted using a team of Culberson Midstream staff which has operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes recommendations for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\n\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution.

The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendation(s) to prevent a reoccurrence and forwards these results to the business management team for resolution.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, Culberson Midstream LLC periodically conducts an audit of the program to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.  Compliance audits are conducted at least every three years.  Both hourly and staff personnel participate as audit team members. The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to operations or facility management for resolution. The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.\n\n\n\nChemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe processes at the Maveric"

      "SummaryText": " Information\n\nThe Maverick Liquid Fallout Facility maintains a written emergency procedure, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The procedures are for the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released. The procedures address notification of local emergency response agencies if a release occurs.  Employees receive training in emergency procedures.  The emergency procedure is updated when necessary based on modifications made to the plant facilities.\n\n\n\nThe overall emergency procedure program for the Maverick Liquid Fallout Facility is coordinated with the Culberson County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials and industry representatives.  The Maverick Liquid Fallout Facility has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department). This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.  In addition to periodic LEPC meetings, the Maverick Liquid Fallout Facility conducts periodic emergency drills that involve the LEPC and emergency response organizations, and also provides periodic refresher training to local emergency responders regarding the hazards of regulated substances in the plant.\n\n\n\n&#8195;\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe Maverick Liquid Fallout Facility resolves all findings from PHAs, some of which result in modifications to the process.  Other recommendations for possible changes to improve safety come from periodic accident prevention program audits, incident investigations, or employee suggestions and recommendations.  The following changes are planned for implementation at the Maverick Liquid Fallout Facility.\n\n\n\nCulberson Midstream LLC is currently in the pro"
