This is accomplished by providing contractors with an orientation session that covers (1) a process overview, (2) information about the safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements and (4) safe work practices prior to beginning their work. In addition, Placeholder Petrochemical evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the contractor selection process.  Placeholder Petrochemical personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\r\nPre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR)\r\nThe Maverick Liquid Fallout Facility conducts a PSSR prior to the startup of all new facilities or any modification that requires a change in process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\nThe Maverick Liquid Fallout Facility has well established practices and procedures for maintaining process equipment.  The basic aspects of this program include (1) training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting equipment deficiencies, when identified and (5) applying quality assurance measures.  In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.\r\n\r\nSafe Work Practices\r\nThe Maverick Liquid Fallout Facility has safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety. Examples of these include: (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous substances before process piping and equipment is opened, (4)"

This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of the facility's processes.  It is the practice of Culberson Midstream LLC to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances. However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to, control and contain the release.\r\n\r\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\nThe Maverick Liquids Fallout Facility is located in Culberson County, Texas is owned by Culberson Midstream LLC and is operated by Culberson Midstream LLC.\r\n\r\nMaverick Liquid Fallout Facility is a site for collecting condensate from raw gas. The inlet stream enters the slug catcher V-1115 at high pressure, roughly 1000 psig. Gas leaves the slug catcher via the offload line where it goes through the offload scrubber V-1120 and then exits the site. Liquids are sent in batches to the 3-phase 60,000 gallon surge vessel V-7010, where a pressure cut is taken between the slug catcher and surge vessel across a liquid control valve, taking the liquids from 1000 psig to about 30 psig. Any flash that occurs in the vessel is captured by overhead compressors C-2310/2315 and pressured to 1000 psig to combine back with the offload line between the slug catcher and offload scrubber. The liquids are sent in batches from the surge vessel to atmospheric tanks. Water is sent to (2) produced water tanks TK-8180/8181 and condensate is sent to (4) condensate tanks TK-8100/8110/8120/8130. The (6) tanks have a common vapor header and any flash is captured by the VRU C-0101, compressed to 35 psig, and sent to the suction of the over"

      "SummaryText": "Information\r\nThe Maverick Liquid Fallout Facility maintains a written emergency procedure, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The procedures are for the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released. The procedures address notification of local emergency response agencies if a release occurs.  Employees receive training in emergency procedures.  The emergency procedure is updated when necessary based on modifications made to the plant facilities.\r\n\r\nThe overall emergency procedure program for the Maverick Liquid Fallout Facility is coordinated with the Culberson County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials and industry representatives.  The Maverick Liquid Fallout Facility has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department). This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.  In addition to periodic LEPC meetings, the Maverick Liquid Fallout Facility conducts periodic emergency drills that involve the LEPC and emergency response organizations, and also provides periodic refresher training to local emergency responders regarding the hazards of regulated substances in the plant.\r\n\r\n&#8195;\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\nThe Maverick Liquid Fallout Facility resolves all findings from PHAs, some of which result in modifications to the process.
