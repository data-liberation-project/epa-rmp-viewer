Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nAt the Howard F. Curren Advanced Wastewater Treatment Plant (HFC AWTP), both chlorine and sulfur dioxide are handled at levels above the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) threshold.  The quantity of chemicals stored at the plant make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to personal health maintenance workers, and to reduce the threat to members of nearby community and the environment.  It is the policy of the HFC AWTP to adhere to all applicable Federal and State rules and regulations.  The HFC AWTP's accidental release prevention program involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices.  The HFC AWTP's emergency response plan includes written procedures for reacting to events associated with the Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide systems.  The procedures include safe handling procedures, mitigation techniques, and communication protocols (internal and external).\n\n\n\n2.    HFC AWTP and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe regulated substances handled at HFC AWTP are chlorine and sulfur dioxide.  The primary purpose of this facility is to treat the wastewater from the City of Tampa Service Area.  Both chlorine and sulfur dioxide are received in 90-ton rail cars and stored at either the chlorine unloading station or the sulfur dioxide unloading station.  Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel, and authorized contractors.\n\nThe maximum amount of chlorine that is stored at the treatment plant is (2) 90-ton rail cars (360,000 pounds).  Similarly, the maximum amount of sulfur dioxide that is stored at the treatment plant is (2) 90-ton rail cars (360,000 pounds).  \n\n\n\n3.    General Accidental Release Pre"

The HFC AWTP's general accidental release prevention program contains four parts: designing for safety, maintaining safe operations, operating safely, and auditing our operations.  \n\n3.1    Designing for Safety:\n\n?    Rail car construction meets federal guideline 49CFR179.102\n\n?    Excessive-flow check valve prevents rapid release of rail car contents\n\n?    Redundant or backup safety systems are part of design\n\n?    Remote sensing device to detect leaks\n\n?    Valves and equipment are tagged and numbered\n\n\n\n3.2    Maintaining Safe Operations:\n\n?    Safety reviews for all changes\n\n?    Maintenance personal trained on the job by standards set by the Chlorine Institute\n\n?    Preventative maintenance program conducted by qualified technicians\n\n?    Equipment checked on a routine schedule\n\n?    Frequent walk-through inspections by maintenance personnel\n\n\n\n3.3    Operating Safely:\n\n?    Written operating procedures and operational standards based on process hazard analysis\n\n?    Established shut-down procedures\n\n?    Standby generator available for backup power\n\n?    Leak sensors monitored in control room\n\n?    Operators present during loading and unloading of rail cars\n\n\n\n3.4    Auditing our Operations:\n\n?    Critical equipment/instrumentation tested and inspected weekly to assure proper operation\n\n?    Pre-startup safety reviews on new or modified equipment\n\n?    Process hazard analysis conducted regularly\n\n?    Design changes reviewed for proper design\n\n?    Investigation and follow-up of all accidents and incidents\n\n?    Emergency drills and exercises on a periodic basis\n\n\n\n4.    Five-year Accident History\n\nThe HFC AWTP has not had accidental releases of chlorine of sulfur dioxide in the past five years.\n\n\n\n5.    Emergency Response Program.\n\nThe City of Tampa HFC-AWTP has established an Emergency Response Plan (ERP) which outline"

The existing ERP addresses the intent and requirements of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Standards codified as: \n\n?    29 CFR 1910.38 (Emergency Action Plans) \n\n?    29 CFR 1910.120 (Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response) \n\n?    29 CFR 1910.1200 (Hazard Communication)\n\nThe ERP is reviewed annually to ensure the plan is consistent and effective.\n\nThe HFC AWTP has been subdivided into emergency response areas.  Each area has a designated Rally Point and Shelter-in-place locations.  The HFC-AWTP conducts emergency drills and exercises on a and Shelter-in-place locations.  The HFC AWTP conducts emergency drills and exercises on a periodic basis to test specific aspects of the Emergency Response Plan and to identify areas where procedural changes or capital upgrades can be made.\n\nThe HFC AWTP uses Everbridge software to timely notify any emergency to the treatment plant staff, visitors and contractors.\n\nAll employees receive general emergency response training for his/her assigned work area when first employed at the HFC-AWTP.  This training provides basic instruction on how to respond in an appropriate manner during an incident.  Training is updated annually or whenever significant changes in onsite conditions, applicable hazards, or response actions occur.\n\n\n\n6.    Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThrough our ongoing implementation of the Risk Management Program, HFC AWTP looks continuously for possible chlorine and sulfur dioxide system changes to improve safety in our facility.  \n\nCurrently, local siren systems are being installed throughout the treatment plant to help communicate emergency notifications to staff inside the buildings.  In theory, the alarm will be audible inside all staffed buildings while instructions will be received through the Everbridge notificati"
