Executive Summary\nThis program is intended to meet the spirit and intent of the following regulations:\n- California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program - Title 19 CCR, Chapter 4.5\n- Federal EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) - Title 40 CFR \u00a768\n- California Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 8 CCR \u00a75189\n- Federal Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 29 CFR \u00a71910.119\n\nHereafter this program will be referred to as the RMP-PSM program.\n\nThis program is intended to be a \"living document\". As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible and updated as necessary. To accomplish this, Legacy Packing and Cold Storage has elected to use PSMWriter, software developed and distributed by Resource Compliance, Inc. This software will assist us with updating, maintaining, scheduling, and tracking RMP-PSM related activities. \n\n1.1 Legacy Packing and Cold Storage, Risk and Process Safety Management Program\n\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that Legacy Packing and Cold Storage has updated/developed their unified RMP-PSM Program. This program has been prepared to address the risks involved in operating and maintaining the following processes which have the presence of hazardous chemicals above threshold quantities: \n\nProcess Name                      | Process Chemical                      | Process Quantity(lbs.)\nAmmonia Refrigeration               Anhydrous Ammonia                       63,000\n\nOur RMP-PSM program promotes overall plant, worker, and public safety. The program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of hazardous chemicals. Overall, the program is designed to prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, illnesses and physical property damage.\n\nOur company has many policies and procedures in place to promote overall plant, worker and public safety.

The facility has an ammonia refrigeration system that provides refrigeration capacity to the following:\n\n(10) Rooms\n(8) Precools\n(2) Loading Docks\n(1) Bin Room\n(5) Degreening Rooms\n\n1.2.2 Facility Location\n\nLegacy Packing Cold Storage is located at 38773 Road 48 Dinuba CA, 93618. The latitude and longitude of the machinery room is 36.495284, -119.469497. The facility is located approximately 3 miles east of state highway 99 in a rural area surrounded primarily by agriculture land.\nAccording to FEMA Flood Map Service, the facility is not located in a special flood hazard area.\nLegacy Packing Cold Storage is not located in an Alquist-Priolo Fault Zone as defined by the California Department of Conservation. In addition, a review of United States Geological Survey (USGS) fault maps revealed that there are no faults in close proximity to the site. The USGS 2018 One-Year Model revealed that Legacy Packing Cold Storage had a 1-2% chance of experiencing \u0093potentially minor-damage\u0094 due to ground shaking in 2018.\n\n1.2.3 Description of Covered Process\n\nThe refrigeration system is a combination between a flooded and pumped overfeed system. The refrigerated spaces are equipped with air-cooling evaporators and accumulators, or equipped with only air-cooling evaporators. \n\nAll control valve groups are located on the roof to provide easy access. The refrigeration machinery is contained within or directly adjacent to t"

As such, the refrigeration system at Legacy Packing Cold Storage is treated as a single process.\n\n1.3 General Accident Release & Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\n1.3.1 General \n\nWe inform our employees engaged in process operations of the dangers of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia in annual safety meetings. During these meeting we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\n\nLegacy Packing and Cold Storage has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the ammonia refrigeration process. These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release. The results of the analyses are reported in PSMWriter and hard copy binders. \n\n1.3.2 Anhydrous Ammonia\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration process at the Legacy Packing and Cold Storage facility is an integral part of the overall business and operates most of the year. It is extremely important that this process is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner. Management is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.\nOur refrigeration personnel monitor the ammonia refrigeration process and keep active records of all procedures and transactions that pertain to ammonia. In addition, the process is checked frequently by one of the outside refrigeration contractors that we use. These contractors also assist in performing the annual mechanical integrity inspection of our ammonia equipment. \n\n1.4 Five Year Accident History\n\nLegacy Packing and Cold Storage has had no accidental release within the last five (5) years.\n\n1.5 Emergency Action and Response Plan\n\nLegacy Packing and Cold Storage's emergency action and response program has been d"

Nevertheless, Legacy Packing and Cold Storage continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.\n\nBy utilizing PSMWriter software, all necessary employees have access to every aspect of the RMP-PSM program. This has improved Legacy Packing and Cold Storage's ability to communicate hazardous situations to employees and contractors. In addition, PSMWriter tracks all RMP-PSM related events so that Legacy Packing and Cold Storage's management team can ensure that the RMP-PSM program is being implemented.\n\nLegacy Packing and Cold Storage has implemented all aspects of the RMP-PSM program. When a RMP-PSM program requirement is completed (i.e. mechanical integrity inspection, process hazard analysis, compliance audit, etc.) any specific action items related to that event are entered into PSMWriter, assigned a responsible person, and given a due date. Once the action item has been completed, the resolution can be documented using PSMWriter as well. A list of current or past due action items can be accessed at any time by those with access to PSMWriter.\n\nIn addition to utilizing PSMWriter to create, schedule, track, and document events, Legacy Packing and Cold Storage has also entered into a contract with Resource Compliance to obtain help with RMP-PSM program implementation.\n\nFor the future, Legacy"
