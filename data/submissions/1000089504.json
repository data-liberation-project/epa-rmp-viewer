The purpose of this Executive Summary is to provide a brief description of certain elements of the Risk Management Plan that has been implemented at the AMPAC Fine Chemicals LLC (AFC) facility, located in Rancho Cordova, California. The objectives of the California Accidental Release Prevention Program are to prevent the accidental release of certain regulated substances, minimize the risk to the community, and promote communication between the facility and emergency response personnel.\n\n1.0 Accidental Release Prevention\u00a0\nAMPAC Fine Chemicals has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the covered processes.  AMPAC Fine Chemicals policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.\n\n- Provide and maintain facilities, operations, and working conditions, which are safe for employees, visitors, contractors, and the public.\n- Provide appropriate information and training to enable all activities to be conducted in a responsible and effective manner.\n- Include health, safety, environmental and loss prevention considerations in planning and decision making.\n- Comply with applicable laws and regulations and establish and maintain programs and procedures to assure that those laws and regulations are known and followed by its employees.\n- Minimize any undue risk to health, safety or the environment in connection with the conduct of its business.\n- Promote product stewardship including exerting a positive influence on the environmental, health and safety performance of contract manuf"

The main entrance to the Aerojet site, or Gate 3, is located at Highway 50 and Aerojet Road. The primary gate for AFC employees is Gate l, at the corner of Hazel and Folsom Blvd, and further south Gate IA. The entire Aerojet site extends between Sunrise Boulevard in Rancho Cordova on the west, Prairie City Road in Folsom to the east, and from Folsom Boulevard on the north to White Rock Road on the south. AFC operations are limited to Line 5, two warehouses located on Line 4, and Building 01-020.\n\nAFC is a contract manufacturer of custom intermediate and active pharmaceutical ingredients utilizing batch processes. Active pharmaceutical ingredients (also known as bulk pharmaceutical substances) typically consist of structurally complex organic chemical compounds, which are manufactured via a series of intermediate steps and reactions under precise conditions. An intermediate is a material produced during a manufacturing process that must undergo further molecular change or processing before it becomes an active pharmaceutical ingredient. These are all well regulated, permitted, and inspected by local, county, and state officials. Any excess hazardous material is gathered and stored in separate containers at a specific location at the Rancho Cordova Facility to be properly disposed of by a professional third party. All use, excess, and disposed of hazardous material is documented and kept on file for five years.\n\nSince AFC is a contract manufacturer, pharmaceutical campaigns may run a couple of weeks to a couple of years. Therefore, due to the possible intermittent use, AFC has registered for all of the chemicals in which the thresh"

      "SummaryText": "old quantities are anticipated to be exceeded during the next couple of production years, otherwise known as predictive filing. Actual quantities of regulated materials maintained onsite may be significantly less than the registered amount. AFC uses the following chemicals in amounts that exceed the regulatory threshold for certain regulatory defined processes including:\n\nAcryloyl Chloride\nAmmonium Hydroxide, 30%\nAmmonia in Methanol\nAnhydrous Ammonia\nBis(chloromethyl) Ether\nCyanogen Bromide\nHydrogen Chloride (Anhydrous)\nHydrochloric Acid (37%)\nPhosphorus Oxychloride\nPhosgene\nSodium Azide\n\nThe majority of the covered processes involve the storage of the regulated substance in the original supplier's container. The anhydrous ammonia is currently the only regulated substance that is consolidated in a single bulk storage tank.\n\n3.0 HAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario Results Summary for Toxics\n\nWCR Scenario Description: The worst-case scenario for 37% Hydrochloric Acid (aqueous) assumes a rupture and release of the entire contents of 55-gal drum of 500 pounds of 37% HCl, which spills and creates a liquid evaporating pool on the ground in the storage building 04-045. The air, ground, and puddle temperature used in the simulation is 95oF which is the highest average temperature in Rancho Cordova, CA. Moreover, enclosure (unsheltered single storied building) was considered as a mitigation measure. Using the parameters mandated by regulations through the RMP*Comp program, this worst-case release has the potential to traverse a 0.5-mile radius from the point of release and the potential to affect the population of 0 people.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario Results Summary for Toxics\n\nThis section is not applicable since Process 1 (37% HCl (aqueous) in building 04-045) and Process 2 (POCl3 in building 05-002B) are both Program Level 1.\u00a0\n\n4.0 Accidental Release Prevention Program AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STeps\n\u00a0\nAs part of the implementation of this Ris"

In addition, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are currently utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed.\n\nAFC has implemented this Risk Management Plan and a Process Safety Management (PSM) Plan in accordance with Title 8 CCR Section 5189 and 29 CFR 1910.119, which include the following elements:\n\u00a0\n- Process safety information for each process is maintained to enable the identification of hazards involving regulated substances.  The documentation provides information on the specific hazards from the regulated substances used or generated, the technology of the process and process equipment.\n- A Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) is conducted prior to the start-up of each process or campaign, which uses a regulated substance that that exceeds the PSM threshold quantity.  The PHA identifies, evaluates and controls the hazards according to a risk rate system, based on hazard probability and severity.  The prioritization ranking dictates the implementation of hazard mitigation and control systems. \n- Written operating procedures, or batch records, are developed and implemented for each process, to provide process safety information, instructions and guidance to conduct the process activities.\n- Training is provided to all employees who handle or may come into contact with the regulated chemicals or processes.  The training program includes new-hire orientation, annual refresher classes, and process-specific safety training.  The process specific training is conducted before the start of a new process and emphasizes chemical safety, hazard communication, operating procedures, and safe work practices.\n- Mechanical Integrity system to maintain the on-going reliability of process equipment.\n- A Management of Change procedure has been developed and implemented to provide an administrative tracking system"

An incident investigation procedure is kept onsite which summarizes the required data that will be used as necessary to document any CalARP Program-related incidents.\n\n6.0 Emergency Response Program\n\u00a0\nAFC is committed to providing a safe and healthful work environment for its employees, the surrounding community, and the environment. The prevention of accidents, injuries, fires, emergency releases, and other emergency situations is of utmost importance and shall be the first priority for all persons working at the refinery.\n\nAFC is not a first responder. Thus, AFC has an Emergency Action Plan in place and submits appropriate documentation regarding the chemicals and associated quantities to be included in the community emergency response plan.\n\u00a0\n7.0 Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\u00a0\nThe planned changes to improve safety at the facility resolve the recommendations derived from the Process Hazard Analysis, as well as incorporated recommendations from compliance audits and incident investigations, as they become available.  The facility has a tracking system for implementing these recommendations and ensuring its closure."
