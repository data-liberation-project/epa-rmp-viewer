              "Description": "An industrial ammonia refrigeration system services the Perishable Distributors of Iowa perishable warehouse located in Ankeny, Iowa. The system provides refrigeration for cooler, freezer and dock air units.\n\n\n\nA machine room houses the compressors, pressure vessels, and control system.  Seven screw compressor packages are located in the machine room. Four economized compressors service the low temperature evaporators (-30F suction).  Three compressor services the high temperature evaporators and liquid subcooling loads (15F suction). All compressors have thermosyphon oil cooling.\n\n\n\nFour evaporative condensers are located above the machine room roof. The condensers are axial fan units with remote water pumps and a water sump. The condenser fans have two-speed motors.\n\n\n\nThe evaporators are circuited for liquid recirculation, bottom feed, and hot gas defrosting. The ice cream, freezer, and cooler evaporators are constructed of aluminum tubes and fins. The dock evaporators are constructed of galvanized tubes and fins. The evaporator control valves are located on the roof.\n\n\n\nThe pressure vessels are located in the machine room. A control pressure receiver, CPR-1, is used as an ammonia storage vessel. A low pressure receiver, LPR-1, is used to feed the low temperature evaporators. Accumulators, ACC-1 and ACC-2, and liquid transfer unit, LTU-1, are used for liquid sub-cooling and feeding the high temperature evaporators. A thermosyphon receiver, TS-1, is used for compressor oil cooling.\n\n\n\nAll refrigeration system piping is black steel, ASTM A53 Grade B or ASTM A333 Grade 6. All joints are welded except where impractical for service. Extruded polystyrene pipe and vessel insulation with PVC or aluminum jacket is applied to all vessels and piping subjected to sweating and frosting.\n\n\n\nA microprocessor based system controls the refrigeration system. The central system controls the compressors, condensers, evaporators, pressure vessels, and safety controls. Sensors are used for monitoring temperatures, pressures, vessel liquid levels, and ammonia leak detection. An operator interface (graphics computer) is used for monitoring, alarming, and set-point changes. Alarming is provided with an automatic telephone dialer.",

      "SummaryText": "The Ankeny Perishable Warehouse is a grocery products storage and distribution facility that contains refrigerated areas.  The refrigerated areas are cooled by an anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system.  Anhydrous ammonia, a substance regulated by EPA, is one of the most economical refrigerants available.  However, the properties of ammonia makes it necessary to observe certain safety precautions while operating the refrigeration system to prevent employee exposure, and to reduce the threat of exposure to nearby members of the community.\n\n\n\nThe Ankeny Perishable Warehouse chose to follow the EPA's Chemical Accident Prevention Rule, Program Level 3, to prevent a release of ammonia from the refrigeration system.\n\n\n\nThe Ankeny Perishable Warehouse complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule, and applicable state codes and regulations to prevent a catastrophic release of ammonia.  The ammonia refrigeration system has been constructed according to the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration guidelines (IIAR).  The operators of the systems are required to complete a training and certification program to operate the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\n\n\nThe Ankeny Perishable Warehouse has an established Emergency Action Plan to respond to emergencies.  The plan was developed in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.38 Emergency Action Plan.  The plan requires most employees to exit the facility during a fire or ammonia release to designated safe areas.  An OSHA HAZWOPER (29 CFR 1910.120) Technician-level ammonia emergency response team is trained to respond to releases of ammonia for the purpose of attempting to stop the release and/or mitigate or minimize the effects of such a release.  Emergency agencies will be notified of the emergency.  The emergency agencies will notify any potentially affected neighbors.  Maintenance personnel will be available as a resource during an ammonia release emergency.  The plan also addresses natural hazard emergencies, fires, bomb th"

      "SummaryText": "reats, civil disturbances, and utility outages.\n\n\n\nThis location has not experienced an ammonia release in the past 5 years.\n\n\n\nThe Ankeny Perishable Warehouse wanted to evaluate the potential failures of the refrigeration system, and if the safeguards were sufficient to prevent a catastrophic release of ammonia.  A Process Hazard Analysis was completed on the refrigeration system in 2018.  Planned changes to improve safety resulting from this analysis are documented in the Process Hazard Analysis report in the Accidental Chemical Release Prevention Program.  Also, the guidelines from the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) will be followed where applicable, to manage the refrigeration system."
