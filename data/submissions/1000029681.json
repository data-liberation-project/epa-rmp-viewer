The Grand Valley\r\nGas Conditioning Plant has also implemented all the elements of Williams Midstream's System Integrity Plan\r\n(SIP), which contains additional environmental, health, and safety standards.\r\n\r\nThe Grand Valley Gas Conditioning Plant's Emergency Response Plan is site-specific. It includes required\r\nactions by plant employees as well as required notification and coordination with local responders and\r\nagencies. All employees are trained in the execution of the Emergency Response Plan and drills are conducted\r\nannually.\r\n\r\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated substances:\r\n\r\nThe Grand Valley Gas Conditioning Plant processes raw natural gas into pure methane, and other natural gas\r\nliquids. The raw natural gas is received by pipeline. The methane is delivered by pipeline. The NGLs are\r\ndelivered by both pipelines and to a truck loading rack.\r\n\r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program:\r\n\r\nThe Grand Valley Gas Conditioning Plant has implemented all the elements of a Program 3 Risk Management\r\nPlan (RMP) and all the elements of OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) program. The plant has also\r\nimplanted all the elements of Williams Midstream's System Integrity Plan (SIP), which contains additional\r\nenvironmental, health, and safety standards. Key elements of these programs include:\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information: A variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of\r\nthe process.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA): A systematic examination of the plant to identify possible hazards and ensure\r\nthat adequate controls are in place to manage these ha"
