The regulation requires procedures to protect the public and employees from the risk of accidental emissions of certain hazardous chemicals.  The following facility meets the criteria for a Program 2 category as defined in 40 CFR Part 68: \n\nRaw Water Disinfection Facility\n6902 Cherokee Circle\nAbilene, TX\n\nThis Risk Management Plan offers a systematic process for design, operation, and  maintenance of a water treatment plant in such a way as to minimize risks associated with storage and use of 24,000 lbs. of chlorine and 20,000 lbs. of anhydrous ammonia utilized in the disinfection process.\n\nIn the development of this plan, existing operational and safety policies and procedures were evaluated and , in some areas, enhanced to assure compliance with the law and optimum safety for the public and employees.  Various staff levels were involved in the development of this plan including management, supervisory, operations, and maintenance.  Tha City of Abilenes Risk Management Plan will be incorporated as an element in the Water Utilities overall health and safety program.\n\nThe City of Abilene conducted a release analysis utilizing the EPA's RMP Comp Model to determine the off-site consequence of and worst case release for chlorine.\n\nThe City of Abilene has implemented a Prevention Program that consists of;  updated safety information on all process chemicals;  designing, constructing, and operating all processes in accordance with regulatory and industry-specific codes and standards;  conducting hazard reviews that will be updated at least every five years by a registered professional engineer;  establishing written operating procedures;  fine tuning operational, safety, and maintenance training;  a preventative and corrective maintenance program to ensure t"
