      "SummaryText": "Lodi Gas Storage, LLC  is installing two propane vessels, a pump and associated equipment for injecting propane into a DOT regulated natural gas pipeline.  The purpose of the propane is to boost the BTU of the natural gas to improve its fuel value.  Although the propane tanks used for this operation have a water capacity of 14,000 gallons, the facility is limiting inventory of propane by administrative controls to limit the worst case hazard distance.\n\nThe facility has conducted a hazard assessement with the assistance of Dixon Risk Services, Inc. to determine the worst case hazard distance.  The facility is surrounded by agricultural land and the only nearby residence is outside the worst case hazard distance.  There are no businesses, parks or other offsite receptors within the worst case hazard distance.  This facility is submitting a Level 1 RMP based upon the rules established by EPA.\n\nThe facility has had no incidents with offsite incidents in the past five years.  The facility routinely coordinates its emergency response planning with outside response agencies including hosting visits and joint training exercises with the local fire department."
