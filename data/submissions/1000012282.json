(Facility ID: 100000195362)\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances:\n\nThe Mid-Missouri Energy, Inc. (MME) Ethanol Plant is located near Malta Bend, Saline County, Missouri.\n\nThe facility operates 24 hours per day, 7 days per week for the purpose of manufacturing fuel grade ethanol from grain. Processes involved in this activity include a) the receiving and milling of corn, b) liquefaction of the milled corn to produce mash, c) fermentation of the mash to produce beer, d) distillation of the beer to produce ethanol, and e) denaturing of the ethanol.  \n\nThe regulated substances under the RMP program are Anhydrous Ammonia and Denaturant(natural gasoline) which is considered a flammable mixture. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and used in the liquefaction process to adjust pH levels.  The maximum quantity of ammonia stored would be 92,924 pounds in one storage tank.  Denaturant is added to the ethanol at the end of the process so the ethanol can not be consumed.\n\nMME has determined that the radius of impact from a worst-case release would be approximately 5.4 miles; due to the amount of ammonia stored on site.  The radius of impact for a worst-case denaturant release is approximately 0.4 miles.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Response Policies:\n\nMME is committed to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated in the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel as well as considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility.\n\nMME's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, plant personnel will respond to contain the release as necessary. The two ethanol tanks, two final product tanks, and denaturant tank are all located in a large bermed tank farm containment area that is separated from the plant.  A release"

S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of anhydrous ammonia\" and the Standards of OSHA, 29 CFR 1910.119 \"Process safety management of highly hazardous chemicals.\" The anhydrous ammonia tank is located outside and equipped with remotely actuated emergency shut off valves and excess flow shut off valves.

Also, administrative controls include following written operating procedures, and to utilize specified personal protective equipment (PPE) for tasks when potential for exposure exists. MME conducts employee training as part of facility activities. Lastly, operations at both the tank farm and anhydrous ammonia tank can be overseen from the Control Room. \n\nFacility personnel at MME are not trained to be first responders to large incidents on-site. MME has coordinated with the Malta Bend Fire Department as well as the Marshall Fire Department for emergency response procedures.

Also, liquid waste can never be poured down a drain.  \n10.\tThe Coordinator will complete and submit the proper spill forms and reports required by state and federal agencies.\n\nBoth the truck and railcar loading/loadout areas have been equipped with containment devices. The truck loadout area is concrete and designed to direct the flow of potential spills to drains under this area. The drains are then directed into the tank farm's secondary containment area. A catchment basin is also located immediately below the railcar loadout. A spill to the railcar loadout catchment basin also drains back to the tank farm secondary containment via underground piping. Spill response materials are available throughout the facility to deal with minor spillage, as necessary. Spills shall be cleaned and removed promptly by trained employees. \n\nAdditional Information Specific to Anhydrous Ammonia\n\nUnlike spills of other liquid products, anhydrous ammonia will immediately evaporate at ambient temperature and pressure. It will not travel overland and into drainage systems at the plant. Therefore, traditional spill containment practices will not work in responding to the release. Facility employees are not trained as first responders for an anhydrous ammonia release and the local Fire Dept. (911) or emergency contractor should be contacted. To prevent exposure employees should:\n\n* Stay upwind of a spill or threatened release. Although ammonia vapors are lighter than air in some cases ammonia will hug the ground and drift. \n* Ammonia has excellent warning properties which may allow escape before concentrations affect health. Many people can detect ammonia odor at 1 to 5 parts per million which is a hundred times less than what is immediately dangerous to life and health. \n* Preplan your escape route prior to working near anhydrous ammonia. \n* Carefully approach with the wind at your back or"

The worst-case scenario is based on the release of all ammonia stored on site.  The worst case vapor cloud endpoint is approximately 5.4 miles from the center of the plant.  Public receptors are located within this 5.4 mile radius. For denaturant the worst-case scenario at the facility is the release of 550,440 pounds of denaturant creating a vapor cloud explosion.  The worst-case scenario is based on a release from the entire denaturant tank.  The worst case vapor cloud endpoint is approximately 0.4 miles from the center of the facility.  Public receptors are also located within the 0.4 mile radius.\n  \nAlthough MME has numerous controls in place to prevent such a release and to manage potential consequences, no credit for administrative controls or passive mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating this scenario.\n\nSince MME qualifies as a Program 3 due to the close proximity of public receptors, Program Safety Management has been completed for this facility.\n\nSince the facility also qualifies as a Program 3, Alternative Release Scenarios (ARS) were required.  The ARS is the release of 275,220 pounds of denaturant creating a vapor cloud explosion.  The ARS endpoint is approximately 0.4 miles from the center of the facility.  The ARS is the toxic release of 4,780 pounds per minute of ammonia.  The ARS endpoint is approximately 0.9 miles from the center of the facility.

Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the continuation of safe conditions. Updates to OSHA regulations, as well as other regulatory updates, are received by email and postal mail to be evaluated by staff regularly. MME conducts monthly safety meetings where recommendations for improvements are discussed and implemented. Additionally, the facility is currently making improvements to the safety program based on input received from MERC during an RMP inspection that took place on July 27, 2010.\n\nEmergency Response Program Information:\n\nMME has several safety programs in place at the facility that incorporate emergency response, including a Health and Safety Plan and Emergency Response Plan in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38. MME has coordinated with local emergency responders and provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).
