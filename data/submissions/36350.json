In addition, the Louisville facility is developing a Special Situations Plan (\u00bfSSP\u00bf) which is a program designed for responding to emergencies that may have impacts beyond the immediate plant and is a supplement to the Emergency Response Plan.  The Special Situation Plan will link the local response to the OxyChem Corporate Emergency Response Center located in Dallas, Texas.\n\nThe facility is a member of the Louisville Local Emergency Planning Committee (\u00bfLEPC\u00bf), which includes industrial and public entities.
