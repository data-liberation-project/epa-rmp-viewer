      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\t\r\n\r\nNew York City Environmental Protection (NYCDEP) uses chlorine to meet the New York State Sanitary Code and federal Safe Drinking Water Act disinfection requirements.  Hillview Reservoir is one of the locations where some of the City's water is treated with chlorine.\r\n\r\nNYCDEP is committed to protecting its employees, the public, and the environment from any accidental releases of chlorine.  We have implemented safety, environmental protection, and risk management programs to prevent hazardous materials releases.  If there is an accidental release, we will immediately call for emergency response to minimize the effect of the release and notify the public of any actions necessary to ensure public protection, through emergency management agencies.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nWe are committed to personnel safety, public safety, continued reliable operation and regulatory compliance.  Based on this commitment an individual designated as the RMP Responsible Manager has assumed overall responsibility for the development and implementation of the Risk Management Program.  The RMP Responsible Manager has also clearly defined accountability and responsibility for each of the prevention program elements to meet both the EPA and OSHA Process Safety Management Requirements.\r\n\r\nTo ensure that an offsite release does not occur, the NYCDEP maintains a release prevention program with the primary focus of protecting plant employees and the public from the hazards associated with an accident or release involving chlorine.  The multifaceted program includes the use of:\r\n\r\nChlorine detectors and alarms to rapidly alert operators to any problems;\r\n\r\nPersonal chlorine monitors to continuously monitor concentrations in the employee's breathing zone;\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information to document the safe process design;\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analyses to evaluate the chemical and process hazards;\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures to ensure that the system is operated safely"

      "SummaryText": ";\r\n\r\nMaintenance, inspection and testing to ensure that the system is maintained according to applicable standards and manufacturers recommendations;\r\n\r\nTraining, hot work permits, contractor safety and employee participation programs to ensure that all employees and contractors working on and around the processes are aware of the hazards, can perform their job duties safely and know the actions to be taken in an emergency;\r\n\r\nManagement of Change and Pre-startup Safety Reviews to ensure that the changes are documented, analyzed and kept within the design basis;\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation procedure to investigate each incident and A near misses to determine root causes and make needed safety improvements; and,\r\n\r\nPeriodic compliance audits to ensure that our programs are working as they should to protect both employees and the public.\r\n\r\nFive-year Accident History\r\n\r\nWithin the past five years, the Hillview Reservoir Facility has not had an accidental release that resulted in injuries or property damage.  The plant has never had a major chlorine release that had an adverse effect on the public.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response\r\nIn the event that a chlorine release does occur, the Hillview Reservoir Facility coordinates emergency response with the local Fire Department.  If such a release did occur, plant personnel would contact the on site Enviornmental Protection police who would contact the Yonkers Fire Department who would dispatch a trained HAZMAT team to the site to handle the chlorine release.\r\n\r\nMaintaining A Safe Operation\r\nThe NYCDEP continually works to safely manage the hazards of chlorine to protect employees and the community we serve.  The Risk Management Program is maintained to reduce the risk of accidental releases.  Each year we conduct training, review procedures, maintain the equipment and follow safe work practices.  Periodically, we audit our program, review our Process Hazard Analysis and coordinate with the community emergency response organization.  A c"

      "SummaryText": "hlorine system emergency scrubber system was installed to further reduce and minimize the likelihood of an off-site consequence. Expansion pots are in place to further increase safety related to a potential chlorine system incident. In addition, automatic shutoff valves are provided throughout the systems and are interlocked with the sensors and alarms to shutdown the operations in the event of a chlorine detection."
