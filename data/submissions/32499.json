IN SANDY RUN, SC\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\nDevro's accidental release prevention and emergency response policies show that the facility is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety, and adheres to all applicable regulations. The comprehensive accidental release prevention program covers response procedures such as pre-emergency employee training, lines of communication and authority, emergency recognition, evacuation routes and procedures, and emergency medical treatment. It is Devro's policy to implement appropriate measures to prevent possible release of regulated sustances.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\nDevro, Inc. has one (1) regulated substance at the facility above threshold quantity. The regulated substance is anhydrous ammonia. Ammonia is used in the facility's manufacturing process. Ammonia is stored in one 10,000 gallon nominal tank, and in a 12,000 gallon nominal tank. They can have on-site up to 85,000 pounds at one time in storage and in the process; however, the maximum amount of ammonia that could be released is 44,000 pounds. The facility is mandated to meet Program 3 requirements because a release would result in off-site impact, and is subject to OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION\nDevro, Inc. has taken the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA. The process is subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119 and is already in compliance. The following steps are key to the prevention program:\n1. Detailed records of safety information describing chemical hazards of ammonia, process technology, and process equipment;\n2. Comprehensive process hazard analysis are conducted with manangement, technical personel, and operators to ensure that hazards are recognized and evaluated;\n3. Opera"

      "SummaryText": "ting procedures were developed and implemented which describe tasks to be performed, dates to be recorded, operation conditions to be maintained, emergency operating procedures, and safety and health precautions to be taken;\n4. Employee training program is in effect to ensure that employees at the site are properly trained, aware of ammonia safety practices, hazards, emergency procedures, and maintenance procedures; operators, technicians, and managers are trained;\n5. An on-going mechanical integrity program is in place to ensure continued safe process operation and physical condition;\n6. Incident investigation procedures are in place to ensure that unplanned events effecting process safety are properly investigated in a timely maner to identify the causes of the incident, and to implement corrective action.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nDevro, Inc. has had an excellent record for preventing accidental releases over the last five years. Due to the effective release prevention policies, there have been no accidental release of ammonia of reportable quantities during the last five years.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\nThe site has a writtten emergency response plan to deal with the accidental release of ammonia, and other hazardous substances, which has been coordinated with local emergency response personnel. The plan contains the aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, and notification of the local emergency response groups, and the public.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nDevro, Inc. plans to continue to evaluate the regulated process as required under the PSM/RMP standards to ensure safe operations."
