Safety of the community and employee is our first priority.  We strictly follow all federal and state regulations including:  Process Safety Management, (1910.119) Sara Title III, Emergency Action and Fire Prevention Plan (1910.38) and the Respirator Protection Plan. (1910.134) Through safety training, testing, response drills, procedure reviews, safety devise checks and preventative maintenance, Elementis Chromium strives to provide the safest plant possible to both the community and the employees.\n\nOur Emergency Response Program includes Emergency Response with the Castle Hayne Fire Department.   All the Salt Cake Purification Plant operators and maintenance. technicians are 40 hr Hazmat certified and participate in yearly response drills.  The emergency response plan includes notification to Elementis security, Wilmington Hazmat team and the Castle Hayne Fire Department.\n\n2.\tThe Facility and the Regulated Substance Handled\n\nAt this Elementis facility, we purify Sodium Sulfate.  In the purification process, Sulfur Dioxide is used to reduce Hexavalent chrome to Trivalent chrome.  The liquid Sulfur Dioxide is received by truck every 2-4 months, with a maximum on-site storage capacity of 83,000 lbs.  The storage tank is located in its own building with dual gas detectors and an automatic ventilation system.  The liquid SO2 is transferred to the SO2 evaporator, heated to a gas, and fed to the process via vacuum injection.\n\n3.\tWorst Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nWorst Case Scenarios \u00bf Complete failure of the full Sulfur Dioxide storage tank would result in the release of 83,000 lbs of Sulfur Dioxide gas.  Using the EPA\u00bfs RMP * Comp modeling program, the distance to toxic endpoint is 19 miles.  Complete tank failure is highly unlikely as the tank is protected with relief v"

Also, as the liquid SO2 evaporates to a gas and escapes, the bulk liquid temperature drops, reducing the release rate to near zero before the tank is empty.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlternative case Scenarios \u00bf The alternate case assumes the tank is over filled.  The 3\u00bf pressure relief valve opens for 10 minutes.  Using the EPA\u00bfs RMP * Comp modeling program, the distance to toxic endpoint is 6 miles and the quantity released is 3,480 lbs.  While this release extends beyond the USFilter boundaries, there are no public receptors within the 0.3 mile radius.  Elementis  is the property owner within the radius.\n\n\n4.\tThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThis plant falls under OSHA\u00bfs Process Safety Management.  Compliance with PSM includes:  a comprehensive mechanical integrity plan, initial hazop study, detailed procedures,  procedure revision review and approval, Management of change, and training Procedures, testing and documentation.\n\nHighlights of our Release Prevention program include:  weekly safety equipment/interlock checks, daily process checks and documentation, rupture disc failure and alarms prior to any gas release, pressure relief valve testing and certification, UT thickness testing, yearly refresher testing and SCBA drills, pressure and levels available locally and remotely at the control room and pressure and temperature interlocks designed to minimize release. \n\n5.\tFive Year Accident History\n\nSince start-up in June of 1997, this plant has not had an SO2 release.\n\n6.\tEmergency Response Program\n\nOur emergency response program includes Elementis operators donning level B suits with mutual aid back-up from the Castle Hayne Fire Department.  The ERP describes 6 typical emergencies, which can occur during loading or operation and  a suggested response for each.  Non-essential personnel from Elementis are instructed to shelter-in-place.

Two documented changes have been made to the process piping to improve safety.  Refresher training and Mutual Aid drills will continue.  Strict adherence to the comprehensive mechanical integrity, operating procedure and safety checks will be maintained, insuring as safe a process as possible.  Remote isolation valves were added in June of 2002 and can be operated from the Salt Cake Purification Plant control room and from the Plant Supervisor\u00bfs laptop. (anywhere with phone access)"
