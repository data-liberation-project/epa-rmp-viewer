The group is headquartered in Heerlen, The Netherlands, with annual sales in excess of $7 billion and employs about  23,000 people at more than 200 sites in Europe, North and South America, Asia, Africa and Australia.\nDSM's Corporate SHE Policy\nResponsible Care is a worldwide action program set up by the chemical industry to ensure ongoing improvement of the chemical industry's performance in the field of Safety, Health and Environment (SHE) and to promote communication on SHE matters. DSM considers proper SHE management to be a fundamental part of its operations. We have incorporated the main SHE elements in a management system that is closely linked to the Responsible Care program and is at the same time based on the ISO 9000 and ISO 14000 standards. DSM's SHE policy clearly states what the company understands by safe, healthy and environmentally conscious working. Our policy objectives are:\n7 an accident-free working environment. DSM is convinced that all accidents can be prevented.\n7 no occupational diseases or health problems attributable to DSM's activities.\n7 ongoing evaluation and improvement of working methods, processes, products and services to ensure that these are safe and acceptable from the point of view of employees, customers, the community and the environment.\nIn order to achieve these objectives we have laid down a number of principles that apply throughout the DSM organization:\n7 SHE management is just as important as production, marketing, profitability and product quality.\n7 All our sites are subject to the same SHE standards.\n7 Each site has its own SHE management system.\n7 Each site is subject to regular audits.\n7 Each site reports on its SHE performance.\n7 Each site actively communicates with the neighboring community.\nWHO IS DSM Che"

      "SummaryText": "micals North America, Inc.?\nThe DSM facility in Augusta was originally a joint venture between DSM of The Netherlands and PPG Industries of Pittsburgh, PA. Founded in 1962, the joint venture's first production facility was a nitrogen fertilizer complex. In 1964, Nipro, Inc., (the predecessor of today's DSM Chemicals) was organized to manufacture caprolactam, a monomer of nylon used in nylon fiber production. Subsequent expansions of DSM Chemicals resulted in two additional caprolactam plants in Augusta, in 1974 and 1976, which made DSM Chemicals the largest independent supplier of caprolactam in the U.S.  In 1999 nylon 6 production  began at the DSM Augusta site. In late 1999, a carpet recycle facility will begin recovering the original pure caprolactam from waste carpet and nylon scrap.\nWHAT DOES DSM Chemicals MEAN TO AUGUSTA? TO GEORGIA?\nThe DSM Chemicals plant facilities and sales offices in Augusta mean jobs for approximately 376 company employees and 250 contract employees. In terms of dollars, DSM Chemicals means annual domestic sales in excess of $108,000,000, export sales of over $75,000,000 and an annual payroll of over $25,000,000.\nWhat is Caprolactam?\nCaprolactam is the primary raw material in the production of nylon 6. At the Augusta DSM plant the caprolactam is stored in tanks in the liquid state by keeping it heated to 1700 F and in the flaked solid state in bags. The liquid product is shipped to local customers and the solid product is shipped to foreign customers. DSM's customers convert the caprolactam to nylon 6 and then make carpets, lining materials, clothing, shoes, stockings, and lingerie. \n\n\n\n\nOleum\nBasic Information\n7 Oleum, also known as fuming sulfuric acid, is basically a clear liquid with a slight milky-gray tint and a severely irritating odor. Exposure to the liquid causes tissue destruction. Oleum is a severe fume hazard. The fumes are sulfur trioxide, are severely irritating and concentrations over 3 ppm are harmful. \n7 Oleum is used a"

At DSM it is used to convert our intermediate product to our final product, caprolactam. After it is neutralized with ammonia, the oleum is in turn converted to ammonium sulfate, a by-product fertilizer.\nWorst Case  Release Scenario\n7 A full 279,000 gallon tank of 24% oleum fails catastrophically. 4,490,000 pounds of oleum are released instantaneously. A containment dike will limit the downwind impact of this scenario.\n7 EPA look-up tables predict the fumes will travel 1.9 miles before the fume concentration in air will fall to 3 ppm, which is considered a safe level. \n\nAlternate Release Scenario\n\n7 A supply pipe fails while transferring 24% oleum at the rate of 250 gallons per minute. The release continues for 10 minutes before it is discovered and the flow is stopped. 43,000 pounds of oleum are released. \n7 EPA look-up tables predict the fumes will travel 0.47 mile before the fume concentration in air will fall to 3 ppm, which is considered a safe level.  \n\nFive Year Accidental Release History \nThere was one spill of oleum during the last five years. There were no offsite effects from this 3,000 pound spill but the local emergency management agency was notified.\n\nChemical - Specific Prevention Steps\n\n7 Oleum tank fumes are vented to a scrubber that recovers the fumes.\n7 Oleum tanks and pumps are diked to limit spills and the downwind impact of the above scenarios.\n7 Oleum is piped to our plant from the nearby supplier, thus, eliminating the risk of spills while unloading from tanker trucks.\n7 A spare storage tank is maintained.\n\n            \n Ammonia\nBasic Information\n7 Ammonia is a colorless gas with a very strong pungent odor, that is supplied to DSM as a liquid at high pressure and low temperature via piping. Ammonia is very irritating to mucous membranes, eyes and skin. Direct contact with liquid ammonia can cause severe burns. The vapor is extremely irritating and concentrations"

Natural gas is delivered with a strong odorizer to give it a distinctive smell. Methane can be a simple asphyxiant by displacing oxygen from the atmosphere; otherwise, no acute or long term health effects are known. Natural gas can also exist in a liquid state at cryogenic temperatures of -260 degrees F. In the liquid form it is colorless and non-flammable; however, the cold vapors are v"

At DSM it is stored in the liquid state and is vaporized prior to use.\nWorst Case Release Scenario\n7 A full 1,200,000 gallon tank of liquid natural gas (LNG) fails catastrophically. 4,150,000 pounds of methane are released instantaneously.

A large pool of LNG forms in the ditch, flows away from the truck and begins to vaporize. A  vapor cloud fire is assumed to occur.  5500 pounds/minute of LNG are released during the 15 minute period it takes the Emergency Response Team to close the shut-off valves. \n7 EPA look-up tables predict the radiant heat effects of a vapor cloud fire will travel 0.20 miles before the concentration falls to the lower flammability limit of  5 % by volume.\n\nFive Year Accidental Release History\nThere were no spills or releases of methane during the last five years .\nChemical - Specific Prevention Steps\n\n7 LNG tank vapors are vented to a compressor that recovers the vapors for in plant use as fuel.\n7 LNG storage tank is surrounded by a containment dike.\n7 LNG storage tank is equipped with fire suppression systems.\n\n Cyclohexane\nBasic Information\n7 Cyclohexane is a colorless liquid with a slightly swe"

The flammable vapors are heavier than air and tend to accumulate on the ground rather than disperse. Cyclohexane is not a listed chemical subject to EPA's Risk Management Plan regulation; however, it is considered the most serious hazard in the DSM plant.\n7 Cyclohexane is used in the manufacture of nylon, as a solvent and as a paint and varnish remover. DSM uses it as a raw material to produce caprolactam.\nWorst Case Release Scenario\n\n7 A process pipe fails while transferring liquid cyclohexane at a temperature above its atmospheric boiling point. 600,000 pounds of cyclohexane are released and immediately vaporize. A vapor cloud explosion is assumed to occur. No controls are considered. This scenario was selected because it actually happened at a DSM facility in England with catastrophic results.\n7 EPA look-up tables predict the blast effects of a vapor cloud explosion will travel 0.64 mile before the over pressure level is reduced below one psi,  which is the point at which only slight injuries are expected due to flying debris.\nAlternate Release Scenario\n\n7 An unloading hose fails while a full 28,000 gallon rail tank car of cyclohexane is being unloaded into the tank.
