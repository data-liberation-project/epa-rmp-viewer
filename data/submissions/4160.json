We follow the DuPont Corporate philosophy that the \"goal is zero.\"  This \n     means that we constantly strive for zero process safety incidents, zero environmental incidents and \n     zero injuries.  We have programs, procedures and management practices in place to support this goal of\n     zero.  We constantly assess our progress against these goals of zero and take corrective actions to\n     maintain the desired performance.\n\n     Our primary focus is on prevention of any accidental releases.  We have instituted emergency response\n     capabilities in order to supplement our prevention activities.  We use this combination of prevention      \n     programs and emergency response capability to help ensure the safety of our employees and the \n     public as well as protection of the environment.\n     \n     Corporate policies are embodied in the numerous Engineering Standards and Safety, Health and \n     Environmental (SHE) Standards that apply to our site.  At the Waynesboro site, these SHE policies are\n     implemented through the Waynesboro Health and Environmental Resource Manual (HERM).  This\n     information is available to all employees.  In addition, the Waynesboro site's Emergency Manual details \n     the complete Emergency Response Program for the site.\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION\n     The DuPont Waynesboro site is located on 188 acres in the city of Waynesboro, Va.  The\n     Waynesboro site consists of three (3) textile fiber manufacturing processes.  They are LYCRA@\n     Spandex, Nylon BCF and PERMASEP@.  In one of our manufacturing processes, the following\n     regulated substance is used as a raw material:\n          - Ethylenediamine  [1,2-Ethanediamine]\n\nWORST-CASE TOXIC RELEASE SCENARIO\n     The worst-case release scenario for ethylenediamine would be a complete "
