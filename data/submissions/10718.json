      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary, Risk Management Plan (RMP) for Silver Eagle Refining, June 1999\n\nThis Summary covers the Risk Management Plan (RMP) for Silver Eagle Refining. \n\nEnvironmental and Safety Policies:\nSilver Eagle Refining is committed to the safety of its employees, visitors, and the public in the operation of this facility.  Silver Eagle Refining is also committed to protection of the environment.  Procedures and plans (such as spill prevention plans, emergency response procedures, safe work procedures, and operating procedures) have been implemented to help ensure the facility operates in a safe and environmentally friendly manner. \n\nFacility Description:\nSilver Eagle Refining is a small petroleum refinery located approximately six miles east of Evanston Wyoming.   The facility is located in a somewhat isolated area of Uinta County.  The closest residential  population is over five miles away.  The facility mainly processes light crude oil into gasoline.  The facility can process between 3000 and 4000 barrels of oil per day.  The facility was built in 1989 and operated until 1991.  It was shut down from 1991 to 1996.  Silver Eagle restarted the refinery and has operated it since 1996.\n\nMaterials Handled at the Facility:\nSilver Eagle Refining processes light crude oil into gasoline.  As part of the refining process the facility produces, purchases and stores liquefied  petroleum gas (LPG).  These gases include methane, ethane, propane, butanes, and pentanes.  The other materials handled at this facility include: light crude oil, gasoline, diesel, and residual fuel oil.  Gasoline is the largest volume material processed and stored at the facility.\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario:\nAs part of the RMP, a worst case release scenario was developed for Silver Eagle Refining.  The worst case scenario consisted of vapor release of 210,000 lbs of a flammable mixture of methane, ethane, propane, butanes, and pentanes from a tank.  This assumed an explosion of this flammable mixtu"

Most of this effected area lies within the boundaries of the facility itself.  The effected area outside of the refinery includes an infrequently traveled dirt road, and a pipeline pump station where workers are present only intermittently.\n\nAlternate Release Scenario:\nAs part of the RMP, an alternate case release scenario was developed for Silver Eagle Refining.  This alternate case release scenario would be somewhat more likely to occur than the worst case scenario.  The alternate case scenario consisted of vapor release of 130,000 lbs of a flammable mixture of propane, and butanes from a pressurized storage tank.  This assumed an explosion of this flammable mixture.   Based upon a projection using EPA's RMP-Comp computer model, the extent of this release would have a radius of about 0.4 miles.  Most of this effected area lies within the boundaries of the facility itself.  The effected area outside of the refinery includes an infrequently traveled dirt road, and a pipeline pump station where workers are present only intermittently.\n\nRelease Prevention Steps:\nSilver Eagle takes many steps to ensure releases are prevented as much as possible.  Some of these include adhering to numerous environmental and safety regulations.  Silver Eagle must comply with regulations such as Process Safety Management (PSM), Spill Prevention, Control and Countermeasures (SPCC), the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), EPA Right-to-Know Laws, and air emissions regulations.  In addition Silver Eagle uses guidelines and standard developed by the American Petroleum Institute (API) for the safe design and operation of petroleum refineries.  Refinery personnel are highly trained in safe operating practices.  \n\nFive-Year Accident History:\nSilver Eagle has operated this facility since 1996.  During that time no accidental releases have occ"

Silver Eagle's employees are routinely trained on emergency response measures, such as fire fighting, spill response, handling specific chemicals, evacuation measures, and other specific measures.   An emergency response plan for Silver Eagle has been provided to local emergency response agencies.  Silver Eagle's emergency plan includes a lists of chemicals and volumes of chemicals handled at the facility, emergency phone numbers, evacuation plans, and how to contact local emergency response agencies.   Silver Eagle keeps emergency response equipment and machinery available for use as needed."
