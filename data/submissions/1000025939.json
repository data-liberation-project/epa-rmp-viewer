              "Description": "The Chlorine process at the SWA Water Treatment Plant is a system used to inject chlorine gas into potable water for the purpose of disinfection. Two, 1 ton chlorine containers are fitted with gas regulators. Vacuum lines from the regulators are attached directly to an automatic switch-over device. From the switch-over device the vacuum lines run to the north and south clearwells. At each clearwell location an ejector creates a vacuum, drawing the chlorine gas from the containers via the gas regulators and dispenses the chlorine gas into each respected clearwell. The gas flow rate to the ejectors is controlled by automatic controllers, one controller located by each respected clearwell. A typical flow rate is from 100 to 200 pounds of chlorine per day. The system is designed to stop the release of chlorine from the container if there is a vacuum leak anywhere in the system.",

The SWA delivers an estimated 5.9 million gallons of treated water per day to its customers.  Because of the amount of chlorine stored and used in the water treatment process at various locations within our water system, we as management/operators are required to submit a Risk Management Plan (RMP) to the EPA under 40 CRF Part 68-Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions ruling. Currently we have three locations that use chlorine. With our RMP program in place, we will store up to four chlorine containers, (8,000 lbs.) at each location. Our locations include: the Dickinson Water Treatment Plant (DWTP), the OMND Water Treatment Plant (OMNDWTP) and the Dodge Pumping Station (DPS). SWA is in compliance with the EPA's Community Right-To-Know Act (EPCRA). Each year since the reporting year of 1992, the WTP has submitted to the state and local emergency response authorities, documentation of the hazardous chemicals used and stored at both our locations. All senior operators employed with SWA are trained in chlorine safety and are well versed in the operational aspects of the chlorine/ ammonia disinfection process. Novice operators are assisted by senior operators with chlorine processes, operations, and maintenance of equipment.  On-going training sessions for chlorine safety as well as other safety training is and will be conducted on a regular basis. All senior operators engaged in the maintenance of the chlorine process equipment are well informed as to the equipment mechanics, calibration and testing. The RMP is well received and is an important part of the safety program for SWA. SWA has a written emergency response plan and the RMP is used in conjunction with this plan. SWA has an excellent chlorine accident history. Our records show that there has never been a chlorine related ac"
