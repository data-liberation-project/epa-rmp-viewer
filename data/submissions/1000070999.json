The facility operates an ammonia refrigeration system to provide cooling and freezing capabilities.  Approximately 168,000 pounds of ammonia are contained within the refrigeration system at any one time.  Nestle utilizes a process of mechanical refrigeration similar to that in a home freezer but on a much larger scale.  Liquid ammonia is evaporated into a gas within the sealed refrigeration system, then compressed and condensed back into its liquid form to provide cooling of the processing and storage areas.\n\n\n\nWhen Nestle developed their Mt. Sterling manufacturing facility in 1993, they elected to utilize ammonia (instead of chlorofluorocarbons, such as Freon) as their refrigerant due to its many advantages in manufacturing.  Ammonia is naturally-occurring compound with minimal environmental impacts, and is more efficient than its chlorofluorocarbon counterparts.  In addition, it is significantly less expensive than other refrigerants, allowing Nestle to provide the consumer which the most affordable product possible.\n\n\n\n2.0 ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n\n\nWhile there are few long-term environmental consequences to ammonia use, it can present health hazards if handled improperly.  Nestle has developed a comprehensive safety program in compliance with OSHA and EPA requirements to ensure the responsible management of the ammonia onsite (the Process Safety Management and Risk Management Program, respectively).  All refrigeration employees are trained in this program on an annual basis and weekly safety meetings are conducted to further protect Nestle workers and the community as a whole.  Nestle works very closely with local emergency management organizations such as the Montgomery County Fire Department and the Montgomery County Local Emergency Planning Commission.
