In addition, Russell Stover operates this facility in accordance with internal standards that employ good engineering practice and industry accepted principles and codes. Russell Stover has instituted operating and training procedures that are designed to provide a safe work environment and protect our neighbors.\r\n\r\nThe Russell Stover facility is a candy manufacturing operation. It is comprised of one Risk Management Plan (RMP)-covered process involving anhydrous ammonia. The facility maintains two separate ammonia refrigeration systems. All anhydrous ammonia is delivered to the facility by truck. No other RMP regulated substances are handled at this facility.\r\n\r\nEmergency Action Plan:\r\nRussell Stover has developed an emergency action plan. Russell Stover has an arrangement with the Iola Fire Department to provide response in emergencies. The Fire Department is familiar with the Facility and the ammonia refrigeration systems.\r\n\r\nPrevention Program:\r\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirement set out under 40 CFR Part 68. This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with IIAR standards. The elements of the release prevention program that are in place at our facility include Safety Information, Hazard Review, Operating Procedures, Training, Mechanical Integrity Program, Compliance Audits, and Incident Investigation. \r\n\r\nEmployees have been trained of the procedures associated with the processes and the Emergency Action Plan, and it is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local regulations.
