As requested by the lessor, Countrymark has prepared this RMP Plan.\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response polices at this facility:\n\nThe LPG storage facility is believed to comply with NFPA-58 requirements for LPG storage tanks.  It is the policy of BWX technologies and Countrymark to comply with all applicable federal, state and local laws pertaining to LPG storage tanks.  If an emergency were to occur it is the policy of both BWX Technologies and Countrymark to immediately notify Mt. Vernon area emergency services.  A written Emergency Response Plan is in place.\n\nA description of the facility and regulated substances handled:\n\nBWX Technologies is a manufacturing facility, but no longer uses the LPG tanks.  Countrymark leases the tanks for periodic storage in short lengths of time, usually over several weeks or months.  Generally, the tanks are used only during a maintenance shutdown. It should be noted that Countrymark has not had the need to utilize these tanks for the past few years but still keeps the lease active in case emergency storage dictates the need for BWX tank utilization.\n\nThe Worst Case Scenario:\n\nThe worst-case scenario is failure of one 30,000-gallon storage tanks, \n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical specific prevention steps:\n\nThis storage facility is believed to comply with all applicable codes and requirements.\n\nFive-year accident history: None\n\nThe emergency response program:\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving the LPG tanks, it is both parties policy to notify Mt. Vernon area emergency dispatch via 911.  The Tier II forms are submitted annually to the local Posey County LEPC.\n\nPlanned changes to improve sa"
