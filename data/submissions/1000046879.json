              "Description": "The plan is to minimize those hazards to human health and to the environment that are associated with accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. Employees working at the bulk storage plant make routine observations prior to and during transfer operations of anhydrous ammonia from the storage vessel(s) to the nurse tanks. The conditions of the nurse tanks are observed during these times. In so doing, the employees are able to detect problems before they arise. The routine inspections identify any portions of the system (including nurse tanks) which may be under stress or about to fail. Repairs can be made before they become problematic. Employees are annually trained to recognize the hazards associated with the storage, transfer, handling, and transportation of anhydrous ammonia. In addition to annual training for employees who have been on the job for a number of years, the company conducts training for new hires and part-time, seasonal employees. This training includes classroom instruction, on-site training at the plant, and follow-up observation to determine their individual comprehension and understanding. Finally, the company routinely invites local fire department personnel to visit the storage plant and other sites of interest to them. In the event that the local fire department requests assistance in training its employees on anhydrous ammonia, the company cooperates fully in their endeavors.",

(Ag Facility)\n\n\n\nThis facility complies with ANSI Standard K-61.1-1995 requirements for Anhydrous Ammonia storage. It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal, State, and local regulations. If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to immediately vacate the premises, move to a safe location, and notify the Dows Volunteer Fire Department (via a 911 call) and request that it respond to the emergency. Incidental to the notification to the fire department, a call to the North Central Regional Planning District will be made.\n\n\n\nWhile we have planned for an emergency, it is acknowledged that a real emergency will be unexpected and may very well be much different and cannot be ensured to duplicate what may have be planned. In reality, the situation that develops may not happen in the manner in which it has been planned. In that event, what may have been planned will serve only as a guideline to follow.\n\n\n\nThe Emergency Action Plan for this facility describes certain procedures that are intended to minimize the hazards associated with human health and the environment from fires, explosions, the sudden and unexpected release of chemicals (i.e., Anhydrous Ammonia), tornadoes, bomb threats or other accidents or acts of God which might occur on our premises.\n\n\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE ANHYDROUS AMMONIA STORAGE/DISTRIBUTION PLANT AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCE HANDLED AT FARMERS COOPERATIVE COMPANY, DOWS, IOWA:\n\n\n\nThis facility is a parking lot staging area for nurse tanks. The anhydrous ammonia that is stored at  this facility is distributed to agricultural crop producers in the surrounding area who utilize the anhydrous ammonia for crop nutrient purposes. \n\n\n\nNurse tanks are filled and positioned awaiting distribution and transportation from the parking to the farm.

The specific address of the parking lot is described in the registration section of this document.\n\n\n\nTHE WORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS:\n\n\n\nThe worst-case scenario is the failure of the  largest nurse tank when filled to the greatest amount allowed (85% of capacity), resulting in the release of the total volume in a gaseous (hazardous ammonia vapor cloud) form. According to EPA's RMP*Comp Program (Version 1.06), the distance to the endpoint is 1.0 miles.\n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario involves the rupture of the transfer hose on the nurse tank or the act of vandals opening the liquid withdrawal valve to illegally obtain anhyydrous ammonia for methamphetamine production. The resulting release, according to EPA's RMP*Comp Program has a distance to endpoint of 0.2 miles.\n\n\n\nSince this facility is located in relatively close proximity to the Town of Dows,  provisions have been designed to notify all affected persons. An evacuation plan is in place.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS:\n\n\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable State and local codes and regulations. The anhydrous ammonia system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with ANSI Standard K-61.1-1995 and State law. \n\n\n\nIn addition the company has specific operating procedures in place intended to minimize the potential for an accidental (and potentially catastrophic) release of anhydrous ammonia. Finally, Farmers Cooperative Company has extended to the Dows Volunteer Fire Department the opportunity to visit our anhydrous ammonia plant, to participate in mock emergency simulation training, and to avail themselves of specific anhydrous ammonia health hazard information and training provided by the company.\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\n\n\n\nFarmers Cooperative Company, Dows, Iowa has not experienced any  accidental release involving"
