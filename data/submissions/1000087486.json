(SECI), provides essential wholesale services to our nine Members through a balanced, diversified portfolio of safe, affordable, and reliable energy resources. We value accountability, integrity, and service rooted in the cooperative spirit. We take no actions that undermine or harm SECI's reputation or standing in the eyes of our Members, our communities, our stakeholders, or each other.\r\n\r\nThe Midulla Generating Station (MGS) is SECI's state-of-the-art, natural gas-fired, combined-cycle and simple cycle power generation facility located on a 1,300 acre site at the Polk and Hardee County lines west of County Road 663 in Hardee County, Florida.  The two combined-cycle units use aqueous ammonia for the selective catalytic reduction (SCR) system to control emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx). The aqueous ammonia is stored in a 20,000 gallon aboveground storage tank.\r\n\r\nSECI recognizes the responsibility in protecting employees and the environment against the hazards of an unintentional release of ammonia. The safety and health of all employees and the surrounding community is of upmost importance. The control of accidents associated with ammonia usage at the plant will continue to be a primary responsibility of all MGS employees. Employee participation is a primary component in ensuring a successful risk management program. In the event of an unforeseen release, SECI has coordinated emergency response efforts with the District 7 Local Emergency Planning Committee and the local fire department. In addition, SECI has retained an emergency response contractor for assistance in the event of an emergency.\r\n\r\nPREVENTION PROGRAM\r\nIn accordance with EPA requirements, a prevention program has been prepared for the aqueous ammonia process at MGS. The prevention program was developed for the prevention or minimization of consequences of catastrophic releases of aqueous ammonia. The following summary addresses each of the prevention program elem"

These documents include information on chemical properties and hazards associated with aqueous ammonia, operating limits, and equipment design and specifications. Personnel within SECI have been assigned the responsibility of maintaining up-to-date process safety information.\r\n\r\nHazard Review - SECI has conducted an evaluation of hazards associated with the aqueous ammonia process using the What-If analysis technique. The process has been systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure adequate controls are in place to manage the hazards identified during the evaluation. The analysis was conducted using a team of people who have operation and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. The hazard analysis is updated and revalidated periodically, but not less than every 5 years, as required.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures - SECI maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations that can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.\r\n\r\nTraining - SECI has a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating the aqueous ammonia process. In addition to initial training, all operators receive refresher training at least once every 3 years on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.\r\n\r\nMaintenance - SECI has established a system of procedures and practices to maintain process equipment and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition. Maintenance personnel receive training to help ensure that they can perform their work in a safe manner.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits - SECI periodically conducts audits to determine whether the procedures and"

SECI management will certify that the RMP prevention program has been evaluated at least every 3 years.\r\n \r\nIncident Investigation - SECI promptly investigates all incidents that results in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury. The investigation is conducted to identify the cause of the incident and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence or similar incident.\r\n\r\nEmergency Preparedness - SECI has developed a emergency action plan that addresses emergency procedures to be used in the unforeseen event of an aqueous ammonia release.\r\n\r\nSAFETY FEATURES\r\nThe aqueous ammonia tank is supported by saddles and located within a poured concrete secondary containment for over 110 percent of tank contents. The containment has two normally closed drainage valves. When opened, the first drain allows either leakage or rainwater on the outer truck unloading slab to be drained into the containment. The second valve allows operators to periodically empty any rainwater situated in the containment. The tank is protectively coated. Safety equipment is located at the northwest corner of the containment proximate to the truck unloading area. An ammonia leakage detector, with local area and control room indicators, is also present to alarm when ammonia vapor related to a leakage event is detected.\r\n\r\nACCIDENT HISTORY\r\nThe aqueous ammonia process at MGS became operational in October 2001. No events that qualify as reportable on the 5-year accident history have occurred according to plant personnel and plant records.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE\r\nSECI maintains a written emergency action plan at MGS. In the event of an aqueous ammonia release, employees will activate shutdown procedures, might evacuate the plant, and notify local emergency response teams. The overall emergency response program for MGS is"

SECI management and system operators are integral in verifying process information, maintaining updated operating procedures, and conducting preventative maintenance inspections. All recommendations developed during the initial Hazard Review were completed to improve the safety performance of the aqueous ammonia process. Recommendations from future hazard reviews will be implemented in a timely manner."
