      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\n\nThis Process Safety Management (PSM) and Risk Management Plan (RMP) Program document (PSM/RMPr) was prepared on behalf of Helena Chemical Company (Helena) pursuant to the requirements of the Clean Air Act ? 112(r) as codified by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) at 29 CFR ? 1910.119 and by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) at 40 CFR ?68.  The OSHA PSM and EPA Subpart D RMP standards are applicable to operations in Greenup, IL.  At this Facility, Helena engages in the formulation, distribution and sale of chemicals (i.e. retail) to customers, most of who use Helena's products to support agricultural operations (See Section 3.0).  \n\n\n\nThis electronic submittal provides conservative estimates of the offsite consequences of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia from the Greenup Facility located approximately 0.5 miles north of Greenup at 612 IL Route 130, Greenup, IL 62428.  The electronic RMP summarizes the policies and procedures implemented by the Greenup Facility to minimize the likelihood of an accident.  The electronic RMP also summarizes the actions that the Greenup Facility has taken to ensure that a response to a release (even though a release is unlikely) will be implemented in a proper and timely manner.\n\n\n\nPURPOSE FOR UPDATING RMP\n\n\n\nHelena recently acquired this Facility and has submitted this 5-Year update to reflect the new ownership.  Under the prior ownership, the Facility operated as an RMP Program 2.  Based on certain operations that are conducted, Helena will operate the Facility as an RMP Program 3.  All relevant sections for a Program 3 RMP Facility have been reviewed and/or updated.  The updates are reflected in both the EPA RMP Submit report and the Facility PSM/RMPr.\n\n\n\nFACILITY\n\n\n\nThe Greenup Facility is a retail agricultural chemical facility and operates two (2) covered processes that include (1) Covered Process 1: Storage and Handling, and (2) Covered Process 2: Fertilizer Blendin"

      "SummaryText": "g.  Anhydrous ammonia is transported to the Facility via a commercial tanker truck (9,000 gallon) and then transferred to a 30,000-gallon or 18,000-gallon stationary storage tanks.  The commercial tanker truck operator (Vendor/Contractor) performs these transfer operations.  \n\n\n\nHelena stores the anhydrous ammonia in its storage tanks and then transfers the anhydrous ammonia from the storage tank to nurse tanks at point of retail sale to the end user (e.g. the farmer).  This Facility owns and operates 30 1,450-gallon nurse tanks.  Helena also transfers the anhydrous ammonia from the storage tanks to the Fertilizer Blender to manufacture 10-34-0 Fertilizer.  Helena performs this operation in accordance with its Risk Management Program that includes a prevention program.  \n\n\n\n\n\nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\n\n\n\nWorst case and alternative case consequence analyses were completed for both covered processes. The worst case scenario release assumed that all the contents in the largest single storage tank were released.  The release was modeled as if the ammonia tank was punctured on the side at the ground level. The resulting release of ammonia was modeled as a ground level horizontal jet.\n\n\n\nThe alternative (or more likely to occur) scenario assumes a rupture of a 3-inch line caused by an impact from a vehicle or some other source on the liquid ammonia transfer line during a major loading or unloading operation.  Although this event is classified as an alternative scenario, even an accident of this type is unlikely to occur due to the safety equipment (excess flow devices, check valves) and operating procedures that Helena uses to safeguard ammonia transfer operations.\n\n\n\nBoth the worst case and alternative scenario are overly conservative because even a 2-minute release is unlikely to occur since excess flow valves on the system should close immediately upon increased flow resulting from the ruptured transfer line.\n\n\n\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe Branch Manager imp"

The Branch Manager is responsible for ensuring that Helena Staff are properly trained in the implementation of the Program 3 Accident Prevention Program elements: Management System, Employee Participation, Safety Information, Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Contractor, Pre-Startup Review, Maintenance, Hot Work Permit, Management of Change, Incident Investigation, Compliance Audits, Emergency Response, and Compliance Audits.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nHelena's Greenup Facility is a non-responding facility. Helena has coordinated emergency response activities with its local emergency response agency and local fire department.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThere have been no on-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage; or off-site deaths, injuries, property damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place, in the past five (5) years because of the ammonia operations at the Greenup Facility.\n\n\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n\n\nThe Risk Management Plan implemented by Helena Chemical Company at the Greenup Facility complies with the requirements of the Clean Air Act, Section 112(r). The RMP will be updated as the Greenup Facility adds, deletes, or changes processes. The Emergency Response Program has been coordinated with the Cumberland County LEPC.\n\n\n\nNOTE: Sections 4, 5, 6, and 8 of the standard RMP produced by EPA's RMP Submit Program are not applicable to the Greenup Facility.\n\n"
