      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nThe Two Rivers Terminal, LLC (Two Rivers Terminal) Moses Lake Facility has submitted this updated electronic RMP in compliance with the provisions of the Clean Air Act 112 (r) as codified by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency at 40 CFR Part 68.  This electronic submittal provides conservative estimates of the offsite consequences of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia from the Moses Lake Facility located at 13583 Wheeler Road NE, Moses Lake, WA 98937.  The electronic RMP summarizes the policies and procedures implemented by the Moses Lake Facility to minimize the likelihood of an accident.  The electronic RMP also summarizes the actions that the Moses Lake Facility has taken to ensure that a response to a release (even though a release is unlikely) will be implemented in a proper and timely manner.\n\nPURPOSE FOR UPDATING RMP\n\nTwo Rivers Terminal is submitting this RMP as a first time submission.  The Moses Lake Facility is Program Level 3 and the covered processes include a temporary railcar storage process and a mobile fertilizer reacting process.  The off-site consequence analysis for the worst case and the alternative case release scenarios are included in the Moses Lake Facility Risk Management Program document.\n\nFACILITY\n\nThe Moses Lake Facility is an agricultural chemical blending and distribution facility.   Anhydrous ammonia is transported to the Facility via railcar that is temporarily stored on the property until the anhydrous ammonia is reacted with phosphoric acid in a mobile pipe reactor and then diluted with water.  Two Rivers Terminal does not own or operate the reacting process.  The reacting process and ancillary railcar unloading procedures are performed by an Independent Fertilizer Reacting Contractor (IFRC).  After the reacting process is complete, any residual anhydrous ammonia is stored in the railcar until the railcar owner removes the railcar from the Two Rivers Terminal Facility.\n\nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS"

      "SummaryText": "Worst case and alternative case offsite consequence analyses were completed for both the ammonia storage process and the reacting process.  The worst case release scenario is the same for the both the ammonia storage and the reacting process.  The worst case scenario release for the Moses Lake Facility assumes that all the contents of the largest single vessel (a single railcar) are released.  The release was modeled as if the railcar was punctured on the side at the ground level. The resulting release of ammonia was modeled as a ground level horizontal jet.\n\nThe alternative (or more likely to occur) scenarios are different for the two processes.  The ammonia storage alternative consequence analysis assumed that a vapor valve is leaking or is not fully closed.  (The scenario actually assumes the valve is only 50% closed.)  The reacting process alternative consequence analysis assumes that a 3-inch liquid transfer line is severed during the reacting process.  \n\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe Facility Manager implements the risk management planning process at this Two Rivers Terminal Facility.  The Facility Manager is assisted by other Two Rivers Terminal staff, as directed.  The ammonia storage prevention program is implemented by Two Rivers Terminal employees.  Two Rivers Terminal employees inspect the markings on railcar to ensure that the railcar is operated within the U.S. DOT required inspection requirements and they inspect the Bill of Lading to ensure that the railcar is not overfilled.  Two Rivers Terminal employees also inspect the railcar for leaking valves and fittings and they conduct daily inspections of the railcar storage area for audio, visual, or olfactory indications of leaks.\n\nThe reacting process prevention program is implemented by the IFRC because Two Rivers Terminal does not own or operate the reacting process.  Two Rivers Terminal requires the IFRC to certify its compliance with a Process Safety Management Plan and it spot checks some aspec"

Two Rivers Terminal has coordinated emergency response activities with its local emergency response agency and local fire department.  Two Rivers Terminal has a written Contingency Plan that includes procedures to notify local emergency response agencies in event of a significant ammonia release.  Two Rivers Terminal employees will not, under any circumstance, serve as first responders to a significant release of ammonia.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no on-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage; or off-site deaths, injuries, property damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place, in the past five (5) years because of the ammonia operations at the Moses Lake Facility.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThe Risk Management Plan implemented by Two Rivers Terminal at the Moses Lake Facility complies with the requirements of the Clean Air Act, Section 112(r). The RMP will be updated as the Moses Lake Facility adds, deletes, or changes processes. The Emergency Response Program has been coordinated with the Franklin County LEPC.\n\nNOTE: Sections 4, 5, 6, and 8 of the standard RMP produced by EPA's RMP Submit Program are not applicable to the Moses Lake Facility."
