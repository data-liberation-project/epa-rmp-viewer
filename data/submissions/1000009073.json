      "SummaryText": "I.  Accidental Release Prevention and Response Policies\n\nWhiting Oil and Gas CorporationA?s West Branch Gas Plant (WBGP) has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety, and to the environment.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of the plant.  Whiting Oil and Gas Corporations policy is to implement reasonable measures to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  \n\nII.  Description of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nWest Branch Gas Plant, located in West Branch, Ogemaw County, Michigan, operates processes to remove liquids from natural gas.  The plant has a single regulated flammable mixture, which contains ethane, methane, butane, propane, and pentane.  The plant does not have any regulated toxic substances.\n\nIII.  General Accident Release Prevention Program & Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nBecause the WBGP is also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses a sampling of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\nEmployee Participation: The WBGP ensures its employees participate in all development, review and implementation aspects of process safety management and accident prevention. \n\nProcess Safety Information: The WBGP has technical documents that are used to ensure safe operation of the processes and equipment.  These documents address hazards of the chemicals at the plant, process technology, and process equipment.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA):  Within this program, the process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nTraining:  To complement the written procedures for process operations, the WBGP has implemented a comprehen"

The program, is intended to help employees understand the plant operations, and increase employee awareness with respect to the hazards particular to a process. \n\nContractors:  The WBGP uses skilled contractors that are supervised by agents of the company that have appropriate training to assure the work they are overseeing is completed correctly and in a manner that safeguards the property and safety of company and contract personnel and the general public.  \n\nSafe Work Practices:  The WBGP has long standing safe work practices in place to ensure worker and process safety. \n\nThe processes at the WBGP have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation. The WBGP has safety features in many areas to quickly detect a release, and reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release.  \n\nIV.  Five-year Accident History\n\nThe WBGP has an excellent record of accident prevention over the past five years.  There have been no accidental releases of regulated substances in the past five years.\n\nV.  Emergency Response Program Information\n\nThe WBGP has developed and implemented a written emergency action plan to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance potentially resulting from a fire or explosion, severe weather, environmental spill, and pipe line failure.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid, evacuation plans, accounting for personnel, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, and post incident cleanup, reporting and recordkeeping requirements.  The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on factors such as modification made to the plant process or operating procedures, or change in the communication procedures.\n\nThe WBGP has around-the-clock communication capability with appropri"

This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.  \n\nVI.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nAll findings from the most recent PHA and Safety Audit have been scheduled for resolution.  The WBGP will continue to conduct PHAs, safety audits, and incident investigations as applicable to continuously improve the worker and public safety."
