This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, we are completely coordinated with the Marshall County Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC) and the Plymouth Fire Department to provides highly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\n2. THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nOur facility's primary activities encompass the manufacturing of polyethylene foam products that are used as Packaging material. We have a flammable mixture of regulated substances which are used as a blowing agent at this facility.\n\n3. THE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND THE CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA. In addition, we have one process at our facility which is subject to the Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard under 29 CFR 1910.119 and we have an air operating permit IDT099-5696-00028 from the Indiana, Department of Environmental Management. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the accidental release prevention program that are in place at Pregis.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nPregis maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating\nparameters and equipment designs associated with the covered proces"

FMEA methodology is used to carry out these analyses. These studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and revalidated at a regular interval of 5 years and when major changes are made to the covered process. Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within the covered process, Pregis maintains written\noperating procedures. These procedures address various modes of operation such as startup, shutdown,\nnormal operations temporary operations, emergency shutdown and emergency operations. The information is\nreviewed on a regular basis and is readily accessible to operators involved in the process.\n\nTraining\nPregis has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating\ncomponents of the covered process am competent in the operating procedures associated with these\ncomponents. Refresher training is provided at least every three years and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity \nPregis performs documented maintenance checks on covered process equipment to ensure proper operations. Process equipment examined by these checks includes but is not limited to storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps. Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner. The maintenance operations are done by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices; and these personnel are provided specialized training as needed.   \n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at Pregis to manage changes in covered process chemicals, technology,\nequipment and procedures.

These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating\nand maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nPregis will continue to conduct periodic audits to ensure that the provisions set forth under the RMP and PSM\nrules are being implemented. Any corrective actions required as a result of the audits will be undertaken in a\nsafe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\nPregis promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic\nrelease of a regulated substance. These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the\nincident as well as any corrective actions that would prevent the release from reoccurring. All reports are\nretained at our facility for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation\nPregis truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort. Company\nemployees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and they\nactively participate in process safety management. In addition, Pregis employees have access to all\ninformation created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP and PSM rules, including information\nresulting from process hazard analyses.\n\nContractors on occasion, Pregis hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.
