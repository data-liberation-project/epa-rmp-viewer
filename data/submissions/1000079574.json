The regulated substance was evaluated for a possible worse-case release scenario and alternative release scenario.  It is important to understand that the City of Gallup Water and Sanitation Division Yah-ta-hey Pump Station/Water Chlorination Facility has invested extensive resources to prevent releases, and the potential for a worse-case release is extremely small.  The alternative release scenario represents a more realistic potential for occurrence and is based on historical data from our process or other similar processes.  By identifying these potential releases, the City of Gallup Water and Sanitation Division Yah-ta-hey Pump Station/Water Chlorination Facility has developed an extensive program to prevent such an occurrence.  This program is discussed in detail in the Prevention Program section of this plan.\n\nThe primary objective of performing the offsite consequence analysis is to determine the distance at which certain effects might occur to the public and/or the environment as a result of an accidental release.  This point is called the endpoint distance.  At distances less than the endpoint distance, the effects would be greater; at distances farther than the endpoint, the effects would be less.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1  Hazard Assessment - Toxic Substances\n\n\n\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with Regulated Toxic Substances is a failure of a full, one ton (2000 lb) cylinder of liquid chlorine.  A toxic cloud formed by the evaporating chlorine would reach offsite endpoints and public receptors.\n\nAn alternative release scenario (ARS) for chlorine releases is a release from a vessel leak.  The modeled release lasted for 30 minutes before it is stopped.  A toxic cloud formed by the evaporating chlorine would reach offsite endpoints and public receptors"
