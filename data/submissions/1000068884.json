Potential chemical releases from the nitrogenous slow release plant food process and glyphosate formulation process are addressed in the Emergency Action Plan including notification procedures, evacuation procedures, and medical assistance procedures.  Production managers and supervisors are responsible for ensuring operating procedures for their processes are reviewed and updated at least annually and informing process operators of changes to operating procedures that affects their responsibilities.  Operating procedures are reviewed as often as necessary to ensure that they reflect current operating practices, including changes associated with process chemicals, technology, and equipment and changes to facilities.  Drexel certifies annually that operating procedures are current and accurate.  \r\n\r\nArrangements are established with the local emergency response agency, the fire department, and local hospital.\r\n\r\nDrexel provides training to all employees when they are hired and before they begin their assignment. Employees receive training to familiarize themselves with all exits and evacuation routes.  An annual training session is conducted during a weekly safety meeting.\r\n\r\nEvacuation drills are held at least once a year or when a change is made.  Drills are evaluated by the plant manager regarding effectiveness and timeliness.\r\n\r\nAfter a drill, the plant manager judges the effectiveness of the plan and reviews any employee input concerning the drill.  Employees may identify something that requires a change to the procedure or was ineffective.  For example, they may discover new doors that would not open; they may enter storage closets instead of exits; or they may get lost and confused. \r\n\r\nThe emergency action plan is reviewed with all employees, if any changes are made to the plan or if any employee r"
