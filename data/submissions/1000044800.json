All applicable procedures of the EPA Prevention Program are adhered to.  Dole Fresh Vegetables' emergency response policy involves the preparation of response plans which are tailored to the emergency response services available in the community.  It is also in compliance with EPA Emergency Response Program requirements.\n\n\n\nThis facility consists of the Value Added Facility, which cools, cleans and packages fresh vegetables, primarily salads.  Anhydrous ammonia and chlorine are stored at this facility.  The Value Added Facility uses 40,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia for refrigeration and 12,000 pounds of liquefied chlorine gas for disinfectant.  The chlorine system in the Value Added Facility is a separate process from the ammonia system.\n\n\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program is based on the following key elements:\n\n-High Level of training of the operators.\n\n-Preventive maintenance program.\n\n-Use of state-of-the-art process and safety equipment.\n\n-Performance of a process hazard analysis of equipment and procedures.\n\n-Implementation of an auditing and inspection program.\n\n\n\nChemical specific prevention steps include availability of self contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) and full face respirators for use by operators and emergency response personnel when working with ammonia or chlorine supplies, and training that includes awareness of the hazardous and toxic properties of these toxic substances.\n\n\n\nThe facility has its own emergency response program.  This program includes an emergency response decision tree and a notification plan.  Emergency response drills and drill evacuations are conducted annually; emergency operations and response procedures are also reviewed at that time.\n\n\n\nDole has fully implemented the RMP and will initiate appropriate changes as needed to maintai"
