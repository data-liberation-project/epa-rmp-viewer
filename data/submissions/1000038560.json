Executive Summary :\n\n\n\nThe site has Anhydrous Ammonia on the site stored in a Bulk Tank in a quantity greater than the 112(R) list thresold quantity.\n\n\n\nIf a release or an accident would occur there would be no impact on public receptors per modeling conducted by Imes Engineering Inc., for the worst case and alternative release scenarios . This modeling was performed in 1998 and still holds true today where no process changes have occured and the nearest pubic receptor has'nt change.\n\n\n\nThere have been two accidental releases involving the requlated substance within the past five years.  \n\n1).  On April 7, 2010, the site reported losing 108 lbs over a 24 hour period through a mechanical seal on the Ammonia compressor that was leaking.\n\n2).  On August 11, 2010, the site reported a leak of 693 lbs over a 24 hour peroid . At the time, it was thoight it released through a mechanical seal leak on the recycle pump, but later it was found out most of the ammonia leaked into the process through a tube leak in a exchanger. The pumps has since been replace with sealess pumps \n\n\n\nLinde has sheared our emergency action plan with the local responders . \n\n\n\nBase on the above information the the two processes mention :\n\n\n\n- Ammonia used as a refrigerant in the CO2 Liquefaction process\n\n\n\n- Ammonia used as an on site Nox Reducing Agent to control emissions from our Flue Gas \n\n\n\nAre concidered program level 1 processes .\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccidential Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at the Decatur Linde Gas Inc.

Nevertheless there is always the possibility of equipment failure, operator error or force of nature which could cause a serious environmental problem.

The maufacturing process includes taking natural gas as the feed stock, mixing it with steam , after which is preheated then pass  through a reformer where the methane and water mix is converted to hydrogen ,Carbon Monoxide and Carbon Dioxoide.\n\n\n\nThe reformer gas is then pass through to a high temperature shift convertor where the carbon monoxide will be reacted with excess steam present in the gas stream to produce additional hydrogen by the following reaction :\n\n\n\nCO + H2O = CO2 + H2\n\n\n\nThe gas then is cooled in Plant One.  The CO2 is stripped off and sent to a CO2 Liquefaction process before being transfer to storage for Distribution . The hydrogen is pass through a high pressure purification step from which it is transfer directly to clients by way of pipeline. In Plant 2 the CO2 is not separated out and is remove in the pr"

The refrigerent package is a close loop system that contains approximately 4500 lbs of Ammonia at any one time.\n\n\n\n2) Ammonia is also used on our site as a reducing Agent to reduce the amount of nitrogen oxide emmision from our process flue gas. The site uses a Non- Catalytic reduction system design specific to reduce nitrogen oxide from exust gases . \n\n\n\nAuxillary euipment supporting the Nitrogen Oxide reduction system icludes a 10,000 gallon Ammonia storage tank , Deluge system for the tank , collection system for spills , welded transfer pipe , and a software control system .\n\n\n\nThe system make use of the anhydrous ammonia by diluting it to approximately five percent with abient air then injecting the mixture in the flue gas stream where the temperature is approx 1700 F FOR Non catalytic reduction. The reaction that occurs results in the Nitrogen Oxide being reduce to Nitrogen and water vapor.\n\n\n\nThe Worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario for Anhydrous Ammonia at the Linde Gas llc Decatur Site:\n\n\n\nIntroduction : The Analysis was performed on the 10,000 gallon Ammonia Storage Tank that is located on the southeast corner of our facility.

This level is equivalent to 200 ppm ammonia . Three approximated distances were used in the calculations. The first distance of 200 ft is the approximate distance to the west fence line and to the control building. The second distance of 600ft represents the southeast corner of the Solutia Facility . The third distance of 1600 ft corresponds to the Nova Chemical eastern property line. The Nova Chemical Property line was the major area of concern .\n\n\n\nThe following assumptions were made : \n\n\n\n- The vessel is 80% full ( 8000 gal ) . This corresponds to 39020 lbs of ammonia \n\n\n\n- The vessel is within a concrete dike area of 15 ft by 45 ft\n\n\n\n- The vessel inventory empties into dike area over a 10 min peroid ( 3902 gal / min ). This is typical for ammonia rupture scenario\n\n\n\n- The Ammonia in the vessel is pressurized to 180 psig , with a corresponding temperature of 94.8 F\n\n\n\n-No mitigation credit is taken while vessel empties ( deluge not activated ) \n\n\n\nSummary of Results :\n\n\n\nThe results of the study showed that the plume becomes buoyant and detaches from the ground at a distance of roughly 60 ft . At a distance of 1600 ft the plume has a centerline concentration of 2446 ppm,but this concentration is at a height of 90ft .

This corresponds to approximately 39,020 lbs of Ammonia \n\n\n\n- The relief valves relieve at 265 psig  , with a corresponding temperature of 119 F \n\n\n\n- The release height was 15 ft , which included a 5ft stand pipe \n\n\n\nSummary of Results \n\n\n\nThe calculated release rate was 615 lbs/min . The ERPG 2 concentration of 200 ppm was reached at a distance of 568 ft. At this distance the cloud is still buoyant and has not touched down. The cloud edge touches down at a distance of 975 ft and is 200 ppm . At 1600ft , the centerline concentration is 49 ppm, which is well below the allowed 200 ppm .
