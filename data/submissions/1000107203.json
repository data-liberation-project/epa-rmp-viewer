      "SummaryText": "A Risk Management Plan has been implemented at this facility for the prevention of accidental releases of flammable materials. The facility is located at 11101 Enterprise Way in Sturtevant (Racine County) Wisconsin. The facility is a storage and distribution warehouse that houses consumer products, packaged in aerosol cans, manufactured by SC Johnson & Son.\nSC Johnson is a privately held, family-managed company, with worldwide headquarters located in Racine, Wisconsin.\n\nLiquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) propellant used in aerosol products contains several components that are classified as flammable materials under EPA's RMP regulations. Specifically, the propellants consist of propane, butane and isobutane blends. The maximum projected quantities (cases) of aerosol products stored in the warehouse and product propellant weights were used to estimate maximum quantities of RMP-regulated chemicals in the warehouse storage process.\n\nThe worst case scenario performed, based on EPA's Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance, indicates that the distance to the 1 psi overpressure endpoint will not extend beyond plant property. No offsite receptors are impacted. There have also been no prior accidents at the facility resulting in any offsite environmental impacts.\n\nEmergency response activities at this facility are coordinated with the Racine County LEPC.\n\nThe maximum number of pallets storing flammable mixture-containing products is based on the best information available, as follows:\n1. The number of pallets of aerosol products is 2,717 pallets, which are expected to be limited to only Level 1 aerosols.\n2. The number of cases per pallet is assumed to be 205 cases per pallet, as a worst-case; however, the actual number of cases per pallet generally varies by product depending on packaging & transportations requirements.\n3. The number of cans per case is typically 12 cans/case.\n4. The worst-case amount of propellant per can is approximately 0.73 lb/can for Level 1 aerosols (as Raid"

      "SummaryText": "Max Flying Insect Killer).\n5. The worst-case release has been increased from one can to a full-case of 12-cans.\n6. The flammable mixture mass reported in Sec. 1.17.c (4,907,507 lbs) is the total of the reportable flammable chemicals, while the total mass of the entire mixture is calculated at 6,722,613 lbs.\n\nThe fourth item is expected to approximate the worst-case amount of flammable mixture in individual containers for use in calculating the worst case release scenario, given it is realistic to expect that when the above-noted Raid products are present onsite, there will be at least one case that may contribute to release. For continuity, this approximation was then conservatively extrapolated to estimate the maximum aggregate amount of flammable mixture that may be present onsite for the purpose of assessing applicability relative to whether the 10,000 lb TQ is exceeded. To this end, we estimated that 2,717 pallets of Level 1 aerosols would all be as Raid Max Flying Insect Killer. While such is expected to provide a conservative worst-case aggregate amount for applicability assessment purposes, such is not reasonable to expect in practice because at any given time, there will be more than one type of Level 1 aerosol product onsite - each with varying amounts of flammable mixtures (expected to be less than or equal to that which is noted under Item 4, above). The relative mix of products at any given time depends on numerous variables (e.g., market demand, distribution needs). Regardless of the actual mix of products, the TQ is expected to be triggered."
