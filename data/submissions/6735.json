Facility Policy: The oners, management and employees of Bode Cooperative are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate and minimize thre impacts of the release to the people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information: The facility is a country grain elevator which also stores and blends fertilizers for sale to farmers. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application and for blending into mixed grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients. Anhydrous ammonia is stord at the facility in 1 - 26,000 gallon, 1 - 12,000 gallon and 2 - 11,000 gallon storage tanks. The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia stored is 255,000 pounds.\n\n3. Worst Case & Alternate release Scenarios: The Worst Case Scenario would be the release of the total contents of the largest storage tank as a gas over a period of 10 minutes. The maximum quantity released would be 110,500 pounds, which represents the volume of that tank at 85% capacity as limited by design standards. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 parts per million, or ppm) is 2.2 miles. The Alternate Release Scenarion, based on either the 5 - year accident history or the most likely potential incident are as follows: a release in a break from  a 3-inch transfer hose followed by a release of ammonia for 2 minutes before an automatic or manual shutoff intervenes and stops the flow of ammonia.  The maximum quantity released would 26,640 pounds. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.1 miles.\n\n4. Accident Release prevention Program: The facility has been reviewed for general compliance with applicable standards for stirage and handling of anhydrous ammonia. The standards include the provisio"

(ANSI) and the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, Storage and Handling of Anyydrous Ammonia. The ANSI Standard has been adopted by reference by the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship Code Part 21 - Chapter 43 - Rule 43.6(200).\n\n5. Five Year Accident History: There have been no accidental releases of anydrous ammonia in the last five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, evacuations sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\n6. Emergency Response Program: The facility has a written emergency action plan in accordance with OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.38; provided state and local authorites with the emergency planning and community-right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA) and a written emergency response program in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.120.\n\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety: Safety improvement is an ongoing process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions. There are no additional specific safety recommendations regarding storage for use of anhydrous ammonia for implementaion at this time."
