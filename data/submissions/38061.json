      "SummaryText": "Risk Management Plan Executive Summary for The Dow Chemical Company, Pittsburg, California Site\n\n1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe Dow Chemical Company, Pittsburg, California site (\"Dow Pittsburg\") is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by Dow Pittsburg's comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at the Dow site in Pittsburg, California.  It is Dow Pittsburg's policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Dow Pittsburg is also committed to responding to emergencies resulting from accidental releases in order to mitigate the release and any associated consequences.\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe primary activity at Dow's Pittsburg site is agricultural chemical manufacturing.  Dow Pittsburg has six regulated substances present at the site.  These substances include 1,3-butadiene, ammonia (aqueous), chlorine, hydrogen chloride (anhydrous), hydrogen fluoride (anhydrous) and sulfur dioxide (anhydrous).  1,3-butadiene is used in making emulsion polymers.  Ammonia (aqueous) is used in making emulsion polymers and an agricultural herbicidal intermediate.  Chlorine is used in making of intermediate and finished products for agricultural applications and is a byproduct of these processes.  Hydrogen chloride is made as a co-product of some of the agricultural product manufacturing processes.  Hydrogen fluoride and sulfur dioxide (anhydrous) are used to make agricultural products and intermediates.\n\n3. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe Dow Pittsburg site has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.
