      "SummaryText": "Risk Management Plan Executive Summary for The Dow Chemical Company, Pittsburg, California Site\n\n1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe Dow Chemical Company, Pittsburg, California site (Dow Pittsburg) is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by Dow Pittsburg's comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at the Dow site in Pittsburg, California.  It is Dow Pittsburg's policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Dow Pittsburg is also committed to responding to emergencies resulting from accidental releases in order to mitigate the release and any associated consequences.\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe primary activity at Dow's Pittsburg site is agricultural chemical manufacturing.  Dow Pittsburg has six regulated substances present at the site.  These substances include 1,3-butadiene, ammonia (aqueous), chlorine, hydrogen chloride (anhydrous), hydrogen fluoride (anhydrous) and sulfur dioxide (anhydrous).  1,3-butadiene is used in making emulsion polymers.  Ammonia (aqueous) is used in making emulsion polymers and an agricultural herbicidal intermediate.  Chlorine is used in making of intermediate and finished products for agricultural applications and is a byproduct of these processes.  Hydrogen chloride is made as a co-product of some of the agricultural product manufacturing processes.  Hydrogen fluoride and sulfur dioxide (anhydrous) are used to make agricultural products and intermediates.\n\n3. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe Dow Pittsburg site has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  The Dow Pittsburg site was designed and cons"

The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at the site.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nDow Pittsburg maintains detailed records of safety information that describe the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes. Examples include; Material Safety Data Sheets, piping and instrumentation diagrams, equipment specification sheets, reactive chemicals testing reports, and corrosion reports.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nDow's Pittsburg site conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with the covered processes are identified and effectively controlled.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses include Dow Fire and Explosion Index (F&EI), Dow Chemical Exposure Index (CEI), Reactive Chemical/Process Hazard Analysis (RC/PHA), Hazard and Operability Study (HAZOP), Layers of Protection Analysis (LOPA), Reactive Chemical Reviews, and project Safety & Loss Prevention Reviews.  Studies utilize an appropriate team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering, maintenance and process operations and are revalidated on a regular basis.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis, where a response is required, are tracked to ensure resolution in a timely and appropriate manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within Dow Pittsburg's covered processes, written operating procedures are maintained.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\n\nDow Pittsburg has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating proce"

These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nDow Pittsburg truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  The site has safety teams, which involve employees as leaders in facilitating team efforts. In addition, Dow Pittsburg employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses in particular. Safe job performance is required for each of the jobs at the site.\n\nContractors\n\nOn occasion, Dow Pittsburg hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance, construction and various other activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out.  Dow Pittsburg has a policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related to the contractor's work and the processes. Contractors are also required to inform Dow of any hazards they may introduce at the site. Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\n\n4. Five-year Accident History\n\nDow Pittsburg has enjoyed an excellent record of preventing accidental releases due to the site's release prevention policies.  There have been no accidental releases from Dow within the last 5 years with offsite impact (deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place).  There have been two onsite injuries as a result of a"

Emergency Response Plan\n\nDow Pittsburg utilizes a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, sheltering-in-place, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.  To ensure proper functioning, Dow Pittsburg emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place that would require a modified emergency response.\n\nCA Region II LEPC is the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) with which the emergency plan for the Dow Pittsburg site has been coordinated and verified. Dow Pittsburg also coordinates our plans and actions with local agencies and industrial mutual aid groups, which provide Dow with additional emergency response capability.\n\n6. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nImproving safety is a continuous process at Dow Pittsburg.  PHA's, Compliance Audits, Incident Investigations, Emergency Response Drills and employee participation are a primary means for identifying opportunities to improve safety.  Structural seismic upgrades, materials of construction upgrades, installing additional process instrumentation and/or process controls, and conducting Hazard Awareness training are typical of currently planned changes to improve safety at the facility.\n\nThe Dow Chemical Company\nPittsburg, California"
