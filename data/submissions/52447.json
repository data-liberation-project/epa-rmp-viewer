Other processing at this facility includes fresh cherry packing, dark sweet cherry processing and frozen dark sweet cherry processing.  Fresh cherries are cooled using chilled water in hydrocoolers to product product quality.  Fresh and frozen products are stored in cold rooms and freezers respectively.  Our mission is to produce quality cherry products in safe processing operations and protect our employees, our growers, our customers, the public, and the environment.\n\nThe covered PSM-RMP processes for this facility include:\n\nSulfur Dioxide: Sulfur Dioxide gas is transferred from either 90 ton railcars or 5 ton cylinders.  Sulfur Dioxide gas is bubbled into salt water to prepare brines that preserve, firm and bleach the cherries.  This process is essential to preserve cherry quality.  To assure that Sulfur Dioxide is handled safely, only trained, qualified operators are authorized to make cherry brine.  Oregon Cherry Growers has a long standing safety program which includes annual SO2 training for all brine making crews, Process Safety Management, meetings when a process change occurs, and continuing follow up to assure safe practices are followed and improved if possible.  Process team members assist in the update of our procedures and safety information.  \n\nAnhydrous Ammonia: Anhydrous Ammonia used as a refrigerant for our cold rooms, freezers, and hydrocoolers.  The estimated total pounds of Ammonia in our refrigeration systems is approximately 10,500 pounds.  To assure that Ammonia is handled safely, only trained refrigeration mechanics operate our refrigeration systems.  Only qualified contractors work on refrigeration equipment.  Our safety program for Ammonia also includes annual training for operators, Process Safety Management, meetings when a operations change occurs, and continuing fo"

Process team members assist in the update of our procedures and safety information.\n\nTo assure accidental releases are prevented, Oregon Cherry Growers has a continuing safety program for Sulfur Dioxide and Ammonia.   All process procedures are written and closely monitored by trained, qualified employees.  These include checklists for operations, written operations procedures, regular equipment inspections, and maintaining a comprehensive training program to keep operators alert to safe operations.  Emergency Response activities are reviewed and updated annually.  Emergency response training is included in pre-harvest training activities.\n\nPlanned improvements include additional coordinated training with local emergency response agencies and applying the principles of continuous improvement to all chemical handling processes.  All improvement are documented and reviewed with the process team prior to implementation."
