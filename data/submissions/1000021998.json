      "SummaryText": "Hi-Temp LLC, dba Bluewater Thermal Solutions\nExecutive Summary\n\n1.    Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nBluewater is committed to employee, public, and environmental safety. We have a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place. This program covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. In the unlikely event that a release should occur, our emergency response personnel are trained to control and mitigate the effects of such a release.\n\n2.    Description of the Facility and the Regulated Substances Handled\nBluewater is a commercial heat treating service utilizing continuous electric and gas heated furnaces to perform multiple manufacturing processes on customers parts. Manufacturing processes include hardening of 410 stainless steel; annealing of all types of steel and cast iron; tempering & stress relieving; copper, silver & nickel brazing; passivating of stainless steel; copper stripping and alkaline washing. \n\nBluewater consists of three plants located on one contiguous piece of property. The plants house offices, manufacturing operations and storage. Plant #1 is located at 310 S. Wolf Road, Northlake, IL. Plant #2 is located at 75 E. Lake Street, Northlake. Plant #3 is located at 5400 W. Lake Street, Melrose Park, IL. The mailing address of the facility is 75 E. Lake Street, Northlake, IL 60164.\n\n    Plant #1\nPlant 1 does not store or use any chemicals in quantities that would trigger a Risk Management Program.\n\nPlant #2:  Air Permit Operating #73070244\nThe property of Plant #2 is bounded by Lake Street to the North, the Union Pacific Railroad to the South, Dyna-Burr Chicago, Inc., located at 65 E. Lake Street to the West, and by Veolia, to the East. There are multiple unit apartment buildings, a motel and an oil-lube change "

      "SummaryText": "shop across the boundary street to the north. The Union Pacific Railway lines that border to the South run both freight and passenger lines. The passenger trains run on the southernmost tracks. The properties that border to the east and west are industrial facilities and offices. A site map of the facility appears on page 8.\n\nPlant #2 handles and stores Anhydrous Ammonia (CAS# 7664-41-7). This material is regulated under 40 CFR Part 68 as a toxic gas. It is a gas that is liquefied under pressure. It is delivered, installed by transfer hose and stored in steel tanks in this liquid form. There are two (2) tanks. One 10,000 gallon tank, and one 1,000 gallon tank. The tanks are constructed of steel and are 1.5\" thick. The tanks are stored outside of Plant #2 on the east side of the building approximately 125 feet south of Lake Street (the north property boundary). The tanks are stored on the ground and are enclosed in a locked chain link cage and a protected by 6\" steel I-beams. See page 8 for a diagram.\n\nPlant #2 uses two systems for providing the protective atmosphere in continuous furnaces. The first system combines both nitrogen and dissociated ammonia. The second system uses only disassociated ammonia, in continuous furnaces as the protective atmosphere.\n\nPlant #3\nPlant 3 does not store or use any chemicals in quantities that would trigger a Risk Management Program.\n\n3.     Worst-Case Release Scenarios\nPlant 2:  Ammonia, anhydrous\n\nFailure of a High-Pressure Steel tank through a puncture or failure at the valve will have no effect on the adjacent ammonia tank. However, in the worst case scenario the maximum combined quantity of ammonia stored in the 10,000 gallon and 1,000 gallon tank equal 9,650 gallons as they are kept only 87% full. This amounts to 54,040 lbs of ammonia. If this maximum quantity of ammonia (54,040 lbs) was simultaneously released from both tanks, the resulting denser-than-air vapor would release at ground level with a toxic endpoint distance of 2.0"

Alternative Case Release Scenario\nPlant 2:  Ammonia, anhydrous\n\nAn accidental release of ammonia for both processes would more likely occur as a result of a transfer hose failure. This type of release would occur at the time of receiving new quantities of ammonia and having the facility's ammonia tanks refilled. The transfer hose is 2\" in diameter and is 22' long. If there were a failure in this hose, the resulting ammonia release would only involve the quantity of ammonia that existed within the transfer hose. This quantity is 22 pounds of ammonia.\n\nWith this  of an ammonia release, the resulting toxic distance endpoint is <0.1 miles. This would not extend past the property boundaries, therefore, this type of ammonia release would not generate a public health emergency.\n\n    Assumptions and Calculations follow (OCA Guidance):\n\n    RMP*CompVer 1.07\n\n    Results of Consequence Analysis\n\n    Chemical: Ammonia, anhydrous\n    CAS #: 7664-41-7\n    Category: Toxic Gas\n    Scenario: Alt"
