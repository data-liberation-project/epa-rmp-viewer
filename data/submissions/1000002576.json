      "SummaryText": "Seneca Foods Corporation - Process Facility, Rochester, MN\n\nINTRODUCTION:\n\nThe facility is a seasonal vegetable processor which cans and freezes a variety of vegetables, including peas, corn, carrots, and potatoes.  Peas are processed from mid-June to August, corn in August and September, and carrots and potatoes from early October to mid-November.  Shortly after processing, nearly all of the canned and frozen vegetables are shipped via truck to Seneca warehousing facility located at 308 20th St. SE, Rochester, MN (approximately 8 blocks south of processing facility).\n\nAn ammonia refrigeration system is used at the processing facility ammonia is a regulated substance per 40 CFR Part 68 Environmental Protection Agency (Appendix A).  The same properties that make ammonia a valuable coolant for refrigeration also make it necessary to observe certain precautions when using to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health and the health of our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is Seneca Foods policy to conform to all applicable state and federal rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which the refrigeration system is operated, safety devices engineered into the system, good maintenance procedures, as well as the training of our personnel.  The 21,840 lbs. of anhydrous ammonia in the system is used to provide refrigeration for the IQF (Individually Quick Frozen) tunnels, air units in the freezer tunnel room, and vegetable cooling units utilizing chilled water.  The threshold reporting quantity for anhydrous ammonia is 10,000 lbs., thus Seneca's Process Facility is required to comply with the EPA's Risk Management Plan (RMP) requirements.\n\nSeneca's Process facility has an accidental release prevention program in place which complies with OSHA's 29 CFR 1910.119 Process Safety Management Standard.

NewMech Companies Inc. of Plymouth MN performs maintenance on the refrigeration system.  The refrigeration system was installed in 1986, all components were new when installed; no second hand equipment was used.  The system remains in excellent condition as a result of the diligent maintenance program used by Seneca and NewMech.\n\nThe Rochester Fire Department is the Seneca Process Facility's designated outside first response team.\n\n If an uncontrolled release develops, the following procedure will be used:\n\n     1) Freezer mechanics confirms leak\n     2) Freezer mechanic evacuates the immediate area\n     3) Management determines the need for a plant wide evacuation\n     4) An upwind location is selected and the evacuation signal is ordered by the management staff (High-Low Siren)\n     5) Time cards are collected for role call\n     6) Rochester Fire Department* is notified by calling 911\n     7) Roll call is taken at the assembly area and first aid is administered\n     8) A list of employees not accounted for at roll call will be forwarded to Rochester Fire Department\n     9) Notification of appropriate Company Officials and Governmental Agencies is done\n\n*= Rochester Fire Department will notify potentially affected offsite "
