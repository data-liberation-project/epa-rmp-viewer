As part of this commitment, Solvay Fluorides, Inc. has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility. One component of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at Solvay Fluorides, Inc. and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule). One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMPlan) describing the risk management program at Solvay Fluorides, Inc. This plan is intended to satisfy the RMPlan requirement of the RMP rule ('68.150 through '68.185) and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at Solvay Fluorides, Inc.\n\n2.0 Accidental Release Prevention and\nEmergency Response Policies\nSolvay Fluorides, Inc. is committed to the safety of our employees and the public, and to the preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances. Solvay Fluorides, Inc. implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances. In the event of an accidental release, Solvay Fluorides, Inc. controls and contains the release in a manner that will be safe for workers and will help prevent injury to the public or the environment.\n\n3.0    Facility Processes and Regulated Substances\nSolvay Fluorides, Inc. manufactures a dry brazing flux for the automotive industry. The manufacturing process uses aqueous hydrofluoric acid (HF). HF acid at solution concentrations of 50% or greater are regulated by the RMP rule. And although only dilute (about 25 wt.%) HF acid solutions are used in the manufacturing process, HF acid at a solution conc"

      "SummaryText": "entration of 70% is stored in a large tank at the facility for use in the process.\n\nA maximum of 7,200 gallons of 70% HF acid is stored in one 8,000 gallon tank located in the middle of the Solvay Fluorides, Inc. site. The weight of HF acid in 7,200 gallons of 70% solution is right at 75,000 lb., which exceeds the RMP rule threshold quantity for HF acid in a process (1,000 lb.). Because the HF acid storage creates the potential for offsite consequences resulting from an accidental release of HF acid and the specific use of the acid falls under one of the 10 \"targeted\" NAICS codes, the process falls under the RMP Program 3 prevention program.\n\n4.0    Offsite Consequence Analysis\nThe RMP rule requires Solvay Fluorides, Inc. to perform an offsite consequence analysis for one worst-case and one alternative release scenario for aqueous HF acid, a toxic substance. The worst-case release scenario is failure of the 8,000-gallon storage tank releasing 75,000 lb. of aqueous HF acid (70 wt.%). A diked area contains the released aqueous HF acid, which evaporates, forming a vapor cloud. The maximum distance to the toxic endpoint concentration is well beyond our site perimeter.. Several houses are located within this distance from the release, with a total population of about 20 people; no environmental receptors are within this distance. There are number of commercial operations within this distance with a daytime workforce of about 2,000.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario for aqueous hydrofluoric acid is rupture of a 2-inch diameter liquid line connecting the aqueous HF acid (70 wt.%) storage tank to the process vessels. This scenario assumes that the solution's release is not discovered for 10 minutes at which the line is  isolated and leaking ceases. The released acid forms a pool, with HF evaporating from the pool and forming a vapor cloud. The maximum distance to the toxic endpoint is 0.19 mile. No residences are located within this perimeter from the storage tank. There "
