      "SummaryText": "The Dallas Group of America, Inc. Texas City Facility produces a high-purity ammonium chloride powder. Anhydrous ammonia is reacted with hydrochloric acid to produce an ammonium chloride solution. Because the concentration of hydrochloric acid used at the plant is less than 37 percent, the hydrochloric acid is exempt from RMP requirements.In a series of steps, the ammonium chloride solution is concentrated, refined,and reduced to a powder form. The finished product is bagged and sold commercially.\n\nIn the worst case scenario, an ammonia tank is predicted to rupture. The ruptured tank spills 49,632 pounds of ammonia into a diked area. The release rate of the ammonia is 199 pounds per minute and the total spill is estimated to evaporate in 249 minutes. The atompheric conditions are 77 degrees Fahrenheit, 50 % humidity, 3.3 miles per hour wind speed, and F Class atmospheric stability. Based on dispersion modeling, the endpoint distance is 0.62 miles. The endpoint distance is the distance at which the chemical concentrations are low enough that effects on the community are no longer expected. The following passive mitigation measures were considered: dikes and enclosures.\n\nIn the alternative release scenario, a two inch hole in a pipe is predicted. The hole releases 1,000 pounds of ammonia vapor into the atmosphere. The release rate of the ammonia is 100 pounds per minute and the total release lasts 10 minutes. Active and passive safety systems are considered to work. The atompheric conditions are 77 degrees Fahrenheit, 50 % humidity, 7.0 miles per hour wind speed, and D Class atmospheric stability. Based on dispersion modeling, the endpoint distance is 0.09 miles. The following passive mitigation measures were considered: dikes and enclosures. The following active mitigation measures were considered: sprinkler systems, deluge systems, and excess flow valves. \n\nThe following process control are used: vents, relief valves,check valves, scrubbers, manual shutoffs, automat"
