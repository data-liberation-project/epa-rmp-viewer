The Sudan Pump Station employs Chloramine disinfection which is the combination of chlorine and Ammonia . Chlorine and Ammonia ( chloramines)  produce what is known as a combination residual. The process of using Chlorine and Ammonia  to form Chloramines enhance the longevity of the chlorine . Chloramines are used as the primary disinfectant to kill bacteria, algae and other microorganisms which are undersirable in public water supplies. \n                                        \n2. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICY\n\n               Chlorine and Ammonia are present at the Sudan Pump Station . Chlorine and Ammoina are classified as toxic chemicals under the Environmental  Protection Agency's (EPA's) Risk Management Program ( RMP) rule. Some of the same properties which make Chlorine and Ammonia valuable and necessary components of the Sudan Pump Station make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling each chemical to prevent unnecessary human exposure, Including the threat to plant personnel, neighboring citizens of Bailey County, as well the environment.\n\n                  It is the City of Lubbock policy to strictly adhere to all applicable FEDERAL and State Guidelines and Regulations. Safety depends on the manner in which Chlorine and Ammonia are handled at the station, the safety devices inherent in the design for the facility, the safe handling procedures which are in place and the training of  personnel.\n\n                  The City of Lubbock Fire Department will respond to any major release involving either Chlorine or Ammonia. The Water Utilities Emergency Response Plan (ERP) is based upon available information materials related to Chlorine and Ammoina. The ERP includes  procedures for the notification of the City of Lubbock Fir Department, proper station personne"

      "SummaryText": "l and any potentially affected citizenry.\n\n\n3. THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\n                   As described in Section 1, the primary purpose of the Sudan Pump station is to treat ground water making it safe for consumption by the citizens of Lubbock .  Chlorine is received in one ( 1 ) ton  cylinders by truck . It is then utilized in the disinfecting process. Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees. Authorized management personnel, authorized contractors and authorized guest. The total Maximum inventory of Chlorine is 24,000 lbs. AMMONIA is received in bulk state delivered by tanker truck and is pumped into a storage tank, It is then used in the disinfection process and access to the site is regulated the same as the chlorine site. The total maximum inventory of ammonia is 20,500 lbs.\n\n4. THE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM  AND THE SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe Sudan Pump Station complies with al applicable Federal and State guidelines , codes and regulations. The facility is operated in accordance with recommendations from the Chlorine Institute and adhere to regulation 40 CFR 302\n\n\n5. FIVE- YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\nThere have been no  accidental release of CHLORINE or AMMONIA at the Sudan Pump Station within the past five (5) years.\n\n\n6. EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM (ERP)\n\n\nSudan Pump Station employees will respond to minor releases involving CHLORINE and AMMONIA . More involved releases of CHLORINE and AMMONIA will be responded to by City of Lubbock Fire Department per the ERP developed by the City of Lubbock Water Utilities Department.\n\n\n7. PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\nThe Sudan pump Station will continue to improve operations on a ongoing basis. Chlorine Institute and additional engineering programs will be reviewed to determine that process being conducted are in compliance with latest safety innovations."
