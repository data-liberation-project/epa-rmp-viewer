Ammonia is brought into the facility primarily by pipeline and shipped out primarily by truck.  UAN solution is brought into the facility by rail and truck and shipped out primarily by truck.  The regulated substance, as defined by 40 CFR Part 68, which is present at the facility in more than a threshold quantity is ammonia.\n\nIt is Terra Nitrogen's policy  to prevent accidental releases from the Blair Terminal by effective process safety management programs and procedures that include: participation by all plant employees in every element of PSM; maintaining current and accurate written operating procedures; providing timely and comprehensive training for all employees involved in operating and maintaining process equipment; overseeing the activities of contractors and ensuring that they are trained to perform their job safely; following established pre-startup safety review and management of change procedures to ensure that modifications are adequately evaluated for safety; administering a comprehensive mechanical integrity program to ensure that process equipment is maintained in accordance with good engineering practice and accepted industry standards; investigating incidents when they do occur to promptly correct deficiencies and learn from the experience; and audit the entire PSM program on a regular basis to verify that elements, procedures, and systems are in place and adequate.  In addition, it is the Blair Terminal's policy to maintain a current and accurate written emergency response plan, an equipped onsite emergency response team, a system to notify facility neighbors in the event of a release and to coordinate emergency response planning with local authorities and exercise those plans annually.\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis\nThe Blair Terminal Toxic Worst Case Scenario involves ammonia and has offsite impact.

On 8/18/94, the facility was receiving anhydrous ammonia from the pipeline into our 30,000 gallon bullets.  The bullets filled to 100% and a relief valve on top of the tanks opened up to the atmosphere and relieved pressure as designed.  An estimated 1132 lbs. of ammonia was released over a period of 2 minutes.  Construction workers at a plant site south of the terminal smelled ammonia a"

The Blair Terminal has also contracted with Community Alert Network (C.A.N.) to provide an emergency telephone notification system for alerting neighbors in the affected area in the event of a release."
