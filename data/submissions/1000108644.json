If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the North County Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.  We also maintain fire extinguishers on site and conduct fire safety training to employees to handle small emergencies. \n\nA description of your facility and the regulated substances handled.  This facility is a bulk terminal storing LPG for resale to wholesale and retail propane outlets.   The facility consists of six 90,000-gallon tanks and may have up to 32 railcars on site at any time. \n\nThe worst-case and alternative release scenarios.  Our worst-case scenario is failure of one 90,000-gallon storage tank when filled to the greatest amount allowed (85% at 60F), resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  The resulting distance to the endpoint extends offsite, and public receptors are within the distance to the endpoint. Our alternative release scenario is a release from a four-valve relief valve with three of the valves lifting, leading to a 5-minute release and explosion.  The resulting distance to the endpoint (0.13 miles) extends offsite, and public receptors are within the distance to the endpoint. \n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps.  This facility complies with EPA\u2019s accident prevention rule, the OSHA PSM standard, and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.  The propane system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with NFPA-58 and state law.  \n\nFive-year accident history.  We have never had an accident involving propane that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place. \n\nThe emergency response (action) program.
