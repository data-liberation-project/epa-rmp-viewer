Hydrogen is currently stored in two separate locations within the facility. \n\nA process Hazard Analysis is conducted on a five year schedule by the process hazard analysis team.  The team is composed of a Team leader (also Gas Engineer) , Safety Representative for gases, Gas Technicians, Manufacturing Representative, Emergency Control Representative, and an Engineer from Air Products (vendor).  The results are recorded and maintained on file.\n\nOperating procedures were written by the Gas Engineer using technical process description, process safety information, and in cooperation with the affected employees.  Operating procedures are currently available where specified  in Process Safety Management, (PSM) Documentation or in Central Utilities System 1 department, (D/20G), \"Bulk Gas Procedures & Desk References located in B/316\".\n\nTraining is formulated and tracked by the Gas Engineer and training records are maintained by the D/20 G Manager.\n\nThe Mechanical Integrity is shared between the gas supplier and IBM.  The program consists of equipment lists and specifications, equipment history, preventative maintenance procedures.  The Vendor is audited by IBM  every three years as required by PSM to assure compliance to all requirements. \n  \nHot work permits for hydrogen are issued by D/20G \"High Purity Gases Piping Permit\".  This permit includes inspecting the area for safety.  In addition to the Hot Work Permit most jobs may also require an open flame permit to be issued by Emergency Control.\n\nManageme"

Operator refresher training and system update training are conducted on the prescribed basis of the operator training program.  The maintenance program inspections and tests to assure operation of the prevention devices.
