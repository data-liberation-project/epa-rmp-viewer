However, should a release occur, plant personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\nDescription of Stationary Source and Regulated Substances:\nThe Kane gas processing plant is located approximately 3 miles east of Kane, PA on state highway 6.  The plant processes about 10 MMSCFD of natural gas and provides both a service and a product.  The gas is dehydrated and hydrocarbons, which might otherwise condense in the transmission pipeline and cause problems, are removed to produce a saleable gas product.  The hydrocarbons that are removed are fractionated into propane and a butane/gasoline mixed product.  Total liquid production is about 460 BPD with total propane and butane/gasoline mix storage capacity of 2,100 Bbls.  The plant has inlet compression, hydrate suppression, and utilizes a refrigerated process for hydrocarbon removal.  The plant contains several regulated flammables such as propane and natural gasoline.  No threshold quantity of a regulated toxic is present at the plant site.\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results:\nThe WCS is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) involving the full capacity of the largest propane storage tank, 123,000 Lbs.  Although a written procedure is in place to limit the inventory to 90% of tank capacity, the entire tank capacity was used in the scenario.  EPA?s RMP*COMP software was used to determine that the maximum distance to a 1 psi endpoint was 0.4 miles.\n\nThe Alternate Release Scenario is a Vapor Cloud Explosion resulting from the release of propane from a truck loading line (16,400 Lbs released in 10 minutes).  The release is expected to be blocked in by the operator within 10 minutes.  EPA?s RMP*COMP was used to determine that the distance "

      "SummaryText": "to a 1 psi endpoint is 0.1 miles.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Program:\nThis facility is constructed in accordance with appropriate mechanical and electrical codes for gas processing plants and is subject to OSHA?s PSM program.  Written programs and procedures  cover all of the key elements of the PSM program and the employees are well trained in the safe operation of this facility.\n\nChemical-Specific Prevention Steps:\nThe Kane plant includes the following safety features:\n1.Hydrocarbon detectors with alarms;\n2.Process safety relief valves;\n3.Automated plant shutdown system (the plant will be automatically shutdown should key process variables vary from specified ranges);\n4.Manual valves to permit isolation of various portions of the process;\n5.Diking to contain liquid releases;\n6.Appropriately placed fire extinguishers to combat incipient stage fires;\n7.Excess flow valves on product storage;\n8.Breakaway connections on product loading hoses to stop flow if a hose is pulled off;\n9.Automated call-out system to notify plant operator(s) of abnormal operation.\n\nFive Year Accident History:\nThe Kane Plant is scheduled to be placed in service in mid-late August, 2002.  This is a new facility and has not experienced any accidental releases that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on  site or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\nEmergency Response Program Information:\nThe Kane Plant Emergency Response Plan has been coordinated with the McKean County Control Office.  The plan has been posted at the plant and all employees have been trained in the actions to be taken in the event of an emergency.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\nNo changes to the safety program or plant facilities are currently planned. However, weekly safety meetings are held during which incidents are reviewed, safety procedures discussed and changes proposed.  Our safety program is constantly improving."
