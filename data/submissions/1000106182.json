      "SummaryText": "The Tempur Production Plant located at 3200 Comfort Drive in Crawfordsville, IN manufactures flexible polyurethane foam which is fabricated into pillows and mattresses on-site.  All manufacturing activities are conducted within the building\u2019s interior. Raw materials are received by truck and rail and stored in tanks in the chemical tank farm.  The chemical storage tanks and truck unloading operations are located inside the manufacturing building. There is a rail car unloading facility along the north side of the manufacturing building.\n\nThe Tempur Production Plant Risk Management Plan (RMP) has been developed in accordance with EPA requirements found in 40 CFR Part 68, Chemical Accidental Prevention Provisions.  The Tempur Plant is subject to this requirement because it exceeds the 10,000-pound on-site storage threshold quantity for toluene diisocyanate (TDI), specifically 2,4-Toluene Diisocyanate CAS 584-84-9 and 2,6-Toluene Diisocyanate CAS 91-8-7, and is a mixture of approximately 80% 2,4-TDI and 20% 2,6-TDI.\n            \nThe plant operations will consist of a chemical tank farm, one foam pouring line, one R&D mini pouring line, high bay racking foam storage, 7 foam cutting lines, 4 foam compression lines, 4 lamination lines, 4 Assembly lines, and two topper assembly lines.  All production and manufacturing will occur in one 700,000 ft2 building."
