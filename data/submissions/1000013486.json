      "SummaryText": "The Black Hills Power WYGEN 1 and WYGEN 2 Power Plants maintain one substance, anhydrous ammonia, on site in amounts that exceeds the RMP rule threshold quantity.  The threshold quantity for anhydrous ammonia is 10,000 pounds.  Each of these plants has a separate process that stores anhydrous ammonia in a 12,000-gallon tank (maximum capacity of 61,765 lb; however, due to administrative restrictions, the tanks are only filled to 85% of their capacity or 52,500 lb, each).  The storage and management of anhydrous ammonia for each plant??A?s system is addressed in this RMP plan. The WYGEN III Power Plant was brought on-line in April of 2010. This facility utilizes the WYGEN II Power Plant anhydrous ammonia tank as its source of anhydrous ammonia. This is the reason why WYGEN III has been incorporated with WYGEN II Power Plant facility anhyrous ammonia system.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is used at the power plants as an air pollution control additive to minimize the emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) in boiler flue gas.  The boiler units are equipped with selective catalytic reduction (SCR) systems.  The SCR system's ammonia tanks and associated piping are addressed in the Risk Management Plan.\n\nPlant Descriptions\n\nThe WYGEN 1, WYGEN 2 and WYGEN 3 Power Plants are located in Campbell County at 13151 Hwy 51, southeast of Gillette, Wyoming.  The facilities are situated south of Interstate I-90 and east of Gillette.  To the east and also on the north side of the I-90 is residential area.  Open-pit coal mining operations are on the west and northwest side of the power plants.  The property to the south of the power plants consists of reclaimed coal mine property and undeveloped grassland.  There is a recreational area called the Cam-Plex that is located to the southwest of the plants which has such events as motor-cross and horseback riding occasionally; however, the reclaimed coal mine property is between the power plants and the Cam-Plex.  These recreational and residential areas "

Each tank will be maintained at a pressure of 60-200 psi by drawing liquid ammonia from the bottom of the tank, heating it in one of two electric vaporizers, and then routing the ammonia vapor back to the tank head space.  For the NOx control systems, ammonia vapors will be drawn from the tank's head space, regulated for pressure, mixed with air, and injected into the boiler flue within each respective ammonia grid.  In combination with the catalyst located within the SCR units, NOx will be chemically reacted with the ammonia-air mixture and emissions of the pollutant will be substantially reduced.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nA process hazard analysis (PHA) was performed on each ammonia system, as well as with the addition of WYGEN III to WYGEN II system, using a Reliability-Centered Maintenance (RCM) technique that includes a complete environmental, safety, and operational review using as a basis a failure modes and effects analysis.  The ammonia tanks and associated systems were reviewed for compliance with the American National Standards Institute standards for ammonia (ANSI K-61.1, American National Standard Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia).  Compliance with code requirements regarding the storage tank, unloading station, piping system, vaporizers, air dilution equipment, and ammonia injection grid, as well as operational practices and protocols with anhydrous ammonia management, were assessed.  A copy of the RCM analysis is included in the PHA Plan document.\n\nA plant-assigned team of operators, maintenance planners, engineers, supervisors, and managers evaluated ea"

Potential failure points, maintenance and inspection concerns, and standard operating procedures were reviewed for each functional failure within the systems.  Comments and recommendations are summarized in detail within the OSHA-required sections of the PHA Plan document.  In addition, a corporate policy requires that each site having ammonia prepare a PHA Plan meeting the OSHA requirements.\n\nPrevention Systems\n\nBlack Hills Power prepared operation, annunciator, and maintenance procedures for the anhydrous ammonia systems.  Operating Procedures (OP), Alarm Procedures (AP), and Maintenance Procedures (MP) have been developed based on the RCM analysis requirements, and key personnel will receive training before being allowed to work on the systems.  The training includes test certification.\n\nThe ammonia systems will be visually inspected once per shift on a daily basis.  Use of accurate procedures, written with the participation of the Process Safety Management (PSM) team, will be utilized as the primary prevention method of operating the systems.  Personnel will be trained annually on safety concerns and general operation procedures as well as emergency response procedures.  Emergency response training on self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) worn by the operators during emergency releases of ammonia will be conducted annually and prior to system startup.  Key employees will be trained and certified annually on the safety requirements for connection/disconnection of ammonia supply components, awareness of the hazardous properties of ammonia, and the presence, location, and design of ammonia detectors.\n\nAmmonia detectors with alarms are installed within proximity of the ammonia tanks and ammonia injection skids and will be used to detect leaks and warn of hazards by flashing a beacon.

Each plant's personnel will be trained to respond to leaks that can be managed by shutting off key valves in an emergency.  Any response requiring entry into a dangerous atmosphere or situation will be performed by the Campbell County Fire Department (CCFD) HazMat team.  The CCFD is a member of the Campbell County Local Emergency Planning Committee (CCLEPC).  If the situation deems necessary, the CCFD will notify Campbell County Emergency Management Agency (CCEMA).  Ammonia response procedures will be discussed during an inspection by the CCFD HazMat team.
