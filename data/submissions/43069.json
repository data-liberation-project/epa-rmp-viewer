The accidental release prevention and response policies for the Hiland Bakken Gas Plant are maintained in the facility's Emergency Response Plan and RMP Manual.  Hiland is committed to the safety and health of it's employees, contractors and visitors.  This commitment is demonstrated in the design, operation and maintenance programs developed and implemented specifically for this facility.  Operation and maintenance personnel are trained in the appropriate emergency response procedures to follow in the event of an accidental release.  However, accident prevention is the ultimate goal and as such a site-specific mechanical integrity program is being implemented and maintained.\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES.  The Hiland Bakken Gas Plant is located approximately 10 miles North of Sidney, Montana, East of Highway 16.  It is a plant that is designed to extract natural gas liquids (ie: ethane, propane, butane and heavier hydrocarbons) from raw natural gas and at the same time produce a pipeline quality gas (primarily methane).  The only process in the plant that contains an above threshold quantity of a regulated substance is the Product Storage Tank.  There are no above threshold quantity toxic substances at the Hiland Bakken Gas Plant.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM.  The Hiland Bakken Gas Plant has developed and implemented a site-specific accidental release prevention program that consists of a detailed facility mechanical integrity program and employee training program.  The mechanical integrity program was developed under the guidelines of manufacturer written recommendations,  recognized/generally accepted good engineering practices, industry/regulatory standards and past operation history.  Employee training was designed to ensure/document employee understanding of facility operation and maintenance requirements.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY.  The Hiland Bakken Gas Plant has neve"

The Hiland Bakken Gas Plant has develped and maintains a site-specific Emergency Response Plan (ERP)  that includes actions to take in the event of an uncontrolled release of a hazardous substance.  The ERP includes the names and phone numbers of not only company personnel but also the names and phone numbers of support services (contractors, police departments, fire departments, medical services/hospitals, regulatory agencies, LEPC, etc.) tha may be called upon for assistance.  Liaison with those agencies is maintained to ensure timely and proper responses.  Employee understanding of their responsibilities during and emergency situation is high priority.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY.  Hiland believes safety is an issue that can always be improved upon.  Hiland continues to look for, develop and implement programs that will improve an employee's ability to identify and correct potential workplace hazards.  Hiland also endeavors to ensure policies, programs and procedures are developed and implemented to meet applicable laws, rules and regulations.  Employee understanding of these policies, programs and procedures is high priority."
