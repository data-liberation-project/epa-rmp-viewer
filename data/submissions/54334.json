We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public, as well as protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n* A description of our facility and use of substances required by EPA's RMP regulation\n* A summary of results from our assessment of the potential offsite consequences from accidental chemical releases\n* An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\n* A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule\n* An overview of our emergency response program\n* An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nEnterprise's Propylene Processing Facility (Splitter III) is used to separate Propane from Propylene products.  The Propane/Propylene mixture is fed to the facility via pipelines from underground storage wells where the two components are separated via distillation.  The Propylene product is fed through the Bay Area Pipeline for distribution to downstream customers.  The remaining Propane joins with Propane product from the adjacent Enterprise facility and is shipped to downstream customers via pipelines, rail cars and/or trucks.  \n\nCurrently, there are no toxic substances used, manufactured, or stored at the Propylene Processing Facility that meet the RMP threshold quantities promulgated for those"

Our accidental release prevention program and our contingency planning efforts help us effectively manage the hazards that are posed to our employees, the public, and the environment by our use of these chemicals.\n\nKEY OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS SCENARIOS\n\nEPA's RMP rule requires that we provide information about the worst-case scenario(s) and alternative release scenario(s) for our facility.  The following are brief summaries of these scenarios, including information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the exposure distances for each scenario:\n\n\nToxic Substances\n\nAs stated previously, no toxic substances were identified at Enterprise's Propylene Processing Facility as meeting the criteria or threshold limits of the RMP Rule.  Hence, there was no need to conduct a worst-case scenario (WCS) with respect to toxic substances. \n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario - Regulated Flammable Chemicals\n\nThe WCS associated with a release of flammable materials from Enterprise's Propylene Processing Facility involves the rupture or failure of the Splitter Charge Tank, which contains a mixture of propane and propylene.  All emergency response and early warning to the employees and the community would be exercised immediately if this scenario were to occur.  All Emergency Response protocols would be in effect.  There would be no offsite environmental impact in this scenario due to the material being consumed on site.  Further details on the Splitter III worst case scenario are contained in the Risk Management Program registration document.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario(s) - Regulated Flammable Chemicals\n\nThis scenario would be mitigated by means of the emergency shutdown system and the activation of the emergency response team.  All emergency response and early warning to the employees and the community would be exercised immediate"

Further details on the alternate case scenario are contained in the Risk Management Program registration document.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMIAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nWe take a systematic, pro-active approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  Our Process Safety Management Systems address each of the key features of successful prevention programs, including:\n\n* Process safety information\n* Process hazard analysis\n* Operating procedures\n* Training\n* Mechanical integrity\n* Management of change\n* Pre-Startup Safety Review - PSSR\n* Compliance audits\n* Incident investigation\n* Employee participation\n* Hot work permit\n* Contractors\n\nAs part of our prevention efforts, we have a multitude of programs in which our employees participate.  We have a training program in which the Operations and Maintenance personnel are specifically trained in the operation of the plant, the operating procedures, maintenance procedures, and specific other regulations and policies, as well as in all areas of emergency response.  We train, use and apply the guidelines of our PSM program, which include all of the above-listed areas.  All of these programs come under scheduled scrutiny and critique.\n\nWe have an on-going inspection program designed to search out and find deficiencies in the process equipment prior to any incident.\n\nOperations personnel make regular inspections of the equipment and processes they operate.  If something out of the ordinary is detected, it is reported to management in order to expediently resolve any problems.\n\nRecords are maintained for all significant accidental releases of hazardous chemicals that occur at the facility.

There have been no RMP-defined accidental releases of hazardous material from Enterprises' Propylene Processing Facility within the last five years. \n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nEnterprise maintains an integrated contingency plan, which consolidates all of the various federal, state, and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning.  The program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting the workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  Furthermore, the plan is coordinated with the Mutual Aid Mont Belvieu group, which includes the Mont Belvieu Police, fire department, and Emergency Medical Service as well as the Chambers County Emergency Management system.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nEnterprise personnel are continuously reviewing and improving our PSM systems, especially in the areas of operating procedures and training programs.  Employees are encouraged to submit suggestions or recommendations to improve process or unit operating safety.  All suggestions are reviewed and, if a probable safety improvement can be expected, the suggestion is implemented.  The following projects or programs are currently being installed or re-evaluated to improve safety of the Propylene Splitter III facility:\n\n*  The accident prevention program / Process Safety Management system is currently under4going a complete review and update of all fourteen sections of the program."
