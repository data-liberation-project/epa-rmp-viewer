A Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) system controls oxides of \r\nnitrogen (NOx).  The SCR system is capable of reducing NOx emissions by approximately 6,000 \r\ntons per year during the ozone season (May through September).  This NOx reduction provides a \r\nsubstantial benefit to the ambient air quality in terms of reduced ground level ozone \r\nconcentrations.  An integral part of the SCR system is the storage and on-site transfer of \r\nanhydrous ammonia used as a reagent that reduces NOx emissions.  Anhydrous ammonia is \r\nregulated under U.S. EPA's Accident Release Prevention Program (40 CFR Part 68). Because \r\nanhydrous ammonia will be present in the SCR process in quantities well in excess of the 10,000 \r\nlb. threshold, the SCR process is subject to ARP regulations. \r\nThe Homer City generating station also utilizes relatively small quantities of anhydrous ammonia \r\nin the electrostatic precipitators (ESP) to enhance the control of particula"

The ESP \r\nprocess is capable of being supplied anhydrous ammonia from the main anhydrous storage tanks \r\nand therefore is subject to the risk management regulation.  \r\nAnhydrous ammonia is a colorless liquid or gas which is readily detectable by its extremely \r\npungent odor.  In sufficient concentrations, anhydrous ammonia is an eye, skin, and/or \r\ninhalation irritant.  For this reason, anhydrous ammonia is regulated under the Occupational \r\nSafety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management Standard at 29 CFR \r\nPart 1910.119 and the U.S. EPA risk management rule at 40 CFR Part 68.\r\nFor ammonia processes, the threshold quantity for coverage under 40 CFR Part 68 is 10,000 \r\nlbs.  Anhydrous ammonia is delivered to the site via tank truck and stored above-ground in \r\nthree horizontally oriented cylindrical pressure vessels, with a combined storage capacity of \r\n663,000 lbs.  Shipping and transfer of ammonia to the pressure vessels is carried out by trained \r\nqualified personnel provided by the vendor, using standard operating procedures that have \r\nbeen thoroughly reviewed for safety.  The unloading process is monitored from the boiler \r\ncontrol rooms and plant security facility via video cameras.  The procedures minimize routine \r\nrelease of residual ammonia in the transfer hose by purging ammonia from the transfer hose \r\nback into the transport trailer. Ammonia is pumped from the storage area to the SCR area \r\nwhere it is vaporized, mixed with heated air and injected into the flue gas, which is then \r\nimmediately passed through a catalyst material.  The reaction in the presence of the catalyst \r\nreduces the nitrogen oxide (NOx) and ammonia (NH3) mixture to nitrogen (N2) and water vapor \r\n(H2O).  \r\nThe U.S. EPA Risk Management Regulation identifies three levels of requirements for industrial \r\nprocesses.

Because the accident prevention \r\nelements of Program 3 are virtually identical to PSM, compliance with U.S. EPA Risk \r\nManagement regulations also constitutes compliance with PSM. \r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 2-1 Layout of the EME Homer City Generation L.P. Station\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n       \r\n\r\n\r\n3.0  OFF-SITE HAZARDS ASSESSMENT\r\n\r\nFor the purposes of developing and maintaining adequate RMPlans, the U.S. EPA has defined in \r\nits governing rules and guidance a series of modeling methods and assumptions which are to be \r\nutilized as administrative guides for planning purposes.  In order to standardize and simplify to a \r\npractical level the many factors that can potentially occur in an accidental release situation, some \r\nof these assumptions may not take into account the available preventive measures or mitigation \r\nmethods that would diminish or even eliminate the implied risks that are suggested by worst-\r\ncase analyses.  For that reason, both the results for the standardized worst-case defined by the \r\nU.S. EPA methods and an alternative case, which is considered by EME Homer City Generation \r\nL. P. to more realistically represent situations that may possibly, but rarely, occur within the \r\nlifetime of the facility, are presented and described.  \r\nAs noted, the Homer City Generation Station has used anhydrous ammonia in the ESPs since \r\n1998.  No accidental release of ammonia has resulted in reportable on-site injury"

To ensure that mitigation \r\nmeasures and emergency response plans are appropriate, potential release scenarios are \r\nconsidered.  Thus, the sections of the RMPlan which discuss both the worst-case and the \r\nalternative case, believed to be somewhat more probable, are meant to provide the data \r\nnecessary to develop and evaluate possible improvements in the overall safety provided by the \r\nprograms which constitute the EME Homer City Generation L.P. ARP program.   \r\nAs defined by 40 CFR Part 68, a worst-case release of a gas liquefied under pressure is a 10-\r\nminute ground-level release of the entire tank contents, taking into account passive and \r\nadministrative controls that limit the maximum quantity.  The worst-case release scenario for the \r\nHomer City facility is a gaseous release from the anhydrous ammonia storage tank dispersed \r\nunder stable meteorological conditions The possibility of a worst-case type of scenario is \r\nextremely remote and virtually prohibited, given the design of the ammonia storage system and \r\ninspection and maintenance measures that EME Homer City Generation L.P. has taken as part of \r\nits accident prevention program.   The alternative release considers more typical events and \r\naccounts for both passive and active mitigation measures.  \r\nIn accordance with revised Risk Management Plan requirements promulgated on April 9, 2004 \r\nand in deference to the concerns of the Department of Homeland Security, this executive \r\nsummary does not include a description of the release scenarios and their consequences.  \r\nSpecific information regarding the off-site hazards assessment for worst-case and alternative \r\nreleases is included in the RMP data elements.\r\n.\r\n\r\n4.0   ACCIDENT PREVENTION\r\n\r\nThe processes subject to the Risk Management Regulation are also subject to the OSHA PSM \r\nStandard with which the EME Homer City Generation L.P. facility is in compliance.
