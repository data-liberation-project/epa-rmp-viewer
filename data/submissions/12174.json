Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at P-Chem are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Chemical Manufacturing.  We have 2 regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include Ammonia (anhydrous) and Formaldehyde (solution).  Ammonia (anhydrous) is used forNeutralization of acids.  Formaldehyde (solution) is used forMaking of salts.\n\n\n3.    The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equations.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from Production of Phosphonic Acids.  In this scenario 42000 lb. of Ammonia (anhydrous) is released.  The toxic liquid released is assumed to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to evaporate over 10 minutes.  The released quantity has been limited to 100% of the maximum capacity of the source by a system of administrative controls.  At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 6.8 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.1"

      "SummaryText": "4 mg/L.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Ammonia (anhydrous) involves a release from Production of Phosphonic Acids.  The scenario involves the release of 42000 lb. of .  Toxic liquid is assumed to be released to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated after 10 minutes.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L of Ammonia (anhydrous) is 2.2 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Formaldehyde (solution) involves a release from Production of Phosphonic Acids.  The scenario involves the release of 22200 lb. of .  Toxic liquid is assumed to be released to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated after 10 minutes.  Passive mitigation controls such as dike(s) are taken into account to calculate the scenario, having the effect of Stoping fluid release.  The release is also assumed to be controlled by deluge system(s), water curtain(s) and scrubber(s).  These active mitigation systems have the effect of decreasing Air polution chemicly.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.012 mg/L of Formaldehyde (solution) is 0.09 miles.\n\n4.    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.
