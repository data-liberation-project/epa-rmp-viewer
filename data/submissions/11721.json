Non - bulk raw material receipts (drum / carton commodities) are generally received via common carrier.  Facilities for receiving and storage of the more volatile process materials are located outdoors in areas as remote as practical from the main plant processes.  These installations are typically protected and provided with a means of secondary containment (e.g. dikes) in order to minimize hazards resulting from spillage.  The physical transfer of raw materials from transport container to storage and on to the various processing units is accomplished by means of pumps and / or inert gas pressure.\n\nPOLYBUTADIENE AND SOLUTION SBR, reaction products of butadiene and butadiene / styrene respectively, are manufactured in a continuous polymerization process utilizing toluene as a diluent.  Organometallic catalysts are added to initiate the reaction and carry it to the desired level of conversion.  The resulting polymer solution is then pumped through a series of flash distillation units to recover the unreacted butadiene and a significant portion of the solvent, leaving a more viscous solution.\n\nThe majority of the remaining solvent is then separated (stripped) from the polymer using a steam distillation process.  This occurs by bringing the polymerized rubber into contact with hot water and steam.  Stripped vapors arising form this operation are condensed and recovered for reuse.  The remaining crumb water slurry is then dewatered, dried, baled, containerized and warehoused. \n\nPBAN, a reaction product of bu"

An emulsifying agent or soap is utilized to facilitate the dispersion of the ingredients in a water medium and a catalyst added to initiate the reaction and accelerate it to completion.  The polymerized emulsion is commonly referred to as latex.  Unreacted compounds are either recovered and returned to the supplier or discharged to the wastewater treatment plant.  The latex is coagulated by the addition of brine and subsequently dried.
