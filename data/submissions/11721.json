We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n      *  A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's Risk Management Plan (RMP)   \n          regulation\n      *  A summary of results from our assessment of the potential offsite consequences from accidental\n          chemical releases\n       *  An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\n       *  A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule\n       *  An overview of our emergency response program\n       *  An overview of planned improvements at our facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases\n           from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment\n       *  The certifications that EPA's RMP rule requires us to provide\n       *  The detailed information (called data elements) about our risk management program\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\nAmerican Synthetic Rubber Corporation is located on a 60.5 acre site in the Southwest section of Jefferson County, Kentucky within the industrial area known as Rubbertown.  Manufacturing operations are conducted on a seven day continuous basis.  We employ approximately 380 individuals who work nominal shift hours of 7:00 a.m. - 3:00 p.m., 3:00 p.m. - 11:00 p.m., or 11:00 p.m. - 7:00 a.m.  Approximately 260 employees are on site weekdays between the hours of 7:00 "

Non - bulk raw material receipts (drum / carton commodities) are generally received via common carrier.  Facilities for receiving and storage of the more volatile process materials are located outdoors in areas as remote as practical from the main plant processes.  These installations are typically protected and provided with a means of secondary containment (e.g. dikes) in order to minimize hazards resulting from spillage.  The physical transfer of raw materials from transport container to storage and on to the various processing units is accomplished by means of pumps and / or inert gas pressure.\n\nPOLYBUTADIENE AND SOLUTION SBR, reaction products of butadiene and butadiene / styrene respectively, are manufactured in a continuous polymerization process utilizing toluene as a diluent.  Organometallic catalysts are added to initiate the reaction and carry it to the desired level of conversion.  The resulting polymer solution is then pumped through a series of flash distillation units to recover the unreacted butadiene and a significant portion of the solvent, leaving a more viscous solution.\n\nThe majority of the remaining solvent is then separated (stripped) from the polymer using a steam distillation process.  This occurs by bringing the polymerized rubber into contact with hot water and steam.  Stripped vapors arising form this operation are condensed and recovered for reuse.  The remaining crumb water slurry is then dewatered, dried, baled, containerized and warehoused. \n\nPBAN, a reaction product of bu"

An emulsifying agent or soap is utilized to facilitate the dispersion of the ingredients in a water medium and a catalyst added to initiate the reaction and accelerate it to completion.  The polymerized emulsion is commonly referred to as latex.  Unreacted compounds are either recovered and returned to the supplier or discharged to the wastewater treatment plant.  The latex is coagulated by the addition of brine and subsequently dried.  Finished product is then transferred to hold tanks pending laboratory analysis and on to storage.\n\nIN OUR PROCESSES, we use the following chemicals that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant off site consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release:\n\n     Toxics:\n\n          Acrylonitrile.
