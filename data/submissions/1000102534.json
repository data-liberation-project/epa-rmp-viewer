(Advario Texas City) operates a marine terminal that stores chemicals including specialty polymers, solvents, intermediates, monomers and industrial products.  Operations occurring at Advario Texas City are marine/overland vessel loading/unloading, storage, transportation, and distribution of chemicals.  U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations presented in Title 40 Code of Federal Regulations Part 68 (40 CFR 68), the Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions, require Advario Texas City to comply with the Risk Management Program (RMP) rule because the quantity of vinyl acetate monomer stored onsite exceed threshold quantities.\n\nThe RMP rule requires a facility to report the unit inventory for each RMP substance that exceeds threshold quantities, along with an EPA-approved chemical release prevention program.  In addition, 40 CFR 68 requires all RMP-covered facilities to update its Risk Management Program Plan (\"RMP Plan\") at certain intervals, among which is the onsite presence of a new chemical in an amount greater than its threshold quantity.  The initial RMP Plan for Advario Texas City was submitted to the EPA in November 2004.  The June 2007 revision included updates to terminology to more clearly reflect operations at Advario Texas City, stylistic and grammatical corrections, and expansions of the assumptions made and techniques employed in the evaluation of release quantities, release rates, and impacts.  The August 2007 revision contains changes and updates that resulted from an EPA RMP inspection in June 2007.  The September 2008 revision contains changes and updates that resulted from the Permit By Rule (\"PBR\") 83949 authorization of three new products that contain isopentane, pentane, and 1 pentene.  This revision contains products to be introduced by a"

      "SummaryText": "recent amendment of TCEQ Air Permit No. 4804 and the potential pending storage of crude oil, which is already authorized by Permit 3284.  As a result of changes authorized by the amendment of Permit 4804, threshold amounts of the flammable substances 1,3-butadiene, ethylene, and 1-butene were added.  However, the pressurized bullet tanks authorized in Permit 4804 to store propylene, 1,3-butadiene, ethylene, and 1-butene no longer exists at the site; therefore, these compounds have been removed.  Also, due to the pending storage of crude oil, the toxic substance hydrogen sulfide was added to the RMP.  Due to revised H2S concentrations in crude oil, it was determined that H2S is <1.0% in the crude oil mixture.  Therefore, per 40 CFR 68.115(b)(1) H2S is not required to be included. \n\nPotential offsite consequences of hypothetical Worst-Case Scenarios (WCS) and Alternative Releases Scenarios (ARS) were conducted using the EPA program RMP*Comp as well as the RMP Guidance for Offsite Consequence Analysis.  Although numerous controls are in place to prevent chemical releases and manage such consequences should an incident occur, no credit for active mitigation measures was taken into account in evaluating the worst case and alternative release scenarios.\n\nAs required by the RMP regulations, worst-case and alternative release scenarios were generated for toxic releases.  Details regarding the worst-case and alternative release scenarios for Advario Texas City are provided in the RMP Plan.\n\nAdvario Texas City currently holds the following RMP-regulated substances above threshold quantities:\n\nRegulated Chemical\tCAS Number\tCharacteristic\tThreshold (lbs)\nVinyl Acetate Monomer\t108-05-4\t\tToxic chemical\t15,000\n\n|================================|\n|KEY OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS|\n|================================|\n\n40 CFR 68 requires all facilities subject to the Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions rule to conduct an Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA) to provide information to"
