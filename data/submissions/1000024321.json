In addition to ensuring that \n\nemployees have the best training in the operation of \n\nprocesses, safety must be the first priority in\n\ndesign, installation, operation, and maintenance of \n\nprocesses.\n\nMaintenance and inspection programs \n\nhelp ensure site integrity.  Site policy is to implement\n\nreasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of\n\nregulated substances. Examples of controls to prevent\n\nreleases include (1) installation of pressure relief valves\n\nto prevent rupture of vessels due to overpressurization, (2)\n\nroutine visual inspection and thickness checks to ensure\n\nvessels and piping are in good condition, (3) using\n\nmaterials of construction that are compatible with the\n\nprocess chemistry, (4) continuous monitoring of vessel pressure\n\nand temperature, and (5) use of carbon and water\n\nscrubbers to remove small amounts of emissions.\n\nShould a release occur, however, trained personnel will\n\nrespond to control and contain the release.  Mitigation\n\nmeasures that have been included in design include\n\ninstallation of isolation valves, fire suppression systems\n\nin areas where flammable chemicals are present and fire\n\nfighting equipment in all process areas, a fully implemented\n\nemergency response plan, appropriate PPE and an alarm system\n\nfor early notification of a release.

Raw materials are received via\n\nrail cars, tank trucks, tote bins, and drums and as a part of  \n\nthe manufacturing processes, the site uses some substances\n\nthat are covered by the Risk Management Program (RMP) rule\n\n(40 CFR 68).  The plant utilizes a combination of good\n\ndesign practices, an accidental release prevention program,\n\nand an emergency response program to ensure the safety of\n\nour employees, the public and the environment.  We are\n\ncommitted to operating our facility in a safe and\n\nresponsible manner.  Following is a brief description of the\n\nfacility and the RMP regulated chemicals at the site.\n\nThe Columbus plant is situated on an 18 acre site.\n\nAdjacent to the plant are an 8 acre property with technical laboratories that\n\nare not currently operational and a 4 acre vacant lot. The site has \n\nfour covered chemicals and is subject to RMP Program Level 3.\n\n\n\nKEY OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS SCENARIOS\n\nEPA's RMP rule (40 CFR 68) requires that companies\n\nprovide information about two types of offsite consequence\n\nanalysis scenarios: worst-case scenarios and alternative\n\nrelease scenarios. There are strict requirements for\n\nchoosing and modeling worst-case release scenarios; as a\n\nresult, these scenarios are often exceedingly conservative\n\nand represent a situation that is quite unlikely to occur.\n\nThe purpose of the alternative release scenarios is to\n\nprovide emergency planners with more information about the\n\nchemicals handled at a site and their relative hazards. Alternative \n\nrelease scenarios are generally more realistic than worst-case\n\nscenarios.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL \n\nSPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe Columbus site takes a systematic, proactive approach to preventing\n\naccidental releases of chemicals.

These documents are kept up\n\nto date, are available to all employees, and address\n\nimportant process parameters such as: (1) operating limits\n\nfor the equipment, (2) design basis and configuration of the\n\nequipment and (3) physical properties and hazards associated\n\nwith each chemical.\n\nChemical information is documented within\n\nMaterial Safety Data Sheets (MSDS's).

This information\n\ntypically includes (1) toxicity information, (2) physical\n\ndata, (3) reactivity and corrosivity data, (4) thermal and\n\nchemical stability data and (5) hazards of mixing substances\n\ntogether. MSDS's are available to all employees as well as\n\ncommunity emergency responders.

Employees who are new to a\n\nprocess are given basic training that includes (1) a general\n\noverview of the process, (2) the properties of the\n\nsubstances used in the process and their associated hazards,\n\nand (3) a detailed review of the operating procedures for\n\nthat process.  Once they have demonstrated their\n\nunderstanding of this initial training, they are paired with\n\nan experienced operator to learn their specific job\n\nfunctions and tasks. After they demonstrate their\n\ncompetence in performing these tasks, they are allowed to\n\nwork independently.\n\nThrough oral reviews, written tests and on-the-job\n\ndemonstration, we ensure that our employees understand the\n\ntraining given to them. Refresher training is performed at\n\na minimum frequency of three (3) years. All training given to an\n\nemployee is documented, along with the means used to verify\n\nthat the training is understood.\n\nMECHANICAL INTEGRITY\n\nThe Columbus plant maintains the mechanical integrity\n\nof our equipment to prevent equipment failures that could\n\nendanger workers, the public, or the environment.  The\n\ninspection and testing program helps identify equipment\n\ndamage or deterioration before the equipment fails.

The management of change system\n\napplies to changes in the chemicals used, process equipment,\n\ntechnology, procedures, and other facility changes.\n\nPRESTART-UP SAFETY REVIEW\n\nWhenever a change occurs that requires updating the\n\nprocess safety information, the Columbus plant performs a\n\nprestart-up safety review. This review ensures that safety\n\nfeatures, procedures, personnel and the equipment are\n\nprepared for service before the process is started or restarted. \n\nA prestart-up safety review will generally include field\n\nverification of new construction and that accident prevention\n\nmeasures are implemented correctly.

Employees are routinely asked to participate in\n\nPHA's, incident investigations, management of change hazard\n\nAnalyses, and all other aspects of the prevention program.\n\nEmployees have access to all information developed as part\n\nof the prevention program and are specifically informed of\n\nany changes that occur in their process areas. The various\n\nways employees are involved in the prevention program are\n\ndocumented in a written plan (ADP-CB-001).\n\nSAFE WORK PRACTICES\n\nThe Columbus plant has established safe work practices\n\nthat ensure the safety of employees.  Examples \n\ninclude (1) hot work permits designed to control\n\nspark or flame producing activities, (2) a permit and\n\nprocedure to control confined space entry, and (3) a\n\nlockout/tagout procedure for isolating energy sources during\n\nmaintenance. These procedures and permits ensure that\n\noperations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\n\n\nCONTRACTORS\n\nThe Columbus plant uses contractors for various\n\nactivities such as maintenance and construction.  All\n\ncontractors are evaluated to ensure that they are well\n\ntrained and able to perform their job function in a safe\n\nmanner.  A contractor's safety record and performance are\n\nreviewed during the selection process. Once a contractor is\n\nselected, the plant provides training and procedures to\n\nensure that contractor employees (1) perform their work in a\n\nsafe manner, (2) are aware of the hazards associated with\n\nthe area in which they will be working, (3) understand the\n\nemergency response procedures, and (4) report any hazards\n\nthey find during their work.

The\n\naudit team systematically evaluates each aspect of the\n\nprevention program, ensuring both compliance with the RMP\n\nrule and effective hazard prevention.

This management system helps prevent hazards\n\nassociated with equipment failures and human error.  In\n\naddition to the prevention program, the Columbus plant has\n\nsafety features built into the design of the facility that\n\nhelp to ensure safe process operation for employees, the\n\npublic, and the environment.  These features may contain or\n\ncontrol a release, detect a release, or reduce the\n\nconsequences of a release. They may also prevent a release\n\nby providing strict design standards for process equipment.\n\nThe following types of safety features are used in various\n\nprocesses in our facility:\n\nRelease detection\n\n- Procedures require that a plant employee be present\n\nduring loading and unloading operations\n\nRelease Containment and Control\n\n- Valves to permit isolation of the process\n\n- Automated notification systems for some process\n\nparameters, (e.g., high level, high pressure)\n\n- Manual shutdown systems located in the control room\n\n- Diked areas designed to contain a release and prevent\n\nits spread\n\n- Pressure relief valves and rupture disks that discharge\n\nsafely to emissions control devices or the atmosphere\n\nRelease Mitigation\n\n- Fire su"
