      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\n\r\nAccidental release prevention and emergency response policies\r\n\r\nAt the Foamex LP Plant in Orange, California, we handle toluene diisocyanate (TDI), which is considered hazardous and regulated by the EPA.  The same properties that make TDI valuable for use at our facility also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in the handling of the substance.  Safety precautions have been implemented to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of our community.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.\r\n\r\nWe are committed to the safety of our employees and the public, and to the preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  Successful implementation of our accidental release prevention program will help ensure that emergencies are unlikely and reduce the likelihood that emergency response procedures will be needed.  Nevertheless, an emergency such as a release of TDI is possible.  We have emergency response procedures to help ensure that accidents will be mitigated properly without undue risk to the public, environment, employees, contractors, or other personnel within the plant.\r\n\r\nDescription of the facility and the regulated substances handled\r\n\r\nThe primary purpose of this facility is to produce flexible polyurethane foam and carpet pad, which is sold to other facilities and used to produce bedding, furniture, carpet pad and a number of other products.  TDI is one of the reactants required to produce polyurethane foam and carpet pad.  TDI is received by rail car and by tank truck, and is stored in outdoor storage tanks.  The maximum quantity of TDI stored in rail cars and in storage tanks at our plant is about 1,200,000 pounds.  The TDI is piped to a mix head or reactor  where it is mixed with other reactants to produce"

The foam is conveyed to cutting stations where it is cut to the  and shape specified by our customers.\r\n\r\nTDI is the only substance handled at our plant that is regulated by EPAA\u00bfs risk management program (RMP) rule.  TDI is covered because the maximum quantity stored onsite exceed EPAA\u00bfs threshold quantity (TQ) of 10,000 pounds.\r\n\r\nOffsite consequence analysis of release scenarios\r\n\r\nAn offsite consequence analysis (OCA) was performed to estimate the potential for an accidental release to affect the public or the environment.  The OCA consists of evaluating worst case release scenarios (WRSs) and alternative release scenarios (ARSs).  We do not expect a worst case release scenario to ever occur.  An ARS represents a release that might occur during the lifetime of a facility like ours.  ARSs help us to work with the local emergency planning committee (LEPC) to improve the community emergency response plan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFoamex LP Orange, California Plant\r\nRMP Executive Summary\r\nJune 11, 2004\r\nPage 2\r\n\r\nThe main objective of performing the OCA is to determine the distance at which certain effects might occur to the public because of an accidental release (called the endpoint distance).  The following effects could occur at the endpoint distance:\r\n\r\nA\u00bf\tMost people at the endpoint distance of a TDI release would be able to walk away from the exposure without any long-term health consequences, although some short-term consequences (e.g., strong eye or throat irritation) are likely.  Some people who are particularly susceptible to the released substance could be incapacitated.\r\n\r\nWorst case release scenarios.  Catastrophic failure of a TDI rail car, having a capacity of 200,000 lbs. TDI, would be a worst case release for a toxic substance because a TDI rail car is the largest non-bermed outdoor TDI container at the plant.  The TDI vendors limit the quantity of TDI loaded into a railcar to 192,000 lbs. maximum to allow space for"

      "SummaryText": "thermal expansion during possible heating of the TDI.  During cold weather, we pre-heat the TDI to a maximum temperature of  95 A\u00b0F to facilitate unloading and prevent TDI solidification.  During hot weather, the TDI temperature could reach the maximum ambient temperature of 100 A\u00b0F.  Because a release at a higher temperature will result in the greatest endpoint distance, we assumed the release would occur at 100 A\u00b0F.  We also assumed that the entire contents of the railcar would be released as a liquid, form a pool that would spread to cover an area of approximately 80,000 ft2 with a depth of about 0.4 inches (1 cm), and evaporate to form a cloud that would disperse downwind.  Refined dispersion modeling predicts a distance of 483 ft. from the rail car to the TDI toxic endpoint concentration of 0.98 ppm (0.007 mg/L).\r\n\r\nAlternate Release Scenarios.  Rupture of the transfer line from the railcar-unloading pump to the TDI storage tank would release TDI to the ground at the standard pump rate of 610 lb/min.  We assumed that the release would continue for the 15  minutes required for an employee to stop the pump using remote emergency shutdown controls.  The resulting pool would spread to cover an area of approximately 3660 ft2 with a depth of 0.4 inches and evaporate to form a cloud that would disperse downwind.  Refined dispersion modeling predicts a distance of less than 36 ft. from the pool to the TDI toxic endpoint concentration of 0.98 ppm.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe general accidental release prevention program and specific prevention steps\r\n\r\nThe plant has implemented programs and procedures that comply with EPAA\u00bfs Level 2 Accidental Release Prevention Program Rule.  Our facility qualifies for Level 2 coverage because (1) our worst case release scenarios for TDI can impact persons across the property boundary of the nearest public receptor, and (2) TDI is not a substance covered by OSHAA\u00bfs process safety management standard (PSM).
