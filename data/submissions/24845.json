It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal, State, and local regulations. If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to immediately notify the Nashua Fire Department (via a 911 call) and request that it respond to the emergency. Incidental to the notification to the fire department, a call to the Chickasaw County, Iowa LEPC will be made.\n\nWhile we have planned for an emergency, it is acknowledged that a real emergency will be unexpected and may very well be much different and cannot be ensured to duplicate what may have be planned. In reality, the situation that develops may not happen in the manner in which it has been planned. In that event, what may have been planned will serve only as a guideline to follow.\n\nThe Emergency Action Plan for this facility describes certain procedures that are intended to minimize the hazards associated with human health and the environment from fires, explosions, the sudden and unexpected release of chemicals (i.e., Anhydrous Ammonia), tornadoes, bomb threats or other accidents or acts of God which might occur on our premises.\n\nThe primary emergency coordinator for the Nashua, Iowa location is Jon Larsen, location  manager. His work and 24-hour emergency response telephone numbers are provided in the Registration Section of this document.

The anhydrous ammonia that is stored at  this facility is distributed to agricultural crop producers in the surrounding area who utilize the anhydrous ammonia for crop nutrient purposes. \n\nThe system consists of one (1) 30,000-gallon storage tank with associated piping, valves, liquid pump(s), and other miscellaneous equipment. The anhydrous ammonia plant is only operated on a seasonal basis (Spring and Fall). Full-time equivalent employee numbers were computed on that basis. At a maximum, the plant operates a total of three months (1/4 of the year). The FTEs for this company location is two (2).\n\nTHE WORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS:\n\nThe worst-case scenario is the failure of the one (1) 30,000-gallon storage tank when filled to the greatest amount allowed (85% of capacity), resulting in the release of the total volume in a gaseous (hazardous ammonia vapor cloud) form. According to EPA's RMP*Comp Program (Version 1.06), the distance to the endpoint is 4.4 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario involves the transport delivery vehicle pulling away from the intake lines into the storage plant without disconnecting the transfer hoses. The resulting release, according to EPA's RMP*Comp Program has a distance to endpoint of 0.1 miles.\n\nA Liquefied Petroleum Gas (Propane) storage vessel is located on the same property as the anhydrous ammonia plant in Nashua. The existence of the propane storage vessel is included in the Executive Sum"

An evacuation plan is in place.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS:\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable State and local codes and regulations. The anhydrous ammonia system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with ANSI Standard K-61.1-1995 and State law. \n\nIn addition the company has specific operating procedures in place intended to minimize the potential for an accidental (and potentially catastrophic) release of anhydrous ammonia. Finally, Farmers Cooperative Elevator Company has extended to the Nashua Fire Department the opportunity to visit our anhydrous ammonia plant, to participate in mock emergency simulation training, and to avail themselves of specific anhydrous ammonia health hazard information and training provided by the company.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\n\nFarmers Cooperative Elevator Company, Nashua, Iowa has not experienced any  accidental release involving anhydrous ammonia in the last five years  that caused death, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations or shelterings in place.\n\nTHE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving our anhydrous ammonia system, it is the policy of Farmers Cooperative Elevator Company to immediately notify the Nashua Fire Department and the Chickasaw County, Iowa LEPC to request that they respond to the emergency. In the unlikely event that the Nashua Fire Department is unable to adequately respond to an emergency at our Nashua location, the Volunteer Fire Department with whom Nashua has a reciprocal agreement will be summoned.
