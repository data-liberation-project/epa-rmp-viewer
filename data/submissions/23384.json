We have available self-contained breathing apparatus in case of an emergency spill or other release of liquid and vapor.  The following considerations are taken in the the case of Hydrofluoric Acid.\n\n1a. In a Worst Case Scenario (such as the bursting of a drum and releasing its contents), emergency services (such as the fire department) would be informed. Unnecessary personnel would leave the area to a distance of 1.00 miles. Other facilities would be informed within this distance, and appropriate personal protective equipment (including self-contained breathing apparatus) would be put on trained personnel, the spill would be contained by diking the spill area, and put into a salvage container for disposal.
