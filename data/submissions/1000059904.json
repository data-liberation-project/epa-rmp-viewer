A compilation of written process safety information was used in conducting the process hazard analysis (PHA). The process safety information included information pertaining to the hazards of Isobutane, information pertaining to the technology of the Isobutane system, and information pertaining to the equipment utilized in the Isobutane system. The PHA was conducted using the methodology specified in 40 CFR 68.67 (What IF). A system has been established to promptly address the findings from the methodology used. The operating procedures will be consistent with the process safety information and address steps for each operating phase, operating limitations, safety systems and their functions. Training for employees associated with the Isobutane system will be provided along with the required refresher training. A preventative maintenance program is utilized to ensure ongoing mechanical integrity of the Isobutane system. Proposed changes to the Isobutane receiving, storage , delivery, and handling and production systems are evaluated and approved before implemented. A Pre-start-up Safety Review is conducted to ensure that plant personnel and process equipment are ready to safely start and maintain process operations. RMP Compliance Audits will be conducted at least every three (3) years to verify that procedures are adequate and are being followed. Any incident involving the Isobutane system and equipment will be investigated. The facility will consult with affected employees on the conduct and development of the elements of the management of the Isobutane process. Hot work permits are issued for hot work operations conducted near or on the Isobutane system. Information regarding contract owner or operator's safety performances will be obtained and evaluated prior to selection of the contractor.",

Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nPregis, LLC (Pregis) is a specialty foam manufacturing facility which produces polyethylene (PE) foam, and structural polystyrene (SPS) Foam located in Tupelo, Mississippi. The PE foam manufacturing process also includes a laminated PE foam process. A Title V Permit Application renewal was submitted to Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality in July 2016.\n\n\n\nThe EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) is part of the Clean Air Act and applies to processes storing a specified chemical above a threshold quantity. The chemicals and threshold quantities are specified in Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 68. One such chemical is isobutane which is used as a blowing agent in the manufacturing process and is stored in excess of the threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds.\n\n\n\nPolyethylene foam or \"PE\" foam is a plastic product made of polyethylene resin that is mixed with reclaimed product and additives, extrusion of the mixed resin through a highly specialized extruder; adding a liquid blowing agent (Isobutane), then cooling the material and forcing it through a die. The finished product is produced in variety of colors, thicknesses, and densities. The Isobutane is stored in three (3) storage tanks located in the tank farm.  The Isobutane Storage Tanks include one (1) 7,000) gallon and two (2) 6,000-gallon storage tanks with a combined maximum storage capacity of 19,000 gallons. The facility maintains administrative controls that allow the tanks to be filled to 80% of capacity which equates to 15,200 gallons or 71,280 pounds of Isobutane.\n\n\n\nAfter reviewing the facility operations and the RMP regulations, it was determined that the entire facility is considered one process. Based on the facility processes and applicable regulations, it was determined that the facility is subject to Program 3 of the RMP regulations.\n\n\n\nB.

      "SummaryText": "s\n\nPregis is committed to protecting facility personnel, the public, and the environment from any workplace and accidental release hazards. An appropriate response to releases of Isobutane is in the written Risk Management Program. Safety, environmental, and risk management programs are fully implemented and coordinated with community emergency responders for emergency planning and response. \n\n\n\nC. Hazard Assessment\n\nThe RMP requires the Pregis to evaluate the potential maximum potentially affected area for accidents involving the Isobutane for worst case release scenario and an alternative scenario.\n\nThe worst case release is highly improbable since it involves the combination of a certain set of conditions for a large release of the chemical without any employee intervention.  Because the assumptions required for the worst-case analysis are very conservative, the results likely will be very conservative. The endpoints specified for regulated flammable substances are intended to be protective of the general public. The distance to the endpoint estimated under worst-case conditions should not be considered an area in which the public would likely be in danger; instead, it is intended to provide an estimate of the maximum possible area that might be affected in the unlikely event of catastrophic accident. EPA intends the estimated distances to provide a basis for discussion among the regulated community, emergency responders, and the public, rather a basis for any specific actions.\n\n\n\nA release from the 7,000-gallon Isobutane storage tank has been identified as the worst-case release and was considered in the hazard assessment. The maximum storage capacity of 7,000 gallons of Isobutane equates to approximately 32,833 lbs of Isobutane. Facility administrative controls allow the tank to be filled to 80% of capacity. The tank is located within a secondary containment area which would fully contain a spill from the tank. Thereby reducing the evaporation rate of the spill"

The impact distance from the RMPcomp Model results in an impact distance of 0.3 miles. The impact distance extends beyond the facility property.\n\n\n\nThe alternative scenario is an event more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario is more realistic accident scenario.  Pregis has determined that appropriate alternative scenario for the facility is process piping release from the process line carrying Isobutane from the tank to the pump room. The leak would release approximately 1066 lbs. of Isobutane. The RMPcomp Model estimates a distance to the endpoint of 0.05 mile the alternative release scenario.\n\n\n\nD. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nProcess Safety Information: Pregis will complete a compilation of written safety information to be used in conducting the process hazard analysis (PHA). The PHA will be conducted using the process safety information gathered in order to identify and understand the hazards posed by the Isobutane System. The PHA will be conducted using the process safety information in order to identify and understand the hazards posed by the Isobutane system.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis: Pregis will update and revalidate the PHA as necessary and at least every five (5) years. The PHA was conducted using  the \"What IF\" methodology, which is one of the methodologies specified in 40 CFR 68.67, and was performed by a team with expertise in engineering and process operations, including one member who has expertise in the Isobutane system and a member knowledgeable in the specified PHA methodology.

These written operating procedures will be consistent with the process safety information for each operating phase, operating limitations, safety and health considerations, safety systems and their functions. The operating procedures will be readily accessible to employees who work in or maintain the Isobutane system. These operating procedures will be reviewed as often as necessary to assure that they reflect current operating practice.

This training will include an overview of the process and operating procedures as outlined in 40 CFR 68.67. Refresher training is provided every three (3) years or more often as necessary. Pregis documents and maintains records of employee training, and the means used to verify that the employee understood the training.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity: Pregis will develop a written preventive maintenance program to maintain the on-going integrity of the equipment used in the Isobutane system (i.e., storage tanks, pumps, piping systems, etc); additionally, inspections, testing, equipment deficiencies, and quality assurance are addressed.\n\nEach person who has responsibilities to perform maintenance on the Isobutane system components receives training at least every three (3) years or more often if necessary.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change: Pregis wil"
