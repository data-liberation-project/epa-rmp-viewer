An appropriate response to releases of Isobutane is in the written Risk Management Program. Safety, environmental, and risk management programs are fully implemented and coordinated with community emergency responders for emergency planning and response. \r\n\r\nC. Hazard Assessment\r\nThe RMP requires the Pregis to evaluate the potential maximum potentially affected area for accidents involving the Isobutane for worst case release scenario and an alternative scenario.\r\nThe worst case release is highly improbable since it involves the combination of a certain set of conditions for a large release of the chemical without any employee intervention.  Because the assumptions required for the worst-case analysis are very conservative, the results likely will be very conservative. The endpoints specified for regulated flammable substances are intended to be protective of the general public. The distance to the endpoint estimated under worst-case conditions should not be considered an area in which the public would likely be in danger; instead, it is intended to provide an estimate of the maximum possible area that might be affected in the unlikely event of catastrophic accident. EPA intends the estimated distances to provide a basis for discussion among the regulated community, emergency responders, and the public, rather a basis for any specific actions.\r\n\r\nA release from the 7,000-gallon Isobutane storage tank has been identified as the worst-case release and was considered in the hazard assessment. The maximum storage capacity of 7,000 gallons of Isobutane equates to approximately 32,833 lbs of Isobutane. Facility administrative controls allow the tank to be filled to 80% of capacity. The tank is located within a secondary containment area which would fully contain a spill from the tank. Thereby reducing the evaporation rate of the spill"

If a change results in the change in the process safety information, operation procedures, or practices, they will be updated accordingly.\r\n\r\nPre-Startup Safety Review: Pregis will perform a Pre-Startup Safety Review according to 40 CFR 68.67 when the modification is significant enough to require a change in the process safety information, equipment, operating procedures or practices.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits: Pregis will certify that they have evaluated compliance with the provisions of 40 CFR, Part 68 every three (3) years. The compliance audit will be conducted by at least knowledgeable in the Isobutane system. A report of the findings of the audit will be developed.

Pregis has determined that appropriate alternative scenario for the facility is process piping release from the process line carrying Isobutane from the tank to the pump room.

Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\r\nPregis, LLC (Pregis) is a specialty foam manufacturing facility which produces polyethylene (PE) foam, and structural polystyrene (SPS) Foam located in Tupelo, Mississippi. The PE foam manufacturing process also includes a laminated PE foam process. A Title V Permit Application renewal was submitted to Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality in July 2016.\r\n\r\nThe EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) is part of the Clean Air Act and applies to processes storing a specified chemical above a threshold quantity. The chemicals and threshold quantities are specified in Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 68. One such chemical is isobutane which is used as a blowing agent in the manufacturing process and is stored in excess of the threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds.\r\n\r\nPolyethylene foam or PE foam is a plastic product made of polyethylene resin that is mixed with reclaimed product and additives, extrusion of the mixed resin through a highly specialized extruder; adding a liquid blowing agent (Isobutane), then cooling the material and forcing it through a die. The finished product is produced in variety of colors, thicknesses, and densities. The Isobutane is stored in three (3) storage tanks located in the tank farm.  The Isobutane Storage Tanks include one (1) 7,000) gallon and two (2) 6,000-gallon storage tanks with a combined maximum storage capacity of 19,000 gallons. The facility maintains administrative controls that allow the tanks to be filled to 80% of capacity which equates to 15,200 gallons or 71,280 pounds of Isobutane.\r\n\r\nAfter reviewing the facility operations and the RMP regulations, it was determined that the entire facility is considered one process. Based on the facility processes and applicable regulations, it was determined that the facility is subject to Program 3 of the RMP regulations.\r\n\r\nB.
