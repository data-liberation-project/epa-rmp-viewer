The facility has an active safety program covering both employees and contract workers. This program encompasses promotion of safe work practices to prevent personal accidents, and incidents that would adversely affect the community. The Weldon Plant recognizes their commitment to accident prevention through continuing programs including personnel training. Consideration is also given to safety in the design, installation, and operation of all operating units and modifications to the plant. The safety commitment is also carried forth as evidenced by an aggressive maintenance program. Reasonable controls have been implemented to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. In the unlikely event that a release does occur, arrangements have been made within the local community to provide response and control of any catastrophic releases. Passive mitigation, such as vents, is present at the plant to contain any liquid spills that may occur. The plant is also equipped with a flare, and a low pressure shutdown that shuts down the compressors in the event of an emergency.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Weldon Gas Plant is located approximately three miles east of Weldon, Texas (FM 230) on County Road 3575. The Plant neither uses, nor stores any regulated toxic substance above RMP threshold quantities (40 cfr 68.130). Inherent with the operation of a gas processing plant, the Weldon facility processes and stores regulated flammable substances above the threshold quantity. These flammable substances are addressed through"

The worst-case scenario for the Weldon Plant begins with the catastrophic vessel failure of one 30,000-gallon natural gas liquids product storage tank. Due to the close proximity of this tank with two 30,000-gallon and one 20,000 gallon natural gas liquid product storage tanks, the worst-case scenario includes the simultaneous release of the capacity contents of each tank, in compliance with the Risk Management Plan Rule guidelines. The result would be the release of 407,000 pounds of natural gas liquids product as a Vapor Cloud Explosion. No credit for passive mitigation has been taken when evaluating the worst-case scenario. The distance to the overpressure endpoint of one pound per square inch is 0.6 mile. This distance was derived from tables provided in RMP guidance documents.  A more refined estimate was made using the RMP*COMP program developed by the Computer Aided Management of Emergency Operations Team of the Hazardous Materials Response and Assessment Division, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration of the U.S. Department of Commerce, and the Chemical Emergency Prevention and Preparedness Office of the EPA. In reality, it is highly unlikely that one tank would be over pressured causing a catastrophic release, which would then affect the subsequent tanks. The modeling results show a distance to a 0.4 mile radius in the event of a catastrophic release from one of the 30,000-gallon tanks. No credit has been taken for the manual or automatic shutdown emergency controls active at the facility.\n\nThe a"

      "SummaryText": "lternative-case scenario is a release from one 30,000-gallon natural gas liquids storage tank over a ten-minute period. The causes of the release considered are from a split in a transfer hose, or a sudden hose uncoupling; process vessel or pump release due to cracks, seal failure or drain, bleed or plug failure; or from a vessel overpressure and venting through relief valves or rupture disks. Each event is considered to last for ten-minutes until plant operators can isolate the release. The distance to the overpressure endpoint of one pound per square inch is 0.1 mile. This is considered to be a more realistic radius of exposure. It is assumed the release is directly to the environment. The Plant has an emergency flare to which process relief valves discharge to capture and incinerate episodic releases.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe following is a summary of the Accident Prevention Program in place at the Weldon Gas Plant.  As the plant is not normally manned, but is serviced by contractors on an \"as needed\" basis, the facility is not regulated by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard.  However, the RMP prevention program has been developed to be generally consistent with the OSHA PSM standard.   \n\nEMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION\n\nThe Weldon Plant requires employee participation in process safety management and accident prevention for the protection of people and the environment. Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of the process hazard analysis team. They are also active participants as facility safety and training meetings. Employees have access to all information created as part of the plant's accident prevention program. Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in a participation plan that is maintained at the Universal Oilfield "

Each employee is fully trained, initially and with refresher sessions, so that they are fully aware of the safety considerations of their job.\n\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION\n\nThe Weldon Plant maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the plant processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. All employees at the plant are active in the development and maintenance of up-to-date process safety information. Chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs). This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known concerns. For specific process areas, the gas plant has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters, such as temperature, level, and composition. The plant ensures that each process is maintained within approved limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems, such as automated shutdown systems.\n\nThe plant also maintains technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nPROCESS SAFETY ANALYSIS\n\nThe Weldon Plant has a "

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe plant uses a thorough hazard analysis to perform \"What If?\" evaluations. These analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to corporate management for resolution. Implementation of mitigation options in response to \"What If?\"  findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team. This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention. All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained at the plant.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating. The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained. Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\nOPERATING PROCEDURES\n\nThe Weldon Refrigeration Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, including (1) unit startup, (2) normal o"

The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\n\nIn addition, the plant maintains documentation that provides guidance as to how to respond to upper or lower limit exceedances for specific process or equipment parameters. This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks. \n\nTRAINING\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Weldon Plant has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process. New employees receive basic training in gas plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate, through tests, and skills demonstration, having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. Refresher training is conducted at least every three years. All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nCONTRACTORS\n\nThe Weldon Plant uses contractors as its routine work force during periods of routine and increased maintenance activities.

This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work. Weldon Plant personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\nPRE-STARTUP SAFETY REVIEWS\n\nThe Weldon Plant conducts a Pre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR) for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information. The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service. This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready. The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness. A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that Accident Prevention Program requirements are properly implemented.\n\nMECHANICAL INTEGRITY \n\nThe Weldon Plant has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.

Written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training. Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended and to verify that / equipment is within acceptable limits, such as adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels. If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service, or a management of change team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\n\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance. The Weldon Plant incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs. This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\nSAFE WORK PRACTICES\n\nThe Weldon Plant has implemented safe work practices to help ensure worker and process safety. Examples of these include: (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous substances before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities, such as hot work, and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate preca"

These, and many other procedures, along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\nMANAGEMENT OF CHANGE\n\nThe Weldon Plant has a comprehensive system to manage changes to all covered processes. This plant is run cooperatively by multiple parties with process equipment being interconnected for normal plant operations.  Therefore a diligent effort must be made by all responsible parties to ensure proper notification that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology, process operating conditions, procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented. Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards, and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change. Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes. In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training concerning the change. \n\nINCIDENT INVESTIGATION\n\nThe Weldon Plant has had no incidents, to date, that would require an accident investigation. However, there is a system in place to investigate any incident that could result, or could reasonably result in, a fire/explosion, flammable gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury. The goal of an investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.
