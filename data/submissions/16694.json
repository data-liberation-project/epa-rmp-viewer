      "SummaryText": "Stratford Growers Inc. is a cooperative cotton gin that also sells anhydrous ammonia to grower members as fertilizer for their crops.  This facility consists of one 30,000 gallon tank with associated loading and unloading pump. piping, load hoses, valves and other miscellaneous equipment.  This tank is in a cyclone fenced compound and gates are locked on non-business hours and lights are on automatic when dark.\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's Accident Prevention Rule and all applicable state (Cal-OSHA) and local regulations and codes.   The anhydrous ammonia system is designed, installed and maintained in accordance to California Standards Title 8.\n\nOur worst case scenario is failure of the 30,000 gallon tank, when filled to 85%, calculated to 131,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, causing a toxic spill into the atmosphere.   The estimated distance to toxic end point is 6.9 miles, which circles and estimated residential population of 1805 and two (2) elementary schools.  The nearest school is approximately two (2) miles away and the farthest is approximately five (5) miles .  The nearest residents is approxiamately .4 miles.\n\nThis facility never had an accident involving anyhdrous ammonia that caused death, injuries, property or environmental damage.\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving our anhydrous ammonia system it is our policy to notify the Kings County Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.  We have discussed this policy with the local department located in Stratford, approximately 1 1/2 miles from this facility.  Members of the fire department have inspected the site on a regular basis.\n\nSafety meetings are conducted on a regular basis when product is being moved.  Only authorized, trained personel are to handle, transfer, load, etc. anhydrous ammonia."
