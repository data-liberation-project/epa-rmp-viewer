              "Description": "The chlorine car is staged at the chlorination process and is used as a feed tank.  The chlorine car (irrespective of the location within the plant) is also subject to OSHA PSM Standard (29 CFR 1910.119).  A detailed internal report was prepared in July 1998 which contains a demonstration of compliance with all elements of the PSM Standard.  Because the elements in Prevention Program 3 correspond to the elements covered by the PSM Standard, the internal report (referenced above) is the basis for most (if not all) responses provided in this section of the Risk Management Plan.  Thus, theinternal report referenced above serves as a surrogate for the Prevention Program 3 requirements under 40 CFR 68 for the subject process at BSEP.\n\nSome important notes are provided on the RMP as follows:\n\nProcess Hazards Analysis:  A process hazards analysis conducted in July 1998 concluded that no changes are necessary.  However, because a repsonse has been provided for Item 7.4a, leaving the item 7.4c blank is not allowed by the RMP*Submit Program.  Thus, based on a suggestion given by Ms. Karen Shanahan (EPA), the response given for item 7.4c is the same as the response given for item 7.4a, suggesting that no changes were recommended by the PHA.\n\nTraining:  BSEP is a nuclear facility.  Therefore, general employee training is an ongoing process at BSEP.  Training requirements include general and specific training (e.g., response team training).  These procedures are reviewed periodically and individual elements are updated as needed.\n\nContractor Safety:  The procedures for contractor safety at BSEP require all personnel (including contractor personnel) to undergo training given by BSEP.  Thus, the contract owner or operator's responsibiltiies summarized in 40 CFR 68.87(c) are transferred to BSEP thus ensuring more effective control over contractor safety issues.\n\nManagement of Change:  As a nuclear power plant, BSEP is subject to stringent regulations enforced by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC).  Specifically, beginning from the time of commissioning itself, BSEP was required to have procedures for management of change, specified in 10 CFR 50 regulations.  Thus, BSEP developed procedures for management of change prior to commissioning the plant in 1973.\n\n\nContractor Safety Performance Evaluation:  AT BSEP, typically, contract help is not used for maintenance activities associated with the chlorination process (i.e., the program 3 process covered by this RMP).  Therefore, it has not been necessary to evaluate contractor safety performance.  However, BSEP has evaluated contractor safety performance for other activities (not covered by 40 CFR 68) at the Plant.",

A detailed internal report was prepared in July 1998 which contains a demonstration of compliance with all elements of the PSM Standard.  Because the elements in Prevention Program 3 correspond to the elements covered by the PSM Standard, the internal report (referenced above) is the basis for most (if not all) responses provided in this section of the Risk Management Plan.  Thus, the internal report referenced above serves as a surrogate for the Prevention Program 3 requirements under 40 CFR 68 for the subject process at BSEP.\n\nSome important notes are provided on the RMP as follows:\n\nProcess Hazards Analysis:  A process hazards analysis conducted in July 1998 concluded that no changes are necessary.  However, because a repsonse has been provided for Item 7.4a, leaving the item 7.4c blank is not allowed by the RMP*Submit Program.  Thus, based on a suggestion given by Ms. Karen Shanahan (EPA), the response given for item 7.4c is the same as the response given for item 7.4a, suggesting that no changes were recommended by the PHA.\n\nTraining:  BSEP is a nuclear facility.  Therefore, general employee training is an ongoing process at BSEP.  Training requirements include general and specific training (e.g., response team training).  These procedures are reviewed periodically and individual elements are updated as needed.\n\nContractor Safety:  The procedures for contractor safety at BSEP require all personnel (including contractor personnel) to undergo training given by BSEP.  Thus, the contract owner or operator's responsibiltiies summarized in 40 CFR 68.87(c) are transferred to BSEP thus ensuring more effective control over contractor safety issues.",

      "SummaryText": "Brunswick Steam Electric Plant (BSEP), located in Brunswick County, produces electric power for retail distribution.  The plant operates two nuclear reactors for power generation.  The heat from the nuclear reactors is used to generate steam which drives the turbines.  Water which is used for cooling is treated with chlorine.  Chlorine is stored in a fenced-in section adjacent to the service water building.  Other components of the water treatment system are:  evaporators (5), chlorinators (5), and injectors (5).\n\nThere are three locations at BSEP where chlorine is stored on site in railcars above the regulated threshold quantity:\n\n1.  A single chlorine railcar is staged at the chlorination process and is used as a feed tank.\n\n2.  One or more chlorine cars are stored on a rail spur behind the warehouse several hundred yards from the chlorination process.\n\n3.  Railcars are stored for short periods in a locked holding pen near Bethel Church Road.\n\nThe storage of the railcar at the three separate locations constitute three processes since the railcars are not interconnected and are located such that a release at one location would not result in a potential release at another location.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario analysis required by 40 CFR 68.165 was conducted based on Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA) guidance issued by EPA.  The worst-case release scenario is the same for all three railcar locations (i.e., all three processes).  The alternative release scenario analysis (which is also identical for the three railcar locations) also required by 40 CFR 68.165 was conducted based on guidance provided by The Chlorine Institute in Pamphlet 74 (Edition 3, April 1998).  The RMP regulations require that the alternative release scenario analysis be based on actual incidents at the facility.  However,  the BSEP has not experienced a chlorine release which had impacts beyond the property.  Therefore, the guidance issued by The Chlorine Institute has been used for the alte"

      "SummaryText": "rnative release scenario analysis.\n\nBrunwick Steam Electric Plant is subject to regulations enforced by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC).  NRC regulatons require procedures and safe operating practices to minimize health and safety risks (to the employees as well as the public) resulting from exposure to radioactive material as well as other toxic/flammable materials.  With respect to safety inspection performed by an external agency (Item 1.15 of the RMP), as a licensee, BSEP maintains NRC safety requirements.  Consequently, BSEP has developed procedures and safe operating practices for the handling of chlorine at the Plant.  These procedures and safe operating practices have resulted in no accidental release during the past five-year period which resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.  A process hazards analysis (PHA) conducted in July 1998 indicated that no changes were necessary.\n\nThe RMP*Submit program has flagged the latitude and longitude reported in Section 1 of the RMPas not valid.  However, we have checked the latitude and longitude and the values we have reported are correct."
