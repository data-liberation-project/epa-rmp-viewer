O. Box 67, Eustis, NE  69028\n\nRISK MANAGEMENT PLAN - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\nFACILITY POLICY:\n\nThe management and employees operating each of our facilities are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of hazardous materila transported or stored on our locations.  In the event an accidental release should occur, we are prepared to work with our Eustis Fire Company, Emergency Response Personnel and other appropriate authorities deemed applicable depending on the specific incident to best mitigate any release and to minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment\n\nFACILITY INFORMATION:\n\nThe primary activity of our company is NAICS code 422510 \"establishments primarily engaged in operating country or terminal grain elevators however, we are also engaged in providing \"agricultural inputs\" that include the receiving, storage and reloading of Anhydrous Ammonia for delivery to farmers in our area.  The NAICS code we feel most applicable for receiving, storing and reloading is #493130 \"farm product warehousing and storage\".  Although Anhydrous Ammonia is the only product subject to the EPA 'Risk Management Plan at this time, we include crop protectants and petroleum in our planning, training and maintenance programs, however only the Anhydrous Ammonia facilities will be included in this report.\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application to farm fields during the early and fall months.  During the balance of the year little if any product transfer occurs.  At any given time for approximately the month of April, there may be as many as three railcars of anhydrous ammonia on the rail siding, totaling as much as 468,000 additional pounds o"

      "SummaryText": "f Anhydrous Ammonia.  It should be noted that only one railcar will be connected to offloading equipment at a time.\n\nThe facility is operated on an \"as needed\" basis with staff present only during the receiving and reloading of product for delivery. Total annual hours for these needs do not meet the 2,080 hour requirement to qualify as a \"full time employee\" on site, therefore item number 1.11 is zero.  Our facilities have adequate lighting and are inspected at various times of day and night throughout the year.  Time expended for these inspections is not included in our staffing calculation.\n\nThe \"worst-case release scenario\" is considered to be the release of the total contents of our largest Anhydrous Ammonia tank.  The maximum quantity released based on 85% tank capacity as limited by design standards, the distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) miles based on EPA's RMP-COMP Program (Version 1.06), as well as possible public and environmental receptors within the areas having been provided to the County LEPC (Local Emergency Planning Committee) to assist them in their planning.\n\nALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO:\n\nThere has not been an actual release of Anydrous Ammonia during the last 5-years at the site.  We believe the most likely release  would be caused by a break in a transfer hose.  Transfer hoses are protected by manual and self closing excess flow valves so our alternative release scenario is based on the loss of contents from the largest hose used (off loading transportation equipment).  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 0.06 miles (317 feet) rounded to 0.1 mile (528 feet) per instructions by EPA guidance.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PROGRAM:\n\nOur Anhydrous Ammonia accidental release program is based on guidelines found in the American National Standards Institute, Inc. (ANSI) standard K-61.1 \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia; and the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administra"
