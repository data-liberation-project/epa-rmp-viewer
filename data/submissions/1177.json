      "SummaryText": "Ethylene  is transported to Permviro Systems, Inc.'s plant in a tube trailer.  This trailer is leased from Jack B. Kelly, Inc. of Amarillo, Texas.  This trailer consists of nine tubes which are individually valved into a manifold with a master valve to which PSI personnel make the plant connection.  One or more tubes can be opened to the manifold at one time.  This trailer is maintained for our exclusive use for ethylene transporting.   The trailer is tested every five years in accordance with DOT regulations.  We engage the services of Chemical Leeming, Inc. to transport the tube trailer to and from Claymont, Delaware where ethylene is supplied to us by Sun Olin.\n\nDue to the tare weight of the trailer and tractor as well as the maximum pumping pressure permitted by Sun Olin of 1600 psi the net contents of this trailer is generally under 12,000 lbs.  Upon receipt of ethylene in this tube trailer PSI personnel attach its filling line to the trailer and proceed to off-load and repackage ethylene into cylinders.   These cylinders are as follows:\n\nMaterial of construction:                          Valves:                             Net Contents:\n\nAluminum                                                  Brass 350A                     4 lbs.\nAluminum                                                  Brass 350A                     10 lbs.\nSteel                                                         Brass 350A                     38 lbs.\n\nCylinders are filled by pressure differential as long as possible and then when necessary an air driven pump is employed.  Generally the tube trailer is emptied into these individual cylinders within two weeks of delivery to the plant.  As a result the tube trailer has in excess of 10,000 lbs. of ethylene no more than a few days during each calendar year while situated on PSI premises.  During the repackaging process, each line fitting, valve and safety relief is soap-tested on each and every cylinder attachment in order to detect even t"

      "SummaryText": "he smallest possible leak.  All cylinders owned by PSI have the appropriate safety-relief valves.   \n\nAll of PSI's cylinders are hydrostatically tested pursuant to the appropriate DOT regulations every 5 years.  These cylnders are tested by Pye-Barker, Inc. in Marietta, Georgia.  Log sheets are maintained for each cylinder retested.  Each cylinder retested is individually stamped with date of retest.\n\nAfter completion of cylinder filling, each cylinder is closed and test-weighed.  A dust cap is applied to the threaded outlet of each cylinder and the valve cap is screwed on.  Cylinders are immediately placed on specially designed pallets where they are strapped and shrink-wrapped to assure safety and stability inside PSI's warehouse and while being transported to PSI's customers.  The warehouse in which the cylinders are stored generally only has a large number of full cylinders between March and July.\n\nA minimum of two owner-managers are always present during the repackaging/filling operation.  All four owner-managers have ten years of experience in this operation.  The filling operation is carried out in an open-air secured area with a roof covering.  The warehouse and plant is entirely a non-smoking area.  None of the owners or any of the employees of PSI are smokers.  All appropriate areas are equipped with fire extinguishers.  Signage and placards prohibiting any visitors from smoking are posted throughout the plant.\n\nIn PSI's ten years of repackaging/filling ethylene cylinders it has never experienced a spill of any kind aside from minor valve or attachment leakage.  A leak of this type might result in a tenth of a pound of ethylene to escape into the atmosphere.\n\nEthylene has been classified by the EPA as a biopesticide and aside from its flammable properties (in high concentrations) is considered to be a very safe gas.\n\nMaterial Safety Data Sheets, Emergency Response Guidebooks and Flammable Gas placards are provided to the Carrier/Driver with each shipment o"
