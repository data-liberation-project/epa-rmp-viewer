              "Description": "FPL Martin Power Plant Unit 8 stores anhydrous ammonia onsite for control of nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions from Unit 8's four combustion turbines. Ammonia is delivered onsite by tanker truck and is stored in one, above ground, carbon steel pressure vessel. Pressure is maintained through the use of two electrical vaporizers to maintain a minimum pressure of 80 psig.  Maximum pressure is 300 psig. Ammonia vapor is conveyed via pressure to each unit's selective catalytic reduction processes, where it is diluted with air and then injected into the flue gas stream upstream of the catalyst.\n\nFPL contracted with Martin Manatee Power Partners (MMPP) for engineering, construction and startup of the system. FPL Martin Power Plant has now taken care, custody and control of the system. \n\nThe prevention program consists of: \n1) Engineering controls\n2) Establishment of safe standard operating procedures and training\n3) Process Hazard Assessment (PHA) \n4) Establishment of Management of Change Process \n\nEngineering controls include the following:\nEstablishment of maximum fill level\nProviding relief valves\nProviding interlocks to prevent filling the tank if pressure or level is high\nProviding remote emergency stop pushbutton to shut down process\nProviding area sensors for ammonia release detection\n\nStandard Operating Procedures address the following for the SCR and ammonia systems:\nInitial Startup\nUnloading\nEmergency Shutdown and Operation\nNormal Startup, Operation, and Shutdown\nStartup Following a Turnaround or Emergency Shutdown\n\nTraining is tailored to categories of personal involvement and exposure to the anhydrous ammonia.  All employees and unescorted visitors to the plant receive general information regarding anhydrous ammonia hazards, the MSDS, emergency procedures.  Employees are provided the location of relevant documents which are available for review. Personnel directly involved with site safety, ammonia unloading, and facility operations and maintenance receive more detailed information regarding specific operating procedures and check sheets.  \n\nProcess Hazard Analysis was performed with a group of twenty-five people from MMPP, the FPL Manatee Power Plant (another FPL plant that recently began storing anhydrous ammonia for NOx reduction), LaRoche (the ammonia supplier), and Tropicana (a nearby business that stores large quantities of anhydrous ammonia and has extensive experience).  Follow-up sessions were held as items were evaluated and decisions were made regarding actions to be taken as a result of the identified potential hazards.  \n\nFPL has an established management of change process which is used for anhydrous ammonia as well as other systems onsite.",

      "SummaryText": "SYSTEM DESCRIPTION.\n\nThe Martin Expansion Project (Unit 8) provides five additional electrical generating units on the property of the FPL Martin Power Plant.  These five units include four combustion turbine-generators, and one steam turbine-generator.  NOx emissions of the combustion turbines are reduced through the use of selective catalytic reduction.  That process consumes ammonia.  At this site, the ammonia is provided in anhydrous form.\n\nThe anhydrous ammonia is stored in one 20,000 gallon steel storage tank, surrounded by a concrete retaining wall.  Ammonia is delivered by tanker truck in liquid form.  The maximum level to which it is filled is 86%.  In the tank, the ammonia is stored as liquid under pressure.  Two 100% capacity vaporizers are provided to ensure pressure is maintained at lower temperatures.  Pressure will vary from 80 to 300 psig.\n\nAmmonia vapor is transported via pressure to each heat recovery steam generator ammonia injection skid, where the ammonia is diluted with air prior to injection into the flue gas upstream of the catalyst.\n\nOPERATOR ORGANIZATION. \n\nFPL owns and operates the Martin Power Plant, including Unit 8 as of June 2005, Martin-Manatee Power Partners (MMPP) previously operated Unit 8.  MMPP is a limited liability corporation formed by parent companies Zachry Construction Corporation and Black & Veatch Corporation for the purpose of engineering, procuring, and constructing the expansion of the Manatee power plant.  As a part of its contractual obligations to owner FPL, MMPP operated the facility for three months. Under that obligation, MMPP created an RMP Manual and submitted *RMP Submit to EPA in March 2005.   This document replaces that previously created by MMPP.\n\nPREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nFPL has a long-established very high expectation regarding safety and environmental protection.  The following documents have been developed by FPL and are in practice at the Martin Power Plant: \n-  Safe Work Practices Manual and SOPRs\n-  Site "

FPL Group encourages all employees to carry this strong health and safety value beyond the workplace to all of their activities.     \n________________________________________________________________________\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia is covered at this site under the OSHA PSM rule.  Specific to this RMP, the prevention program consists of (1) Engineering Controls, (2) Establishment of safe Standard Operating Procedures and Training, (3) Process Hazard Assessment (PHA), and (4) Establishment of Management of Change Process.  These are described in more detail in the Prevention Program Description.\n\nThe overall approach to minimizing risk of accidental release is based on a foundation of sound engineering design, development of appropriate standard operating procedures, and training for affected employees.  Design has included features such as engineered controls to prevent overfilling of the tank, breakaway valve stations to minimize release should a truck pull away before uncoupling, monitoring stations for detection of accidental releases, and water sprays to help minimize migration of vapor releases.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThis is a new facility with no prior history with anhydrous ammonia.  There have been no accidental releases of ammonia at the time of this filing.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nFPL employees are trained as first responders.  In the event of a large-scale release, site personnel will follow an established emergency response plan which includes notification of FPL management, 911, local emergency responders, and firms that FPL has identified as having the capability and willingness to respond to anhydrous ammonia releases.\n\nLocal emergency personnel have been involved in tr"

Those without a direct involvement in the operations and maintenance of the anhydrous ammonia system have received overview level training?what are the hazards, how can they be identified, and what to do in the event of a release.  Personnel who may have to enter a high concentration area in order to isolate a system with a manual valve, for example, have received 24-hour hazardous materials technician training.  They must remain clean-shaven at the point of SCBA mask contact, and have been instructed in the use of the appropriate protective PPE and SCBA.\n\nFPL considers the delivery of ammonia at the site to be one of the highest risk activities.  Unloading will be done by the ammonia vendor by their qualified personnel.  As an additional safety measure, FPL will be in radio and/or visual contact with the unloading vendor during the unloading operations.  \n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nA PHA process was undertaken as a part of the RMP.
