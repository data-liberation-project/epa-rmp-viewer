Unless otherwise specified, no credit was taken for administrative controls or mitigation measures in evaluating the off-site impact of the scenarios.  \n A)  Regulated Flammable Chemical\nWorst-Case Release Scenario -- \nPropylene:  The worst-case release scenario for a flammable regulated substance assumes catastrophic failure of a storage tank that releases 300,000 pounds of propylene as a gas to the atmosphere, leading to a vapor cloud explosion.  According to the OCA Guidance Table, this release could impact off-site public receptors.  Specific steps to prevent this scenario from occurring, and to mitigate its effects should they occur, include:\n7 Pressure relief valve - This valve relieves excess pressure to avoid tank rupture\n7 Overfill pressure interlock - This interlock automatically shuts down transfers to the tank when high pressure is sensed.\n7 High pressure alarms - This alarm warns operators of a pending high pressure situation in the tank so that appropriate actions can be taken, including shutting down transfers and actuation of the deluge system.\n7 Deluge systems - This is a manually operated water spray system that can suppress a vapor cloud to avoid an explosion\n\nAlternate Release Scenario --\nPropylene:  This scenario assumes the rupture of a propylene column and condensor due to loss of condensor cooling.  This rupture releases  211,000 pounds of propylene as a gas to the atmosphere leading to a vapor cloud explosion.  According to the OCA Guidance Table, this release could impact off-site public receptors. Specific steps to prevent this scenario from occurring, and to mitigate its effects should they occur, include:\n7 Relief valves to the flare - These valves relieve excess propylene column pressure to the plant flare.\n7 Critical interlock on high pressure - This instrument automatically shuts down the propylene column heat source when high pressure is sensed.\n7 Spare cooling water pump"

Key elements include:\nEquipment Design:  Vessels and other process equipment are designed according to recognized industry standards and/or governmental requirements.\nProcess Safety Information: Chemical hazard, process technology, and equipment information is documented, maintained up-to-date, and available to operating personnel.\nProcess Hazard Analysis:  Process hazard analyses are conducted every five years to identify major process hazard scenarios and to recommend corrective action(s) needed to prevent their occurrence.\nEpisodic Risk Management:  Periodic reviews are conducted to identify hazards which could have significant community impact and to recommend corrective action(s) needed to prevent their occurrence.  These reviews utilize advanced quantitative risk assessment techniques.\nOperational Safety Standards:  Design requirements for active and passive mitigation controls used to prevent major process hazards are documented in operational safety standards.\nOperating Procedures:  Operating procedures provide detail on how to safely operate a process and are maintained up-to-date.\nOperator Training/Certification Program:  The plant has a training and testing program which provides operators with the proper skills and knowledge prior to allowing them to independently operate a process.\nTechnical Staff Training and Support:  Trained technical staff employees are available 24 hours a day to support operations.\nMaintenance Procedures:  The plant has specific procedures for maintaining process equipment so that it operates safely.\nMainte"

Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe Union Carbide Cypress Polypropylene Plant is committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes in a safe and responsible manner.  We have implemented a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public, as well to protect the environment.  These programs include both Union Carbide's Responsible CareR requirements and governmental requirements, such as the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) rule, Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard and the Louisiana Chemical Accident Prevention Program.\n\n2. Description of the Facility and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Union Carbide Cypress Polypropylene Plant is a manufacturing facility that annually produces more than 500 million pounds of polypropylene resins.  The material produced  at this facility is sold to over 50 customers in the United States and abroad.  Polypropylene is a type of plastic, which is produced in pellet form and then shipped to our customers, primarily in railroad cars.  The RMP rule requires that if a facility, such as the Cypress Polypropylene Plant, has a specific amount (threshold) or more of any one of 140 toxic and flammable chemicals, the facility must follow the RMP rule requirements for that chemical.  The Union Carbide Cypress Polypropylene Plant has the following RMP-regulated flammable substance - propylene.\n\n\n3. Key Offsite Consequence Analysis Scenarios\n\nEPA\u0012s RMP rule requires that we provide information about the worst-case release scenario(s) and alternative release scenario(s) for our faci"

FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nIn the last five years there has not been an accident or incident involving an EPA RMP chemical at the Union Carbide Cypress Polypropylene Plant that resulted in an on-site death, injury, or property damage; or a known off-site death, injury, evacuation, shelter-in-place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\n6. EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe Cypress Polypropylene Plant maintains a written emergency response program to protect worker and public safety, as well as the environment.  The program consists of procedures for responding to  releases of hazardous substances, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including:\n7 Proper first-aid and medical treatment for exposures\n7 Evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation\n7 Notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs\n7 Post-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements, and\n7 Inspecting, testing, maintaining, and using emergency response equipment.\nThe emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to facility processes. \n\nThe Cypress Polypropylene Plant maintains a trained emergency squad to handle fires, explosions, toxic vapor releases, spills, and medical emergencies.  The plant squad trains and drills with local emergency responders to enhance their skills and tactics for responding to an accidental chemical release.  Critiques are held on drills and actual events.  In addition to the plant emergency squad, St. Charles Parish DEP is notified immediately of the incident.  The DEP determines the community impact and takes the appropriate action to protect the community.  Additional resources are also available the mutual aid organizations, if needed. \n\nThe emergency response progr"
