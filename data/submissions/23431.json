BOX 50\nLAKE PARK, MN  56554\n\nTWIN VALLEY DIVISION\n\nRISK MANAGEMENT PLAN- EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n                                \n1.  THE FACILITY POLICY\n\nThe owners and employees of Triangle Agronomy Services, LLC are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire company, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.  FACILITY INFORMATION\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received and stored in nurse tanks and distributed for direct application.  Anhydrous ammonia is used for crop production nutrients.\n\nThe maximum quantity of ammonia stored would be 88,000 pounds in 20 1,000 gallon nurse tanks filled to 85% capacity.  The maximum quantity handled would be the distribution of 1 nurse tank at 4400 pounds.\n\n3.  THE WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nThe worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of all nurse tanks as a gs over a 10 minute time period.  The maximum quantity released would be 88,000 pounds, which represents the volume of all the nurse tanks at 85% capacity as limited by design standards.  According to TFI Guidance Tables, the distance to endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .96 miles.\n\nThe alternate release scenario for anhydrous ammonia based on the hazard review is a 2 minute release from a break in a 1.5 inch hose.  The distance to esndpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .46 miles.\n\n4.  THE ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe facility has implemented the provision of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\", K-61.1, published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc. and the Standards of the U.S. Occupati"

THE FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have caused any death, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility, nor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\n6.  THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe facility has:\na.  A written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38;\nb.  Provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA)."
