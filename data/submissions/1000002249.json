In fact, the facility has a comprehensive safety program in place establishing many levels of safeguards that are designed to minimize the potential for the release of any hazardous substance and to minimize injuries and damage resulting from the release of a hazardous substance.\n\nDomtar/Nekoosa minimizes the potential for releases of the hazardous substances used at the facility.  When hazardous substances are used at the facility, the equipment is carefully designed, built, and operated to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release.  Industry and government standards are adhered to in design, construction, and operation of the equipment.\n\nDomtar/Nekoosa limits damage from a release, if such a release occurs.  The facility trains workers to respond to upset conditions, reducing the consequences of a release if it occurs.  In addition, the facility will be working with the Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC) to help ensure that injuries and/or environmental damage will not occur in the event that a release does occur.\n\nThe safety programs at Domtar/Nekoosa consist of a number of elements, only some of which are required by the RMP Rule.

Domtar/Nekoosa provides response training for upset conditions to facility personnel, designates an emergency response coordinator to oversee response activities, and coordinates response efforts with the local emergency response organizations.\n\nIn order to effectively implement these policies, the facility has established a management system directed by the General Manager, Wisconsin Operations.\n\n\n1.2\tDescription of Regulated Process / Substance \n\nDomtar/Nekoosa is a pulp and paper facility primarily involved in the manufacture of bleached paper products.  As part of this manufacturing process, the facility produces and stores chlorine dioxide (ClO2) for the use of bleaching pulp. \n\nThe ClO2 solution is stored at a concentration of approximately 1.0-1.4% (weight percent ClO2 in water) in two identical storage tanks, each with a capacity of 90,000 gallons.  The unpressurized, aboveground storage tanks are interconnected and equalize with each other.  The storage tanks are located in the bleach plant area of the facility.  ClO2 gas in solution at this concentration will rapidly off-gas at ambient temperatures.  Therefore, the ClO2 solution in the two tanks is stored at a temperature of approximately 40 to 48 degrees Fahrenheit (\u00c2\u00a2XF).  A concrete wall, capable of providing containment in the event of a catastrophic spill of solution, surrounds the storage tanks.  Passive mitigation is also available in some circumstances when solution is released inside the ClO2 Plant building, in the form of curbing and an acid sewer drain, and the building itself.  The containment area and sewer could contain the release from the"

The two storage tanks at Nekoosa are located inside a concrete containment area, sufficient in size to hold the entire contents of both tanks, if released.  This scenario will consist of an evaporating pool, resulting from the failure of a single 90,000-gallon storage tank, limited in surface area to that of the containment area, 750 square feet.  The predicted impact distance, where concentrations are greater than the toxic endpoint, extends beyond Domtar/Nekoosa facility property.  Accounting for available passive mitigation, the RMP*Comp computer software predicts an impact to a distance of 2.9 miles.  The estimated population within a circle of this radius is 6,200.   Several public receptors are also located within this distance (e.g., several industrial facilities, several public and private elementary schools and high schools, several nursing homes, several churches, several recreational parks, and numerous subdivisions).  There are also several environmental receptors.\n\t\n\tThe alternative release scenario for chlorine dioxide is the rupture of a transfer line at the discharge side of one of four suction pumps used for transferring solution from storage to the bleaching process area.  During normal operations, each of the four pumps is individually capable of transferring solution to bleaching operations.

A review of pump curves and supporting documentation indicate that, at maximum efficiency, these pumps have the potential to run out to 600 gallons-per-minute pumping capacity.  The scenario assumes that the pump operates for a period of 5 minutes before workers detect the release and shut down the pumps and operate the remote shutoff valves on the storage tanks from their operating room.  Detectors and alarms in the pump area would immediately note the presence of ClO2 fumes.  The pumps are contained in a diked area with splash shields and all the spilled solution would be captured within the 80-square foot containment area.  Therefore, the alternative release scenario considered is the release of 3,000 gallons of solution (at 600 gallons-per-minute) containing 350 pounds of pure ClO2, based on a concentration of 1.2% by weight.  The maximum distance to the toxic endpoint for ClO2 for the alternative release scenario is 0.1 mile using the RMP*Comp computer software.

Process Hazard Analysis   Domtar/Nekoosa performs and periodically updates process hazard analyses (PHAs) of the covered processes to help identify process hazards and generate recommendations that might improve the safe operation of the process.  A team composed of personnel with engineering and process operating experience and a team leader with experience in performing process hazard analyses is assembled to analyze the process.  The facility primarily uses the Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) and/or What If / Checklist\u00c2\u00a1\u00c2\u00a8 techniques to perform this analysis.  The PHA team prepares a written report describing the results of the analysis, including recommendations.  Responsibility for resolving the recommendations is assigned to personnel and, when appropriate, changes to enhance the safety of the process are implemented.\n\t\n\t4. Operating Procedures   Domtar/Nekoosa operators, supervisors, and engineers work together to develop and maintain accurate operating procedures to define how tasks related to process operations should be safely performed.  The operating procedures (1) are used to train employees and (2) serve as reference guides for appropriate actions to take during both normal operations and upset operating conditions.  The operating procedures include:\n\t\n\t-\tSteps for safely conducting activities;\n\t\n\t-\tApplicable process safety information, such as safe operating limits and consequences of process deviations; and \n\t\n\t-\tSafety and health considerations, such as chemical hazards, personal protective equipment requirements, and actions to take if exposure to a hazardous substance occurs.\n\t\n\tThe facility personnel develop and maintain operating procedures that cover all phases of the opera"

LLC\u00c2\u00a1\u00c2\u00a6s Nekoosa Mill (\u00c2\u00a1\u00c2\u00a7Domtar\u00c2\u00a1\u00c2\u00a8) is committed to operating in a manner that is safe for its workers, the public, and the environment.  As part of this commitment, Domtar has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the hazardous chemical processes at this facility.  One component of this system is a Risk Management Program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the facility and addresses compliance with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Regulation 40 CFR 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a Risk Management Plan (RM Plan) describing the Risk Management Program for the Nekoosa Mill.  This document is intended to satisfy the RM Plan requirements of the RMP Rule and to provide the public with a description of the Risk Management Program at the facility, with regards to the manufacture, storage, and use of chlorine dioxide at the company\u00c2\u00a1\u00c2\u00a6s pulp bleaching plant.  This plan has been updated, as of June 2009, to satisfy the five-year update requirement of the RMP rules.\n\nThe Risk Management Program at the facility consists of four elements:\n\n1.\tA hazard assessment to help understand (a) the potential off-site consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and (b) accidents that may have occurred during the last five years associated with the use of the substances regulated by the RMP rule (Chlorine Dioxide) - see topic 1.2;\n\t\n2.\tA prevention program to help maintain and safely operate the processes containing more than the threshold quantity of the regulated substances (covered processes) - see topic 1.4;\n\t\n3.\tAn emergency response program to help respond to accidental releases of the regulated substances from the covered processes - see topic 1.6; and \n\t\n4.\tA management system that delineates responsibility for implementing and maintaining the Risk Management Program.\n\nInformation f"

The quantity of ClO2 stored in each tank, based on a maximum concentration of 12 grams per liter (g/l) (1.2%), is 9,013.6 pounds.  Because each tank will contain ClO2 in an amount greater than the threshold quantity (1,000 lbs), the RMP Rule covers both tanks.\n\n\n1.3\tOff-Site Consequence Analysis\n\nDomtar/Nekoosa performed an off-site consequence analysis to estimate the potential for an accidental release of regulated substances to affect the public or the environment.  The off-site consequence analysis consists of evaluating both the worst-case release scenario and an alternative release case scenario.  The facility does not expect a worst-case release scenario to ever occur.  An alternative release scenario represents a release that (1) might occur at a facility like Domtar/Nekoosa and, (2) would result in an off-site consequence if the release occurred.  The alternative release scenario will help the Local Emergency Planning Committee improve the community emergency response plan.\n\nThe main objective of performing the off-site consequence analysis is to determine the distance at which certain effects might occur to the public because of an accidental release (called the   endpoint distance).  At distances less than the endpoint distance, the effects would be greater; at distances greater than the endpoint distance, the effects would be less.\n\nWhen considering the release of a toxic substance such as chlorine dioxide, most people at the endpoint distance would be able to walk away from the exposure without any long-term health consequences, although some short-term consequences (e.g., strong eye or throat irritation) are likely.\n\nThe RMP Rule includes specific requirements for the worst-case and alternative release scenarios that must be reported by Domtar/Nekoosa.  These requirements include:\n\n\u00c2\u00bf\u00c3\u00bf\tOne worst-case release scenario for a toxic substance"
