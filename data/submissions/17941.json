The gases stored are propane and butane.  The facility \nutilizes certain safety precautions to prevent unnecessary on-site human exposure and to \nminimize the potential for any offsite exposure.  These safety precautions include: \n\n- Effectively managing our process operations;\n- Investing in the latest process safety technologies;\n- Training and retraining our personnel;\n- Reviewing our processes for hazards on a continuous basis;\n- Ensuring safety is considered in process design, installation, operations and maintenance.\n\nThe facility maintains a policy to be a good business partner; a safe and conscientious neighbor; \nand to operate in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. \n\nMobil has a standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This is evidenced by our history \nof support and commitment to the community and our high environmental standards.  We are \nproud of our Safety and Environmental Programs and continually strive to be the best.\n\n2.\tDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nMobil\u0012s facility contains the RMP regulated flammable substances of propane and butane.\n\n3.\tHazard Assessment Results\n\nThe RMP rule requires companies to develop chemical release scenarios that estimate the \npotential community impact from an accidental release.  These scenarios are useful for \nemergency planning in case of an accident.  There are two types of scenarios required by the \nEPA.  The worst-case scenario (WCS) is the release of the largest quantity of a regulated \nsubstance.  The alternative release scenario (ARS) allows industries to develop a more realistic \nplanning scenario.\n\nA release of propane is the WCS and ARS for flammable chemicals"
