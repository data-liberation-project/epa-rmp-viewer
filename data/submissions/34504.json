      "SummaryText": "The Monterey Regional Water Pollution Control Agency (Agency) Regional Treatment Plant (RTP) is located northeast of the City of Marina, in Monterey County, California. Major plant construction took place in the 1980s, with the Salinas Valley Reclamation Project (SVRP) was completed in 1998. The Agency's RTP is subject to the state and federal Risk Mangement Plan (RMP) regulations and the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard because it has chlorine and sulfur dioxide in quantities that exceed the respective Threshold Quantities (TQs). It is the Agency's policy to fully comply with the PSM and RMP regulatory requirements.\n \nChlorine is used in the wastewater treatment process for odor control and disinfection, and sulfur dioxide is used for dechlorination. Both chlorine and sulfur dioxide are supplied in one-ton containers. Containers, evaporators and chlorinators/sulfonators are contained inside a building equipped with a scrubber system. The building has capacity to store 32 ton containers of chlorine, and eight tons of sulfur dioxide. Methane from the wastewater digesters is also produced onsite, but the quantity stored is less than the TQs. The maximum quantity of chlorine stored at the RTP at any one time is limited by an administrative procedure to 15 tons. Sulfur dioxide is not stored onsite under normal operations. It is only used when there is a need lower chlorine residuals. When it is used, the number of ton containers onsite is limited to two. \n\nThe quantity of chlorine supplied by each chlorinator can be controlled manually or automatically using a flow control loop controlled by the Programmable Logic Control (PLC) system. The chlorine feed rate is calculated automatically based on process parameters such as reclamation plant process flow rate. When sulfur dioxide is used, the feed rate is controlled by a flow control loop based on chlorine residual. From the chlorine building, pvc piping delivers chlorine and sulfur dioxide under vacuum or in "

Some of the alarms are interlocked to the systems providing important safety functions. Leak detectors are located throughout the chlorine building to monitor ambient air for potential leaks. All ambient detectors trigger a leak alarm and activate the scrubber automatically. The scrubber is installed on a separate pad outside the main building.  The scrubber is interlocked with the chlorine/sulfur dioxide detectors in the building and in the relief vent. Exhaust gases from the chlorine building can be routed to the scrubber during an emergency. \n\nTo comply with the RMP and PSM requirements, the Agency has developed a Risk Management Program and a Process Safety Management Program for chlorine and sulfur dioxide. The Risk Management Program includes an Emergency Response Plan (ERP). Together these programs document the Agency's policies and procedures pertaining to the prevention of accidental releases and emergency response. The Agency has also conducted technical studies for the RTP including Process Hazards Analyses (PHA) and Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA). \n\nIn developing the OCA, the approach taken was to follow the overall guidance provided by EPA in their guidance document for wastewater treatment facilities. The EPA guidance includes look-up tables that were used to evaluate the worst-case and alternative release scenarios. The OCA prepared for the first RMP submittal in 1999 was updated in 2004, as part of the Risk Management Program and Plan update. Details of the OCA methodologies and results of the OCA are included in the OCA reports retained on site at the RTP.  \n\nImplementation of the RTP Prevention (PSM) Program helps to prevent a release or to minimize the impact of any release that may occur. Some of the key elements of the RTP PSM program are summ"

      "SummaryText": "arized below. \n\nA comprehensive set of Process Safety Information (PSI) has been compiled for the chlorine and sulfur dioxide systems. Process Hazards Analysis studies were conducted prior to the startup of the chlorine and sulfur dioxide systems in 1998 to evaluate potential hazards. External events (including earthquakes) were considered in the Process Hazards Analysis. Each external event with the potential to initiate a release was investigated in detail. Recommendations made by the PHA team to improve the safety of the systems were addressed before the systems were started up in 1998. The PSI and PHA were updated and revalidated in 2004. A Management of Change procedure is in effect for the chlorine and sulfur dioxide systems.\n\nAn Operations and Maintenance Manual provides detailed written operating procedures for both the chlorine and sulfur dioxide systems. Additional procedures are written for offloading containers and changing out containers as the chemicals are used. The chlorine and sulfur dioxide systems are included in the RTP maintenance program. Equipment inspections, testing and preventive maintenance activities are performed, mostly by a qualified contractor. Training is provided to operators before they are certified to operate the system and to each maintenance person before they conduct maintenance. \n\nA pre-startup safety review was conducted for the new chlorine and sulfur dioxide systems and the associated scrubber (1998). A checklist was used to ensure that essential elements of the prevention program (i.e., engineered systems and documentation) were in place prior to startup. Compliance audits for the Cal-ARP, PSM and RMP regulations have been conducted. \n\nThere have been no major incidents or accidents involving chlorine or sulfur dioxide at the RTP. The MRWPCA has developed an Incident Investigation procedure to investigate any major incident or accident that does occur. \n\nEmployees are involved in many aspects of the RMP and PSM Programs. "

      "SummaryText": "Their involvement in PHA studies, pre-startup reviews, development of procedures, etc., helps employees to develop and retain ownership of these programs. A contractor safety program has also been implemented. \n\nThe ERP includes procedures that defined response actions for chlorine and sulfur dioxide emergencies. The procedures include evacuations, notifications to response agencies and adjacent businesses, and for medical and first aid. The ERP also includes a list of emergency equipment with a maintenance schedule. The ERP is coordinated with the local response agencies. \n\nDuring the PHA revalidation conducted in 2004, a number of recommendations were developed to improve safety. These recommendations will be addressed in a timey manner. It is RTP policy to review operating, maintenance and emergency response procedures on a routine basis to ensure applicability. This continuous review process may generate further recommendations for improved safety during the course of operating the chlorine/sulfur dioxide systems. \n\nIn summary, the design of the Agency's RTP chlorine and sulfur dioxide facilities and the implementation of the safety and risk management programs provide a high level of assurance that the hazards and risks associated with the use of chlorine and sulfur dioxide are managed in an appropriate manner. These programs are expected to reduce the likelihood of a release and minimize the severity of any release that might occur."
