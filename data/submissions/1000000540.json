The Facility Policy:  The owners, management, and employees of Earlybird Grain & Fertilizer Service are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia by utilization of proper equipment, regular inspections, maintainance and training of all persons that work with the material.  Should an accidental release occur, the facility has orientated the local fire department and the local emergency planning committe so they can plan for response to any release and minimize the impact of the release to the people and the environment.\n\n2.  Facility Information:  The primary activity at the facility is the storage of anhydrous ammonia for sale to farmers. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application to the soil as a crop production nutrient.\n\n3.  Worst-Case Scenerio/Alternative-Case Scenerio: This facility has developed a worst-case and alternative-case scenario however it has been withheld from this Executive Summary as security-sensitive information as requested by EPA.                                                                                                                                                                                    \n4.  The accidental release program:  The facility complies with the various Rules and Regulations governing the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia including ANSI K61.1, OSHA 29 CFR 1910.111 and regulations administered by our state agency.
