General events external to the plant that can conceivably cause a release of anhydrous ammonia were addressed. The External Events that were considered credible include, but are not limited to, an act of nature (earthquake, thunderstorm, lightning, high winds, snowstorm, tornadoes, aircraft impact, external fire, and human error/mis-operation. The magnitudes of the external events considered are detailed within the PHA Worksheets and were qualitatively risk-ranked by the PHA Team. General events external to the plant that can conceivably cause a release of anhydrous ammonia were addressed by the Process Hazard Analysis.

This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the Ammonia Refrigeration System. The facility policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent the foreseeable release of regulated substances. The number of full time equivalent employees on site is zero, as the facility is vacant and there are no tenants occupying the building. \r\n\r\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT/OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nThe Off-site Consequence Analysis must be reviewed every five years or within six months of process changes or other changes that may significantly affect the results of the Off-site Consequence Analysis.\r\n\r\nWorst-Case Release Scenario Results Summary\r\nScenario Description: Per the EPA RMP Regulations, one worst-case release scenario has been defined for the Ammonia Refrigeration System. A summary of the results can be located in the Worst Case Scenario section of this RMP submittal. \r\n\r\nAlternative Release Scenario Results Summary\r\nScenario Description: Per the EPA RMP Regulations, one alternative-case release scenario has been defined for the Ammonia Refrigeration System. A summary of the results can be located in the Alternative Release Scenario section of this RMP submittal.\r\n\r\nRisk Considerations\r\nAlthough the storage and use of anhydrous ammonia has inherent potential risks and the release scenarios can potentially reach sensitive populations within the community, the facility has recognized these potential risks and structured its safety programs to make the worst case type of event non-credible.  It should also be recognized that there are inherent analysis assumptions that make the results of the atmospheric dispersion analysis appear worse than what would actually be expected during such an event, which furth"
