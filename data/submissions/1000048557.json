The CAP meets regularly to discuss safety and environmental issues and serves as a voice for the community to provide feed back to COOPER RIVER PARTNERS in relation to community matters.\n\n\n\nLocal Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC)\n\nCOOPER RIVER PARTNERS is a charter member of the Berkeley County Local Emergency Planning Committee and has actively worked with the county and local agencies and response groups to provide information about COOPER RIVER PARTNERS and the chemicals we use on our site. In addition, COOPER RIVER PARTNERS's site emergency plans have been integrated with the emergency plans of the county and local fire departments. COOPER RIVER PARTNERS has participated in every disaster drill\n\nheld annually by the LEPC.\n\n\n\nCompliance and Commitment to Safety\n\nAt COOPER RIVER PARTNERS, we work with the citizens of our community to help protect and improve the quality of life we all enjoy. Protection of our employees and neighbors is our highest priority, and that is why we have installed multiple safeguards to ensure that all chemicals are handled safely. We also work closely with our suppliers, other companies, local officials and the public to maintain stringent safety and environmental programs and to minimize risks. In keeping with our commitment, COOPER RIVER PARTNERS has developed a risk management plan in compliance with guidelines established by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Under EPA guidelines, facilities that handle certain quantities of regulated chemicals must submit plans that show the consequences of hypothetical chemical releases. Facilities must also outline their measures to reduce the risk of releases and minimize their effects.\n\nSeveral processes at the site are regulated by the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) requi"

The COOPER RIVER PARTNERS Bushy Park site is in full compliance with the PSM requirements.\n\n\n\nIII. RMP REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nCOOPER RIVER PARTNERS ammonia system, in compliance with PSM requirements, must meet the requirements for the Risk Management Program listed in 40 CFR Part 68. The RMP includes COOPER RIVER PARTNERs ammonia refrigeration system. The Ammonia system contains liquefied gas under pressure, and is regulated as a toxic substance. The COOPER RIVER PARTNERS site does not have any flammables that require inclusion in the Risk Management Plan.\n\nCOOPER RIVER PARTNERS uses anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant in the plant-wide refrigeration system. Ammonia is a colorless gas with a strong pungent odor. Exposure to ammonia can irritate the eyes, nose and throat. Exposure to extremely high levels can result in a buildup of fluid in the lungs and can be life threatening.\n\n\n\nIV. RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nA worst case and alternative case scenario is included in the plan for ammonia. \n\n\n\nToxic end-point or Level of Concern (LOC)\n\nThe Emergency Response Planning Guideline 2 - Level of Concern (ERPG2-LOC) is the maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals can be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or serious health effects, or symptoms which impair their ability to take protective action. The release impact distance is the distance down wind to the ERPG2-LOC concentration. The ERPG2-LOC for ammonia is 200 parts per million (ppm).\n\nThe Extremely Hazardous Substance Level of Concern (EHS-LOC) is the airborne concentration 10 times safer than the concentration (estimated from toxicity data) that is immediately dangerous to life and health. The release impact distance is the distance down wind to the EHS-LOC concentration"

Other models did not provide satisfactory estimates for use in evaluating the maximum end-point distance. Public and environmental protection requires\n\nconservative results. Both substances were evaluated for the alternate scenario and the information is included in the plan.\n\n\n\nMore-Likely Scenarios\n\nThe alternative scenario is a hypothetical release that is more realistic than the worst-case scenario. In this scenario, safety and emergency systems operate as expected, and plant personnel respond to take action to control and stop the release\n\n\n\nAmmonia scenario assumptions:\n\n+ Partial failure of the piping system containing ammonia liquid under pressure.\n\n+ Detection of ammonia by instruments or personnel in the area, shutdown of the ammonia supply equipment by remote control, and closure of valves by site personnel to stop the leak.\n\n+ Release during typical weather conditions experienced at the site.\n\n\n\nV. FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nDuring the past five years, COOPER RIVER PARTNERS has not experienced any release of ammonia that requires listing in the RMP information we are submitting.\n\n\n\nVI. EMERGENCY RESPONSE\n\nIncident and Emergency Guidelines\n\nCOOPER RIVER PARTNERS has multiple safeguards in place to ensure safe handling of ammonia to prevent releases of these substances. Our facility is prepared to handle emergencies such as hurricanes and tornadoes as well as chemical releases. In the unlikely event a release occurs, we work to contain the release quickly and to minimize its impact on plant personnel and neighbors.
