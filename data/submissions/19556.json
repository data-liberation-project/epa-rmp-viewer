Ethyl mercaptan, an odorant, is also stored at the terminal and is injected into the propane stream to odorize the propane prior to truck loading.  The facility is completely automated and is available for around the clock loading by trained, qualified drivers.  The facility is equipped with hand scan devices so only qualified drivers can gain access to the terminal and loading operations.  In our processes, we use the following chemi"
