Facility accidental release and emergency response policy. \n\n\n\nThe management and employees of Southern FS, Inc. are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment. \n\n\n\n2. The stationary source and the regulated substances handled.\n\n \n\nThe primary activity at the facility, which is located at 3565 Blue Bunting Rd, Pinckneyville, IL, is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient. The storage and handling system consists of 1 storage tank (30,000 gallons), loading risers, associated plumbing and nurse tanks. Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors. The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia that can be stored would be 435,599 pounds. This includes anhydrous ammonia that could be stored in nurse tanks \n\n\n\n3. The worst-case Release Scenario and the Alternative-case Release Scenario.\n\n  \n\nThis facility has developed a worst-case release scenario and an alternative-case release scenario. However since this is security sensitive information it has been withheld from this executive summary as required by E.P.A. regulations. \n\n\n\n4. The accidental release prevention program.\n\n \n\nThis facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations. This facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc. as adopted by state regulation and the standards of the U S Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1"

      "SummaryText": "910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\". Compliance with these regulations and on-going training of our employees make up our accident release prevention.\n\n\n\n5. Five year accident history.\n\n \n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that: \n\n  - have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor \n\n  - to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, shelter in place, property damage or environmental damage. \n\n\n\n6. The emergency response program.\n\n \n\nThe facility has: - a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38; - provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA). In the event of an emergency involving anhydrous ammonia, it is our policy to notify the local fire department and the County LEPC. \n\n\n\n7. Planned changes to improve safety.\n\n \n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions. There are no specific safety recommendations for implementation at this time.\n\n"
