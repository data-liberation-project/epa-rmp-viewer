Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n  We at CR Briggs  are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental\n  safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release\n  prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures,\n  maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is\n  our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated\n  substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, our highly trained emergency\n  response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n  \n  \n     2.

Regulated substances include Ammonia and Propane.  The regulated substances at our facility are involved in several uses.  Ammonia is used in the Specialized Catalyst Reduction (SCR.) of oxides of nitrogen.  Propane is used for heating and the firing of the dore furnace for gold recovery.  \n  \n  The maximum inventory of Ammonia at our facility is no more than 85% of 59255 lb. while Propane is\n  present at our facility in quantities of  15658 lb.\n  \n  \n     3.     The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release\n     Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario.\n  To evaluate the worst case scenarios, we have used the look-up tables and equations\n  provided by the EPA in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance as w"

The scenario involves the release\n  of 51,000 lb. of Ammonia in a gaseous form over 10 minutes.  Passive mitigation\n  controls, to be used depending on the physical state of the release, such as dikes, sumps and berms are also taken into account to calculate the\n  scenario.  At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum\n  distance of <5 miles miles is obtained corresponding to the toxic endpoint.\n  \n  \n  The alternative release scenario for Ammonia involves a release from the SCR Bed\n  located at the crusher in the storage tank and transfer piping. The scenario involves the release of 51000 lb. of\n  Ammonia in a gaseous form over 10 minutes.  Passive mitigation controls, to be used depending on the physical state of the release, such as dikes\n  and berms are taken into account to calculate the scenario.  The release is also assumed\n  to be controlled by active mitigation measures that include water curtain(s).  Under\n  neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint\n  of Ammonia is under 2 miles.\n  \n  The worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 flammable substances\n  as a class involves a catastrophic release from the propane storage vessel at refinery\n  used for heating in the gold extraction process.  The scenario involves the release of\n  27439 lb. of Propane.  It is assumed that the entire quantity is released as a vapor,\n  which finds an igni"

The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the\n     Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n  Our facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release\n  prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was\n  designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1967 Edition.  Our\n  facility is also subject to EPCRA Section 302 notification requirements.

The following\n  sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place\n  at our stationary source.\n  \n  Process Safety Information\n  CR Briggs maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical\n  hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n  \n  Process Hazard Analysis\n  Our facility conducts daily pre-shift inspections to ensure that hazards associated with\n  our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The inspections are undertaken\n  by qualified supervisors and mine personnel with expertise in process operations and\n  are revalidated at a regular interval.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are\n  addressed in a timely manner.\n  \n  Operating Procedures\n  For the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, CR\n  Briggs  maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various\n  modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations,\n  emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a\n  turnaround.
