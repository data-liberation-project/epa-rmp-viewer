Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies \n\nThe City of Angels' Water Treatment Plant (WTP), which is located  on 1131 Murphys Grade Road. in Angels Camp, California, uses chlorine which is considered a hazardous material and is a regulated substance, which is considered in the Risk Management Plan (RMP).  The properties of chlorine make it necessary to observe safety precautions in handling chlorine to prevent human exposure, and to reduce the threat to the facility's workers and nearby members of the community. It is the facility's policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the safe procedures used to handle chlorine, the safety devices and systems designed and constructed into the facility; and the training of the pertinent personnel.\n\n2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe WTP is designed to treat surface water from the Angels' forebay.  The treatment plant operation consists of chlorination for disinfection and coagulation of the particulate matter suspended in the raw water just received from the forebay.  After the particles settle out, the water is filtered and another lower dose of chlorine is applied before the water is placed in the clearwell or storage basin.  Upon leaving the clearwell; one more very low dose of chlorine is added  to prevent bacteriological regrowth in the water distribution system.\n\nChlorine is delivered by a commercial supplier in one-ton containers for use at the WTP. Off-loading of the one-ton container from the commercial delivery vehicle is accomplished with a hoist.  Each one-ton container is placed in the chlorine storage area on a steel cradle with a load-cell scale. One of the one-ton containers is on-line and the other container is in stand-by.\n\nThe WTP has administrative procedures in place to limit the amount of chlorine at the facility to no more than two of the one-ton con"

      "SummaryText": "tainers.  Delivery of the one-ton containers is during normal working hours. The driveway provides adequate room for the delivery and parking of the delivery vehicles during the off-loading of the full one-ton containers, and the loading of the empty one-ton containers.\n\nThe chlorine building is locked after normal working hours and the area is fenced.  No unauthorized personnel is allowed entry into the chlorine building. The container storage and handling is conducted pursuant to per Sections 2.6, 2.7, and 2.8 of the Chlorine Institute's Chlorine Manual.\n\nThe WTP operates twenty four hours per day, seven day a week and is staffed for a single shift per a day for seven days a week.  The chlorine gas is withdrawn from the one-ton containers by vacuum.  This vacuum is created by an injector.  This vacuum opens the vacuum regulator diaphragm, and withdraws gas from the one-ton container at a controlled feed rate set by the operators at the rotometer.  The chlorine gas is injected into the feed water line, where it becomes a chlorine/water solution and is feed where it is needed in the treatment process.  The container storage room has an exhaust system, leak detector, and alarm systems. Each chlorinator is vented to the outside if their diaphragm malfunctions.\n\n3a. Worst Case Release Scenario\n\nThe Worst Case release scenario must consider the largest quantity of a regulated substance handled on\nsite in a single vessel at any time, taking into account administrative controls on the vessel's contents and\nusage as per 40 CFR Part 68 Section 68.25.  A one ton container of chlorine is the largest vessel in the treatment system and has 2,000 lbs. of liquid chlorine. The Worst Case release scenario for the one-ton container of chlorine is the release of the 2,000 lbs. of chlorine at the rate of 200 lbs/min for 10 minutes.  The distance to the endpoint for the Worst Case scenario will extend beyond the boundaries of the stationary source.\n\n3b. Alternative Release Scenario\n\nTh"

      "SummaryText": "e Alternative Release scenario for the one-ton container of chlorine is a leak occurring in the\npacking material around the valve stem of the gas valve on the one-ton container.  There are no active or passive mitigation measures that are considered to reduce the amount of chlorine released or treatment system to which released chlorine would be directed and treated.  It is assumed that the release would continue for a period of sixty minutes. During that the time a total of 120 pounds of chlorine would be released. In this scenario, the distance to the endpoint would extend beyond the boundaries of the stationary source.\n\n3c. Administrative Controls\n\nAdministrative controls exist to restrict to a minimum, the amount of chlorine lost from a one-ton container if accidental release were to occur. This administrative control is inherent in the operational procedures for the chlorine process system and the training provided of the operators of the process system.\n\n3d. Mitigation Measures\n\nMitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario exist to restrict the amount of chlorine released to a minimum if a release were to occur. The mitigation measures are based upon the design, inspection, testing, and maintenance of the chlorine process systems; their related equipment and components.\n\n4. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe facility complies with all applicable federal and state codes and regulations. There are safety meetings and safety training.  The Process Safety Management (PSM.) program implemented at the facility for the chlorine process system and the related activities and equipment represents the facility's main active commitments to an accidental prevention program.\n\n5. Five Year Accident History\n\nThere has been no accidental release of chlorine in the last five years.\n\n6. Emergency Response Program\n\nThe Emergency Response Program is based upon alerting personnel at the facility to evac"

The Calaveras County Environmental Health can incorporate this response into the Area Plan for the Local Emergency Planning Committee.\n\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThere are commitments under the Process Hazard Analysis element of the Process Safety Management (PSM) that are planned to be implemented.  Current applicable codes and regulations are reviewed as part of the PSM to determine if other commitments need to be made to achieve increased operational safety for the regulated chlorine process system.  These commitments will be prevention and mitigation measures for the accidental releases of the regulated substance."
