The Northside Wastewater Treatment Plant is part of the Wastewater Operation Division of the City of Lakeland, Florida. The City of Lakeland requires each site to develop and maintain accident prevention programs and an emergency response plan appropriate to the site. Each site is also responsible for regulatory compliance issues that apply to the site. The City of Lakeland Office of Risk Management provides assistance in training for site employees and in budgeting and procurement of safety and training services.\r\n2. Facility and the Regulated Substances Handled\r\nThe McIntosh Power Plant is located on the north shore of Lake Parker. McIntosh consists of the following electric generating units: one diesel and gas simple cycle turbine unit (MGT2) and one diesel and gas combined cycle turbine unit (Unit 5). Two oil and gas-fired steam electric generating units (Units 1 and 2) were retired on December 31, 2015, and June 22, 2020, respectively, while one coal-fired steam electric generating unit (Unit 3) was retired on April 4, 2021. The McIntosh facility supplies electric power to the City of Lakeland and the surrounding area. The Northside Wastewater Treatment Plant, located on property adjacent to the McIntosh facility, includes disinfection, filtration, clarification, and aeration processes that treat wastewater for the City of Lakeland. Since the McIntosh and Northside facilities are located on one contiguous property and have a common owner, they filed a joint Title V Air Permit. For this reason, they submit their Risk Management Plan jointly to comply with the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68. The facility will therefore be referred to as McIntosh/Northside facility.\r\nAt Unit 5, the McIntosh Power Plant stores liquefied anhydrous ammonia in one 30,400-gallon tank for addition to the Selective Catalytic"

      "SummaryText": "Reduction (SCR) System. Although the tank has a total capacity of 30,400 gallons, the Ammonia Unloading Procedure limits the tank level to 85% of capacity for a maximum total inventory of 25,840 gallons or approximately 131,273 pounds of ammonia (at 70\u00b0F and 128.8 psia). The process therefore exceeds the 10,000 pound Risk Management Programs (RMP) threshold quantity for anhydrous ammonia.\r\nThe Northside Wastewater Treatment Plant adds chlorine to the filtered wastewater as a disinfection agent. The chlorination process includes twelve one-ton containers of liquefied chlorine gas. Three one-ton containers are on-line, three are on standby, and up to six are in storage. The maximum chlorine inventory in the process at any one time us therefore 24,000 pounds. This exceeds the 2,500-lb. RMP threshold quantity for chlorine. Northside operators use a 2 ton overhead hoist to move full containers into place for use and to return empty containers to the storage area. In 2013, a chlorine building was constructed to fully enclose the chlorine container storage area. The chlorine building doors are normally closed during operation of the process. The building is equipped with a scrubber unit to capture chlorine gas emissions in the event of a release from a chlorine container.\r\nThe exhaust fan and louvers are interlocked to the chlorine detectors, such that in the event of a chlorine release, the released chlorine will be exhausted through the scrubber.\r\n3. Prevention Programs\r\nThe McIntosh Power Plant and Northside Wastewater Treatment Plant have separate programs in place to comply with the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation entitled Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: RMP under Clean Air Act Section 112 (r) (7) (40 CFR Part 68). The RMP Program was established in 1997 for the chlorine process. The McIntosh Power Plant RMP program was established in June of 2001 for the Unit 5 SCR ammonia process prior to its installation in fall 2001. All processes"

Five-year Accident History\r\nThe McIntosh/Northside facility has had no accidental releases of chlorine or anhydrous ammonia in\r\nthe past five years.\r\n5. Emergency Response Program\r\nThe McIntosh Power Plant/Northside WWTP has a written emergency response plan in place that\r\ncomplies with 40 CFR Part 68, Subpart E. The plan has been coordinated with Polk County Fire Department, and the District 7 Local Emergency Planning Committee.\r\nNotification is made locally by dialing 911, and by notifying Florida State Warning Point at (800) 320-\r\n0519.\r\n6. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\r\nThe McIntosh Power Plant/Northside WWTP will implement recommendations resulting from process hazards analyses and RMP audits to improve the safety of the facilities."
