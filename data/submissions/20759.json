There were no offsite injuries or evacuations that occurred.  \nOur emergency response program is coordinated with the local LEPC and through our local 911 system.  This will notify all local emergency responders.  All employees that work with chlorine have had training.  They have had Chlorine Awareness Classes, Operational Classes, and Technical Training for the handling of chlorine gas.  With these classes the employees have completed the level of training as a Hazardous Materials Technician which would make them our first responders in the event of an accident.
