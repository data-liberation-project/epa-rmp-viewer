Drexel Chemical believes that risks associated with DMA storage at this facility are well managed.\n\n\n\nSOURCE AND  PROCESS DESCRIPTION\n\nDrexel produces agricultural chemicals.  The DMA is stored in two aboveground storage tanks at the facility.  \n\n\n\nOverall responsibility for the RMP for the DMA process is assigned to the Plant Manager.  Employees are responsible for following the requirements of this policy.  Employees are encouraged to actively participate in the PSM program.\n\n\n\nDrexel consults with employees on the conduct and development of process hazard analyses and on the development of other elements of the standard.\n\n\n\nDrexel provides to employees and contractors, whose work is covered by the PSM program, ready access to PSM program files and documents upon request.\n\n\n\nDrexel makes use of a PSM team comprised of employees and supervisors that actively engages in the implementation and management of the PSM program.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccident Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nDrexel develops and implements written operating procedures that provide clear instructions for safely conducting activities involved in each covered process.  Operating procedures address the steps for each operating phase, operating limits, safety and health considerations, and safety systems and their functions.  \n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\n\nA facility Emergency Action Plan is established to give direction to employees for safe response actions to be taken during fire and other emergencies. Potential chemical releases, including DMA, are addressed in the Emergency Action Plan including notification procedures, evacuation procedures, and medical assistance procedures.  Production managers and supervisors are res"

Operating procedures are reviewed as often as necessary to ensure that they reflect current operating practices, including changes associated with process chemicals, technology, and equipment and changes to facilities.  Drexel certifies annually that operating procedures are current and accurate.  \n\n\n\nArrangements are established with the local emergency response agency, the fire department, and local hospital.\n\n\n\nDrexel provides training to all employees when they are hired and before they begin their assignment. Employees receive training to familiarize themselves with all exits and evacuation routes.  An annual training session is conducted during a weekly safety meeting.\n\n\n\nEvacuation drills are held at least once a year or when a change is made.  Drills are evaluated by the plant manager regarding effectiveness and timeliness.\n\n\n\nAfter a drill, the plant manager judges the effectiveness of the plan and reviews any employee input concerning the drill.  Employees may identify something that requires a change to the procedure or was ineffective.  For example, they may discover new doors that would not open; they may enter storage closets instead of exits; or they may get lost and confused. \n\n\n\nThe emergency action plan is reviewed with all employees, if any changes are made to the plan or if any employee responsibilities change in the plan. \n\n\n\nPeriodic compliance audits will ensure that the plan is kept up-to-date. \n\n\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nThere has not been any accidental release of DMA during the last 5 years that caused any of the following:\n\n? On-site death, injury, or significant property damage.\n\n? Known offsite death, injury, property damage, environmental damage, evacuation, or sheltering in place.\n\n"
