The regulated substance is anhydrous ammonia with a total inventory charge of 17,657 lbs which is over the threshold quantity of 10,000 lbs.  Since the facility is also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration\u00bfs PSM Standard 29 CFR 1910.119, Program 3 is required.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION POLICY\n\nThe top priority of Diversified Foods and Seasonings, Inc. is to provide a healthy and safe work environment for its employees and the surrounding community.  In this effort Diversified Foods & Seasonings, Inc. has developed strict policies and procedures to reduce the risk of an accidental hazardous chemical release.  The Process Safety Management (PSM) program acts as a gatekeeper of these policies and procedures.\n\nThe requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration\u00bfs (OSHA) PSM Standard 29 CFR 1910.119 mirrors that of Risk Management\u00bfs Prevention Program 3 and therefore been integrated.  Of the 14 PSM elements 13 focus on accidental release prevention and one on emergency planning and response.  It is the commitment of management and employees to follow the established procedures and seek new ways for improvement. \n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICY\n\nThe facility has developed an Emergency Response Plan with the intent to take control of an incident until the Nebraska City Fire Department arrives on the scene.  Once the Fire Department arrives they will assume the role of Incident Commander.  Diversified Foods & Seasonings has designated and trained, to the Hazardous Materials Technicians Level, employees that will assist in the emergency response.  This strategic approach combines the expertise and the response team of the Nebraska City Fire Department with the facility and process knowledge of the Diversified Foods & Seasonings staff.  Div"
