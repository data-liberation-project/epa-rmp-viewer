The overall goal of this program is to reduce the risk to employees and the public of injury or death from accidental release of a toxic chemical.\n\n1.2    BACKGROUND\n\nIn June of 1996, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) promulgated requirements under 40 CFR Part 68 to prevent accidental releases of regulated substances and to reduce the severity of those releases that do occur.  \n\n1.3    APPLICABILITY\n\nThe City of Palm Bay's Water Treatment Plant, Wastewater Treatment Plant, Water Reclamation Facility, facility all exist adjacent to one another on common property owned by the City., Because they are next to one another, The EPA has determined that the three (3) plants can be represented as a single stationary source for Risk Management Program purposes. The water and wastewater treatment facilities are required to provide disinfection to the finished potable water/wastewater plant effluent prior to discharge.  Chlorine gas is used to achieve the level of disinfection required under state and federal regulations. Chlorine is considered a toxic substance by the EPA and because quantities stored on-site are above the 2,500 pound threshold limit listed under 40 CFR Part 68, a Risk Management Program (RMP) is required.  In addition, the State of Florida requires that the water and wastewater treatment facilities comply with the OSHA PSM requirements established under 29 CFR Part 1910.119.  Because of this, the Risk Management Program developed for the wa"

Because Horizon Gas Co. operates and maintains the propane facility, it was not included in the City's Risk Management Program.\n\n1.4    RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM LEVEL 3 REQUIREMENTS\n\nThe same properties that make chlorine valuable as a disinfectant in wastewater and drinking water treatment also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling chlorine to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to on-site personnel, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is the policy of the City of Palm Bay to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.  Safety depends on the manner in which chlorine is handled, the safety devices inherent in the design of the facilities, safe handling procedures of the operators, and the training of personnel.\n\nA Program Level 3 RMP has virtually all the requirements of the OSHA PSM along with an off-site consequence analysis.  The following elements are required in the development of a Program Level 3 RMP:\n\n?    Management System to oversee the implementation of the RMP elements.\n?    Employee Participation Plan to define how employees will be involved in RMP implementation.\n?    Process Safety Information for the regulated process.\n?    Process Hazard Analysis performed at the facility discussing possible scenarios that may cause a release of toxic substances.\n?    Operating Procedures for the regulated process covering normal and emergency situations.\n?    Training of facility personnel covering RMP requirements and operating procedures.\n?    Mechanical Integrity Program to keep the type of equipment on file updated and documentation of maintenance on regulated process equipment.\n?    Management of Change Procedure to document when any changes are made to regulated process equipment.\n?    Pre startup Safety Review procedure for the regulat"

The report provides for all the required elements of a Program Level 3 RMP and will be kept on file at each facility and the administration building.  \n\n1.7    APRIL, 2004 REVIEW/UPDATE/MODIFICATIONS\n\nSystem Modifications\n\nThe City of Palm Bay Utilities has permitted and installed a Sodium Hypochlorite System for Disinfection to the Water Reclamation Facility. This facility has been permanently converted from chlorine gas to Sodium Hypochlorite. This was permitted in March, 2004 by the Department of Environmental Regulation. The system was placed into operation on January 21, 2004. As of January 21, 2004, The City of Palm Bay Utilities has no Waste Water Treatment Facilities using Chlorine Gas for disinfection. They have been converted to Sodium Hypochlorite Systems.\n\nAll further references to Waste Water Treatment Systems have been eliminated from the RMP within the April, 2004 review.\n\nWe are in the process of converting the Water Treatment Plant from Chlorine Gas to Sodium Hypochlorite. We anticipate this conversion to be complete in the summer of 2005. We will update the RMP at that time.\n\n After the conversion of the Water Treatment Plant, We will have no other facilities that fall within the thresholds for Chlorine Gas that will require a RMP.We will provide the de certification papers at that time.\n\nAll further references to Waste Water Treatment Systems have been eliminated from the RMP within the April, 2004 review and submittal."
