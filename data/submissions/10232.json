Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Holstein Cooperative Elevator in Holstein are strongly committed to employee, public, and\nenvironmental safety.  This commitment is an inherent part of our comprehensive accidental release\nprevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance,\nand employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement\nappropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If such a release does\noccur, our trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of\nthe release.  We also coordinate our response efforts with the Holstein Fire Department, which\nprovides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n  2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities include support services for crop production.  We have anhydrous\nammonia stored in a 18,000-gallon tank at our facility in Holstein (Figure 1, ammonia).  The\nmaximum amount stored is 14,400 gallons (74,102 pounds) at the maximum fill capacity of 80%.\n\nWe also have propane stored in a 30,000-gallon tank located at our facility in Holstein (Figure 1,\npropane).  The maximum amount stored is 25,500 gallons (107,687 pounds) at the maximum fill\ncapacity of 85%.\n\n  3. Worst Case Release and Alternative Release Scenarios\nWe utilized RMP PRO for the worst case and alternate case scenarios of the required offsite\nconsequence analysis for our ammonia and propane facility.  The following details these scenarios.\n\n            3.1     Ammonia\n\nThe worst case release scenario involves a catastrophic release of the entire contents of the\nanhydrous ammonia stora"

At\nClass F atmospheric stability, 1.5 m/s wind speed, and urban topography, the maximum distance to\na toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L is 4 miles (Figure 2).  The estimated population within a 4-mile radius\nof this facility is 1,750.\n\nThe alternative release scenario involves a release from an anhydrous ammonia product line.  The\nscenario involves the release of 11,873.12 pounds of ammonia in a gaseous form over a period of\n30 minutes.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14\nmg/L of ammonia is 0.31 mile (Figure 3).  The estimated population within a 0.31-mile radius of the\nfacility is 900.\n\n            3.2     Propane\n\nThe worst case release scenario involves a catastrophic release of the entire contents of the propane\nstorage tank (107,687 pounds) in gaseous form over a 10-minute period.  At Class F atmospheric\nstability and 1.5 m/s wind speed, the maximum distance to an endpoint of 1 psi overpressure is 0.38\nmiles (Figure 2).  This amount of overpressure can cause partial demolition of houses and can result\nin serious injury to people within this distance.  The estimated population within a 0.38-mile radius\nof this facility is 1,000.\n\nThe alternative release scenario involves a 30-minute release of propane from a product line that\ncontacts an ignition source and detonates, resulting in a vapor cloud fire.  Under neutral weather\nconditions, the maximum distance to an endpoint with a lower flammability limit of 35 mg/L at a\nrelease rate of 5,000 pounds per minute is less than 0.06 mile (Figure 3).  The estimated population\nwithin a 0.06-mile radius of this facility is 50.\n\n  4.
