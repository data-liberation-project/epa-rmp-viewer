Our management philosophy goals are achieved by the personal commitments of our employees and contractors, and by open communication with our employees, customers, neighbors, and with regulators. The accidental release prevention and emergency response programs we have at our facilities are part of the high standards for which we strive.  Our high standards are achieved by operating in compliance with all required environmental permits and regulations, by operating and maintaining our assets in such a manner that any unpermitted release will be unintentional and acknowledged as unacceptable, by remedying any shortcomings found during regular audits of our facilities, and by reporting promptly to regulators any shortcomings found during the course of our audits as required by law.\n\n\n\nThe Stephens Gas Plant (Facility) is one of many facilities operated by OFS.  At the facility, we receive wellhead gas from wells via pipeline.  We separate the liquid hydrocarbons out by employing a 25,000,000 cubic feet per day cryogenic/turbo-expander/demethanizer process.  The demethanized residue gas is either sold to customers as low pressure gas or recompressed for sale to customers as high pressure gas.  There is a product surge tank with a maximum capacity of 7,943 gallons which contains demethanized product.  This demethanized product is the only flammable substance at the facility in an amount greater than threshold quantity that is regulated under the Risk Management Program (RMP).  There are no RMP-covered toxic substances present at the plant in amounts greater than threshold quantity.  The facility is classified as Program Level 3 under the regulation.  The purpose of this RMP is to provide informat"

Our ongoing analysis of the potential hazards of our process, detailed training of our employees, and constant emphasis on safety have helped us avoid any serious accidents over the last 5 years.  Part of this program has also involved identifying and taking steps to avoid potential accidental chemical releases.  A few examples of the additional prevention features implemented at this facility include the following:\n\n\n\n* We provide manual emergency shutdown (ESD) buttons at several locations within the facility in order to shutdown the entire facility during emergency situations.  The ESD system will also isolate the facility from the incoming feed pipeline and outgoing product pipeline.   \n\n \n\n* We have gas detectors in the compressor room in order to detect flammable hydrocarbon vapors and alarm the control room.\n\n \n\n* We provide dual seals on the booster pumps.\n\n \n\n* We provide high pressure and low-flow shutdown switches on our product pipeline as well as high pressure shutdown on the demethanizer that will vent hydrocarbon vapors to the flare prior to any release to atmosphere through the relief valve.\n\n \n\n* We provide fire extinguishers throughout the facility for extinguishing incipient fires.  These fire extinguishers are inspected annually by third party inspectors and monthly by plant employees.\n\n \n\nThese safeguards as well as the vigilance of our trained employees have helped us operate safely at this facility for many years.\n\n \n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n \n\nNo incident having resulting in onsite"

Also involved in emergency response for the facility would be the Velma Police Department, the Stephens County Sheriff, Duncan Regional Hospital, the Velma Ambulance Service, and the Oklahoma Department of Public Safety.  The Stephens Gas Plant Operator is responsible for coordinating all emergency actions.  A specific Emergency Response Plan (ERP) for the facility is in place and that plan has been coordinated with local officials, along with evacuation procedures, regular drilling, and training.  Our ERP provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.\n\n \n\nPLANNED ACTIVITIES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n \n\nDiligent compliance with our RMP Prevention Program forms the framework on which we will continue to improve the level of safety at the Stephens Gas Plant.  Some of the key components of the safety improvements we expect to achieve are as follows.\n\n \n\nWe encourage all interested citizens or community organizations to contact the Stephens County Emergency Management Director for the latest information on emergency response for the county.
