The resources invested in the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances demonstrate this commitment.  The Searcy Water Utilities Water Treatment Plant implements reasonable controls, such as training of personnel and the safe design, installation, operation and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to make every effort to prevent the release of hazardous substances but in the event of a release, our trained personnel and local emergency response agencies will respond to control and contain the release in a manner that will be safe for workers and will help prevent injuries to the public or the environment.\n\n\n2.0 Description of the Searcy Water Utilities Water Treatment Plant and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Searcy Water Utilities Water Treatment Plant is located within the city limits of Searc, Arkansas, a city with a population of over 15,000 residents.  The Searcy Water Utilities Water Treatment Plant handles one substance regulated by the Risk Management Plan Rule (RMP Rule) in quantities above the Threshold Quantity.  This substance is:\n\n? Chlorine - stored in 1 ton cylinders and used for disinfection of the water prior to release into the receiving stream.\n\n\n3.0 Hazard Assessment\n \nThe RMP Rule requires the Searcy Water Utilities Water Treatment Plant to perform a Hazard Assessment of the regulated substances stored and used in the covered processes at the facility.  The Searcy Water Utilities Water Treatment Plant conducted a Hazard Assessment for the Chlorination process and the results of the Hazard Assessment have been formally communicated with the local emergency response agencies. \n\n\n4.0 Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention S"
