The plant was purchased from Nuevo Midstream, LLC late in 2014.  The plant is designed to process natural gas and recover liquid product from natural gas by physical separation and cryogenic means. Petroleum condensates are transported onward to another facility for processing.\r\n\r\nWES has a commitment to workers and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by our efforts in accident prevention, such as training personnel, quality assurance, and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our process. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will evaluate the situation, take actions within the capabilities of the facility, and notify the necessary outside agencies.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\r\n\r\nThe Ramsey Gas Plant is located near Orla, Texas and operates a variety of processes to produce the following petroleum products from raw natural gas:\r\n\r\n1. Natural Gas Liquid Product (Y-Grade, Ethane-plus)\r\n2. Condensate \r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\n\r\nA. Employee Participation\r\nEmployees of the Ramsey Plant are required to participate in all facets of Process Safety Management and accident prevention as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information\r\n2. Performing necessary calculations for PSM and RMP\r\n3. Maintaining good engineering practices\r\n4. Participating as a member of a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) team\r\n\r\nIn addition, all employees have full access to all information pertaining to accident prevention.\r\n\r\nB.

Equipment design basis and configuration information\r\n6. Identification of all necessary Regulatory equipment design documents\r\n7. Sufficient information to assure good engineering practices\r\n8. Written work procedures with consequences of deviation in them\r\n\r\nAll of the technical documents referenced above is listed in the Process Safety Information portion of the PSM Manual/Files at the facility. \r\n\r\nChemical specific information, including hazard and emergency response/exposure considerations, is provided in Safety Data Sheets (SDS) which are kept on site at the facility for all employees to read. For specific process areas, the facility has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters such as temperatures, level and composition in the operator procedures manual. The facility maintains the process within these limits by using process controls, written procedures, monitoring instruments, trained personnel and protective instrument systems such as automated shutdown systems.\r\n\r\nThe facility also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of the process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressures, temperature and electrical ratings. This information, in combination with procedures and equipment operating history, provides a basis for inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to safety features in the process to assure they are not compromised. \r\n\r\nC.

The PHAs conducted included HAZOPS and What If Checklists methodologies and included a team of WES employees who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. The team is tasked to identify, evaluate and make recommendations to management of the potential hazards associated with the process. If possible, the team affects the changes necessary to mitigate the hazards identified.  If the mitigation required is more involved or cannot be mitigated by the team, their findings are forwarded to WES Management for resolution. The approved mitigation options in response to the PHA team's findings are tracked until they are completed. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\r\n\r\nThe facility periodically updates and revalidates the PHA to assure that the hazards identified have been properly mitigated and that new hazards or previously unknown hazards can be dealt with. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating. The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.\r\n\r\nD. Operating Procedures\r\n\r\nWES maintains written Operating Procedures of the covered process that address primary operations mandated by OSHA, EPA, Good Engineering Practice and manufacturers. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. Procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current accurate by employees and management. The procedures are maintained current and accurate, revising them as necessary by employee's suggestion, compliance audit, PHA's, Good Engineering practice, Pre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR) and Management of Change.\r\n\r\nCovered process Operating Procedures are readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to s"

Training\r\n\r\nWES has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating the covered process. New employees receive basic training in process operations at this facility.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. A performance review and written test specific to the facility operations is administered and must be successfully completed during this training period. After the operator demonstrates adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they are allowed to work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the Operating Procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years, or more frequently upon request or need. All training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify and demonstrate skills.\r\n\r\nF. Contractors\r\n\r\nWES uses Contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities. Because some Contractors work on or near covered process equipment, the facility has procedures in place to ensure that Contractors: \r\n\r\n1. Perform their work in a safe manner\r\n2. Have the appropriate knowledge and skills to perform the necessary tasks\r\n3. Are aware of the hazards in the workplace - both the ones they bring to the worksite and the ones that exist at the facility\r\n4. Understand what they should do in the event of an emergency\r\n5. Understand and follow site safety rules\r\n6. Inform facility personnel of any hazards that they find during their work\r\n7.

Facility personnel periodically monitor Contractor performance with regard to their safety obligations.\r\n\r\nG. Pre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR)\r\n\r\nWES conducts a PSSR for any facility modification that requires a change in the Process Safety Information or procedure. The purpose of the PSSR is to see that safety features, procedures, personnel and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup before placing the equipment into service. This review provides one additional check that construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready. A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and services as quality assurance verification that the Accident Prevention Program requirements are properly implemented.\r\n\r\nH. Mechanical Integrity\r\n\r\nWES has established practices and procedures for the safe operation of fixed, rotating, pressure containing and emergency shutdown equipment. The basic aspects of the program include, but are not limited to, the following:\r\n1. Conducting training\r\n2. Developing written procedures\r\n3. Performing inspections and tests\r\n4. Correcting identified deficiencies\r\n5. Applying quality assurance measures\r\n\r\nMaintenance personnel receive training on:\r\n1. Overview of the process\r\n2. Safety and Health hazards\r\n3.

If a deficiency is identified and the situation presents an immediate safety concern, the deficiency is corrected before placing the equipment back into service. A Management of Change team will review the use of equipment and determine what action is necessary.\r\n\r\nAn integral part of the Mechanical Integrity Program is quality assurance. WES incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs. This helps to determine that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\r\n\r\nI. Safe Work Practices\r\n\r\nWES has safe work practices as mandated by OSHA, EPA, Industrial Standards and Good Engineering Practice in place to help provide employee, public and process safety.\r\n\r\nJ. Management of Change (MOC)\r\n\r\nWES has a comprehensive system to manage changes to all Reported Covered Processes. This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology and procedures be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented. \r\n\r\nChanges are reviewed to:\r\n1. Determine that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards\r\n2. Verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the proposed change\r\n3. Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information and procedures are updated to incorporate these changes. All operations and maintenance personnel are trained on the changes before they are implemented.\r\n\r\nK. Incident Investigation\r\n\r\nWES promptly investigates all incidents related to a covered process that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in a fire/explosion, property damage, environmental loss or personal injury. The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective action to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team d"
