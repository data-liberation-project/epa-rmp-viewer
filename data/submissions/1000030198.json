The plant is designed to process natural gas and recover liquid product from natural gas by physical separation and cryogenic means.  Petroleum condensates are recovered from the inlet pipeline gas in this process for off-site sales.  \n\n\n\nTEAK Midstream, LLC has a long-standing commitment to workers and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by our efforts in accident prevention, such as training personnel, quality assurance, and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our process. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will evaluate the situation, take actions within the capabilities of the facility, and notify the necessary outside agencies.\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE    \n\n\n\nThe Silver Oak Plant is located near Pettus, Texas and operates a variety of processes to produce the following petroleum products:\n\n\n\n1. Stabilized Condensate\n\n2. Regulated Flammable Products:    \n\na. Methane\n\nb. Ethane\n\nc. Propane\n\nd. Butane\n\ne. Isobutane\n\nf. Pentane\n\ng.

Equipment design basis and configuration information\n\n6. Identification of all necessary Regulatory equipment design documents\n\n7. Sufficient information to assure good engineering practices\n\nThe location of the technical documents referenced above is listed in the Process Safety Information portion of the PSM.\n\n\n\nChemical -specific information, including hazard and emergency response/exposure considerations, is provided in material safety data sheet (MSDS). For specific process areas, the facility has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters such as temperatures, level and composition in the operators' procedures manual. The facility maintains the process within these limits by using process controls and monitoring instruments, trained personnel and protective instrument systems such as automated shutdown systems.\n\n\n\nThe facility also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of the process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressures, temperature and electrical ratings. This information, in combination with procedures and equipment operating history, provides a basis for inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n\n\nC. Process Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\n\n\nTEAK has a comprehensive program to identify and control hazards associated with the RMP covered process. This program systematically examines for potential hazards and puts controls in place to manage hazards.

The team's findings are forward to TEAK's Management for resolution. The approved mitigation options in response to the PHA team's findings are tracked until they are completed. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\n\n\nThe facility periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating. The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.\n\n\n\nD. Operating Procedures\n\n\n\nTEAK maintains written Operating Procedures of the covered process that address primary operations mandated by OSHA, EPA, Good Engineering Practice and manufacturers. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. Procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current accurate by management. The procedures are maintained current and accurate revising them as necessary by employee's suggestion, compliance audit, PHAs, Good Engineering practice, Pre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR) and implemented through Management of Change.\n\n\n\nCovered Process Operating procedures are readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job task and maintain the covered process unit operating within its safe limits.\n\n\n\nE. Training\n\n\n\nTEAK has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating the covered process.

This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years, or more frequently upon request. All training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify and demonstrate skills.\n\n\n\nF. Contractors\n\n\n\nTEAK uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities. Because some contractors work on or near Covered Process equipment, the facility has procedures in place to ensure that contractors:\n\n\n\n1. Perform their work in a safe manner\n\n2. Have the appropriate knowledge and skills\n\n3. Are aware of the hazards in their workplace\n\n4. Understand what they should do in the event of an emergency\n\n5.

The plant maintains a written emergency action plan, which is in place to help protect employees and public safety as well as the environment. The plan identifies steps to be taken in case of an accidental release including: proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs.\n\n\n\nEmployees receive training in the procedures to be followed by employees who remain to operate critical plant operations before they evacuate. TEAK has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate emergency response organizations (Fire Department, Police and Sheriff's Office). This interface provides the means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident. In addition, TEAK conducts periodic emergency drills and annual refresher training for plant personnel.\n\n\n\n"
