Systems in-place to prevent accidents of this nature include, but are not limited to:\n\n7 Stand-by emergency storage vessels dedicated for the emergency transfer of regulated chemicals.  These vessels are capable of holding the maximum quantities of regulated chemicals stored in the primary storage vessels.\n7 Secondary concrete containment for the storage vessels.  In addition, storage vessels, and processes which involve these chemicals, are inside enclosed buildings.\n7 Storage vessels, process equipment, and associated piping are lined with corrosion- proof liners constructed of materials compatible with the regulated chemicals.\n7 Halogen (Bromine/Chlorine) detectors located throughout the Bromine Plant building complex will signal the presence of any spilled or released regulated chemicals.\n7 Automatic valves to isolate/limit releases.\n7 Relief valve systems to guard against storage and process vessel overpressure.\n7 Regular equipment inspections, calibrations and maintenance through the site's Preventive Maintenance and Mechanical Integrity programs.\n7 Excess flow/check valves on Chlorine transfer lines to limit and prevent releases.\n7 Computer controlled air-pad system to regulate Bromine storage vessel pressure.\n7 Remote and local valve operations to prevent overfill of storage vessels.\n7 Safety interlock systems to shut down critical processes.\n\nSystems and operational procedures in place to respond appropriately to emergencies involving regulated chemicals include, but are not limited to:\n\n7 Halogen (Bromine/Chlorine) detectors located on the fence-line that surrounds the Bromine Plant building complex.\n7 Halogen detectors within the Bromine Plant building complex, to warn op"
