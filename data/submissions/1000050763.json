The IMTT-Geismar facility is a bulk liquids storage terminal, providing tank storage capacity for customers. The terminal has a mission to provide the highest quality service to customers while maintaining a safe workplace and protecting the environment. The terminal is proactive in achieving these goals. The terminal policy is to prevent releases before they happen and to provide the appropriate level of emergency response should an accidental release or other emergency occur.\n\n\n\n(b)  Stationary Sources and Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nThe IMTT-Geismar terminal requires an RMP because it stores four compounds in excess of the RMP threshold quantities as identified in the Federal Register, January 31, 1994. These include the following:\n\nCyclohexylamine [CAS # 108-91-8]\n\nDimethylamine [CAS # 124-40-3]\n\nPropylene oxide [CAS # 75-56-9]\n\nToluene diisocyanate (mixed isomers) [CAS # 26471-62-5] \n\n\n\n(c)  Worst-Case Release Scenarios and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\n\n\nDuring the development of the Risk Management Plan, IMTT-Geismar facility identified the following scenarios using the guidance provided by the EPA.\n\n\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenarios:\n\n\n\n(1)  Estimated distance to toxic endpoint resulting from the release of cyclohexylamine from a storage tank with offsite impacts.  The storage tank is inside a diked area which limits the impact of the release. \n\n\n\n(2)  Vapor cloud explosion resulting from the release of dimethylamine from a storage tank with offsite impacts.  The storage tank is inside a diked area which limits the impact of the release.\n\n\n\n(3)  Estimated distance to toxic end"
