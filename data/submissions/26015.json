Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nAK Steel Corporation, Butler Work's Policy is to fully comply with all applicable environmental laws and regulations.  This includes compliance with EPA's Chemical Accident Prevention Program rules (40 CFR Part 68).  \n\nThe Risk Management Plan along with other safety and environmental programs already in-place enables Butler Works  to prevent the occurrence and minimize the consequences of significant releases of hydrofluoric acid, including leaks, spills, and other types of catastrophic accidents.\n\nButler Works' emergency response program is designed to provide rapid response to suspected problems to keep hazardous materials from being released into the environment, minimize the effects of any spills and provide proper clean-up and required notifications as soon as possible following any incidents.\n\n2.  Facility and Regulated Chemical Description\n\nAK Steel Corporation, Butler Works, Main Plant is a specialty steel manufacturing facility located on Route 8 South in Butler, Pennsylvania.  The facility is subject to the requirements of Chemical Accident Prevention Program rules (40 CFR Part 68) of the Clean Air Act, due to on-site processes containing the regulated chemical, hydrofluoric acid, above the threshold quantities specified by the rules.\n\nHydrofluoric acid is stored and used at the facility's steel finishing operations.  It is stored as a 70% water solution in quantities greater than the 1,000-pound regulatory threshold and meets the criteria for a Program 2 process as specified in the RMP rules.\n\nSince the original RMP submission in June 1999, chlorine, which was then present above its regulatory threshold, is no longer used onsite. The chlorine water treatment system was replaced with a sodium hypochlorite system.  In addition, the HF storage tank containment dike has been enlarged.\n\n\n3.  Worst-Case and Alternative Case Scenarios\n\nHydrofluoric acid solution (70%)\n\nWorst-"

      "SummaryText": "case Scenario:  Instantaneous release of the entire contents of an 11,700-gallon storage tank into the containment area below the tank.  The containment area is sloped to a concrete trough which directs the spill to the facility acid wastewater collection sump.  Acid spilled into the sump would be pumped to an on-site wastewater treatment plant and neutralized with lime. Application of the trough as a form of passive mitigation was used in the worst-case release analysis.  The distance to the toxic concentration endpoint of 20 ppm for the worst-case scenario has the potential to result in off-site consequences on a public receptor.\n\nAlternative Scenario:  A transfer pipe from the hydrofluoric acid storage tank breaks resulting in a release of hydrofluoric acid to the tank farm containment area which drains into a concrete trough.  The trough area drains to a sump where it is pumped to an onsite wastewater treatment plant for neutralization.  Tank levels are continuously monitored by computer along with an overfill alarm, and contract employees are present during material transfers.  These control measures along with rapid operator response result in the release being limited to less than 10-minutes in duration.  The distance to the toxic concentration endpoint of 20 ppm for the alternative scenario has the potential to result in off-site consequences on a public receptor.\n\n\n4.  Chemical Accident Prevention Program\n\nAK Steel - Butler Works complies with EPA's Chemical Accident Prevention Program rules for hydrofluoric acid solution.  All elements of the Chemical Accident Prevention Program requirements under Part 68 have been developed and implemented for hydrofluoric acid.\n\nThe hydrofluoric acid system meets the requirements of EPA's Chemical Accident Prevention Program requirements.  The hydrofluoric acid storage tanks were designed and constructed following good engineering practices.  A hazard review was conducted for hydrofluoric acid on April 19, 2002 using a h"

HF Products and all identified potential problems were addressed.  Written operating procedures for hydrofluoric acid storage, handling, and transfer are in place.  All persons working with hydrofluoric acid or hydrofluoric acid containing equipment have been trained on operating procedures and understand the consequences of deviation from the procedures.  A preventive maintenance, inspection, and testing program is in place for hydrofluoric acid equipment and operations.\n\n\n5.  Five-year Accident History\n\nOne incident involving hydrofluoric acid occurred within the last five years.  The incident resulted in a release of hydrofluoric acid to an on-site storm sewer that ultimately drained into a nearby creek.  No human health effects were noted for the incident.  Incident investigation immediately followed the event and involved all appropriate maintenance and operating personnel, engineers and management.  All incident report findings and recommendations were addressed and resolved.  These included recommendations to prevent such an occurrence from happening again.\n\n\n6.  Emergency Response Program\n\nAK Steel Butler Works has trained employees for emergency response and maintains a written emergency response plan.  The plan is coordinated with Butler County (Pennsylvania) Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and the local Fire Departments.  The AK Steel response team trains annually and conducts annual drills for implementation of the emergency response plan at the facility.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of local fire department and outside emergency response personnel as needed.  Emergency responders including employees and off-site emergency and fire personnel have copies of the emergency response plan and are familiar with its use.  \n\n\n7.
