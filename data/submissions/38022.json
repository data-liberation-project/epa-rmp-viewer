Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\n\nWe at the Grimmway Enterprises, Inc. Plant are strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program and our process safety management program that addresses such critical safety issues as design, installation, operation procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the hazardous processes at our facility.  IT is our goal to implement appropriate control measures to prevent accidental releases of regulated substances.  \n\n2.   The Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled:\n\nOur facility\u00c2\u00bfs primary activities encompass vegetable cold storage.  We have 1 regulated substance present at our facility.  Substance one is Ammonia (anhydrous) and is used as a refrigerant in our plant. \n\nThe maximum inventory of Ammonia (anhydrous) at our facility is 31,000 lbs.\n\n3.  The Worst Case Release Scenarios and the Alternative Release Scenarios, including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distance for each reported scenario:  \n\nTo evaluate worst-case scenarios, we have used the EPA\u00c2\u00bfs OCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equation, the EPA\u00c2\u00bfs RMP Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration Reference Tables or Equation, and the RMP-COMP calculation program.\n\n4.  The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps: \n\nOur facility has taken all necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1967 Edition.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information:\nThe Grimmwa"

The most recent review/revision of management of change procedures was performed on 01/05/08.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or ay other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly make aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\nPre-startup Reviews:\nPre-startup safety reviews related to new processes and to modification in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at the Grimmway/David Road Facility.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation. \n\nCompliance Audits:\nThe Grimmway/David Road Facility conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  The next audit is scheduled for July 2004.  \n\nIncident Investigation:\nThe Grimmway/David Road Facility promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance. These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading into the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from re-occurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years. \n\nEmployee Participation:\nThe Grimmway/David Road Facility truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements. In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility\u00c2\u00bfs implementation of the RMP rule, including information from process hazard analys"

Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out.  The Grimmway/David Road Facility has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related to the contractor\u00c2\u00bfs work and the processes.  Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur. \n\n5.  Five Year Accident History:\n\nThe Grimmway/David Road Facility has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases during Grimmway's ownership.  There was one release during a previous ownership.  The release took place on 7/26/1999 and involved 50 lbs. Of Ammonia (anhydrous).  No deaths or injuries occurred offsite as a result of this accident.  Onsite, there were no deaths or injuries.\n \n6.  Emergency Response Plan:\n\nThe Grimmway/David Road Facility carries a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials. The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuation procedures, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as past incident decontamination of affected areas.\n\nGrimmway Enterprises also maintains a fully stocked hazardous materials response van as well as highly trained complement of hazardous response first responders, technicians, and incident commanders.  To ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  All response team members receive annual refresher training.  In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect pertinent changes taking place in our processes that would require a modified emergency plan.\n\n7.
