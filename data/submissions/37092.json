The plan includes a regular preventive maintenance (mechanical integrity) for the ammonia system components, and a program for both pre-startup safety reviews and management of changes (MOC) to the ammonia refrigeration system.  The program also includes operating procedures for the safe operation of the refrigeration system, specific requirements for safe work practices (such as safe approaches to welding and similar hot work), and safety requirements for contractorswho may be hired to work on the refrigeration system.  Albertson's has a procedure in place for investigating incidents to ensure root causes are identified and corrective actions are taken to minimize the potential for recurrence of incidents.  The program also has a procedure for conducting compliance audits to ensure the PSM emergency response plan and places special emphasis on handling accidental releases of ammonia and coordination of emergency response with local fire departments and other emergency response organizations.",

Albertsons operates many retail grocery stores throughout the Southwest that are supplied through a distribution and transportation complex located in Tolleson, Arizona. The Albertsons Refrigerated Distribution Center #8220, located on this facility site employs over 450 people and uses anhydrous ammonia for refrigeration of the products in storage. Anhydrous ammonia is subject to EPA regulation under 40 CFR 68, Accidental Release Risk Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals.\nAlbertsons? Tolleson distribution center stores and uses anhydrous ammonia for refrigeration of grocery products in storage.  Albertsons? Tolleson distribution center has never experienced a release of ammonia involving consequences that affected residents or the environment.\nPursuant to the RMP regulations (40 CFR 68) and the Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations, Albertsons has developed a comprehensive PSM written program to protect employees and the surrounding community from exposure to the hazardous chemicals onsite.  The facility completed a process hazards analysis (PHA) for ammonia using the industry standard What-If?/Checklist Analysis developed through the International Institute for Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR). The PHA was completed using technical and operations staff from the Tolleson facility as well as experienced facilitators from an outside engineering firm (ERM-West, Inc.), and was revalidated to meet PSM and RMP requirements in 2001.\nAlbertsons? implementation of the PSM program includes employee education in the hazards of ammonia and measures that can be used to reduce employee and community exposure to accidental releases of ammonia. The plans include preventive maintenance programs (mechanical integrity) for the ammonia system, and a program for both pre-startup safety reviews and management of changes (MOC) to this system.

Although such a release is highly unlikely, the regulation requires this review.  \nAlbertsons is committed to minimizing accidental releases of ammonia from the refrigeration process at the Tolleson distribution center.  Facility management is involved in the design, operation, and maintenance of the system.  Albertsons? employees have been involved in the development of the PSM and RMP programs.  Management has committed to working with local agencies and the community to educate the public regarding the hazards of ammonia and to ensure a safe workplace and surrounding community.  Specific questions regarding RMP compliance at Albertsons should be addressed to Albertsons? Environmental Affairs Department.  \nAlbertsons has prepared this RMP in accordance with the requirements imposed by the April 2004 revisions to the RMP regulations."
