Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at City of Eden, Robert A. Harris Water plant are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Filtration and production of drinking water.  We have 1 regulated substance present at our facility.  These substances include and Chlorine.  Chlorine is used for bacterial disinfection.\n\nThe maximum inventory of Chlorine at our facility is 22000.00 lb.\n\n3.    The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equations.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from Chlorine Disinfection.  In this scenario 2000 lb. of Chlorine is released.  The toxic liquid released is assumed to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to evaporate over 10 minutes.  The released quantity has been limited to 9.1% of the maximum capacity of the source by a system of administrative controls.  At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 5.4 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0"

      "SummaryText": ".0087 mg/L.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Chlorine involves a release from Chlorine Disinfection.  The scenario involves the release of 50 lb. of chlorine gas .  Toxic gas is assumed to be released to from a hole or connection producing a small leak.  The 180 minutes the estimated time would take the responding agency to be on site and stop the leak.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L of Chlorine is 0.07 miles.\n\n4.    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1967 Edition.    The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nCity of Eden, Robert A. Harris Water plant maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is Checklist, HAZOP and Fault Tree.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of 24 months.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  The most recent PHA/update was performed on 06/09/1999.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, City of Eden, Robert A. Harris Water plant maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial st"

The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nCity of Eden, Robert A. Harris Water plant has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every 2 years and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nCity of Eden, Robert A. Harris Water plant carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at City of Eden, Robert A. Harris Water plant to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  The most recent review/revision of maintenance procedures was performed on 06/09/1999.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at City of Eden, Robert A. Harris Water plant.  The most recent review was performed on 03/24/1998.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equi"
