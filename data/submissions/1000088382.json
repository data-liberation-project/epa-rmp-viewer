Employees are trained to these SOPs and are re-trained whenever any changes are made.\n\n-    Employees are required to wear standard site PPE which includes flame resistant clothing.\n\n-    A visual inspection is required prior to each use to the transfill system. Once the visual inspection is completed, a leak check is performed using helium. Lastly, a vacuum leak check is performed.\n\n-    Maintenance Team performs preventative maintenance.\n\n-    During transfilling, only the required amount of Silane is valved open on the bulk tank to minimize any potential escape in case of a leak; helps reduce response time on bulk tank.\n\n-    Silane system is continuously monitored when in use.\n\n-    Emergency shutdown buttons are located near the system in case of an emergency.\n\n-    Fire detection/suppression system is in place at the transfill area as well as the bulk source.\n\n-    The bulk source is staged in an area with three fire walls.\n\n-    The Silane filling system is in a Class 1, Division II room.\n\n-    Silane system is shut down and isolated at the end of each workday.\n\n-    The Silane system has minimal threaded connections and connections are welded wherever possible. Piping material is 316L stainless steel and the system incorporates double seal design which provides the highest leak free integrity.\n\n-    Silane transfilling is monitored by both weight and pressure using calibrated scales and gauges. This cross-reference between weight and pressure minimizes the possibility of an overfill condition to occur.\n\n-    Any changes to the process require a Management of Change, a Process Hazard Assessment, and potentially a ready to operate review (RTOR).\n\n\n\n",

Once the visual inspection is complete a leak check is performed using helium. Lastly, a vacuum leak check is performed.\n\n-    BCl3 ton room has fixed air monitoring.\n\n-    BCl3 system is shut down and isolated at the end of each workday.\n\n-    The BCl3 system is constructed of 316L Stainless Steel.\n\n-    The BCl3 is monitored by both weight and pressure using calibrated scales and gauges. This cross-reference between weight and pressure minimizes the possibility of an overfill condition to occur.\n\n-    Any changes to the process require an MOC, a Process Hazard Assessment, and potentially a ready to operate review (RTOR).\n\n",

              "Description": "Process 7- DCS Transfilling\n\n-    Dichlorosilane (DCS) processes are covered in site Standard Operating Procedures (SOP).\n\n-    Employees are trained to these SOPs and are re-trained whenever any changes are made.\n\n-    Employees are required to wear standard site PPE which includes flame resistant clothing.\n\n-    A visual inspection is required prior to each use to the transfill system. Once the visual inspection is complete a leak check is performed using helium. Lastly, a vacuum leak check is performed.\n\n-    Maintenance Team performs preventative maintenance.\n\n-    During transfilling, only the required amount of DCS is valved open on the bulk tank to minimize any potential escape in case of a leak; helps reduce response time on bulk tank.\n\n-    DCS system is continuously monitored when in use.\n\n-    Emergency shutdown buttons are located near the system in case of an emergency.\n\n-    Fire detection/suppression system is in place at the transfill area as well as the bulk source.\n\n-    The DCS filling system is in a Class 1, Division II room\n\n-    DCS system is shut down and isolated at the end of each workday.\n\n-    The DCS system has minimal threaded connections and connections are welded wherever possible. Piping material is 316L stainless steel and the system incorporates double seal design which provides the highest leak free integrity.\n\n-    DCS transfilling is monitored by both weight and pressure using calibrated scales and gauges. This cross-reference between weight and pressure minimizes the possibility of an overfill condition to occur.\n\n-    Any changes to the process require a MOC, a Process Hazard Assessment, and potentially a ready to operate review (RTOR).\n\n",

At the plant, a stand alone building has been designated as a command post center where ER equipment is stored and emergencies can be managed. The building also contains the key contact information to communicate to outside agencies and local authorities.  The Emergency Response Team members have completed their initial 40 hour training requirement and also receive their annual required 8 hour refresher training.   Plant communicates with the Bucks County Emergency Management, the Bucks County LEPC and the Morrisville Fire Department. \n\n\n\nThe Morrisville Plant maintains a facility Emergency Action Plan that has been shared with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). The plan details the essential actions to take should an emergency occur.    Plant personnel conduct periodic drills. \n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\n\n\n\nAs is our policy at Air Liquide, we continue to review our process(es) for possible improvements to the process and to the operational methods and to evaluate new technology to lower risk. Air Liquide Morrisville, PA, conducts and resolves all findings from its PHA and other hazard analysis and utilizes a Management of Change Program to evaluate proposed changes prior to implementation. For example, Morrisville plans on \n\n1) Increasing labeling of process piping; and, \n\n2) Reviewing and revising the facility mecha"
