It is the policy of The Sara Lee Bakery Group to comply with all applicable federal, state and local environmental and safety laws and regulations, and to conduct its business in an environmentally sound manner that avoids any unreasonable adverse impact on the environment or its neighboring community.\n\nIn keeping with this policy, The Sara Lee Bakery Group has developed and implemented a risk management program to ensure the safety of its employees and the neighboring community.  The risk management program includes procedures to (1) identify potentially hazardous chemicals at the facility, (2) for maintaining a safe working environment and, thereby, help prevent the release of hazardous chemicals, and (3) for minimizing the consequences of a release should one occur.\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nSara Lee Bakery Group Fort Payne facility makes various bread, bagel, and snack cake products.  The major processes at the Fort Payne facility include flour handling and storage, ingredient mixing, dough proofing, bread baking, product packaging and distribution.  Raw materials are delivered to this facility by trucks.\n\nThe only RMP regulated chemical handled by Sara Lee Bakery Group at the Fort Payne facility is anhydrous ammonia.  Anhydrous ammonia is used at the facility in the refrigeration system for cooling the building, making ice, and freezing products.  The anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system is a closed loop system.   Anhydrous ammonia is delivered to the facility by supplier tank trucks to initially charge the system and occasionally thereafter to top-off the system during hot weather conditions.  \n\nSara Lee Bakery Group has in place policies that limit the amount of ammonia at the facility.  In addition, this facility"

Ammonia is also subject to OSHA\u00bfs Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations; therefore this chemical is subject to the RMP Program Level 3 requirements.\n\nWorst-Case and Alternate-Case Release Scenarios\n\nThe Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario have been completed as discussed in the following text.\n\nTo evaluate both the worst case and alternative release scenarios, EPA's Areal Locations of Hazardous Atmospheres [ALOHA(R)] was utilized exclusively. The [ALOHA(R)] model is referenced in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance as an acceptable model for the mathematical approximation process. \n\nAs specified in the RMP Guidance, the worst case and alternate case release scenarios have been calculated and the results of the calculations are on file at the Sara Lee Bakery Group. Public and environmental receptors that could possibly be affected by the scenarios were determined through the use of LANDVIEW 5 mapping system software and US Census Bureau 2000 data. \n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe Sara Lee Bakery Group Fort Payne facility is subject to both EPA\u00bfs Accidental Release Prevention program and OSHA\u00bfs Process Safety Management (PSM) program.  Under both of these programs, the facility has outlined specific procedures that it follows to prevent or minimize the release of anhydrous ammonia to the environment.  Specifically, the facility has performed a process hazard analysis (PHA) of the ammonia system and will repeat this process at least every 5 years.  The purpose of the PHA is to provide a systematic approach for identifying, evaluating, and controlling potential hazards associated with the ammonia system.  In addition, the facility performs regular training of its employees to ensure that the pro"

      "SummaryText": "cedures developed for the safe use and handling of ammonia is adhered to all the time.  Finally, the facility has a regular inspection and maintenance program to ensure that the ammonia system is operating according to specific safety standards.  Sara Lee Bakery Group believes that safe operating practices and accident prevention are the way to do business everyday.\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nSara Lee Bakery Group Fort Payne facility has had one accidental release of ammonia in the last 5 years.  The release occurred on November 2, 1999 when the casing on a solenoid valve failed causing the release of anhydrous ammonia into the engine room of the bakery.  Due to the effective emergency response procedures in place at Sara Lee Bakery Group Fort Payne facility, the amount of ammonia released to the atmosphere was significantly minimized. \n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nSara Lee Bakery Group Fort Payne facility has developed a written emergency response program for the ammonia system and has provided training to its employees on its implementation.  In the event of an emergency involving the ammonia system, it is Sara Lee Bakery Group policy to immediately notify the Fort Payne Fire Department and request that they respond to the situation.  Sara Lee Bakery Group has discussed this policy with the Fort Payne Fire Department and has a written letter of agreement that outlines how emergency responses will be handled.  Sara Lee Bakery Group has confirmed with the fire department that they have the necessary equipment and training to respond effectively to an accidental release of ammonia from this facility.  Members of the local fire department have also performed inspections of the ammonia system at the facility."
