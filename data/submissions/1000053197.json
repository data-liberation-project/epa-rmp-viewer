Conducting business in a manner that wins public confidence and meets the environmental and economic needs of the communities we serve is critical to our long-term success. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, including the design, construction, operation and maintenance of our facilities, as well as in the training or our employees. Our policy is to implement the necessary controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. If a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release, thereby reducing potential impact on the surrounding community.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\r\n\r\nINEOS Polypropylene, LLC is co-located with Marathon's Los Angeles Refinery in Carson, California. The INEOS site employs approximately 80 people.  The INEOS plant processes propylene gas from the refinery to make polypropylene.  The site has been manufacturing polypropylene since 1999 and has capacity for storage in excess of 25 million pounds; the site produces more than 450 million pounds of product per year.  \r\n\r\nThe INEOS site has one covered process, a flammable mixture of propane and propylene.  \r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the INEOS Polypropylene LLC site.  This summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management systems in place to implement the accident prevention program.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\n\r\nThe INEOS site provides for and encourages employees"

The polypropylene process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards. The site uses the HAZOP (hazard and operability) analysis method and other approved Process Hazard Analysis methods to perform these evaluations.\r\n\r\nThe analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. The hazards of the process, identification of previous incidents involving accidental release or potential for such, engineering and administrative controls and failure of such, and human factors will be addressed by the team performing the hazard analysis. The findings and recommendations of the team are submitted to area management to assess the likelihood of the potential hazards, assess the severity of the consequences from potential releases, and assign priority for implementation of recommendations. The recommendations and progress towards implementation is followed using a computerized tracking system. The final resolution of findings are documented and retained.\r\n\r\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, INEOS periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer in operation. The results and findings from these updates"

The operating procedures are available to employees working in or near the covered process area.  The operating procedures are reviewed by supervision before scheduled activities (e.g. scheduled start-ups and shutdowns, scheduled on-line maintenance) are completed and when supervision believes that the current procedure should be modified to better execute the planned activities.  Critical procedures such as unit emergency procedures are reviewed annually during annual training sessions.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\n\r\nINEOS Polypropylene LLC has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating or maintaining the covered process.  Initial training includes health and safety training, an overview of the covered process, and process fundamentals.  Job specific training is also given to operators assigned to an operating unit. This training includes specific safety and health hazards, emergency operations including shutdown and safe work practices applicable to the operator's job tasks.\r\n\r\nJob specific training includes on-the-job training, a written manual, written tests, observations, and written sign-off. The site also has ongoing refresher and supplemental training for all personnel. Testing is conducted for all job specific training. Once an operator is qualified in a position, they are required to recertify for the job every three years. Testing is conducted on all OSHA-required safety and health training.

Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the site has procedures in place to ensure that contractors 1) perform their work in a safe manner, 2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, 3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, 4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, 5) understand and follow site safety rules, and 6) inform personnel of any hazards that they find during their work. This is accomplished by providing contractors with a process overview, information about site safety and health hazards, emergency response plan requirements, and safe work practices prior to their beginning work. Additionally, all contractors that work on site must have completed an orientation training that provides a standardized baseline of safety and health training for all contractors.  Recertification to demonstrate knowledge of the required subject areas is required every two years. In addition, the site evaluates contractor safety programs and performance as one of the key criteria for selection of a contractor to perform work. Site personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\r\n\r\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews\r\n\r\nA pre-startup safety review is conducted at the site for any new/modified facilities where modification necessitates a change in the process safety information. The pre-startup review is used to confirm that prior to the introduction of hazardous materials to a process, the following take place: 1) construction and modification are in accordance with design specifications and applicable codes; 2) safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency procedures are in place and adequate; 3) training of each operating employee and maintenance worker has been completed; and 4) process hazard analysis recommendations have been resolved or actions necessary for startup have been completed.

This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented. Changes are reviewed to ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and to verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes. In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation\r\n\r\nINEOS Polypropylene LLC promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in personal injury, spills, fire/explosion, release of a toxic or flammable material, major property damage, or environmental damage. The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to management for resolution.

The investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings. Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHA's and PHA revalidations.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits\r\n\r\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, audits of the PSM and RMP program are conducted at least every three years to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.  The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and audit reports are maintained for review in subsequent audits.\r\n\r\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nThe accident prevention program is applied to the covered process at the INEOS Polypropylene site.  These prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures or human error. In addition to these prevention program activities, the site has safety features on many units to help 1) contain/control a release, 2) quickly detect a release, and 3) reduce the consequences of a release. The following types of safety features are used in various processes:\r\n\r\nRelease Detection\r\n\u00b7Hydrocarbon detectors with alarms\r\n\r\nRelease Containment/Control\r\n\u00b7Pressure relief valves \r\n\u00b7Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual and automatic)\r\n\u00b7Automated shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high level, high temperature\r\n\u00b7Redundant equipment and instrumentation\r\n\r\nRelease Mitigation\r\n\u00b7Fire suppression and extinguishing systems\r\n\u00b7Trained emergency response personnel\r\n\u00b7Personal protective equipment (protective clothing, self -contai"

Due to proactive efforts to prevent accidents and a strong safety program, there have been no incidents in the past 5 years with onsite or offsite effects involving an uncontrolled release of a regulated flammable material that meet the reporting criteria of the EPA RMP or Cal-ARP Rules. \r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\n\r\nINEOS Polypropylene LLC has an Emergency Response Plan or Emergency Action Plan (EAP) in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The Emergency Response Team for the INEOS site is comprised of INEOS and Marathon Refinery employees, with INEOS members taking the lead roles for incidents pertaining to their own site.  Team members wear dual hats as both operations and first response for emergencies that occur on site.  INEOS management staff also has responsibilities under the Emergency Operations Center activities.  Response team members receive training in the emergency response procedures as necessary to perform their specific duties. The plan is updated when necessary, based on modifications made to the process or site.  The overall emergency response plan for the site is coordinated with the Los Angeles County Fire Department. \r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nINEOS Polypropylene LLC is committed to operating excellence in the way we conduct our business and the way we relate to the environment. The company has implemented a system that provides a mechanism for self-assessment and a direction for continuous improvement within our operations."
