(WITA) stores and distributes cases of aerosol spray cans containing flammable propellants, paints lubricants and sealants.  WITA is listed as being included in Code 423710 Hardware Merchant Wholesalers under The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS).\r\nOne covered process is present at the facility and has been identified as falling under the requirements of RMP/PSM/TCPA based upon federal and state regulations:\r\n\u00bf\tAerosol Spray Can Storage and Distribution\r\nSince  the concentration of the flammable substances is one percent or greater by weight of the mixture, and the mixture is under pressure,  for purposes of determining whether a threshold quantity is present at the facility, the entire weight of the mixture is treated as the regulated substance (unless the mixture itself does not have a National Fire Protection Association flammability hazard rating of 4).  The threshold for the applicable regulations is:\r\nRegulation\tMaterial\tThreshold (lbs)\r\nRMP\tFlammable\t10,000\r\nPSM\tFlammable\t10,000\r\nTCPA\tFlammable\t10,000\r\n\r\n\r\nSince the facility is planning to have a maximum storage capability of 150,000 lbs. the facility is preparing a Program 3 Risk Management Program under the New Jersey TCPA regulations.  The TCPA program will assure compliance with the above regulations.\r\nSummary of Security Plan\r\nProcedural and physical security measures are in place to deter, detect and delay a threat.  The complete security plan is outlined and discussed in the WITA Security Plan and is considered confidential.  Some highlights of the plan include adequate illumination of the site; surveillance cameras, limited door/gate access and controlled access levels throughout the facility.\r\nThe facility is located on a roughly rectangular property at the end of Grant Street and across from another Wurth owned facility in Ramsey,"

These procedures are used as a reference by experienced team members and provide a basis for consistent training of new personnel.  These procedures are periodically reviewed and maintained as current and accurate. \r\nTraining\r\nTo complement the written procedures for operations, WITAhas implemented a specific training program for all employees potentially involved in working with Aerosol Spray Cans.  All training is been documented for each operator; supervisors verify that the operators understood the training.\r\nMaintenance\r\nWITA has developed procedures to maintain its facilities in a safe operating condition. Maintenance personnel have received training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure they can perform jobs in a safe manner. \r\nFive-Year Accident History\r\nWITA has had no AEROSOL SPRAY CANS accidents"
