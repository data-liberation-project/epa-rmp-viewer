The site is active in self-evaluation of its performance to ensure compliance with all safety and environmental regulations.\n\n\nNo accidents as defined by 40 CFR 68.42 have occurred at the facility in the past five years.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety include the connection of three(3) fluorine detectors and one(1) pressure switch to activate the fluorine shutdown actuated valve in the trailer connection."

Each tube contains 225 lbs. of fluorine (diluted with 80% nitrogen).  Each trailer contains 8 tubes.  There is a maximum of 2 tube trailers on site any given time.  Therefore, the maximum inventory of fluorine on site at any given time is 3600 lbs.  \n\nThe covered process starts with the transfer of fluorine from the tube trailer through a manifold system which connects one cylinder at a time and transfers the chemical to three reactors. Though each cylinder at the tube trailer may contain pressures of up to 2450 psig, the unloading system regulates the pressure to approximately 45 psig for delivery to the reactor system. The system is configured with an excess flow valve to prevent catastrophic failure and release of fluorine. The area is provided with detection sensors, audible and visible alarms, in case of an inadvertent release. As per RMP requirements, an offsite consequence analysis identifying a Worst Case and an Alternative Release scenario was performed, to determine their potential for off-site impact. Other Alternative Release Scenarios were also studied, and one was selected for RMP registration purposes.\n\n\nAccident Prevention Program\n\nTAPI Puerto Rico, Inc  is in compliance with the OSHA PSM rule.  The key prevention program is procedural/managerial.  An extensive Hazard and Operability study and subsequent revalidations have been conducted on the fluorine / fluorination reaction system.  The site has a strong maintenance program including calibrations, preventative maintenance"
