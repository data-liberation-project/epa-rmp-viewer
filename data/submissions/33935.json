This guidance complies with the United States Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Risk Managenment Program (RMP) regulations, 40 CFR Part 68, and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard 29 CFR 1910.119.\n\nSection 112( r ) requires facilities which store certain toxic or flammable chemicals above threshold quantities to develop and implement an RMP.  The RMP evaluates the worst case and alternative case release of these chemicals  into the environment and the impact on surrounding human populations and environmental receptors.  The worst case release scenario assumes that all of the toxic substance within a vessel, system or process is released at one time.  The alternative case scenario assumes a smaller, more realistic, release of perhaps on cylinder or container.  The RMP also evaluates the facility's resources to cope with chemical releases.  Although the RMP present worst case and alternative case scenarios, it should be noted that there has never been an incident at the ECRWWTF which resulted in any offsite consequences or injury to human health or the environment.\n\nThe ECRWWTF has an average capacity of 55 millions gallons per day (MGD), with an ultimate treatemnt and disposal capacity og 98 mgd.  The plant site consists of 300 acres.  The plant layout was specifically designed to take advantage of the prevailing southeastern sea breeze.  In this manner any odors created would be dissipated over the plant site and sparsely populated surrounding areas.  The ECRWWTF provides wastewater treatment service to five (5) government entities which participated in it development.  The following are the five (5) entities:  City of West Palm Beach, Town of Palm Beach, City of Riviera Beach, City of La"

The ECRWWTF currently serves 400,000 people in central Plam Beach County and nearby communties.\n\nThe ECRWWTF represents a cumulative investemnt of more than 70 million dollars since its inception in 1970.  The plant has undergone several expansions in its 34-year history.  The original aeration facility was constructed in two (2) stages and completed in 1980.  The original design provided a minimum of 90% biochemcial oxygen demand (BOD) and suspended solids removal prior to disposal of the effluent by deep well injection.  Between 1980 and 1986 improvements were made to the original facility.  In 1986, a major program was intitiated to reduce annual operating costs and to expand plant capacity.\n\nChlorine is the only chemical used at this facility at quantities above the EPS -- List of Regulated Toxic Substances and Threshold Quantities for Accidental Release Prevention, and thus chlorine is the basis of this RMP.  The ECRWWTF uses chlorine for emergency operations only, it is not used during normal operating conditions.  Chlorine is used in the disinfection phase of the wastewater treatment in times of an emergency.  The liquid effluent which is discharged from the clarifier enters the contact chamber.  At this time the effluent is treated with chlorine gas.  The chlorine is stored in 2,000 pound capacity containers as a liquid under pressure., but is discharged in to the wastewater as a gas.  The contact chamber has a series of baffles which ensure that chlorine will have a minimum reaction time or contact time of 15 minutes in order to mix the liquid to kill the pathogenic bacteria in the effluent and complete the disinfection process.\n\nChlorine is one of the chemical elements and is one of the halogens.  Neither gas nor the liquid is explosive or flammable, however, both reactive chemically with many sustances.  Chlorine is a hazardous chemical that can cause severe injury or death if released into the atmosphere.  Chlorine gas i"

At higher levels there is vomiting associated with labored breathing.  In extreme cases difficulty breathing may increase to the point where death can occur from suffocation.\n\nChlorine is also hazardous to the environment.  Chlorine causes bleached spots on leafy palnts due to an attack on chlorophyll in the leaf.  Mammanlian animals suffer many of the same effects as humans exposed to chlorine.  Many forms of aquatic animal life are adversely agffected by chlorine in concentrations well below 0.1 ppm, but harmful concentrations are unlikely unless chlorine is discharged directly in to the water."
