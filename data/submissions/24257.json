      "SummaryText": "(a) Who - Winneshiek Cooperative Association (WCA) is an organization owned by crop growers and\n     livestock producers in NE Iowa and SE Minnesota.  The member-owners of WCA benefit from having \n     strategically located fertilizer, feed and grain facilities in Winneshiek and Howard (Iowa) counties.\n\n     Being owned by farmers, WCA does everything it can to protect and preserve the environment.  The \n     members, management and employees of WCA are committed to the prevention of any accidental \n     releases of anhydrous ammonia (NH3) or any other hazardous material.  In the event an accidental \n     release occurs, the Burr Oak facility is well prepared to work with the local fire department, or other \n     authorities, to mitigate any releases and minimize the impact of the relaease to people and the \n     environment.\n\n     All applicable procedures of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency prevention programs are strictly \n     adhered to.  The WCA Emergency Response Policy involves the preparation of response plans which \n     are tailored ot each facility and to the emergency response capabilities of the community they're located \n     in.\n\n(b) What and Where - The Burr Oak branch of WCA handles Anhydrous Ammonia (NH3) as one of the \n     most economical sources of nitrogen fertilizer for corn.  The Burr Oak location serves corn growers \n     from SE Minnesota as well as NE Iowa.  The Burr Oak branch includes the NH3 plant, a dry fertilizer \n     plant, liquid fertilizer tanks, a bagged feed, seed and crop protection product warehouse and a small  \n     country gas station with a short line of groceries and beverages for sale.  The NH3 is stored in a \n     30,000 gallon bulk tank.  The tank, with a maximum capacity of 154,500 pounds of NH3, is mounted on \n     two cement pillars.  There may also be as many as 42 one thousand gallon nurse tanks and 3 fifteen\n     hundred gallon nurse tanks belonging to this location.  This increases the maximum capacity"

      "SummaryText": "by an additional 239,475 pounds.  Occasionally, several additional nurse tanks from another location \n     may be placed on this site also.  However, the maximum capacity at this location is 393,975 pounds.  \n     This exceeds the normal operating maximum.  Because of concerns for mishaps due to pressure, all \n     vessels are filled to a capacity of no more than 85%.  The entire NH3 handling process includes the \n     latest safety products, with many of the safeguards duplicated to assure extra protection.  The NH3 \n     facility is inspected on a daily basis during the spring planting and fall harvest seasons.  All of the NH3 \n     equipment is inspected annually by State officials.  Much of the non-durable equipment (including \n     hoses, safety valves) are replaced on a regular basis most of the time long before required to be \n     replaced by other state and federal standards.  The Burr Oak branch is manned with staff on site \n     seven days a week.\n\n(c)  Worst case and alternate accidental release scenarios - The offsite consequence analysis includes \n     two accidental release theories, found as \"worst case release\" and \"alternative release scenario.\"The \n     worst case scenario is defined by EPA, which states that \"the owner or operator shall assume that the \n     ... maximum quantity in the largest vessel ... is released as a gas over 10 minutes\" due to an \n     unspecified failure.  This accidental release is very unlikely to occur.  However, should it occur, \n     154,500 pounds of NH3 would be released, with a toxic end point (0.14 mg/L) reached at 5.6 miles \n     down wind from the facility.\n\n     The alternative release scenario is defined as \"more likely to occur\" than the worst case scenario.  With \n     no accident history experience to base on, it is WCA's presumption the most likely to occur would be \n     the rupture of a transfer hose or pipe, tied with the failure of the involved excess flow valve.  The toxic \n     end point (0.14 m"

The public \n     population within the \"toxic endpoint distance\" of the Ridgeway facility is defined as the \"population \n     potentially affected\" by a worst case toxic release.\n\n     Because NH3 is not stored within a building, no passive mitigation measures can be credited to slow or \n     reduce any release.\n\n(d)  How to prevent accidental releases - WCA's accidental raelease prevention program is based upon \n     provisions within \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1,\" \n     published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc. and OSHA 29CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and \n     Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.\"  In addition to these requirements, WCA has also included the \n     following elements:\n\n     1.  Strictly limiting the number of staff who are allowed to handle NH3  \n     2.  Annual, thorough, strict safety and handling training of all people involved NH3\n     3.  All valve handles, controls and electrical switches are secured and/or locked to prevent \n          unauthorized releases and/or the overfilling of the main bulk tank.\n     4.  All pipelines have redundant as well as triple redundant valves and locking for security and safety.  \n     5.  Strict enforcement of all parts replacement policies mandated by state and federal officials.\n     6.  Rigorous inspection of each portable NH3 tank during loading.\n     7.  Thorough inspections of all NH3 application equipment before spring application season, after fall \n          application season and before being transported betwen farmers.\n\n(e)  No accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia have occurred at this facility in the past five years.\n\n(f)  Emergency Response Program - Safety improvements at WCA are an on-going process.  WCA has an \n      extensive emergency response program, which it coordinates with the Winne"
