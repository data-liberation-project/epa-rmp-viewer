The estimated maximum number of nurse tanks is 62 -- 1000 gallon nurse trailers and up to 15-- 1500 gallon nurse trailers.  At the maximum of 85% of capacity, the total pounds of anhydrous ammonia present at any one time could be 373,490.      \n\nOperating procedures for maintenance of ammonia nurse trailers have been updated as of 10/01/02.  Maintenance and inspections are performed using a check list of operating and safety equipment on the trailer plus an assessment of the overall condition of the trailer and tank, including paint.  \n\n3.  The accidental release prevention program.\n\nThe facility has implemented most of the provisions of Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1, published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29  CFR 1910.111, Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.  The governing regulations are put forth by the Kansas Department of Agriculture and the facility is inspected on a regular basis by company personnel, inspectors from the Kansas Department of Agriculture, and representatives of the Company's insurance carrier.  Important differences between ANSI standards and KDA regulations involve color coding of valves which are being done to all trailers during scheduled maintenance.  Maintenance schedules are determined by color coding of the dust caps on the wheels of the nurse tanks with a full inspection and repairs as needed on a four year cycle.  Each year, the color of the painted dust cap is changed.  With knowledge of what colors have been used in the past, the year when general maintenance was last performed can be determined.  The Company has adopted a plan to bring all equipment into compliance with the full ANSI standard"
