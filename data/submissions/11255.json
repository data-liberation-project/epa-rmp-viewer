If credit had been taken for this safety equipment, the distance to the toxic endpoint would be less than 700 feet or such that no one outside the plant boundary would be exposed to hydrogen fluoride.\n\nThe WCS (worse case scenario) associated with the release of a flammable substance involves the release of largest inventory, in a single vessel, (as allowed by administrative controls) of vinyl chloride monomer (VCM).  No credit was taken for active mitigation measures when evaluating this scenario.  Therefore, the maximum allowable single vessel inventory allowed to release under established administrative controls is 6,400,000 pounds.  This inventory is assumed to vaporize and ignite, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) which would result in a maximum distance to the 1-psi overpressure endpoint of 1.1 miles.\n\nThe ARS for flammable substances at the LCCC over a 60-minute time period (the time required to empty the tank) is the release of 160,000 pounds of pentane from a 2-inch diameter hole in a pentane storage vessel.

This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, training of highly qualified personnel, and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent chemical releases.  However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control, contain, and mitigate the release.\n\nCONDEA Vista is committed to Responsible Care(r) voluntary initiative for safe management of chemicals.  CONDEA Vista follows the Responsible Care(r) Code of Management Practice, which is integral to the implementation of the CONDEA Vista Environmental and Health and Safety policies.  The Responsible Care(r) Community Awareness Code of Management Practice and CONDEA Vista's Community Awareness and Emergency Response policies are designed to assist emergency preparedness and to faster community right to know.\n\nCONDEA Vista's Lake Charles Chemical Complex (LCCC) located in Westlake, Louisiana uses natural gas by-products from refinery operations and chlorine as the primary raw materials to produce specialty chemicals for detergents, cosmetics, and plastics.  The chemical complex uses or produces several regulated flammables such as ethylene, vinyl chloride monomer, propane, butane, propylene, ethane, butene, hydrogen, methane, and pentane.  In addition, the Chemical Complex uses ethylene oxide, hydrochloric acid, and hydrofluoric acid, which are also regulated substances.  Other regulated chemicals used in our process, which are stored below the threshold quantity, are chlorine, sulfur dioxide and ammonia.\n\nThe worse case scenario (WCS) associated with a toxic substance handled at the Lake Charles Chemical Complex (LCCC) involves cata"

Although we have numerous controls to prevent such a release and to manage the consequences, no credit for administrative controls or passive mitigation measures was taken into account when evaluating this scenario.  Look up tables published by USEPA were used to determine the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint.  Based on these Look-up tables, maximum distance to the scenario endpoint of 20-ppm (milligrams per liter) for the worse case scenario is 25 miles.\n\nThe alternative case scenario (ARS) for hydrogen chloride is the release of hydrogen chloride vapor over a 15-minute period from a one-inch hole in a process line that contains hydrogen chloride. The 15-minute release duration is the maximum time necessary to block off and transfer to storage the hydrogen chloride contained in the process line thus stopping the release.  No other mitigation measures other than to empty the process line were taken into account when evaluating this scenario.\n\nA dense phase dispersion model PHAST developed by Det Norse Veritas (DNV) was used to determine the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 20-ppm (0.28 milligrams per liter) to be 1.02 miles.\n\nOther chemicals listed in the EPA's list of toxic chemicals which are maintained on site at the LCCC above EPA's threshold quantity are ethylene oxide and hydrogen fluoride\n\nThe alternative case scenarios (ARS) for ethylene oxide is the failure of a 3/4 inch nozzle on a process line.

Process changes that are determined to be a replacement in kind (e.g. replacing a valve with an identical valve) are allowed without completing a full management of change program.  All other changes must be confirmed through a full management of change program to help ensure process safety information and procedures are updated, and affected employees are notified of the change.\n\nPre-Startup Safety Review (PSSRs)\n\nThe Lake Charles Chemical Complex (LCCC) conducts a safety review of a new or modified process before the process is placed in service.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure the safety features, procedures, personnel and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment in service.  The review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe Lake Charles Chemical Complex (LCCC) has well established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, emergency shutdown systems, and rotating equipment (pumps and compressors) in a safe operating condition.  The basic aspects of this program include (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies and, (5) applying quality assurance measures.  In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.\n\nMaintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response pl"

Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended, and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g. adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels). If a deficiency is identified, the equipment will be repaired in a timely manner.  All outstanding deficiencies are tracked until such time a final solution has been implemented and documented.\n\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance.  The LCCC incorporates quality assurance into equipment purchase and repairs. This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\nSafe Work Practices\n\nThe Lake Charles Chemical Complex (LCCC) has a long-standing safe work program in place to ensure worker safety.  Examples of the program include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) lockout/tagout procedures to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) procedures for safe removal of hazardous materials before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedures to conduct spark producing activities (i.e, hot work), and (5) a permit and procedures to ensure  that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.  These procedures, along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nThe Lake Charles Chemical Complex (LCCC) investigates all incidents that could reasonably have resulted in a serious injury to personnel, the public, or the environment so similar incidents can be prevented. The LCCC trains employees to identify and report any incident requiring investigation.  The investigation is initiated within 4"

In addition, there was one event that did not result in any offsite consequences but did result in three minor onsite injuries.  The four events are as follows:\n* January 24,1995-Accidental release of hydrogen chloride, vinyl chloride monomer, and ethylene dichloride.  No injuries, exposure to toxic chemicals or property damage either offsite or within a the boundaries of the complex occurred as a result of the release. As a precaution,. approximately 1000 people were sheltered in place. \n* March 10, 1995 - Accidental release of hydrogen chloride, vinyl chloride monomer, and ethylene dichloride.  One person on-site was treated and released and on-site damage was minimal. No injuries, exposure to toxic chemicals, property damage or environmental damage occurred off-site as a result of this release.  As a precaution, approximately 5000 people were sheltered in place as a result of this release.\n* August 10,1996 - Accidental release of hydrogen chloride and chlorine.  Three employees were treated for exposure to hydrogen chloride and chlorine before returning to work.  No exposure to toxic chemicals, injuries, property damage or environmental damage occurred off-site as a result of the release.  Because the release was easily contained,  no one was sheltered in place.\n* June 5, 1997 - Accidental release of hydrogen chloride.  No injuries, exposure to toxic chemical, or property damage either off-site or within the boundaries of the complex occurred as a result of this release. As a precaution,  1000 people were sheltered in place.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe Lake Charles Chemical Complex (LCCC) emergency response program has been developed to meet the emergency planning, response, and notification requirements of the following regulations:\n* OSHA 29 CFR 1910.38 (a) - Employee Emergency Action"
