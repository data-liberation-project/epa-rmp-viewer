This commitment is embraced by each member of our team, no matter what position or area. Our active role includes an obligation to point out any deficient safety or environmental practices that are observed anytime, anywhere. Positive reinforcement will be our primary motivation tool to benchmark satisfactory performance. Safety hazards or environmental concerns are exposed and relayed to team members without fear of reprisal or resentment. Great safety and environmental records are a team effort.\n\n\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED:\n\n\n\nThe facility is located on a nominal 7 acre site, with paved shipping and receiving areas. The major structures and their designated functions are: Warehouse w/ docks; Receiving Area w/ docks; Machinery Spaces; Production Areas; Coolers; and Warehouses. The facility produces cheese products. The facility operates two (2) anhydrous ammonia refrigeration systems. While the quantity of ammonia in only one of the refrigeration systems exceeds the 10,000 pound threshold for RMP-regulated anhydrous ammonia, each system is managed as though it were subject to the Risk Management Program regulations. \n\n\n\nThe single-stage ammonia refrigeration system is used to cool a secondary cooling agent: food-grade glycol. This secondary cooling agent is circulated to various heat exchangers for space cooling, product cooling, and process equipment cooling. The refrigeration system is designed to provide: optimal safety performance (through the minimization of ammonia piping and equipment); operating flexibility (through the availability of multiple operating equipment combinations); economy and efficiency of operations (through the use of operating pressures commensurate with the degree of cooling required); and, consistency of operation, utilizing programmable logic control"

Major equipment components include: compressors, condensers, receivers, recirculators and heat exchangers.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM:\n\n\n\nThe facility has implemented a Process Safety Management program for its ammonia refrigeration process operation and maintenance. The PSM Program has been incorporated as both policy, and most importantly, procedure in everyday operations and maintenance of the ammonia refrigeration system. Among the many safety features present at the facility are:\n\n\n\n?    OSHA Process Safety Management and EPA Prevention Programs.\n\n?    Ammonia detection and alarm throughout the ammonia spaces.\n\n?    Eyewash and safety showers throughout ammonia distribution areas.\n\n?    Personal protective equipment, including emergency respirators.\n\n?    Emergency communication systems.\n\n?    Training Programs, such as Chemical Safety, Safe-Work Practices, and others.\n\n?    Plant Safety Committee, trained, involved, and motivated.\n\n?    Plant Safety Acknowledgement System.\n\n?    Monthly Safety Meetings.\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\n\n\n\nThere have been no accidents or injuries related to the ammonia refrigeration system during the past five years.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\n\n\n\nThe \"Emergency Action Plan\" has been developed to conform to the following regulations:\n\n?    Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), Process Safety Management (PSM) of Highly Hazardous Chemicals Requirements, (29.CFR 1910.119)\n\n?    Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), Employee Emergency Plans and Fire Prevention Plans,(29 CFR 1910.38(a)\n\n?    Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), Employee Alarm Systems, 29 CFR 1910.165\n\n?    Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Risk Management Programs for Chemical Accidental Release Prevention, (40 CFR Part 68)  \n\n\n\nThe plan addresses fire, explosion, spills or releases of toxics, severe weather, and other criteria.

The plan includes \"Emergency Response to Anhydrous Ammonia,\" specifically addressing incidents involving ammonia refrigeration.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\n\n\n\nThe facility is continually working to improve safety in all areas, as well as within the anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system. The facility encourages input from operation and maintenance personnel, as well as vendor and agency inspectors, and responds to address potential improvements. The facility places a high emphasis upon training of personnel in the areas of safety and environmental awareness, compliance, and response.\n\n"
