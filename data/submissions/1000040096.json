The regulated substance that is the subject of this RMP is anhydrous ammonia used in the refrigeration system.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and  Chemical Specific Prevention Steps:\n\nIn accordance with RMP regulations, the general accidental release prevention program for this facility's ammonia refrigeration system is comprised of the following components: process safety informaiton, process hazard analysis, operating procedures, operator training, procedures for maintaining mechanical integrity, procedures for managing system changes, pre-start up safety review procedures, procedures for investigating release incidents, and hot work permit protocols.  This program was developed with the participation of the affected employees, and will be periodically audited for compliance as required by the RMP regulations.  In addition, the facility has in place procedures for notifying contractors and their employees of the hazards of the system.  Chemical specific prevention steps are included within the program, including engineering and administrative control designed to prevent and minimize accidental releases.\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History:\n\nIn the previous five years, this facility has not had any accidetal releases of ammonia which have resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant p"

The facility is included in the LEPC's community emergency response plan.  The facility is currently deemed a non responding facility under the RMP regulations and the facility's RMP, which means that the local Hazardous Materials Response Team, local fire departments, and other local emergency responsers have primary responsibility for responding to accidental releases of ammonia which pose a health or safety hazard to persons or property located on site or off site.  \n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\nThe most recent process hazard analysis was performed on 12/6/2012 as overall system PHA. All PHA recommendations were completed by 03/18/13. The facility continues to monitor and maintain it's PSM/RMP program through an organized PSM team chartered to ensure all elements of the PSM/RMP rpogram are in place."
