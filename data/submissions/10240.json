If you are interested in this\n       information, please contact the WCF at (734) 676-7775 and ask for the Woodhaven\n       Area Supervisor.\n\n  1.4  Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n       The following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at\n       the Woodhaven Cavern Facility. Because processes at the WCF that are regulated by\n       the EPA RMP regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health\n       Administration (OSHA) process safety management (PSM) standard, and because\n       the OSHA PSM requirements are very similar to the EPA RMP requirements, this\n       summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements.  The PSM program at this\n       facility has been extended by the WCF, where necessary, to satisfy EPA's Program\n       Level 3 accident prevention program requirements.\n\n       Employee Participation\n\n       WCF encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management\n       and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating\n       and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a\n       member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team, incident investigation, and\n       compliance audit teams.  Employees have access to all information created as part\n       of  WCF's accident prevention program. Specific ways that employees can be\n       involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee\n       participation plan that is main"

This information includes\n       materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating\n       of equipment, etc.  This information, in combination with written procedures and\n       trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance\n       activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure\n       that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n       Process Hazard Analysis\n\n       WCF has a comprehensive Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) program to help ensure\n       that hazards associated with the process are identified and controlled.  Within this\n       program, the covered process and future processes are systematically examined to\n       identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage those\n       hazards.\n\n       WCF primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to\n       perform this evaluation.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most\n       systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques available.  The analysis is\n       conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience\n       as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the\n       process as well as recommends accident prevention and/or mitigation measures when\n       the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\n       The PHA report is forwarded to the MAPL Eastern District Manager to review and\n       approve. A schedule is developed to address the PHA team's recommendations\n       (Action Items) in a timely and prioritized manner.  The final resolution and\n       completion of each Action Item is documented and retained at the WCF by\n       designated Op"
