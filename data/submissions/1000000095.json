This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nThe Holly Tulsa Refinery operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products (e.g. gasoline, fuel oil, propane, butane, lubricating oils, wax and coke) from raw crude oil. The refinery has several regulated flammables, such as propane, butane, etc. The refinery does not have any of the listed regulated toxic chemicals above the threshold quantity for reporting. The refinery's  process units containing RMP-covered flammable materials are considered a single program 3 covered process.\r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\r\n\r\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the Holly Tulsa Refinery. Because processes at the refinery that are regulated by the EPA RMP regulation are also subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each applicable OSHA PSM element and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\r\n\r\nEMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION\r\n\r\nThe Holly Tulsa Refinery encourages employees to participate in all elements of process safety management and accident prevention.

The refinery ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\r\n\r\nThe refinery also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\r\n\r\nPROCESS HAZARDS ANALYSIS (PHA)\r\n\r\nThe Holly Tulsa Refinery has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled. Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\r\n\r\nThe Holly Tulsa Refinery primarily uses the Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) analysis, What-If technique and Layers of Protection Analysis (LOPA) to perform these evaluations. HAZOP and What-If analysis are recognized as the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques. LOPA is a semi-quantitative risk assessment methodology that involves the quantitative evaluation of a qualitative hazard scenario(s) to determine if the existing safeguards are adequate. The analyses are conducted using a multi-disciplined team with experience backgrounds across the organization.

Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team. This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention. All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are complete. Resolution of items can be generally categorized as Procedures, Repairs of Existing Equipment, Engineering Studies and Installing new equipment. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\r\n\r\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the Holly Tulsa Refinery periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating. The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained. Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\r\n\r\nOPERATING PROCEDURES\r\n\r\nThe Holly Tulsa Refinery maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.
