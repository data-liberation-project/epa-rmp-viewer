      "SummaryText": "This executive summary provides a brief overview of the Risk Management Program (RMP) and the associated policies at the Waycross Water Pollution Control Plant, owned by the City of Waycross, GA and operated by ESG Operations, Inc.\r\n\r\n1.0 Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nESG Operations, Inc. believes it is important to provide a safe workplace to its employees and minimize the impact of its operations on the surrounding community and the environment.  Accordingly, ESG has developed proactive safety and environmental programs, which rely upon active employee participation and management leadership and support.  This same proactive philosophy was employed in the development and implementation of the Waycross WPCP RMP for the chlorine and sulfur dioxide systems.  ESG Operations, Inc. has determined that the OSHA Process Safety Management standard also applies to the chlorine and sulfur dioxide storage and chlorination/dechlorination process and therefore has prepared this RMP to comply with the RMP Program 3 requirements.  By doing so, ESG affirms its proactive safety and environmental philosophy and acknowledges the inherent value of full RMP compliance.\r\n\r\nThe RMP prevention program is arguably the most important element of the rule.  Its program elements require the active participation of facility employees and management in conducting activities aimed at preventing accidental releases of chlorine, a regulated chemical under the RMP regulation.  If prevention activities could be completely successful, there would be no need for emergency response activities, since no releases would occur.  Accordingly, a well-developed and properly implemented prevention program will lower the possibility of an accidental release and minimize the consequences of a release should one occur.\r\n\r\nESG Operations, Inc. takes an active role in preventing accidental releases by ensuring that its employees are well-informed regarding the hazards associated wi"

ESG Operations, Inc has been operating the system since CY 2005 and the system was never been subject to the RMP requirements prior to CY 2008.  The quantity of chlorine stored onsite had historically been below the threshold trigger, however plant loading capacity required the storage of greater than the threshold trigger in CY 2008.  Additionally, the quantity of sulfur dioxide at the facility is expected to increase to near or above the threshold trigger and as such ESG has chosen to include sulfur dioxide as part of the RMP as well.  The employees working on the chlorine and sulfur dioxide systems are properly trained in the safe operation and handling of these systems.  Refresher training is provided to the employees annually.  They are aided in this work by standard operating procedures.\r\n\r\nESG Operations, Inc. management understands its duty to provide a safe working environment and to take measures to prevent accidents which may have an effect on the surrounding community.  Additionally, ESG Operations, Inc. has established procedures for emergency notification and response. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2.0 Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nThe Water Pollution Control Plant owned by the City of Waycross, GA is located in Blackshear, Georgia.  The facility treats 3.6 MGD daily average, 4.5 daily peak and 6.2 MGD storm peak of wastewater through a series of physical and chemical treatment operations.  Incoming wastewater initially passes through an automated screening and grit removal process before being passing through primary clarifiers, trickling filters, aeration, secondary clarification, sand filtration and is then pumped to the rapid  infiltration bed treatment plant for additional filtration.  Final effluent is disinfected by chlorination  and subject to dechlorination prior to discharge.  Solids are de-watered by belt filter press prior to landfill.\r\n\r\nThe Waycross"

The chlorine and sulfur dioxide are stored in one-ton cylinders.

The prevention program includes the following elements:\r\n\r\n3.1 Process safety information, which includes information pertaining to the hazards of chlorine in the process, process technology and process equipment.\r\n3.2 Process hazard analysis (PHA), which includes a systematic evaluation of the hazards of the chlorine and sulfur dioxide processes, identification of previous process incidents, engineering and administrative controls, consequences of failure of the engineering and administrative controls, facility siting, human factors, and possible safety and health effects of failure of controls.  A PHA was first performed in July 2008 and again in 2013.\r\n3.3 Operating procedures, which include steps for each operating phase, operating limits, safety and health considerations and safety systems and their functions.  The operating procedures were developed and validated in July 2008 and have been updated annually ever since.\r\n3.4 Training for each Waycross WPCP employee involved in operating the chlorine and dechlorination systemis complete and documented.\r\n3.5 Mechanical integrity procedures to maintain the on-going integrity of the chlorine process equipment.\r\n3.6 Management of change procedure to manage changes (other than replacements in kind) to the chlorine or sulfur dioxide system.

If the chlorine or sulfur dioxide sensors detect a specified level of chlorine or sulfur dioxide, alarms will be activated and a high rate ventilation system can be activated.  The ventilation system withdraws gas and air from a low elevation in the storage rooms to an outdoor location.  The alarm system is maintained and tested on a regular basis to ensure proper operation should there be a release.  Records of testing are maintained in the site maintenance management system - GBA.

The program is described in detail in the manual and meets the requirements of 40 CFR 68.95, which includes facility notification to emergency responders and evacuation procedures.  The goals of the program are to protect onsite employees from the hazardous effects of chlorine release and to minimize the effects of such releases on the general public.  This program is routinely reviewed and updated to reflect personnel and regulatory changes.\r\n\r\n6.0 Planned changes for Improved Safety\r\n\r\nIdeas for changes to improve safety are actively sought from employees.  Employee participation meetings which focus on safety issues are held regularly at the Waycross WPCP.  Employees are encouraged and trained to recognize hazards and to present ideas to eliminate them or to minimize the potential consequences of such hazards.\r\n\r\nAs part of the development of the Waycross WPCP RMP program, the initial PHA was performed in July 2008 with key employees to meet the prevention program requirements.
