Our commitment is supported by the resources invested in accident prevention, personnel training and the consideration of safety issues in the design, construction, operation and maintenance of our facilities. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to provide a safe operation and prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, trained compressor station personnel will respond to control and contain the release. All pressures and flows at this facility are monitored 24 hrs. /day at our Integrated Operations Control site located in Liberal, KS.\n\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nAnadarko Petroleum Corporation owns and operates the Hugoton Station Natural Gas Compressor facility located in half mile east of Hugoton on Highway 51. The Hugoton Station Natural Gas Compressor facility is regulated by the OSHA Process Safety Management program because of the total quantity of a highly hazardous substance (natural gas) which exceeds the 10,000 pound threshold, it is a manned facility and is in close proximity of a population center as specified by the Standard Code of Federal Regulation, Title 29, Part 1910.119. The facility is also subject to the EPA RMP Standard.\n\n\n\nThe operation of the Hugoton Station Natural Gas Compressor facility is to take natural gas from field compression in the surrounding fields and remove liquids present in the gas stream. Natural gas is then compressed and discharged into 20\" and 26\" sales pipelines leaving the facility. Hugoton Station Natural Gas Compressor facility currently processes approximately 47 MMCF of natural gas daily.\n\n\n\nNatural gas comes into the facility from the field through four, 16\" pipelines.

      "SummaryText": "uction from these pipelines is approximately 25 to 35 psig as it comes into the facility. In normal operations, all the natural gas from the four pipelines flows into scrubber vessel MBF-110, then into filter scrubber MAK-1120 and finally through scrubber vessel MBF-1060. All of these scrubber vessels are designed to remove liquids and/or contaminants before the gas goes into Main Engine Room (MER #3) to be compressed. A 24\" pipeline coming into the facility from the south with inlet pressure of 225 to 250 psig is identified as the Elkhart line. This gas goes through scrubber vessel MBF-1110 and into the 3rd stage suction of MER #2. Approximately 80 barrels of produced water and 30 to 40 barrels of condensate are separated from the gas flow per day.\n\n\n\nGas enters 1st stage of compression of unit CBA-5165 which increases the pressure of the gas to approximately 90 to 95 psig. Gas is discharged into the 1st stage cooling tower and out to scrubber vessel MBF-1070 dropping out any liquids. The gas then enters the 2nd stage suction of MER #3 and compressed a second time, discharged at a pressure of 225 to 250 psig then into 2nd stage cooling tower. The 1st and 2nd stage cooling towers are designed to keep the gas temperature from rising too high as it moves through the compression process to safely operate within equipment parameters. Generally, the gas temperature on the outlet of 2nd stage cooling tower is approximately 80 degrees F to 100 degrees F.\n\n\n\nThe gas leaves the 2nd stage cooling tower and flows into the glycol contact tower MAF-1550. This system uses the common regenerative glycol absorption process. Triethylene glycol (TEG) is used to absorb water vapor from the gas to meet the sales gas pipeline's quality specifications. The glycol stream that has absorbed water vapor flows to the regeneration system where it is filtered to remove contaminants and then heated in the reboiler to remove the water vapor. The regenerated or \"lean\" glycol is cooled and re-circu"

The gas coming into MER #2 is approximately 225 psig and after going through the 3rd stage of compression is increased to 500 to 550 psig. The gas is passed through a 3rd stage cooling tower then to two pipelines for delivery. Gas is delivered to Pioneer Natural Gas Resources delivery sales point approximately 20 miles north of Hugoton via a 20\" pipeline. A second 26\" pipeline delivers gas approximately 31 miles east of Hugoton to Panhandle Eastern Pipeline. The PEPL gas is controlled via a Fisher control valve at a pressure not to exceed 600 psig.\n\n\n\nThe condensate stabilizer at Hugoton Station Natural Gas Compressor facility reduces the vapor pressure to acceptable limits for normal trucking operations.\n\n\n\nHistory and Ownership\n\n\n\nThis Hugoton Station Natural Gas Compressor facility was built and put into service in 1945 by Panhandle Eastern Pipeline Company. Since then, the facility has periodically had engines and other equipment put into service as operations required with the last engine installed in 1973. Anadarko Petroleum Corporation purchased the facility in March of 1996.\n\n\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results\n\n\n\nThis narrative section has been deleted as directed by regulation; however, there are public receptors within the predicted worst case 1 psi over-pressure radius as calculated using the EPA RMP Comp: Analysis program, making this a Program Level 3 facility. As a Program Level 3 facility, the secondary calculation for a more likely release was determined using a failed load hose during loading operations from the storage tanks on site. The release was calculated to be a 5 minute flow from a 4\" load hose before the system could be shut in and isolated - resulting in a 0.08 mile ROE.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prev"

The following summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\n\n\nAnadarko Petroleum Corporation requires employees to participate in all facets of process management and accident prevention. Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team. Employees have access to all information created as part of the station's accident prevention program. Specific ways that employees are involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is part of the PSM program. This program as well as the other documentation is maintained at office onsite. In addition, the PSM program requires that process and employee safety issues be addressed as part of normal operations. These include development of standardized operating procedures, incident investigation, participation in flow sheet reviews, management of change, and safe work practices.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\nAnadarko Petroleum Corporation keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the process. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters, and equipment design basis/configuration information.
