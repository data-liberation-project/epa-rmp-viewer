      "SummaryText": "International Paper's - Georgetown Mill is a modern, technologically advanced pulp and paper production facility.  The mill, originally built in 1937, manufactured the first paper in South Carolina.  In January 1982, International Paper's board of directors voted to spend more than half a billion dollars to completely modernize the Georgetown Mill.  This conversion to the production of uncoated white papers and market pulp, while maintaining the production of bleached bristols, provided a mill capacity exceeding 600,000 tons per year.\n\nThe Georgetown Mill is located on 900 acres of land just off Highway 17, in Georgetown County, South Carolina.   Approximately 850 workers team up to keep the Georgetown Mill safely operating at peak efficiency 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 52 weeks a year.  \n\nRecognizing that we operate the Georgetown Mill with the consent of the Georgetown community, we take pride in our community and serve the community in many ways.  Our employees raise money for the United Way and the March of Dimes.  In addition, we participate as mentors in our Adopt-a-School program, teach Junior Achievement programs, volunteer for Habitat for Humanity, and serve on various boards.  Over the past several years, the International Paper Foundation has contributed more than $500,000 in grants to local educational, civic, cultural and community projects.  \n\nThe Georgetown Mill's key goals are to operate in 100% compliance with existing environmental regulations which include accurate and timely reporting, and striving for steady reduction of environmental impact.  The Georgetown Mill is committed to operating in a manner that is safe for its employees, the public and the environment.  Our commitment is illustrated in our environmental policy.  Our policy states that \"the company will avoid causing any significant adverse effects on public health or the environment in which it operates\".  \n\nAs part of this commitment, the Georgetown Mill has established a syst"

The facility maintains the components of this system by conducting visual inspections on a routine basis and performing nondestructive testing of tanks and piping to ensure that any potential failures are detected before they occur.   \n\nChlorine dioxide is generated on-site using a R8 process.  An aqueous solution of chlorine dioxide is used as part of the bleaching operation.  The generated aqueous chlorine dioxide solution is pumped to two large tanks for storage and process use at a maximum concentration of 12.0 g/L (1.2% by weight).  Each tank has a maximum storage capacity of 320,000 gallons of aqueous solution (32,000 lb.).  Concrete containment walls are located around the chlorine dioxide tanks which limit the exposed surface area of a pool and thus reduce the release rate in the event of an accident.  A worst case release scenario as prescribed by the rule would be the failure of one storage tank.  Potential public receptors in the event of a worst case scenario do include a school, hospital, residences, recreation areas and a small portion of a wildlife refuge.  Highly skilled operators and mechanics, level controls, safety interlocks, emergency shutdown procedures, preventative maintenance requirements and restricted access procedures make a worst case release highly unlikely.   Our chlorine dioxide system has been a covered process regulated by OSHA 1910.119 - Process Safety Management since 1992.   \n\nThe Georgetown mill has had no accidents (incidents) in the last five years that resulted in injuries or property damage.  If there is an incident with chlorine dioxide, a highly trained and skilled emergency response team is on standby 24 hours a day.  The Georgetown County Fire Department provides backup resources if needed"

In addition, the LEPC, International Paper and other local industries are installing a Community Alert Network (CAN). The CAN is designed to quickly notify residents and businesses of any emergencies such as chemical releases or natural disasters."
