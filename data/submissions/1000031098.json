It is necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling these substances to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community. It is our policy to adhere to applicable Federal and state rules and regulations. Safety of the community and employees depend upon the manner in which we handle these substances. \r\nMartin is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety. This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Plainview Fire Department to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment. \r\n\r\n\r\nRegulated Substances Handled or Stored\r\nMartin stores and handles the following regulated substances:\r\nAnhydrous Ammonia (CAS: 7664-41-7)\r\nStorage Quantity: 820000 lbs.\r\n\r\nUses:\r\nAnhydrous Ammonia is combined with Sulfuric Acid to produce Ammonium Sulfate fertilizer and to control Sulfur Dioxide emissions from the Sulfuric Acid Plant.\r\n\r\nWorst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\r\nThe Worst-Case release scenario for the Martin Plainview Facility is a failure of the largest storage tank resulting in a release of 300,000 lbs. of anhydrous ammonia. To limit the impact and likelihood of this scenario Martin has an internal policy limiting storage capacity to 89%. A 10-minute release would resu"

The release is calculated at 9420 lbs. per minute for 15 minutes. The estimated distance to the off-site toxic end point is 1.8 miles. Preventative measures to prevent this type of release are routine inspections and adequate relief valves to prevent an overpressure failure.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Specific Prevention Steps \r\nMartin complies with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)'s Process Safety Management (PSM) rules, EPAs Chemical Accident Prevention Risk Management Plan (RMP) rules and with applicable state codes and regulations. Our facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements under 40 CFR Part 68. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\r\n\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation \r\nMartin's employees are strongly encouraged to express views concerning accident prevention, operational procedures, and recommended improvements. Employees are included in planning meetings and development of procedures for the facility.\r\n. \r\nProcess Safety Information\r\nMartin maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associated with the process. \r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis \r\nOur personnel conduct hazard analysis to identify potential hazards associated with our process and control measures are appropriate. The methodology used to carry out these analyses is a What if/Checklist. The studies are undertaken by a team of personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at least once every five years. Any findings related to the hazard review are addressed in a time"

Process equipment examined includes; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief  and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls, and pumps. Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices. Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner. \r\n\r\nManagement of Change \r\nWritten procedures are in place at the facility to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures. Process operators, maintenance personnel, or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are made aware of and provided training on the modification. \r\n\r\nPre-startup Reviews \r\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at Martin. The reviews are conducted to confirm that equipment is constructed in accordance with design specifications,that the operating and maintenance procedures are suitable and training is completed prior to placing equipment into operations. \r\n\r\nCompliance Audit \r\nMartin conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP & PSM rules are being implemented.

These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring. All investigation reports are retained for a minimum of five years. \r\n\r\nContractors \r\nOccasionally, Martin hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance or construction activities. The contractor safety program involves training and record keeping to ensure contractors are aware of process hazards and facility procedures.  \r\n  \r\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY \r\nMartin has not experienced an accidental release resulting in off-site impacts during the past 5 years.\r\n\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM \r\nThe facility has a written emergency action plan in accordance with the OSHA PSM rules. The emergency action plan includes appropriate mechanisms for notifying emergency responders when there is a need for response. The facility is listed in the community emergency response plan. Martin has worked with the Plainview Fire Department to ensure first responders have an understanding of the facility and the location of hazards.\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY \r\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess and maintain safe operations and pratices.  Martin has a PSM Coordinator to ensure the programs referenced in this Executive Summary are maintained. Additionally the site has Environmental and Safety personnel to assist in these efforts."
