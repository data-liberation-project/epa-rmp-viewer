This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processing plants.\n\nOur policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, plant personnel will respond to contain and control the release.\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Clear Creek Gas Storage Facility is located approximately 12 miles northeast of the town of Evanston, Wyoming.  \n\nThe plant operates a low temperature, liquid separation process for the production of Y-Grade natural gas liquids (NGLs).  These liquids are made up of propanes, butanes, and heavier hydrocarbons.\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nClear Creek Gas Storage Facility started operations in March of 2000.  There have been no reportable \nonsite or offsite accidents, as defined by EPA's General Guidance on Risk Management Programs, since\nstartup of operations.\n\n\nEmergency Response Program Information\n\nThe Clear Creek Gas Storage Facility maintains a written Emergency Response Plan, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address the aspects of emergency response including first aid, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and the post-incident cleanup requirements.\n\nIn addition, the plant has procedures that address mainte"
