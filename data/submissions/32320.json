These liquids are made up of propanes, butanes, and heavier hydrocarbons.\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nClear Creek Gas Storage Facility started operations in March of 2000.  There have been no reportable \nonsite or offsite accidents, as defined by EPA's General Guidance on Risk Management Programs, since\nstartup of operations.\n\n\nEmergency Response Program Information\n\nThe Clear Creek Gas Storage Facility maintains a written Emergency Response Plan, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.
