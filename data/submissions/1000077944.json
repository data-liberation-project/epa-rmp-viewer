BOX 477\n\nPOND CREEK, OK. 73766                                                                                                                           \n\n\n\nFor further information contact the General Manager\n\n\n\nRisk Management Plan - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\n\n1. The Facility Policy:\n\n\n\nThe owners, management, and employees of the Farmers Grain Company of Pond Creek, Oklahoma are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, and other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n\n\n2. Facility Information:\n\n\n\nA? The primary activity at the facility is the storage of fertilizers for sale to farmers.\n\nA? Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for the direct application of fertilizers for crop   production nutrients.\n\nA? The maximum quantity stored would be 280,160 pounds in our two-11,000, one-12,000, and one-30,000 gallon storage tanks. However, due to the rounding requirements in the submit program the 280,160 pounds was rounded to 280,000 pounds in the submit program. \n\n\n\n3. The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario:\n\n\n\na. The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 131,325 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 2.40 miles.\n\nb. The alternative release scenario based on the most likely potential incident is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 0.83 miles.\n\n\n\n4. The accidental release prevention program:\n\n\n\nThe facility has referred to the provisions of \"Safety Requiremen"

The Five-year Accident History:\n\n\n\na. There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\n\n\n\nA? Have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor\n\nB? To our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n\n\n6. The Emergency Response Program:\n\n\n\nThe facility has:\n\n\n\na. A written Emergency Action Plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\n\n\nb. Provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\n\n\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
