The procedures are for the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address notification of local emergency response agencies if a release occurs.  Employees receive training in emergency procedures.  The emergency procedure is updated when necessary based on modifications made to the terminal facilities.   \n\nThe overall emergency procedure program for the Shoup Plant is coordinated with the Nueces County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials and industry representatives. The Shoup Plant has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department). This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.

As part of the Enterprise safety program, the facility utilizes procedures that are included in the Enterprise program, but may not specifically be required at non-PSM and/or RMP Program 1 facilities (e.g. Safe work practice training; safe work permitting and hot work permitting).\n\nUniversal Prevention Activities\n\nThe accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all RMP covered processes at Shoup Fractionation and Cryogenic Gas Plant.  Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\n\nSpecialized Safety Features\n\nThe Shoup Fractionation and Cryogenic Gas Plant has safety features on many units to help contain/control a release, to quickly detect a release and reduce the consequence of a release.  The following types of safety features are used in the covered processes:\n\nRelease Detection\n\n* Hydrocarbon (hazardous gas) detectors and alarms\n* Fire detectors inside plant compressor buildings.\n\nRelease Containment and Control\n\n* Process relief valves that discharge to a flare to capture and incinerate episodic releases.\n* Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated).\n* Automatic shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high temperature).\n* Curbs or dikes to contain liquid releases.\n* Redundant equipment and instrumentation (e.g., uninterruptible power supply for process control system)\n* Atmospheric relief devices.\n\nRelease Mitigation\n\n*"

Finished products are residual natural gas from the cryogenic plant and fractionated hydrocarbon liquids which are removed from the plant by pipeline systems and, in the case of the propane, butane-plus liquids, also by tractor trailer trucks.\n\nThe Shoup Fractionation and Cryogenic Gas Plant process is regulated by Federal OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119 and 40 CFR Part 68.
