Compliance is maintained for all applicable Federal and state rules and regulations.  This facility is ISO 9001 certified for the quality of the process and is re-audited every six months.  Employees help incorporate safe work practices through extensive health and safety training.  The facility is also an American Chemistry Council (ACC) Member and is in the process of working towards Responsible Care Management System (RCMS)Certification.\n\n\n\nThis facility's emergency response program is compliant with OSHA's HAZWOPER regulation.  This facility communicates regularly and works closely with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC)and the Community Awareness & Emergency Response (CAER) Committee for Iberville Parish, the Iberville Parish Office of Emergency Preparedness (OEP), and other community responders.  Detailed emergency response plans incorporating the OEP, the local police and fire departments, are in place at this facility.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.Hazardous Chemicals Used and Produced in Quantities Greater than the EPA Threshold Limit:\n\n\n\nThe Taminco Inc. St. Gabriel Plant is a highly automated manufacturing facility of alkyl-based amines, located on approximately 160 acres 12 miles south of Baton Rouge, LA.  Anhydrous ammonia, and alcohols are reacted to produce amine products, such as ethylamines and isopropylamines.  These amines are then used by other companies to produce a variety of products, such as pharmaceuticals, detergents, automobile coatings, carpet fiber, particle board, plastics, clothing dyes, latex rubber gloves, herbicides, and pesticides. \n\n\n\nAmmonia, ethylamine,isopropylamine, dimethylamine, ethylene oxide, monomethylamine and acrylonitr"

Five Year Accident History:\n\n\n\nThis facility hasn't had a PSM Incident in the past five years.  \n\n                                                                                                                                                                                          \n\n6.The Emergency Response Program:\n\n\n\nThis facility's emergency response program is based on OSHA's HAZWOPER standard.  In addition, it has an on-site Emergency Brigade, a confined-entry rescue team, and an alarm system for fires and spills, in the event of an emergency.  It is a member of the Geismar Mutual Aid Organization and it cooperates with the St. Gabriel Fire Department for back-up support and to share personnel trained for fire-fighting.  \n\n\n\nThis facility communicates regularly and works closely with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), the Office of Emergency Preparedness (OEP), and other community responders.  Detailed emergency response plans incorporating the OEP, the local police and fire departments, are in place at this facility.  Emergency response drills are performed with these responders and Taminco employees.   Under OSHA's HAZWOPER standard, employees have been trained from First Responder Awareness Level to the Incident Commander Level.  The OEP maintains a manned 24-hour 911 center, the parish emergency siren system, a cable override system, the telephone ring-down system, and a computer-aided dispatch system. \n\n\n\n\n\n7.Safety is a continual focus at this facility.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               8.RCMS certified March 2013.
