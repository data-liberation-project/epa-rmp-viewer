(ONEOK) is committed to managing all operations in a manner that protects the environment and the health and safety of employees, customers, contractors and the public while fully complying with applicable laws and regulations.  ONEOKA?s management philosophy goals are achieved through the implementation of the Environmental Health and Safety Management Systems, by the personal commitments of employees and contractors, and by open communication with employees, customers, neighbors, and regulators.  \n\n\n\nThe purpose of this Risk Management Plan (RMPlan) is to provide information about operations at the facility, programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, emergency response plans in the event an accidental release should occur, the five-year accident history of the facility, and planned changes to improve safety at the facility.\n\n\n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nThe Tampico Terminal is owned and operated by ONEOK North System, L.L.C.  At the facility, propane is received via pipeline and stored in above ground storage tanks until it is loaded on trucks for distribution to customers.  Ethyl mercaptan is used as an odorant for propane and is stored at the facility and injected into truck trailers during propane loading.  The Risk Management Program (RMP) substances stored at the facility are propane and ethyl mercaptan.  These are the only flammable RMP substances stored at the facility.  No RMP toxic substances are present at the facility.  The facility is classified as Program Level 3 under the regulation. \n\n\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs in place at the facility are part of the high standards striven for by ONEOK.  These high standards include:\n\n-  Operat"

Ongoing analysis of the potential hazards of the process, detailed training of employees, and emphasis on safety have helped avoid any serious chemical release accidents over the last 5 years.  Part of this program has also involved identifying and taking steps to avoid potential accidental chemical releases.  A few examples of the prevention features implemented at this facility include:\n\n\n\n-  Hazardous atmosphere monitors (HAM) have been installed at the facility, which will shutdown power to the loading facility upon a positive reading.\n\n-  Manual emergency shutdown (ESD) buttons have been installed at the facility in order to shutdown the entire facility during emergency situations.\n\n-  Fire eyes have been installed which will alarm to warn of a fire at the facility.\n\n-  The Tulsa Control Center, which is operated 24 hours per day, can detect high and low pressure on the pipeline and storage vessels as well as levels on storage vessels, and remotely close inlet and outlet valves, if necessary.\n\n-  All drivers are provided with driverA?s loading safety training and a driverA?s loading handbook.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n    Five-Year Accident History\n\n    \n\n    No incident resulting in onsite injuries, death or property damage or offsite impacts from a hydrocarbon release has occurred at the Tampico Terminal within the last five years. \n\n    \n\n    \n\n    Emergency Response Program\n\n    \n\n    The facility will continue"
