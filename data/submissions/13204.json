Resources used in the process was International Institute of Ammonia \nRefrigeration Guidelines, RMP Pro 98 Software by Dyadem\nand Cold Storage Technologies.\n\nReport organization includes; Certification statement, Summary, Detailed Elements and Map of  \nPotential Impact. \n\n\n1.    Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Fowler Packing Company Plant #1 are strongly committed to employee, public and \nenvironmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental \nrelease prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, \nmaintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy \nto implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facilitys primary activities encompass Packing and storage of grape and non-citrus tree \nfruit.  We have 2 regulated substances  present at our facility above threshold quantities.  These \nsubstances include Ammonia (anhydrous) and Chlorine.  Chlorine quantity on site is below \nFederal toxic thresholds and above California thresholds. Ammonia (anhydrous) is used for \nRefrigeration and Chlorine for water treatment in a hydro-cooler. Chlorine is kept in 2-150 lb. \ncylinders adjacent to the Hydro-cooler. Typical operating quantity of Ammonia (anhydrous) in \nthe High Pressure Receivers, Condensers and piping that could release at one time is \napproximately 50% of the total quantity or 10,000 lb.. This is typical of a flooded Ammonia \nsystem that does not operate seasonally and pump down the system.  Since the system has \nsufficeint capacity to store the total Ammonia charge on the High Pressure side  no active \nmitigation is being considered.\n\n3.    The Worst Cas"

      "SummaryText": "e Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release \nScenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to \nlimit the distances for each reported scenario\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the EPA's \nRMP Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration  Reference Tables or Equations.  The following \nparagraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 toxic substances as a class \ninvolves a catastrophic release from Ammonia Refrigeration.  In this scenario 20047 lb. of \nAmmonia (anhydrous) is released.  The toxic liquid released is assumed to form a 1 cm deep \npool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to evaporate over 10 \nminutes.  The released quantity is assumed to be the total system charge since it can be stored in \nthe High Pressure Receivers, Condensers and HPL Piping. At Class F atmospheric stability and \n1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 2.84 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic \nendpoint of 0.14 mg/L.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Ammonia (anhydrous) involves a Safety Relief Valve failure \nand release from the High Pressure Receiver.  This scenario based on the recent PHA would be a \nmore likely worst case scenario. It involves an SRV release rate based on HPR vessel size of \n42 lb./min for 60 minutes.  Toxic gas is assumed to be released to the atmosphere directly.  \nPassive mitigation controls of reducing the total release by manually switching to the standby \nSRV are taken into account to calculate the scenario.  Under neutral weather conditions, the \nmaximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L of Ammonia (anhydrous) is 0.19 miles or \n1000 ft.. The most common release based on operating experience is a compressor shaft seal \nfailure. Since these are mitigated by the mechanical room enclosure, off-site impacts are not \ncommon and therefore not allowed as an alternate scenario.\n\n4.    "

The following sections briefly \ndescribe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nFowler Packing Company Plant #1 maintains a detailed record of safety information that \ndescribes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all \nprocesses.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes \nare identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is \nWhat If/Checklist (combined).  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with \nexpertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of 5 \nyears.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  The most \nrecent PHA/update was performed on 06/05/1999.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Fowler Packing \nCompany Plant #1 maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various \nmodes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency \nshutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The \ninformation is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes. \nOur system is remotely monitored and maintained by a qualified Ammonia Refrigeration \nContractor.
