All employees are informed of hazards in the workplace. Employees who work with potentially hazardous substances receive proper training in the handling of those substances. This facility has procedures in place to safely remove employees from areas in the unlikely event that a hazardous substance release were to occur, and to put in place emergency notification and response procedures.\n\n \n\n2.            Facility and Regulated Substances\n\n \n\nBHP is located in Miami, AZ.  The regulated substance at this facility, anhydrous ammonia, is used in an injection type process for pH control. In order to protect its employees, the public and the environment, BHP has an integrated PSM/RMP program to prevent ammonia releases and mitigate the consequences of a release, should one occur. \n\n \n\n3.            Worst Case and Alternative Case Release Scenarios\n\n \n\nOff Site Consequence (OCA) data is available for review onsite at the facility.\n\n \n\n4.            General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Ammonia Specific Prevention\n\n \n\nThe BHP facility has an emergency plan that addresses the response necessary for a release of ammonia from the system. Because of the pungent odor of ammonia, any leak is easily detected.  BHP personnel and/or contractors have been trained and are knowledgeable in the safe operation of the process.    In case of a release that could travel off the plant property, calls would be made to the Fire Department and/or the County Disaster Services Coordinator to assist in the response. Other state and federal notifications would be made as required.\n\n \n\n5.            Five Year Accident History\n\n \n\nThis is a new material at this location, and during the last five years, there have been no reportable releases of ammonia.\n\n \n\n6.            Emergency Response Program\n\n \n\nThis facility has"

Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n \n\nBHP expects to improve safety performance by emphasizing all elements of the PSM/RMP program.  All recommendations during the PHA were designed to improve the safety performance of the ammonia process.  BHP expects to evaluate each recommendation in a timely manner and implement, as soon as possible, those recommendations that will reduce the possibility of a release and/or mitigate the consequences of an unintentional release.\n\n"
