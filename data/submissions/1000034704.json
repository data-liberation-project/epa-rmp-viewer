The worst case release scenario and the alternative release scenario including the administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for release have been prepared and submitted as required.  This data may be viewed onsite.  \n\n4.    The general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\nThe design, installation and maintenance of the aqueous ammonia tank is performed in conformance with ANSI standards, state and local regulations.  Facility personnel have been trained in safe handling procedures of the chemical.  The facility is in compliance with the applicable regulations.  The loading of aqueous ammonia is conducted with extreme safety.  All the transfer operations are monitored and follow a written standard operating procedure (SOP).\n\n5.    The five-year accident history:\n\nNone.\n\n6.
