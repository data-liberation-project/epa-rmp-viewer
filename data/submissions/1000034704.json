This program is organized into the following elements: 1) Employees participate in the elements of this safety and release prevention program wherever possible; 2) Training is provided for operators and maintenance personnel; 3) Safety Information is maintained on aqueous ammonia hazards and the aqueous ammonia system; 4) A Hazard Evaluation/PHA of the system was conducted and will be periodically reviewed to ensure adequacy of controls; 5) The Mechanical Integrity program ensures the system continues to operate as designed; 6) Operating and Maintenance procedures provide operators and maintenance staff the information necessary to safely operate and maintain the system; 7) Contractors working on or near the system are selected for safety performance, and are briefed on hazards and safety requirements of the job; 8) How Work Permits are required whenever welding, cutting, grinding or other activities are conducted on or near the ammonia process that could generate sparks and start a fire; 9) The Management of Change (MOC) program requires that the impact of changes to the ammonia system be evaluated and approved prior to work being conducted; 10) Pre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSR) are conducted prior to restart of the system after modifications to ensure that impacts of the change are addressed; 11) Incident investigations are conducted for incidents involving ammonia releases and near misses that endanger employees or the public; 12) Compliance Audits will be conducted every three years to ensure that the prevention program is meeting its objectives; 13) Emergency Planning and Response ensures that employees and emergency personnel are prepared to respond to an ammonia release in accordance with the plant?s emergency plan and that notifications are made to designated points of contact at local, state and federal levels depending on the extent of the release.",

Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the stationary source:\n\nCoatex adheres to the Federal and State regulations and in compliance with the OSHA requirements for handling of aqueous ammonia and the OSHA process management standard.  Employees of the facility are trained in their roles and responsibilities in implementing prevention and emergency response.  Should an emergency occur, it is the company's policy to notify the City of Chester Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency situation.\n\n2.    Stationary source and regulated substances handled:\n\nAqueous ammonia is stored in a bulk tank at the facility.  The facility is a commercial emulsion and dispersant manufacturing facility.\n\n3.    The worst case release scenario and the alternative release scenario including the administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for release have been prepared and submitted as required.  This data may be viewed onsite.  \n\n4.    The general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\nThe design, installation and maintenance of the aqueous ammonia tank is performed in conformance with ANSI standards, state and local regulations.  Facility personnel have been trained in safe handling procedures of the chemical.  The facility is in compliance with the applicable regulations.  The loading of aqueous ammonia is conducted with extreme safety.  All the transfer operations are monitored and follow a written standard operating procedure (SOP).\n\n5.    The five-year accident history:\n\nNone.\n\n6.
