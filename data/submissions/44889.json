      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\r\n\r\nThe Dreyer\u00bfs Grand Ice Cream Operations Center is located in northwest Houston, Texas at 4494 Campbell Road.  The site was originally established and owned by Borden Ice Cream in 1985 to manufacture ice cream related products.  The facility has been owned by Dreyer\u00bfs since 1996.  Dreyer\u00bfs manufactures ice cream under the Dreyer\u00bfs and Edy\u00bfs brand names for Texas and the southeastern U.S. at this facility.  The TXOC facility had gradually expanded over the years and today manufactures ice cream and stores a variety of ice cream related products such as frozen fruit bars, Nestle\u00bfs chocolate covered ice cream bars, and ice cream related products from other manufacturers.  Products are shipped via trucking operations.\r\n\r\nThe Dreyer\u00bfs TXOC facility is covered by the RMP regulation because it uses ammonia for refrigeration purposes in excess of the threshold quantity (max inventory approx. 70,000 lbs., normal operating level estimated to be approx 55,000 lbs).  Dreyer\u00bfs extensively uses ammonia refrigeration to support the manufacture and storage of ice cream products.  The refrigeration system is a two-stage system with screw compressors and achieves space temperatures as low as \u00bf40 degrees F.  Manufacturing operations are generally conducted indoors with some ammonia storage and evaporative condensers outdoors on the roof.\r\n\r\nAmmonia is the only RMP-covered chemical on the site.  Other materials on site are either present in less than threshold quantities do not meet the flash point criteria, or are not listed in the RMP and PSM regulations.  The other materials at the site relate to the manufacturing of ice cream and Food & Drug Administration regulations that apply to the site.\r\n\r\nThe Dreyer\u00bfs TXOC facility is an EPA Program Level 3 site and has an OSHA 1910.119 Process Safety Management Program in place that addresses all 14 PSM program elements.  According the Five Year Accident History, there have been no releases associated with ammonia result"

This scenario was selected because it is the largest ammonia storage vessel in the plant and it is located outdoors with potential impact to offsite neighbors.  The EPA/IIAR guidance document tables and equations in Appendix 4B were used for the distance determination.\r\n\r\nThe alternate cast scenario was based on the facility\u00bfs five-year accident history.  The largest release in the five-year accident history was selected and the duration of the release was shortened to allow the release to get offsite.  Releases over substantially longer time spans do not go offsite.  The EPA/IIAR guidance document tables and equations in Appendix 4B were used for the distance determination.\r\n\r\nDreyer\u00bfs Grand Ice Cream TXOC is located in northwest Houston.  The area is a light industrial and warehouse district and adjacent to the Spring Branch residential area.  The area is part of the Cypress Fairbanks Independent School District (CFISD).  Schools impacted by the worst case scenario include two schools in southern CFISD, two schools in northern Spring Branch Independent School District, a community college, and two private schools in the northern part of Spring Branch.  The only major receptor is a park owned by the City of Houston located just west of the facility.  A hospital is located at the very edge of the worst-case scenario circle.\r\n\r\nNote that the Dreyer\u00bfs Grand Ice Cream TXOC is shown slightly incorrect in Landview III mapping software.
