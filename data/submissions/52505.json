Corporate Policies\n\n\n\nWe at Arclin Surfaces are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent to the comprehensive accidental release prevention program that we have in place for our facility.  This program covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances from our operations.  \n\n\n\n\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nOur facility's primary activities encompass manufacturing of phenolic resin and phenolic overlays.  We store and use only one regulated substance (formaldehyde solution) at our facility.  The formaldehyde solution is a 50% (by weight) solution of formaldehyde in water and is used as a raw material to manufacture phenolic resins and glues.\n\n\n\nThe maximum inventory of formaldehyde solution at our facility is currently 321,600 lbs.\n\n\n\n\n\n3. The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario.\n\n\n\nTo perform the off-site consequence analysis for our facility, we have used ALOHA evaporation calculations and dispersion modeling.  We compared these results to manual calculations using the look-up tables and equations provided by the EPA in the RMP Off-site Consequence Analysis Guidance.  There was close agreement between these methods.  The use of RMPComp32 software was rejected as the program did not support 50% formaldehyde or release temperatures greater than 77oF.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.  \n\n\n\nThe worst-case release scenario for formaldehyde (which is considered an EPA Program 3 toxic substance at Arclin) assumes an instant"

The solution is stored at 140oF (60oC).   The release is fully contained in a 61?x85?x1.5? diked area beneath the tank (passive mitigation control).  Volatilization of the spilled solution is known to occur at a rate dependent upon the vapor pressure of formaldehyde gas over a solution of formaldehyde in water.  The vapor pressure of 50% formaldehyde at 140oF is 17 mm Hg, according to J.F. Walker (Formaldehyde, 3rd Edition, Reinhold Publishing, NY, NY.  1964).  \n\n\n\nThe formaldehyde solution is presumed to remain at the storage temperature (140oF) in the concrete containment berm.  The ALOHA Evaporation Calculator was used to estimate the release rate of formaldehyde from solution.  (This program uses measured vapor pressures of formaldehyde gas above aqueous solutions of formaldehyde ranging in concentration from 0 to 40% to calculate the vapor pressure and evaporation rate of formaldehyde under specified conditions.  To estimate the release rate and vapor pressure of a 50% solution at 140oF, we extrapolated the ALOHA data.)   A release rate of 10.83 lbs/minute and a vapor pressure of 22.2 mm Hg were returned from the ALOHA Evaporation Calculator.  \n\n\n\nThe calculator uses temperature, formaldehyde concentration, wind speed, puddle length and puddle width as inputs and returns initial evaporation rate and initial vapor pressure.  It cannot make adjustments for dis-continuous puddles of spilled formaldehyde (such as a release into a containment area containing other storage tanks) and thereby exaggerates the evaporative surface area and overestimates evaporation rates when the puddle is not continuous.  No correction was made for this error.\n\n\n\nThe results were modeled in ALOHA using the initial evaporation rate as a direct release input.  A release duration of 60 minutes was used.  A total release of 650 lbs was calculat"

Under conservative weather conditions (1.5 m/s wind velocity, stability class F), the distance to the toxic end-point of 0.012 mg/L was estimated to be 921 yards using the ALOHA model.  We rounded this result to 0.5 miles in our report. \n\n\n\nAn alternative release scenario has also been submitted for formaldehyde solution.  The alternative release scenario assumes an instantaneous loss of the entire contents of formaldehyde storage tank #40.  The tank contains 33,500 Gallons of 50% (w/w) formaldehyde solution in water.  The solution is stored at 140oF (60oC).   The release is fully contained in the diked area below the tank (passive mitigation control).  Volatilization of the spilled material occurs at a rate dependent upon the vapor pressure of formaldehyde gas over a 50% solution of formaldehyde in water.  The vapor pressure of formaldehyde at 140oF is 17 mm Hg.  The solution is presumed to cool upon contact with the concrete containment berm.  The cooled formaldehyde (which exists in aqueous solution as polyoxymethyleneglycol) begins to precipitate at approximately 125oF.  A release rate of 1.76 lbs/minute was calculated using the ALOHA evaporation calculator.  A release duration of 60 minutes was used.  Using assumed weather conditions of 3 m/s wind velocity and a stability class of D, the distance to the toxic end-point of 0.012 mg/L was estimated to be 113 yards using the ALOHA model with a direct release scenario.  We rounded this result to 0.1 miles in our report.\n\n\n\n\n\n4. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68.  A number of processes at our facility are subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.  Arclin voluntarily participates with Oregon OSHA's Safety and Health Achievement Recognition Program (SHARP) to further enhance plant safety and compliance."
