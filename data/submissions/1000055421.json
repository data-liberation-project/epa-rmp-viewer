Accidental Release prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\n\nWe at Sysco Dallas, Inc. are committed to protecting people and the environment.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as the design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the ammonia refrigeration system at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate control measures to prevent possible releases of anhydrous ammonia.  Unforseeable, if such a release does occur, our highly trained employees are available to control and mitigate the release.  We are also completely coordinated with the Lewisville Fire Department, who provides our emergency response services.\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled:\n\nWe have one chemical at our facility that is subject to the Process Safety and Risk Management regulations.  That substance is Ammonia (anhydrous) .  The maximum inventory of Ammonia (anhydrous) that is expected to be present at this facility, based upon process and operational requirements, is 26,000 pounds.\n\n3. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical Specific Prevention Steps:\n\nSysco Dallas, Inc. has taken the following steps, as required by 40 CFR Part 68 (EPA's Risk Management Planning regulations).  Our Ammonia (anhydrous) process is also subject to section 29 CFR 1910.119 (OSHA's Process Safety Management regulations).  Our facility is also subject to the EPA's Emergency Planning and Community Right To Know Act (EPCRA) Section 302 reporting requirements.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that are in place at our facility.\n\nProcess Safety Information:\n\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our ammonia refrigeration process are identified and controlled efficie"

New employees receive basic classroom training in process operations, followed by on-the-job supervision until they are evaluated and determined to be competent to work independently.  Refresher training is provided at least annually and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity:\n\nSysco Dallas, Inc. conducts documented maintenance inspections and tests on process equipment to ensure proper operation.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Qualified personnel complete inspections and tests only after they are trained and certified.  Any corrective actions noted during these inspections and tests are completed in a timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change:\n\nWritten procedures are in place at Sysco Dallas, Inc. to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and processes.
