      "SummaryText": "1.    ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION & EMERGENCY RESPONSE\n\nThe Carpenter Co., both Corporate and Lakeland Division, operate the facility with attention and a serious commitment to the implementation of safe work procedures and the protection of the environment.  The Lakeland Division of Carpenter Co. utilizes an Integrated Contingency Plan (ICP) to manage the emergency response activities at the facility.  The implementation of the ICP at the facility is directly related to the degree of training given to the Carpenter Co. employees in regard to chemical releases and emergencies, fire evacuation and preparation for response to the effect of natural disasters.  The Lakeland Division?s attention to Accidental Release Prevention is evidenced by the facility?s not having a significant release of toluene diisocyanate during the previous five years.  \n\n2.    FACILITY DESCRIPTION & REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nThe Carpenter Co., Lakeland Division, is located at 5150 Frontage Road South in Lakeland, Florida.  The area around the facility is comprised of other industrial plants.  The Carpenter Co., Lakeland Division, employs approximately 100 full time employees.  The facility manufactures polyurethane foam products for use in carpet cushioning, bedding and other applications.  The polyurethane foam manufacturing process utilizes toluene diisocyanate (TDI) [unspecific isomers], CAS# 2647-62-5, in the respective process.  The Carpenter Co., Lakeland facility has a total TDI storage capacity of approximately 815,000 pounds.  The facility maintains one railcar with approximately 190,000 pounds, one internal TDI storage tank with a capacity of 312,516 pounds, one internal TDI prepolymer mixing tank with a capacity of 91,550 pounds, and one TDI prepolymer day tank with a capacity of 31,518 pounds.  All process tanks are located inside the building with the railcar located outside at the railcar unloading station. The unloading station has stationary drip pans installed to minimize inci"

WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nThe Carpenter Co., Lakeland Division, utilized the modified Gaussian plume model presented in the EPA Off-Site Consequence Analysis (OCA) for the determination of off-site impact.  The Worst Case Scenario consists of the rupture of a TDI railcar releasing the entire contents (190,000 lbs) into an undiked area (urban topography).  The release rate at ambient temperature (25 C) using Equation 3-3 from the RMP Guidance for OCA is 0.64 lbs/min.  The corrected release rate at 110 F is 3.4 lbs/min.  The estimate of the duration of release using Equation 3.5 from RMP Guidance for OCA is 55,900 minutes.  The estimate of the distance to the toxic endpoint is 1,033 ft (0.20 miles).  Within the area delineated by the endpoint distance there are no residential receptors, however 7 industrial businesses would be impacted.\n\n\n\n\n4.    ALTERNATIVE CASE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nThe alternate release scenario is a leak from an unloading hose connecting the tank car to bulk storage system inside the facility.  An estimated 10 gallons or 100 lbs of TDI is spilled into an undiked area (urban topography) before the flow of product is stopped.  The calculated release rate of an ambient temperature (25 C) using Equation 7-8 from RMP Guidance for OCA is 0.00058 lbs/min.  The corrected release rate at 110 F using Equation 3-11 is 0.0031 lbs/min.  The estimated duration of release is 32,258 minutes using Equation 3-5.  The distance to the toxic endpoint using the look up tables in SPI?s RMP for TDI Users which is based on the technique described in EPA?s RMP Guidance for OCA.  In particular, equation D-1 of the guidance document was used to estimate pool evaporation based upon a vapor pressure correlation published by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).  A Gaussian plume model was used to determine the endpoint distance based upon the evaporation rate. Based on the calculated endpoint distance of 100 feet (0.02 miles) a release of "

GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM & CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe Carpenter Co. has implemented the RMP Program Level 2 Prevention Program, as described in the RMP regulations, at the facility which include the following elements:  TDI Safety Information, Health Guidelines & Material Safety Data Sheets, Hazard  Review utilizing ?What if Checklists?, Standard Operating Procedures (TDI Unloading, Transfer Pump Operating and Shutdown, Recirculation Pump Operating & Shutdown, metering Pump Operating & Shutdown, and Pourline Operating Procedures), Employee training, Preventive Maintenance Plan, RMP Compliance Audits, and TDI Incident Investigation.\n\n      6.  FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nOver the previous five years the Carpenter Co., Lakeland Division, has not had any incidents involving TDI.\n\n7.    EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe Carpenter Co., Lakeland Division, utilizes an Integrated Contingency Plan (ICP) to outline the emergency response activities for each class of incident that may occur at the facility.  The facility has made all required notifications to the Polk County LEPC regarding the types of materials stored at the facility and their volumes.  Carpenter Co. has an Emergency Response Service Agreement with American Compliance Technologies to provide remediation services in the event of a TDI release should occur.  Carpenter Co. maintains a trained HazMat response team capable of actively controlling a release of TDI.  All Carpenter Co. operations and support personnel have received training in TDI hazard recognition and awareness as well as a thorough review of MSDS sheets.  The facility conducts emergency response drills on a regular basis.\n\n8.  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe Carpenter Co., Lakeland Division, operates with an attention to employee awareness and emphasizes ongoing training of all personnel.  Additional employees receive 24 hour H"
