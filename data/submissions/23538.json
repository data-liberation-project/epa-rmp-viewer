      "SummaryText": "The Coldiron-Watkins Water Treatment Plant is owned and operated by the City of Danville, Kentucky.  The facility was originally constructed in 1934and has undergone several upgrades since then.  Using a traditional flocculation, filtration and disinfection system, the plant uses chlorine for both pre- and post-chlorination as a means of disinfecting the water produced.  Considering the chlorine in use at the facility, the City of Danville has requested that Hall & Associates, Inc., prepare EPA Risk Management Plans and OSHA Process Safety Management Plans for the plant.  It has been determined that up to 8,000 pounds of chlorine are in use in a RMP and PSM affected process.  Other processes at the facility are subject to neither of these programs.  The emergency response program for the facility is administered by the Danville/Boyle County DES.  Training and drills for ER are the responsibility of this agency in conjunction with the City of Danville Fire Department.  While the facility has no histroy of chlorine related accidents in the past five years, the facility maintains compliance with OSHA PSM for the chlorine process and has a bulding surrounding the process for containment as well as an audio and visual alarm system for chlorine releases.  In the near future, the City plans on switching to a MIOX system for disinfection which will entirely remove the chlorine process and thus exempt the facility from RMP and PSM requirements.  In the interim it has been determined that with a worst case release of 8,000 pounds of chlorine within 10 minutes, the toxic endpoint will be a distance of 2.7 miles away and will affect about 14,700 persons.  In an alternate, more likely release, only 2,000 pounds will be released by shearing of a single cylinder valve.  In this case the release will have a radius of influence of 0.2 miles and will affect about 900 people."
