Mechanical compression and heat exchange cycles occur within the interconnected piping and equipment.  The elements of process safety management are implemented to assure the ammonia refrigeration system is operated safely.  A PHA revalidation was conducted on (12/06/2005) in order to identify hazards and address them adequately.  \nPrimary safeguards include ammonia detection and machinery room emergency ventilation.   The PSM/RMP prevention program is managed by facility staff to assure system equipment safeguards and industry standards are met to prevent accidental ammonia releases.  Mechanical Integrity of the process equipment is maintained through inspections, routine testing and appropriate levels of operator training.  Refrigeration system operators and contractors receive training for safe work practices to prevent all releases or stop them small in instance when incidental releases might occur. \n",
