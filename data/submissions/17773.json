The Emergency Response Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of this PSM/RMP document.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n1.) To save lives.\n2.) To minimize and avoid injuries.\n3.) To protect the environment.\n4.) To minimize property damage.\n\nCity of San Clemente Utilities Division maintains a safety committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, chlorine health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This Plan was be reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM, RMP, and CalARP regulations, and to ensure that the plan is kept current.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nStartup of the chlorine system occurred in 1988.  The process is located at 380 Avenida Pico, San Clemente, California 92672.  The chlorine system for the Water Reclamation Facility of City of San Clemente Utilities Division consists of chlorine one-ton containers which are the storage vessels.  Chlorine gas is drawn from a maximum of four tanks on line through a vacuum regulator to the chlorinators.  Still under vacuum from the chlorinators, it is drawn to injectors and mixed with water from the treatment processes.\n\nThe maximum quantity of chlorine that can be stored on site is 16,000 pounds.\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY\n\nWorst Case Release Result Summary\n\n Scenario Description: Release of the maximum quantity of chlorine that can be stored in a vessel - 2,000 pounds in 10 minutes.  Although, the one-ton containers are stored enclosed in a building at the Water Reclamation Facility, the containers "

This creates the potential for operator error or equipment failure that would result in an unmitigated release, therefore, passive mitigation measures were not used.  The most pessimistic meteorological conditions were used: 1.5 meters/second wind speed, and F stability.  Reference table from the EPA's RMP Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants was used to determine the distance for the toxic point of 3 ppm. This release reaches off-site and may affect population receptors.  No Environmental receptors were affected by the potential release scenario.\n\nAlternative Release Result Summary\n\n Scenario Description: A release of chlorine gas from 5/16 inch diameter leak.  The release rate of chlorine due to the pressure of the tank is 14.6 pounds per minute.  However, passive mitigation measures were incorporated since the chlorine system is located inside an enclosed building at the Water Reclamation Facility.  Consequently, the release rate to the outside atmosphere was calculated to be 8.0 pounds per minute.  The meteorological conditions used were 3 meters per second wind speed, and D stability.  Reference table from the EPA's RMP Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants was used to determine the distance for the toxic point of 3 ppm.  This release reaches off-site and may affect population receptors.  No Environmental receptors were affected by the potential release scenario.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nCity of San Clemente Utilities Division has a Process Safety Management program in place to manage the handling of chlorine.  In addition, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed.  This includes common practices outlined by the Chlorine Institute.  In addition to the Management Programs, there is a chlorine gas detector in the storage room that is set at 1 ppm an"

The Emergency Response Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the PSM/RMP document.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives: \n\n1.)

The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility. \n\nThe Plan also includes the Emergency training for all City of San Clemente Utilities Division employees. The City of San Clemente Utilities Division performs periodic emergency evacuation drills to enhance the emergency response skills of its personnel.\n\nThe Emergency Response Plan is reviewed and updated by the City of San Clemente Utilities Division Water Reclamation Plant responsible person, Mr. A. J. Howard at least once a year.  This Plan will be review and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM, RMP, and CalARP regulations, and to ensure that the plan is kept current.\n\nThe City of San Clemente Utilities Division has coordinated emergency response efforts with the local fire department,  Orange County Fire Department.

All liquid spills or leaks are handled by stopping flow with valving or plugging where applicable.  Major releases are contained within structures or dikes.  All chemical suppliers have vacuum trucks to remove spills and assist with clean-up.  Chlorine releases are handled by confining the leak to the storage building, donning protective breathing and PPE, and plugging or repairing the leak with the appropriate emergency chlorine tank repair kit.  \n\nThe facility has an internal phone network and a PA system to warn employees of an evacuation.  Main buildings have alarm horns and lights to warn of dangerous situations.  Hand held air horns are distributed throughout the facility in the event of power failure to notify employees of evacuation intent.\n\nNote: The most recent date of emergency response team training (item 9.6) is an approximate date.  Training is scheduled for October 1999.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) provided the mitigation measures outlined below to improve safety at the City of San Clemente Utilities Division Water Reclamation Plant.  The PHA was comprised of one session that included a HAZOP study, a Plant Walkthrough, a \"What-if\" analysis, and a series of checklists.  The changes will be completed by December 1, 1999.\n\nR01 Provide new chemical suits in the electrical room at the Water Reclamation Facility.\n\nR02 Contact the vacuum regulator manufacturer to determine if the ventilation line  can be routed to the sensor inside the chlorine storage building.  Also determine whether this will cause the scrubber to turn on during every tank change.\n\nR03 Verify the maintenance and performance of the chlorine sensor with the scrubber system.  Include manufacturer's maintenance recommendation in the Mechanical Integrity program.\n\nR04 Conduct an emergency evacuation drill at the Water Reclamation Facility at least once a year "

Each container should be secured using two nylon \"Kevlok\" straps which use a \"come-along\" buckle to ensure that the strap is tight (520-881-2130).  Typically, these straps are rated at 5000 pounds.  Two chains can be used to secure each container, but they must be kept tight around the container.\n\n2. The gap between the door opening for the crane rail should be eliminated.\n\n3. The point of discharge for the floor drain should be verified."
