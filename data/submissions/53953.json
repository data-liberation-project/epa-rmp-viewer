Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nWe at Ventura Foods, LLC are committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If such a release does occur, our highly trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  We are also coordinated with Ontario City and San Bernardino Fire Departments which provide additional emergency response expertise.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nOur facility's primary activities related to the covered ammonia process revolve around the production, storage and shipping of margarines, spreads, and edible oil products including bottled oils.  Other activities and processes conducted onsite include manufacture of mayonaise, salad dressings, condiments and other sauces.\n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is the only regulated substance present at our facility.  All of the ammonia inventory is attributed to its use as a refrigerant.\n\n\n\nThe maximum inventory of ammonia at our facility is 23,000 pounds.\n\n\n\n3.    The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\n\nTo evaluate the worst case and alternative release scenarios for ammonia we have used the methodology given in the \"General Guidance on Risk Management Programs for Chemical Accident Prevention\"(April 2004) including \"Appendix E. Supplemental Risk Managmeent Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration Facilities\". Also used is Region 1 LEPA California Accidental Release Prevention Program (Cal"

The scenario involves the release of 22,556 pounds of ammonia in a gaseous form over 10 minutes. The release occurs indoors in the mechanical room with a ventilation system that provides 8 air exhanges per hour. Using the recommended building attenuation factor of 40% at Class A atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 0.78 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 200 ppm.\n\n\n\nOne alternative release scenario has been submitted for the toxic substance present in the Program 3 process.\n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Ammonia involves a release during charging operations where a 1.5 inch 50 foot hose fails outdoors during loading or unloading the ammonia refrigeration process.  The scenario involves the release of 25 pounds of ammonia in a gaseous form over 10 minutes.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 200 ppm of Ammonia is 0.0190 mile or 30.6 meters. \n\n\n\nIn keeping with California requirements an Extreme Worst Case scenario was also run that included complete release of all ammonia contained in the system within 10 minutes in a scenario that releases 24,000 lbs of ammonia. Under weather conditions A with a building attenuation factor of 40% and 1.5 m/sec windspeed that toxic endpoint of 200 ppm of ammonia is 0.760 miles or 1,223 meters.\n\n\n\n4.    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA.
