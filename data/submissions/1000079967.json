Motiva Chemicals LLC - Sour Lake Olefins Facility is committed to managing all operations in a manner that protects the environment and the health and safety of employees, customers, contractors, and the public while fully complying with applicable laws and regulations. Motiva Chemicals LLC management philosophy goals are achieved through the implementation of its Environmental Health and Safety Management Systems, by the personal commitments of employees and contractors, and by open communication with employees, customers, neighbors, and regulators.\n\n\n\nFurthermore, the Sour Lake Olefins Facility implements a series of provisions to prevent potential hazardous impacts associated with the processes at the facility. These measures include ensuring that the facility has a well-trained work force, maintaining onsite procedures and manuals, and coordinating with the Hardin County Emergency Management Office, County Sheriff's Office, Sour Lake Volunteer Fire Department, and other agencies to develop emergency response plans and to participate in cooperative emergency response training drills.\n\n\n\n3. Description of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances.\n\n\n\nThe facility stores and processes ethylene (ethene) above the RMP threshold quantity of 10,000 lbs. The ethylene is stored in underground salt dome caverns and is processed by the facility to remove water and carbon dioxide associated with cavern storage such that it can be shipped via pipeline.  Brine water used in the cavern storage process is degassed of ethylene before being stored in brine ponds. The facility recently increased its storage capacity by placing an existing idle cavern into ethylene storage service; however, this increase in inventory did not impact the hazards identified at the facility, increase the offsite consequence analysis release quantity"

Prevention Program\n\n\n\nThe Sour Lake Olefins Facility is operating under the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, EPA RMP regulation, and the Railroad Commission of Texas (RRC) requirements for salt dome cavern storage. The potential for chemical release accidents is minimized through ongoing analysis of the potential hazards of the process, detailed training of employees, and emphasis on process safety. This program also involves identifying and taking steps to avoid potential accidental chemical releases. A few examples of the prevention measures in place at this facility include:\n\n\n\n- Automated Instrumentation for level, flow, temperature, and pressure on the caverns and process area to prevent from exceeding operating limits of the caverns and process equipment and to automatically initiate a process shutdown or initiate an emergency facility shutdown as necessary.\n\n\n\n- Maintenance and function testing of safety systems including:\n\n?Protective devices identified in the Process Hazard Analysis\n\n?Emergency Shutdown Devices (ESDs) on the well heads and in the process area to stop the flow of ethylene, brine, and fresh water\n\n?Flammable gas detectors in the process and cavern areas that provide early detection of a release\n\n\n\n- Emergency backup generator and air compressor to minimize the potential for loss of process controls due to a utility outage.\n\n\n\n5. Five-Year Accident History.\n\n\n\nConsistent with the Sour Lake Olefins Facility's commitment to process safety, there have been no RMP Reportable releases in the last five years.\n\n\n\n\n\n6. Emergency Response Program.\n\n\n\nThe Sour Lake Olefins Facility continues to conduct emergency response preparedness activities and coordinate any emergency response actions necessary with the Hardin County Emergency Management Office, County Sheriff's Office, Sour Lake Volunteer Fire Department, and other age"

The facility has written emergency response programs that contain procedures to be followed in the case of an accidental release of a regulated substance. The emergency response plans are reviewed and updated as necessary at least annually and when changes at the facility could affect emergency response. The Sour Lake Volunteer Fire Department provides initial emergency response to the facility in the event of an accidental release.\n\n\n\n7. Planned changes to improve safety.\n\n\n\nCompliance with the RMP Prevention Program forms the framework for continuous safety improvement. Some of the key components of the safety program are:\n\n\n\n- The Management of Change (MOC) provisions which ensure that the potential safety and health impacts of changes made to process chemicals, technology, equipment, or procedures are considered.\n\n\n\n- The Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) provisions serve as a tool to ensure timely evaluation of potential hazards, thereby leading to continual improvements in safety standards.\n\n\n\n- The Mechanical Integrity provisions ensure that process equipment and instrumentation are designed, constructed, installed, and maintained to minimize the risk of hazardous releases, thereby serving as an integral part of the safety program.\n\n\n\n- Internal and third-party compliance audits ensure that the level of safety protection at the facility is periodically evaluated for improvements.\n\n\n\nThere is an ongoing commitment to implement changes, when identified, that will improve the safety of employees and neighbors of the Facility as well as projects that enhance safety, environmental protection and protect the community from exposure to accidental releases. Specific actions at the Sour Lake Olefins Facility that will be taken in the future to improve the level of safety at the facility include:\n\n\n\n- Evaluating changes to the process using MOC procedures and PHA tools to ensure any new hazards are identified and addressed appropriately.\n\n\n"
