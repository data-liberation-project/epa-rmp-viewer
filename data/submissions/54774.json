This facility has mechanisms in-place as identified in the Mountaire Farms Emergency Release Notification/Procedures and Process Safety Management, Ammonia Refrigeration Systems to address releases of ammonia.  Designated facility personnel have received required OSHA training to respond to an ammonia release.  If an emergency release were to occur (i.e. a reportable quantity release), it is our policy to notify applicable agencies and request that they provide additional response resources as needed.\n\nA DESCRIPTION OF YOUR FACILITY AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nThis facility is a poultry processing facility used to slaughter, cut-up, package, refrigerate and ship fresh poultry.  The facility receives live chickens which are slaughtered, processed and refrigerated for shipping to destinations in the region.  We use ammonia as a refrigerant in four (4) separate systems to provide refrigeration capacity to process equipment including coolers,  spiral freezers, evaporator units, water chillers, and ice makers.  The systems are identified as systems No. 1 through No. 4 and have maximum intended ammonia inventories of 17,152 pounds, 2,700 pounds,17,330 pounds, and 10,068 pounds, respectively.  Thus, the total plant capacity is 47,250 pounds of ammonia.                                                                                              \n\nTHE WORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS  \n\nOur worst-case scenario is the failure of a pipe or vessel in ammonia refrigeration system No. 3 when it is operating with its maximum intended inventory of 17,330 pounds, resulting in its complete release to the environment over a period of 10 minutes.  The resulting distance to a 200 ppm ammonia toxic"

Our alternative release scenario is a 1/4\" effective diameter orifice leak (representative of a pump seal leak or gasket rupture) leading to an airborne release.  The resulting distance to the endpoint extends off-site to a distance of 1,000 feet. \n\nTHE GENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule, applicable state and local codes and regulations.  The ammonia regrigeration systems are designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with IIAR codes and standards.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nOn February 7, 2008 a reportable accident occurred at the facility resulting on a release of ammonia (anhydrous) gas.  The release began at 8:20 pm and was terminated at 8:41 pm.  The estimated quantity released is 961.64 lbs. based on system inventory before and after the release.  No fatalities or serious injuries were reported on or off-site, however seventeen Mountaire employees were sent to the hospital after being preliminary treated by emergency responders. All seventeen were released within a few hours. According to the emergency responders, many did not need to be sent but decided to use caution.  Other than the previously mentioned incident, we have not had accidents involving ammonia that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations or shelterings in the five years prior to June 12, 2009.   \n\nTHE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving our ammonia refrigeration systems, it is our policy to employ designated facility personnel to respond to the emergency.  Designated response personnel and procedures are identified in the written plans entitled Mountaire Farms Emergency Release Notification/Procedures and Process Safety Management, Ammonia Refrigeration Systems.  These personnel have received necessary response operations training in"
