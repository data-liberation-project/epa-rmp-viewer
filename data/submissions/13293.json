The Emergency Action Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the PSM/RMP document maintained at the facility.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n1.)To save lives.\n2.)To minimize and avoid injuries.\n3.)To protect the environment.\n4.)To minimize property damage.\n\nFt. Worth Pool Chlor maintains a safety committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, chlorine health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, and to ensure that the plan is kept current.\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nStartup of the chlorine system occurred in 1995.  The process is located at 3156 Gertie Barrett Rd., Mansfield, Texas 76063.  The chlorine transfer process for Ft. Worth Pool Chlor consists of chlorine one-ton containers (maximum of 6) which are the storage vessels.  Chlorine liquid is dispensed from a one ton container through a filling manifold to 20 pound cylinders (maximum of 60).  The system also includes a scrubber water tank.  The maximum quantity of chlorine on site is 12,000 pounds.  The filling station is located under a canopy and behind a fire wall. \n\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY\n\nWorst Case Release Result Summary\nScenario Description: Release of the maximum quantity of chlorine that can be stored in a vessel - 2,000 pounds in 10 minutes.  No passive mitigation measures were used.  The most pessimistic meteorological conditions were used: 1.5 meters/second wind speed, and F stability. The reference table from the EPA's"

      "SummaryText": " RMP Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants was used to determine the distance to the toxic endpoint of 3 ppm in urban  conditions.  This release reaches offsite and may affect public receptors.  No environmental receptors were affected by this potential release.\n\n\nAlternative Release Result Summary\nScenario Description: A release of chlorine gas from 5/16 inch diameter leak.  The release rate of chlorine due to the pressure of the tank is 72 pounds per minute.  The meteorological conditions used were 3 meters per second wind speed, and D stability.  The reference table from the EPA's RMP Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants was used to determine the distance to the toxic endpoint of 3 ppm in urban conditions.  This release reaches offsite and may affect public receptors.  No environmental receptors were affected by this potential release.\n\nBased on visual observation of the area immediately surrounding Ft.Worth Pool Chlor, Inc., it was determined that the residential population for this Alternative Release scenario was overpredicted (see item 3.12).  The population was estimated using 1990 census tract data with the Landview. III Environmental Mapping Software.  When calculating population densities for large areas which encompass many tracts, the accuracy is rated as good; however, for small areas that encompass only two or three partial tracts, the population data may be skewed due to the unequal distribution within the tract.\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nFt. Worth Pool Chlor has a Process Safety Management program in place to manage the handling of chlorine.  In addition, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed.  This includes common practices outlined by the Chlorine Institute and the National Association of Gas Chlorinators.  In addition to the Management Programs, there is a scrubber system that is used to neutralize displaced chlorin"

A description of the accident is provided below.\n\nDate of Release: 4/26/95\nTime of Release: 2:00 PM\nRelease Duration: 1 Minute\nQuantity of Release:  1 pound\nDescription of Release:  An operator failed to bleed the hose connecting the filling manifold and a 20 lb. container after filling the container.  Once the operator disconnected the container he breathed in a portion of the chlorine gas still remaining in the = inch wide, 6 inch long hose.  The operator drove himself home that afternoon.  Later that evening he was driven to the hospital where he was medically examinated and kept under surveillance for one week.\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nIf a release of chlorine were to occur, Ft. Worth Pool Chlor's response plan is to call 911 in order to reach the Fire Department's HAZMAT team.  Employees will evacuate the facility to a point that is upwind of the hazard.  Evacuation drills are performed annually.  The emergency response plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, and to ensure that the plan is kept current.\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) provided the mitigation measures outlined below to improve safety at Ft. Worth Pool Chlor.  The recommendations are scheduled to be implemented by June 2000.\n\nR01 For all personal protective equipment (such as gas masks, goggles/face shields, glove, etc.) ensure that proper training is provided and documented.\n\nR02 Document the actions taken by the chlorine sensor if a leak of chlorine is detected.\n\nR03 Provide labeling o"
