      "SummaryText": "Columbia Water System (CWS),  is commited to operating a safe well maintained facility.  The commitment to safe storage, use, and handling of chlorine at the facility is a high priority for everyone from highest management, to the plant operators.\nCWS operates a 15 mgd water treatment plant.  This facility uses chlorine in ton cylinders to disinfect water being treated, which is under the RMP Rule.  Normally, two cylinders of chlorine are attached to two separate chemical feed systems at one time, but are not connected together.  Several other full and empty cylinders are stored in an adjacent room.\nConsidering the Worst Case Senario (WCS), RMPComp is used to calculate the toxic endpoint.  Our WCS as calculated presents a potential plume with a toxic end point of nine- tenths miles in radius.  According to the calculated WCS using the Landview Application, 2,266 people would have to be evacuated. Considering the Alternate Release Senario (ARS),  RMPComp is also used to calculate the toxic end point.  Our ARS as calculated presents a potential plume with a toxic end point of one tenth mile in Radius.  Only 44 people would have to be evacuated according to the calculated ARS using the Landview Application.  CWS feels confident that the protective measures  taken at the water treatment plant will considerably minimize chlorine releases, if any, in the future.  \nPresently, we have passive mitigation in the form of a building which encloses the entire chlorine process.  Chlorine detectors are in operation, which sound alarms at the operator room in the plant.  Automatic shutoffs for every cylinder are in the process of being installed.  Present leak detectors are being upgraded to include an alternate power source  ( battery backup power).   All  chlorination equipment, including the hoist that places cyclinders on scales,  is inspected and repaired on a yearly basis.  All pigtales (flexible chlorine feed piping) are replaced every year, and all chlorine valves and yoke"

      "SummaryText": "s are either replace or cleaned and rebuilt every year.  This facility is under OSHA's  PSM rule and CWS feels confident that it complies with this regulation.  All operators, along with volunteers from other areas within the company, undergo various types of training.  Training is periodically done with SCBA to ensure that  employees are familiar with the equipment and proper fit.  Training is also done with the chlorine B kit,  installing the kit on empty cyclinders in order to be better prepared for emegencies.  CWS's training program is ongoing and never ends;  it is constantly evaluated and updated, and new and improved practices are always being sought.  \nIn the last 5 years, CWS has had no accidental releases and hopes that with training and future equipment changes that there will be no accidents in the future.\nStrategies are  coordinated with the Columbia Fire Department and Maury County 911 to facilitate any emergency that may occur.  Everything is set into motion by first calling 911, and all other personnel after the initial call.  Then 911 and the fire deptartment will work with police and other agencies to setup road blocks and evacuate the necessary people.  All protective personal equipment (PPE) needed to respond to any emergency is either in place or in the process of being obtained.  \nAs mentioned before, we are constantly updating our training and emergency response program.  Enineering work is underway to design, specify, and construct a chlorine gas scrubber system and other facility modifications to prevent chlorine releases.  CWS feels that this addition will enhance our capabilities to contain any accidental release to assure CWS adequately protects the public interest."
