The Sale Ranch Gas Plant has a detailed Emergency Action Plan in which it has coordinated with the community's local responders through mock emergency simulations in order to introduce the local responders to the facility and its personnel.\r\n\r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program:\r\nThe Sale Ranch process is covered by OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119, Process Safety Management of highly hazardous chemicals (PSM) regulation.

Thus, the current PSM improvement initiative is heavily focused on this key element as employees are becoming more actively involved in the implementation of each element of PSM.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information:\r\nComprehensive reviews of the available process safety information (PSI) have been conducted.  Updates to maximum intended inventory (MII) and piping and instrumentation diagrams (P&IDs) have been completed.  A comprehensive electronic web-based system utilized for timely access to information has been built, implemented, and made available to all personnel involved with operating the process.  \r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA):\r\nA new PHA team including experienced operating personnel (operations and maintenance), WTG engineers, Process Control personnel, safety representatives, and PSM representatives was utilized to conduct a new PHA in June 2018.  Results and recommendations from these analyses are in process of being shared with employees.  Additionally, a process safety tracking tool has been developed and implemented for the interactive tracking of PHA action items to closure.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures:\r\nWritten operating procedures reference PSI are available in the site project books.  A mentorship training program has been implemented.  A technical review of operating procedures to ensure current operations are reflected and to incorporate the various modes of process operations will be completed and published to the company's electronic web-based system.\r\n\r\nManagement of Change (MOC) and Pre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR):\r\nImprovements to the MOC procedure an"

These checklists are Appendices to the Company's MOC procedure and are available online from the company's electronic web-based process library. \r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity (MI):\r\nIn addition to the ultrasonic thickness testing program already in practice at Sale Ranch, a complete third-party MI gap assessment has been completed.  This has resulted in the development of revised comprehensive inspection standards and procedures along with a specialized inspection program structured specifically for Sale Ranch.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation:\r\nWTG investigates all PSM incidents.  Throughout the PSM program assessment process, incident investigation procedures are being reviewed and will be updated as necessary.  A mix of WTG personnel will be provided investigation methodology training to further enhance the program and ensure root cause is consistently identified.  A process safety tracking tool has been developed and implemented to track action items and incident investigation corrective actions to closure.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits:\r\nTo meet compliance with PSM, WTG conducts compliance audits every three years to verify all PSM element requirements are being satisfied.  In WTG's general PSM improvement program initiatives, an updated audit protocol has been established and implemented within WTG.
