The Facility Policy\n\nThe owners, management and employees of Belle Plaine Cooperative are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia and propane. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire company, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers, and propane sales and delivery.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application. Anhydrous ammonia is used for crop production nutrients. Propane gas is received, stored and distributed for delivery for home heating, farm and commercial business uses.\n\nThe maximum quantity of ammonia stored would be 768,000 pounds in our 30,000 gallon storage tank(s) and nurse tanks. The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a tank truck holding 40,000 pounds. \n\nThe maximum quantity of propane gas stored would be 217,000 pounds in our 30,000 gallon storage tanks. The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a tank truck holding 40,000 pounds.\n\n3. The worst case release scenario and the alternative release scenario.\n\na. The worst case release scenario for anhydrous ammonia would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas over ten minutes. The maximum quantity released would be 132,000 pounds which represents the volume of the storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.16 miles.\n\nThe worst case release scenario for propane would be the failure of one 30,000 gallon tank when filled to 85 percent of capacity (108,"

The alternative release scenario for anhydrous ammonia based on the hazard review is a 2 minute release from a break in a 3 inch pipe. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .78 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for propane would be the failure of one 30,000 gallon storage tank when filled to 85 percent  of capacity (108,500 pounds) resulting in two-thirds of a vapor could explosion, causing a 1 psi overpressure. (factor .67 x .43) = .29 miles. According the EPA lookup tables, the distance to the endpoint is .29 miles.\n\n\n4. The accidental release prevention program.\n\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1, published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc. and the Standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.
