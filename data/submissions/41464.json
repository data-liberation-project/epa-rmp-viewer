The Propylene is stored in a large bulk tank and transfilled into smaller containers (cylinders) for distribution to customers.   \n\n\nRegulated Substances:\nThis facility stores a chemical listed in part 68 of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, beyond a threshold quantity, as established by the EPA;\n\nPropylene \u00bf A  product used in welding and cutting. \n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Policy:\nPraxair is dedicated to being the best performing industrial gas company in all aspects of our business, including safety, health, and environmental affairs. Our safety, health, and environmental policy call for a commitment to protecting the health and safety of our employees, neighbors, and the surrounding environment. This policy is the basis for engineering and construction programs that produce equipment and process systems that minimize the possibility of accidental chemical releases and operational safety programs that ensure safe operation of our facilities. Praxair is committed to the continuous improvement of these programs.\n\nPraxair is an active member of the American Chemistry Council and subscribes to the council\u00bfs program of Responsible Care\u00ae Employee Health and Safety Code of Management Practices.\n\n\nPrevention Program:\nIn accordance with OSHA\u00bfs Process Safety Management standard and EPA\u00bfs Risk Management Program rule, the Brookfield facility has a comprehensive accident prevention program in place. This program is built around process safety concepts such as:\n-Technical documentation of Process Safety Information, describing the physical properties of the hazardous substances, the safety systems in place to control these substances, and the critical operating parameters of the associated equipment and systems.\n-Procedures and programs to develop, maintain, and control key program elements"

Following is a description of some of these safety features.\n\nThe Propylene bulk storage tank has excess flow valves should the piping, transfer hose or valve on the system fail.   In addition to the excess flow valves, the system has safety relief valves to release over pressurization in the system. In an emergency the system has automatic shut down valves which stop the flow of product to the pump and also shut off the power to the whole system.\n\n\nFive-year Accident History:\nThe Praxair Brookfield facility accident history indicates continuous safe operation of our covered chemical process over the last five years. There were no covered process releases that resulted in an EPA RMP recordable accident.\n\n\nEmergency Response Programs:\nPraxair has an emergency response program in place to minimize the effects of accidental release of regulated substances on employees, the public, and the environment.
