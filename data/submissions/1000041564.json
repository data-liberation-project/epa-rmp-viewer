(PPG) Delaware facility is a part of the Performance Coatings Strategic Business Unit within PPG and produces primarily Automotive Refinish coatings and resins.    The PPG Delaware facility has one RMP regulated process, which is the outdoor storage of Acrylonitrile in the facility's Tank Farm and use as a raw material in the Resin Plant. Acrylonitrile is maintained above the threshold quantity of 20,000 pounds.  \n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\n\nThe PPG Delaware facility complies with OSHA's Process Safety Management Rule (29 CFR 1910.119) as well as state and federal EPA, DOT, and other applicable regulations. PPG has established EH&S Requirements Documents that require each manufacturing plant to have an emergency response program to handle emergencies that might happen in that facility. All of these activities form an integral part of PPG's overall Environment, Health and Safety Policy, whose goal is to \"market, distribute and manufacture products globally in a responsible manner that protects employees, neighbors, customers and the environment.\"\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps:\n\nTrained personnel along with environment, health and safety measures are included in all phases of the PPG Delaware operation.  Detailed engineering and design standards are used in all phases of the design and modification process.  These standards may include national codes and standards, quality assurance inspections, overpressure protection systems, flammable and toxic gas detectors, emergency shutdown systems, and fire water/foam system and computer controls for the processes.  Employees at the facility receive job-appropriate training, and periodic retraining as necessary.   Safety, environmental, operating and training procedures are subject to annual reviews, at a minim"

While acrylonitrile is not regulated by the OSHA Process Safety Management standard, PPG utilizes a Process Hazard Analysis to assure a detailed review for hazards in each operating unit for this process at a minimum frequency of five years, and/or when major modifications are made. \n\nThe PPG Delaware facility has a mechanical integrity program in place to minimize the possibility of equipment or piping failures.  Periodic equipment inspections are performed to assure the equipment integrity as defined by the Steel Tank Institute (STI).  Equipment inspections utilize procedures such as proof testing where safeguard systems are forced to function in a controlled manner.  This assures that the safeguards will function if they are ever needed.  Preventive and predictive maintenance programs are utilized and can include vibration monitoring, infrared images to detect differences in temperature, inspections by independent experts, inspections by insurance specialists, routine PPG inspections, and a root-cause analysis program. Maintenance personnel and supervisors are included in many of the training and testing programs that the operators utilize.  Additional training and procedures have been developed for activities that are specific to maintenance. \n\nFive-year accident history:\n\nThere have been no releases in the past 5 years that resulted in an on-site or off-site impact. \n\nEmergency Response Program:\n\nPPG's emergency response program includes the Delaware Emergency Response Plan.  The plan includes procedures for responding to an acrylonitrile release, evacuating employees, notifying the local police and fire department, as well as the hospital, if needed.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\nPPG is committed to the process of continuous improvement.  This commitment extends beyond production issues into the environment"
