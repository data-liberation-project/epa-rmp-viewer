      "SummaryText": "The Warwick Wastewater Treatment Plant is required to prepare a RMP due to its current storage of chlorine at quantities (14,000 pounds) that exceed the 40 CFR Part 68 applicability threshold of 2,500 pounds. The chlorine system was designed by professional engineers based on manufacturer's specifications and the design criteria of the Chlorine Institute's Chlorine Manual.  The chlorine tanks are stored within a separate concrete block building.  There are two chlorine gas detectors in the building that are set at 3 ppm and are tested monthly.  The detector alarms are connected to the plant's main alarm system and an alarm signal is sent directly to the fire department.  The chlorine system is visually inspected daily by facility personnel.\n\nThe current gaseous chlorine disinfection system is scheduled to be replaced with a liquid hypochlorite system.  This operational change is part of an overall system upgrade.  The disinfection upgrade design is currently being reviewed by RIDEM.  Complete removal of gaseous chlorine is expected by the end of 1999.\n\nThe calculated distance to the worst-case release assessment endpoint exceeds the distance to any public receptor as defined by 40 CFR Part 68.  \n\nThe Program 3 accidental release program includes written operating, maintenance and training procedures. All of the design equipment for the facility were specified and certified by Professional Engineers.  The equipment is maintained, inspected, tested and operating in a safe manner in accordance with manufacturer specifications and the Facility Operations Plan which was prepared by a professional engineering firm.\n\nOperations at the plant follow written operating procedures, including written procedures for chlorine deliveries and the connecting new chlorine cylinders.  The operating procedures are based on manufacturer specifications and professional engineering recommendations.\n\nAll new employees are trained prior to the initiation of any physical work at the plant.

Employees are trained on the procedures to handle chlorine cylinders and to connect and disconnect the cylinders in accordance with the written chlorine handling procedures.\n\nEmployees follow the written maintenance procedures developed by the equipment manufacturer and design engineer to maintain the ongoing integrity of the process equipment.  These written preventive maintenance procedures include process equipment inspection and testing procedures.  As part of their safety training, employees receive on-the-job training on maintenance procedures needed to perform job safety and to avoid or correct unsafe conditions.\n\nNo accidents involving chlorine gas storage that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on the site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage have occurred at the facility in the past five years.\n\nThe plant has written overall facility and chlorine specific emergency response plans. In the event of a chlorine leak, employees have been instructed to not respond directly in any release and to call the Fire Department to provide information regarding the release.  The Warwick Fire Department response to any chlorine leak.  All fire department personnel have been trained in emergency response measures and specifically trained regarding the dangers and properties of chlorine."
