(OMI).\n\n1.0  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nIt is the City of Temple's policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws applicable to the Doshier Farm WWTP. As such, the Doshier Farm WWTP requires OMI to operate the process safely, reducing to the greatest extent practicable any hazards associated with the necessary treatment processes and reducing any subsequent risk to the surrounding community, personnel, and environment.  The policy includes working with the surrounding community and local emergency response agencies to implement the emergency response program, in the unlikely event of a process incident occurring at the Doshier Farm WWTP. \n\nThe Doshier Farm WWTP is subject to the Program Level 3 of the RMP regulations, because it is operated by a contractor, OMI. The Doshier Farm WWTP?s accidental release prevention and emergency response policies comply with the RMP rule requirements. OMI has developed specific handling, operation and maintenance, and emergency response procedures for the storage of chlorine and the chlorination process and for the storage of sulfur dioxide and dechlorination process.  The personnel that work with chlorination and dechlorination process are thoroughly trained in the aspects of safe handling, operation, maintenance, and emergency response actions as required by the RMP regulation. \n\nOMI has established and maintained procedures for emergency notification and response and has coordinated emergency response with the Temple Fire Department. The Temple Fire Department is staffed around the clock with trained firefighters and hazmat personnel and are fully equipped to respond to emergencies.  \n\nTo date, the OMI has an "

      "SummaryText": "excellent accident-free record of storing chlorine and sulfur dioxide and operating the chlorination and dechlorination processes at the Doshier Farm WWTP .\n\n2.0  Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Information\nThe Doshier Farm WWTP is located in east Temple, Texas and treats wastewater collected from central and north Temple. \n\nThe wastewater treatment process as regulated by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) requires the addition of chlorine to the wastewater as a disinfection agent. The TCEQ also requires the addition of sulfur dioxide to neutralize the chlorine before the treated wastewater is returned to the receiving stream. The Doshier Farm WWTP has a maximum inventory of 16,000 pounds of chlorine and 16,000 pounds of sulfur dioxide on hand at any one time. These chemicals are stored as liquids under pressure in one-ton containers, withdrawn as gas, and fed into the process by vacuum induction unit. As required by the RMP regulation, the Doshier Farm WWTP has updated the Offsite Consequence Analysis and reported it to EPA using RMP*Submit 2004.\n\n3.0  General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-specific Prevention Steps\n\nOMI recognizes the potential dangers associated with the accidental release of chlorine and therefore, has implemented appropriate safety measures to minimize any risk to the community associated in the event of an accidental chlorine release. The safety measures include the installation of a vacuum feed system for both chlorine and sulfur dioxide, automatic shut-off system to stop chlorine or sulfur dioxide withdrawal, and process area chlorine and sulfur dioxide leak detectors connected to audio and visual alarm system.  \n\nIn addition, OMI has implemented Program 3 prevention program for the Doshier Farm WWTP that meets the requirements of the RMP rule. Preventive maintenance is performed on the chlorination and dechlorination process, including the appurtenances such as hoist and cables used to move "

      "SummaryText": "the containers. Both the chlorination and dechlorination equipment are designed according to industry standards, are regularly inspected and maintained in good working order by qualified operators. The operators are well trained in the handling and use of chlorine and sulfur dioxide. The operators are also trained in the actions to be taken during an emergency and receive regular safety training. The prevention program consists of the following elements:\n\n3.1  Process safety information, which includes information pertaining to the hazards of chlorine and sulfur dioxide in the process, process technology, and process equipment. The process safety information was most recently reviewed in March 2003.\n\n3.2  Process hazard analysis (PHA), which includes a systematic evaluation (by an employee team) of the hazards of the chlorination and dechlorination processes, identification of previous process incidents, engineering and administrative controls, consequences of failure of the engineering and administrative controls, facility siting, human factors, and possible safety and health effects of failure of controls. PHAs were reviewed in June 2004. \n\n3.3  Operating procedures, which include steps for each operating limits, safety and health considerations, and safety systems and their functions. The operating procedures were reviewed in March 2003.\n\n3.4  Training for each employee involved in operating the chlorination and dechlorination system. Most recently refresher training was provided to employees in June 2004.\n\n3.5  Mechanical integrity procedures to maintain the on-going integrity of the chlorination and dechlorination process equipment. The maintenance procedures were most recently reviewed in November 2003.\n\n3.6  Management of change procedures to manage changes (other than \"replacements of kind\") to the chlorination and dechlorination systems. The management of Change procedures were reviewed in March 2003.\n\n3.7  Pre-startup safety review for additions or signifi"

The most recent pre-startup safety review was conducted in March 2003.\n\n3.8  Compliance audits at least every three years from 1999 to evaluate RMP compliance. The last compliance audit was conducted in May 2002.\n\n3.9  Incident investigation, to be conducted and documented for each incident that resulted in, or could have resulted in, a catastrophic release of chlorine or sulfur dioxide.\n\n3.10  Employee participation in the development and implementation of the risk management program and employee access to the risk management program information.\n\n3.11  Hot work prohibition policy on or near the chlorine or sulfur dioxide system when chlorine or sulfur dioxide is present in the affected section of the process. The hot work procedures were reviewed in June 1999.\n\n3.12  Contractor management program, to ensure appropriate evaluation and selection of qualified contractors for work on or near the chlorination and dechlorination systems, proper notification of contractors regarding known hazards of chlorine and sulfur dioxide systems and the emergency evacuation plan, limited access to the chlorination and dechlorination processes, and evaluation of contractor performance.\n\n4.0  Five-Year Accident History\n\nWithin the five-year period prior to the submittal of this RMP, there have been no accidental releases of chlorine meeting the requirements of 40 CFR 68.42. Doshier Farm WWTP has an excellent safety record for use of chlorine. There have also been no employee injuries associated with the use of chlorine.\n\n5.0  Emergency Response Program\n\nThe Doshier Farm WWTP 's emergency response program is coordinated with the Temple Fire Department. In the event of a chlorine or sulfur dioxide accident, the operators would shut down the process as efficiently as possible. The Temple Fire Department would be notified and respond to any chlorine or sulfur dioxide emergency. Temple"
