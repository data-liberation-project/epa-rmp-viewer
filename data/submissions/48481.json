      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\n \nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nURS Field Services owns the Tyler County Gas Plant located in Tyler County Texas, U.S.A.  Holloman Operating Corporation operates the Tyler County Gas Plant and is identified as the operator for RMP purposes. The plant receives natural gas from various oil and gas production facilities throughout the nearby gas production field.  The acid gas components (carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide) are removed from the gas using an amine unit.  The removal of the acidic compounds is generally referred to as ?sweetening? the gas.   At the Tyler County facility the sweetened gas is dried using a glycol dehydrator.  \n\nThe majority of the dried gas is routed to a cryogenic expander plant.  This gas is further dried in molecular sieve dehydrators before routing through a turbo expansion unit where the pressure is reduced.  This pressure drop causes a reduction in the temperature of the gas and subsequent condensation of natural gas liquids (NGL).  The condensed NGL still contains some residual gas which is removed in a demethanizer tower.  The NGL product is introduced into a NGL product pipeline which is connected to the West Texas LPG Pipeline.\n\nThe dried gas which is not routed through the cryogenic unit is routed to a Joule-Thompson (JT) unit.  In a JT unit the gas expands adiabatically which causes less volatile NGLs to separate from the gas stream.  The  NGLs produced in the JT unit are routed to pressurized storage tanks located on site and eventually hauled by truck for sales.  \n\nBoth hydrogen sulfide and NGL are regulated substances.  NGL, a mixture of regulated flammable substances, is present in an amount greater than the threshold quantity of 10,000 lbs.  The plant does not handle hydrogen sulfide in an amount greater than the threshold quantity of  10,000 lbs.\n\nOFFISTE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n\nDue to security concerns, Holloman has elected not to include details of the offsite c"

This information can be made available to EPA, State and local emergency personnel upon request.\n\nThe Tyler County Gas Plant was previously operated by Anadarko?s Springfield Pipeline, L.L.C. group.   Springfield (Anadarko) had prepared an RMP and submitted the required documentation.  The processing done at the facility triggers the need for a Program 3 RMP because the worst case scenario, a flammable gas vapor explosion, is projected to reach off-site receptors.   The plant was initially brought on-line in July of 2005.  The NGL (propane), which is the regulated substance, was not present on-site until the summer of 2005.  The plant has an active and \nup-to-date emergency response plan and process safety management program.  There have been no accidental releases from the facility since the beginning of operations.    \n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe Tyler County Gas Plant has a commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.   However, if a release does occur, the Emergency Response Plan will be initiated and trained gas plant personnel will respond to control and contain the release as well as notify local emergency response agencies for assistance.\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the plant. The processes at the Tyler County Gas Plant are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency?s (EPA?s) risk management program (RMP) regulation and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration?s (OSHA?s) process safety management (PSM) standard.

Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and initiating Management of Change to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team. Employees have access to all information created as part of the gas plant accident prevention program. Specific ways that employees can be involved in the PSM program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the gas plant.   \n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe Tyler County Gas Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters, and equipment design basis/configuration information. Specific departments within the gas plant are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.\n\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/ exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs). For specific process areas, the gas plant has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) on the Pipe & Instrument Diagrams (P&ID) along with the normal operating conditions.  The gas plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated and manual shutdown systems).\n\nThe gas plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and "

This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nThe Tyler County Gas Plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled. Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe original operators of the Tyler County Gas Plant (Anadarko) used the DP10 technique to perform the evaluation of all the operating equipment which they operated.  Subsequent to this original evaluation, Holloman has added the cryogenic expander unit.  The ?What if? method was used to evaluate the added unit.  Both hazard analysis  methods utilized a team of people who possessed  operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identified and evaluated hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team made suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believed such measures are necessary. \n\nAs always,  PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution. Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team. This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention. To help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and wi"

All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process. These procedures are used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate. \n\nIn addition, the plant maintains a procedure that provides guidance on how to respond to upper or lower limit deviations for specific process or equipment parameters. This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Tyler County Gas Plant has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process. New employees receive basic training in gas plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years. All of this training"

Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the gas plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform gas plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work. This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work. In addition, the Tyler County Gas Plant evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor. Gas plant personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\nThe Tyler County Gas Plant conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information. The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service. This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready. The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness. A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly"

The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures. In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.\n\nMaintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their jobs in a safe manner. Written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training. Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels). If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or a management of change team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment. \n\n\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance. The Tyler County Gas Plant incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs. This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made. \n\nSafe Work Practices\n\nThe Tyler County Gas Plant has safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.

Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change. Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures are updated to incorporate these changes. In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nThe Tyler County Gas Plant?s policy is to promptly investigate all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury. The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to gas plant management for resolution.

The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are \n\n\nreviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings. Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs. \n\nCompliance Audits\n\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the Tyler County Gas Plant periodically conducts an internal audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented. Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years. Both on-site and corporate personnel participate as audit team members. The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to gas plant management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team?s findings are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained. \n\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe processes at the Tyler County Gas Plant have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation. The following is a description of existing safety features applicable to prevention of accidental releases of regulated substances in the facility.\n\nSpecialized Safety Features\n\nThe Tyler County Gas Plant has safety features on many units to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release. The following types of safety features are used in the covered processes:\n\nRelease Detection\n?    Hydrocarbon detectors with alarms\n    \n    Release Containment/Control\n?    Process relief valves that discharge to a flare to capture and incinerate episodic releases\n?    Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated)\n?    Automated shutdown systems for specific proc"

The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released. The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements. In addition, the plant has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment. Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency respo"
