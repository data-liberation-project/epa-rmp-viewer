Chlorination is considered to be the most important process for preventing the spread of waterborne disease in drinking water.  The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP) also stores and uses chlorine for drinking water disinfection purposes to protect public health per state and federal water quality standards.  Storing and handling large quantities of chlorine can create hazardous situations.  LADWP takes safety obligations in storing and using chlorine as seriously as it takes providing safe drinking water.  LADWP has been operating the Upper Stone Canyon (USC) Chlorination Station since 1986, which is a chlorination facility that stores and uses anhydrous chlorine for disinfection purposes.  LADWP decided to make significant improvements to the existing chlorination facility to further enhance the safety and offsite consequences of an accidental chlorine release.  The modified chlorination facility is in operation since 2008.  The modified Upper Stone Canyon chlorination station chlorine handling process is also subject to the U.S. environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk management Program and Plan, and also to the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program regulations.  EPA and CalARP regulations require the preparation and five year update of the Risk Management Plan for facilities subject to federal EPA and CalARP regulations. An update is required at least once every five years from the date of its initial submission.  An update is also required within six months of a change that alters the Program Level that applied to any covered process.\n\nThe RMP is to include policies and procedures followed to safely operate the facility and the actions which will be taken by the facility in an event of an emergency.

The Risk Management Plan and Program for the modified chlorination facility was prepared in September 2008.  LADWP prepared Program Level 2 RMPs from 1999 through 2008 because Upper Stone Canyon Chlorination Station is not subject to PSM regulations. However, in the excess of caution, LADWP has now decided to prepare a Program Level 3 RMP. Thus, this 2010 update of the Risk Management Plan for the Upper Stone Canyon facility demonstrates compliance with the Program Level 3 requirements.  It should be noted that no changes have been made to the Upper Stone Canyon Chlorination Station after the preparation of the September 2008 Risk Management Plan.\n\nThe following information is specifically required in the RMP Executive Summary:\n\nA?

The LADWP has prepared an Emergency Response Plan for the Upper Stone Canyon Chlorination Station to facilitate coordination and emergency planning with offsite response officials and facilities in the event of an emergency.  The emergency response plan has been coordinated with local response agencies (City of Los Angeles Fire Department). \n\nGeneral Facility and Regulated Substance Information\n\nThe Upper Stone Canyon Chlorination Station is located at 15000 A? Mulholland Drive in Los Angeles, California.  The station serves to disinfect drinking water by chlorinating water in the reservoirs and at various locations in the on-site water piping system.  The treated waters are piped into the distribution network, which serves parts of west Los Angeles with potable water.  The station building consists of a chlorine storage room, chlorine equipment room, an electrical equipment room, several chemical storage rooms, and a dry media scrubber room.  The facility stores chlorine, a regulated toxic substance under the EPA and CalARP Program rules.  Chlorine containers can be connected to the chlorination process to feed chlorine liquid or gas.  The maximum quantity of chlorine present at the Upper Stone Canyon Chlorination Station at any given time exceeds the listed threshold quantities in the EPA and CalARP rules.  It also exceeds the listed threshold quantities in the federal and California Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Standards.  However, the facility is normally unmanned and water treatment operators visit the facility daily and respond to any trouble alarms, which may occur.  Thus, the LADWP Upper Stone Canyon facility is not subject to federal or California OSHA PSM regulations.\nThe design incorporates two banks of chlorine containers, which normally feed liquid chlorine to evaporators.  There is an automatic switcho"

This system consists of a control panel, two motorized ball valves, and a pressure switch on the liquid header before the evaporators.  When the pressure in the liquid chlorine supply line drops to 20 psi, the switchover system opens the valve isolating the standby bank of chlorine containers to allow liquid chlorine to flow.  At the same time, it closes the ball valve on the now empty bank of chlorine containers.\n\nThe system is also configured with gas headers for each of the two banks of chlorine containers.  This is a complete gas feed system with automatic switchover capability.  It can be used during periods of low chlorine demand, or if the liquid system is out of service for maintenance or repairs.  It is provided to support a wide range of operations at this site.\n\nSince the normal operation is by withdrawing liquid chlorine, and the evaporators are equipped with motorized vacuum regulating valves downstream, it is possible for the gas supply to the chlorinators to be automatically shut off at the vacuum-regulating valve.  These valves can close upon a low temperature condition in the evaporator or at the valve, or upon power failure.  For this reason, in order to assure no interruptions of chlorine feed, a third bank of chlorine containers is provided.  These containers connect to a gas header which leads to automatic switchover type vacuum regulating valves acting as an automatic backup gas supply.  The valves open automatically based on a high vacuum condition that pulls the valve out of its detent position.\n\nA dry media type chlorine gas scrubber system is installed at the station.  The unit is actuated by chlorine detectors at a chlorine concentration of 3 ppm.  The scrubber is provided to neutralize an accidental release of chlorine gas from the chlorine storage or chlorinator rooms.  The scrubber draws suction from the chlorine storage and chlorinator rooms through a duct."

      "SummaryText": "  The station is equipped with an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) in addition to a backup power generator.  Therefore, in case of the failure of regular power, the scrubber will remain functional.\n\nAll on-line containers are equipped with automatic closure valve actuators on the chlorine container valves.  These actuators close the valves when any of the chlorine gas sensors in the chlorine tank or chlorinator rooms detect gas exceeding 3 ppm.  The scrubber system starts simultaneously.\n\nThe emergency backup gas supply is equipped with automatic closure valve actuators as well, but they do not close automatically upon sensing a chlorine leak.  They remain open until an operator on site presses one of the red mushroom switches located at the exit doors.  This is necessary to protect against loss of disinfection to the distribution system.  Even if the emergency backup gas supply was the source of an accidental chlorine gas release, the total capacity of these containers is less than what the scrubber system is designed to handle. \n\nThe gaseous chlorine from the evaporators or from the chlorine gas headers proceeds to the chlorinators that regulate the flow of chlorine.  Chlorine gas from the chlorinators is pulled by vacuum to injectors mostly located in underground vaults.  The injectors provide vacuum, which draws chlorine gas into mixing water to form a concentrated solution.  The solution is then piped through diffusers into the reservoirs or various locations in the on-site water piping system.\n\nSeven chlorine leak sensors are provided in the station to detect chlorine leaks.  The sensors are located in the chlorine container and chlorinator rooms, as well as from the scrubber inlet and outlet ducts.  The detectors signal an alarm by activating a flashing red light over the entry door to the building, as well as an audible alarm within the container and chlorination rooms, and activating an alarm at the Los Angeles Aqueduct Filtration Plant (LAAFP) at Sylmar."

There are flow meters transmitting flow signals to the controller.  Chlorine residual analyzers continuously monitor the treated water residuals.\n\nIn the event power is lost at the chlorine facilities, an alarm will alert the LAAFP control room.  Chlorine flow will continue unaffected, with no safety consequences.\nThe facility is normally unmanned; water treatment operators visit the facility daily. A response team coordinated from LADWP Los Angeles Aqueduct Filtration Plant (LAAFP) responds to any trouble alarms, which may occur. Access to the facility is through gates, which are kept locked all the time.\n\nSummary of the Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe LADWP accidental release prevention program is based on the following key elements:\n\nA?    Detailed management system and clear levels of responsibilities and team member roles.\nA?    Comprehensive process safety information that is readily available to staff, emergency responders, and contractors.\nA?    Comprehensive preventive maintenance program.\nA?

The water treatment supervisor is responsible for this task.  \n\nIn addition, the written maintenance procedure is provided in the Operation and Maintenance Manual as follows: Preventive maintenance schedules are provided which summarize inspection, test, and maintenance schedules on a daily, weekly, bi-monthly, monthly, biannual, annual, every 2 to 10 years, and as-needed basis.  These allow the operator to rapidly review what maintenance is necessary.  The schedules are supplemental to the log sheets on-site and provide a summary and quick reference to manufacturer's O&M manuals.  A maintenance log book is provided on-site for quick reference by the Operator. \n\nLADWP documents inspection, testing, and maintenance of chlorination equipment and assures the performance is done in accordance with the recommendations of the manufacturer and industry groups (i.e., Chlorine Institute).\n\nHot Work Permits and Management of Change \n\nHot work refers to work involving electric or gas welding, cutting, brazing, or similar flame or spark producing operat"

The procedures call for the issuance of a hot work permit whenever it is conducted on or near the chlorination process and other areas deemed appropriate as described in the procedures.  Fire prevention and protection systems are in place prior to the issuance of the hot work permit.  The permit indicates the dates the work is authorized for, the location and specific operational requirements and is kept on file in the administrative office. \n\nLADWP Management of Change (MOC) procedures include steps required to be taken by plant personnel prior to implementing changes to chlorination equipment, procedures, raw materials, and processing conditions.  Training, PSI, operating procedures, and maintenance procedures are updated according to the changes made.\n\nInternal Compliance Audits\n\nThe LADWP has been certifying at a minimum of every three years that compliance with Program 2 Prevention Program requirements is met and that procedures and practices developed are adequate and being followed. Starting April 2010, compliance audits will seek to verify compliance with Program 3 Prevention Program requirements. \n\nThe compliance audit consists of separating the RMP program elements or sections, and auditing each element to determine compliance and effectiveness.  For each internal audit, the audit team completes a Compliance Audit Certification Page and Compliance Audit Checklist forms (one form for each preventive program requirement).  The Compliance Audit Certification Page provides process identification, the dates of the audit, team members, and certification by the audit leader.  The Compliance Audit Checklist details the requirements of each RMP element and contains questions that may assist with the auditing process. The audit checklist for each element consists of the following three sections:\n\nA?    Records Review: A review of the RMP written Prevention Program.\nA?    On-Site Conditions: The audit team will review the program elements based on observation of the"

Interviews:  The program elements will be evaluated by interviewing personnel from appropriate functions including operations, maintenance, management, and contractors.\n\nTeam members record RMP program deficiencies identified during the audit on the checklist.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nThe LADWP incident investigation procedures describe incident reporting, investigation, and investigation reporting steps to be followed by plant personnel.  The incident investigation is started promptly but no later than 48 hours after the event.  The LADWP promptly addresses and resolves all recommendations and shall implement the recommendations in a timely manner to prevent an incident recurrence.  All incident investigation reports are retained on LADWP file for at least a period of five years from the date the reports are completed.\n\nFive-year Accident History Summary\n\nAn accidental minor chlorine release occurred at the Upper Stone Canyon Chlorination Station in April, 2007.  This accident occurred inside the chlorinator room and one operator suffered from chlorine gas inhalation.  The operator was treated for chlorine inhalation.  There were no onsite or offsite deaths.  Also, there were no offsite injuries and no evacuation actions were required.\n\nEmergency Response Program Summary\n\nLADWP is a first responder, its employees respond to chlorine accidental releases.  In the event an accidental release that could result in offsite consequences occurs, external resources such as the City of Los Angeles Fire Department will be solicited to respond as well.  \n\nAs part of the emergency response program, the LADWP has developed and implemented an emergency response plan for the purpose of protecting public health and the environment.  The following elements are included:\n\n(a)    An emergency response plan, maintained at the Upper Stone Canyon Chlorination Station and at the Los Angeles Aqueduct Filtration Plant (LAAFP) containing:\nA?
