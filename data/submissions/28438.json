This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our processes.  Our plant adheres to process safety policies, guidelines, and best practices that have been developed based on company experience over the years.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of all hazardous substances.  However, if a release should occur, our trained personnel are ready to respond to control and contain the incident.\n\nFacility Description and Regulated Substances\n\nThe BP Amoco Chemical Pasadena Plant is located at 1500 North South Street in Pasadena Texas, 77501.  The facility produces linear alpha olefins using ethylene as the major feed stock for the process operations.  The process, which had been in service for over 20 years, was shut down for modifications during the last quarter of 2002 and first quarter of 2003.  The new process produces only linear alpha olefins and no longer manufactures alcohols.   The elimination of alcohol production ended the use of titanium tetrachloride which has therefore been removed from the Risk Management Plan.  The new process reacts with ethylene under relatively high pressure with an aluminum alkyl to form aluminum alkyls containing long, straight hydrocarbon branches of varying molecular weight.  A number of subsequent steps remove and then separate the resulting long chain hydrocarbons into distinct linear alpha olefin products.  These materials are primarily sold to other manufacturers for use in their production processes and shipped by truck, rail, barge, and pipeline.\n\nOur processes use the following chemicals "

Ethylene is supplied by pipeline at a rate of about 2,000 lbs/min.\n\nOur comprehensive operations and maintenance procedures, accidental release prevention activities and contingency planning efforts allow us to effectively manage the hazards that these materials pose to our employees, the public, and the environment.  This has been demonstrated by our past performance, 20 years of ongoing operations without a serious incident with off site impacts.\n\n\nKey Offsite Consequence Analysis\n\nProvided below are brief summaries of the ?worst-case? release scenarios and alternative release scenarios, developed in accordance with the RMP rule.  Also included is information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures in place to limit the impact distances for each scenario.\n\nToxic Release  Scenario -Iron Pentacarbonyl\n\nThis worst case scenario assumes that the iron pentacarbonyl storage tank is full and ruptures spilling its entire contents of 4,440 lbs. into the existing containment area.  (For this to occur, it must be assumed that the storage drum?s safety relief valve does not work).  This scenario further assumes that operations personnel, who would normally be alerted to a possible release by an existing CO monitor, fail to take any remedial actions such as putting water on the spilled material.  These assumptions result in a hypothetical release that has impacts that extend off site and could reach near by residential communities.\n\nAlternate Toxic Release Scenarios-Iron Pentacarbonyl\n\nFor this chemical, unlike in the worst case s"

For iron pentacarbonyl, the alternate scenario would have a release occur while unloading an iron pentacarbonyl cylinder into its storage drum.  It assumes that the 1\" diameter unloading hose develops a leak.  This scenario is based on the operator, who is standing by while the cylinder is being unloaded, taking corrective actions such as immediately blocking in the leaking.  Based on a theoretical 100 lb. leak the EPA model indicated potential impacts could include one of our industrial neighbors.\n\n\nWorst-case Flammable Release Scenario -Butene\n\nButene is produced on site and is stored at several locations in the plant.  The ?worst case? scenario assumes that the plant?s largest storage vessel is completely full and ruptures, instantly spilling its entire contents of 433,000 gallons.  This scenario then assumes that all of the spilled material ignites resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  For this scenario to occur, requires the assumption that the storage vessel?s safety relief valves fail to work and that there is no pooling of liquid in the diked area around the vessel.  The theoretical impact zone for this case would include our industrial neighbors.\n\n\nAlternative Flammable Release Scenario - Ethylene\n\nA more reasonable alternate scenario for a flammable release would be a leak in the 6\" ethylene supply line to the plant.  (Ethylene is the primary raw material for our production processes.)  Such a leak could release 100,000 lbs. of Ethylene while the line?s automatic shutoff system and operating personnel isolate the piping system.  The theoretical impact zone for such a release could include our industrial neighbors but not the general public.\n\n\nThe results from these scenarios are being used to help ensure that our emergency response plan and the community emergency response plan address all reasonable contingency cases.\nGeneral Accidental Re"

Examples of employee participation range from compiling and updating technical information and operating procedures to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis teams.  Employees routinely participate process unit and plant wide safety improvement teams, focusing not only on process safety but also personal safety issues.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nThe Pasadena Chemical plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with our various chemical processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.  We primarily use the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.

At least every five years, the plant updates and revalidates these hazard analysis results.  Recommendations from these studies are sent to management for evaluation and implementation.  Final resolution of the recommendations is tracked, documented and retained.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as startup, normal operation, temporary operations, emergency operations and shutdown.  These procedures are developed and periodically revised by experienced operators, as needed.  Such procedures not only aid in consistent day-to-day operation but also provide a basis for consistent training of new operations personnel.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe Pasadena Chemical plant has well-established practices and procedures in place to properly maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, monitoring and control systems, pumps, compressors and all other critical equipment.
