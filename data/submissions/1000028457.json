The facility uses Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) in order to comply with nitrogen oxides (NOx) emission reductions required by U.S. EPA's Regional NOx SIP Call, as implemented through the Commonwealth of Virginia's NOx Budget Trading Program Rule (9 VAC 5 Chapter 140, Rev D98) and EPA's Section 126 Rule.  The SCR process consists of injecting anhydrous ammonia into the boiler flue gas.  The gas then goes through a catalyst bed where the nitrogen oxides react to form nitrogen and water vapor.  This Risk Management Plan covers the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.\n\n\n\nCOMPANY'S PREVENTION PROGRAM:  The company's prevention program is based on OSHA's Process Safety Management standard.  The Chesterfield Power Station has never had a reportable release of ammonia.  It does not (is not required to) have an emergency response plan meeting OSHA standards at 29 CFR 1910.120 (HAZWOPER); accidental releases that cannot be corrected immediately by employees who are within the immediate release area will be referred to the Chesterfield County LEPC/Emergency Services contact."
