This program includes our on-going efforts in the area of Process Safety Management of hazardous chemicals.  Through the work of well versed work teams performing process hazard analysis and pre-start up safety reviews on new or modified equipment; and the initial, recurrent and update-training sessions for operations and maintenance personnel, we continue to review methods of improving safety in the workplace.\n\nINDSPEC has also introduced an enhanced behavioral process approach to safety.  This process operates by identifying \"Desired Behaviors\" and  \"At-Risk Behaviors\" in the workplace through daily contacts and performing plant-wide evaluations.  By identifying elevated risk conditions prior to injuries occurring, a pro-active approach can be taken to implement corrective actions."

Resorcinol is used primarily as a bonding and stiffening agent in the manufacture of tires. Other major uses are in high-performance wood adhesives and fire-retardent plastic additives. Our 330-employee workforce is comprised of production, maintenance, technical, clerical, and management personnel.  Many of our employees have been with us for 25 years.  We are proud of our facility and the stability of our workforce.\n\nThe Federal Accidental Release Prevention Requirements under the Clean Air Act Section 112(r), codified in 40 CFR Part 68, were written to help prevent the accidental release of extremely hazardous substances and to minimize the consequences of any such release.  All facilities with threshold quantities (TQs) of the listed regulated acutely toxic and flammable substances are subject to these provisions.  The listed substances include 77 toxic chemicals with TQs ranging from 500 lbs. to 20,000 lbs., while the 63 flammable substances all have a TQ of 10,000 lbs.\n\nINDSPEC has three chemicals that meet the toxic and flammable substances TQs, and thus, these substances must be included in a Risk Management Program for their respective operations.  The chemicals are oleum, ethyl ether, and formaldehyde .  The TQ for oleum and ethyl ether is 10,000 lbs, while the TQ for formaldehyde is 15,000 lbs.  \n\nOleum is a fuming sulfuric acid, made up of sulfur trioxide and sulfuric acid. Oleum has a very fuming, cloudy and oily appearance. Oleum can be used as a chemical intermediate in the production of vegetable, marine and petroleum oils, dyes, and in detergents and lubricants.  Oleum is used in a variety of industries that include: metal and metalworking, mining, petroleum refining and distribution, pulp and paper, textiles, and waste disposal.\n\nEthyl ether is a colorless liquid with a pungent, sweetish odor"

Ethyl ether is principally used as a solvent, as a starting material for the manufacture of chemical products, and as an anesthetic.  \n\nFormaldehyde is a colorless liquid with a pungent odor. Formaldehyde is primarily used in the production of resins to create adhesives in the manufacture of particle board and plywood, and for molding, paper treating and coating, textile treating, and foams for insulation. Formaldehyde is used in the field of medicine as an embalming fluid for the preservation of tissues, a skin disinfectant, in cough drops and in mouthwashes. Formaldehyde also has many other uses in various industries that include: an insecticide and fungicide in agriculture, a stabilizer in gasoline, and a corrosion inhibitor in the metal industry. \n\nThe major Clean Air Act Section 112(r) requirements with which INDSPEC must comply for use of oleum, ethyl ether and formaldehyde include:\n\n     -  Management System development and documentation,\n     -  Hazard Assessment for each affected process,\n     -  Prevention Program completion,\n     -  Emergency Response Program coordination, and\n     -  Risk Management Plan submittal.  \n\nIn addition, INDSPEC recognizes its responsibility under Section 112(r)(1) (the \"general duty clause\") to handle all Extremely Hazardous Substances safely to prevent their accidental release and to minimize the consequences of any such release.  Additional chemicals on site, not meeting their TQ or not identified in the 112(r) list rule, are managed using approprite risk-management principles similiar to those applied to our chemicals fully covered by 112(r).

The management system is designed to help ensure that each element of our program is fully and effectively completed.  A qualified individual has been assigned overall responsibility for the development, implementation, and integration of the program elements.  In addition, we have engaged SE Technologies, Inc. (SET) as an expert consultant to prepare and help us implement our program.  Responsibility for implementing individual requirements of INDSPEC's program have also been delegated to competent individuals.  An organization chart has been prepared to identify the responsible personnel and lines of authority for implementing the program.  Record-keeping responsibilities are also included in the management system.\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT\n\nThe Hazard Assessment portion of the 112(r) rule requires facility owners or operators to prepare \"worst-case\" and \"alternative\" release scenarios as appropriate to the operations.  From the release scenarios, facilities are then to determine offsite impacts using specified offsite consequence analysis (OCA) parameters for worst-case releases and more realistic parameters for alternative releases.\n\nAs described by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) the worst-case scenario involves the release of the largest quantity of a listed toxic substance that is estimated to generate the greatest distance in any direction to a toxic endpoint defined in the 112(r) regulation.  The probability that a worst-case release might occur or the possible causes of such a release are not considered.\n\nAlso, the alternative scenario involves an accidental release that is \"more likely\" to occur than the worst-case release scenario.

We anticipate this interaction would tend to decrease the distance to the toxic endpoint (for sulfur trioxiode) given in our offsite consequence analysis.  Sulfuric acid is not identified as a regulated acutely toxic or flammable substance under the 112(r) rule.  Oleum was assumed to remain at 40 degrees Celsius during the duration of a release.\n\nAlternative Release Scenarios:\n\n     -  For oleum, we assumed a railcar line disconnect and a subsequent liquid release of 19,920 pounds in \n        3 minutes.  The release forms an evaporating pool, all of which is contained within the oleum spill \n        containment system.  The total evaporation period is 10 minutes, which takes into account the \n        drainage capacity of the oleum spill containment system and the migration of residual liquid from the\n        surface of the containment into the drain.\n\n     -  For ethyl ether, we assumed a gasket failure in a 3 inch recirculation line and a subsequent release \n        of 6,000 pounds.

Their limitations increase as the complexity of the topography surrounding the release site increases.  The EPA-recommended models used for the INDSPEC worst-case and alternative release scenarios have likely over-estimated the impact distance, because of several complicating conditions:\n\n     -  Near the oleum, ethyl ether, and formaldehyde tanks and piping are large industrial buildings and \n        structures.  These features disrupt and redirect air flow, but the models used assume winds are \n        steady and moving in a straight line.\n\n     -  Beyond plant property, buildings, structures, vegetation, and terrain features also serve to disrupt   \n        and redirect air flow.\n\n     -  The chemicals emitted are assumed to have no reaction with the ground, other chemicals, or other \n        potential release conditions. However, it is likely that releases of oleum, ethyl ether, and formaldehyde\n        will deposit on the ground and other surfaces as they disperse from a ground-level source.  These \n        chemicals may also react with other chemicals or with fire.  In each case, the resulting impact \n        distance is likely to be less than the distance predicted by the models.  Note that a \"synergistic effect\" \n        can occur from two chemicals interacting during an accidental release.  Such synergism results \n        when the effect of two substances acting together \"is greater than the sum of their individual\n        effects.\" Synergistic effects are not expected to occur.\n\nInteraction of these chemicals would likely serve to reduce impact downwind.\n\nSome interaction of these chemicals with other chemicals on site is possible during a catastrophic release.

That is, downwind distances to the TE may be longer along a valley and shorter across a valley.  Therefore, the distance to the TE may be understated in situations with narrow valleys.  At the INDSPEC plant, potential releases would be affected by both their proximity to plant buildings and hilly terrain.  These topographic features would tend to concentrate emissions close to the facility and lessen concentrations farther away.\n\nPREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe Prevention Program ensures that regulated substances are safely stored, used, and handled.  In addition, if a chemical release occurs, the Prevention Program ensures that procedures and equipment are established to detect and mitigate the impact of such a release. The completion of Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) requirements essentially satisfies the 112(r) Prevention Program requirements for oleum, ethyl ether and formaldehyde in the Prevention Program-level 3 processes.\n\nSafeguarding the public from accidental releases through an effective Prevention Program is an important component of the 112(r) rule. The Prevention Program-level 3 elements include:\n\n     -  Process safety information: INDSPEC compiled written process safety information that is completed \n        prior to conducting any process hazard analysis required by the rule.  This written information \n        enables INDSPEC and the employees involved in operating the process to identify and understand the \n        hazards posed by those processes involving regulated substances.  Minimum information includes \n        hazards data such as that found on a Material Safety Data Sheet, technology information, and \n        equipment information.\n\n     -  Process hazard analysis:  A hazard evaluation has been performed by an experience"
