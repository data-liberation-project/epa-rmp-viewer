This line is made of 3/8\u0014 flexible PVC and is placed inside a more rigid, outer PVC sleeve (conduit).  The PVC may become brittle over time.

It is recognized that while chlorine is an indispensable part of public health protection, it poses significant hazards if not handled properly.  The City of Winfield will abide by all pertinent EPA RMP regulations to guard against accidental releases of chlorine at the municipal swimming pool, and, if they do occur, to minimized their harm to the surrounding community and environment.  Additionally, the City of Winfield will always \u0013be on the look out\u0014 for more efficient, safer methods of handling chlorine and, as circumstances and budget allow, for a less toxic alternative disinfection regime (i.e., ozone, etc.).\nThe stationary source and regulated substances handled\nStationary source:\nThe City of Winfield\nMunicipal swimming pool\nPhysical location: At the northwest corner of Main Street and Highway 77, northwest edge of town.\nRegulated substance:\nChlorine\nWorst case release scenario\nScenario\nRelease of the contents of an entire one ton chlorine cylinder.\nAdministrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distance affected by the release\nMuch of the chlorine process is on a vacuum system, particularly in the filter room adjacent the chlorine room.  If there is a break in the line in this area, the vacuum will minimize the escape of chlorine.\nIf there is a problem, there is a master switch in the manager\u0012s office, which can be thrown to shut off all chlorine pumps.\nA chlorine sensor is located at the south end of the chlorine room near the floor.
