(IBP) Joslin, Illinois facility management to implement the requirements of this Risk Management Program (RMP) in accordance with the USEPA regulations under 40 CFR Part 68 and with the corresponding regulations under OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) program.  The objective is to minimize the risk of a release of a hazardous material and if a release occurs, to minimize the potential impact to IBP employees, the public and the environment.  This objective will be accomplished by utilizing general good operating procedures, providing appropriate training to all employees, and coordinating response activities, as necessary, with the local emergency response providers. This plan covers all IBP owned activities at this facility.\n\nIBP's management is committed to providing the resources necessary to implement this policy.\n\nFacility Description\n\nIBP operates a cattle slaughter and processing facility and a hides tannery at this location.  Cattle are trucked to the facility, slaughtered and fabricated.  IBP operates rendering systems to produce gel bone, dried blood, low protein beef byproducts, tallow, and other rendered products. Trans-Continental Cold Storage (TCCS) operates a freezer at this location. Support operations include a wastewater treatment system, truck repair facilities, an analytical laboratory, and administrative offices.\n\nTwo chemicals are utilized at the facility in sufficient quantities to be subject to the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68.  These chemicals are chlorine and ammonia. Chlorine is used to treat wastewater and ammonia is used as a refrigerant at both IBP and TCCS.\n\nWorst-Case and Alternative-Release Scenarios\n\nRMP regulations require that each facility identify worst-case and alternative case release scenarios.  EPA has defined a worst-case release as the release of the entire contents of the largest vessel that cont"

This release rate is then evaluated using modeling techniques and/or reference tables to define the distance to a specified endpoint (concentration or overpressure).  The distance to the endpoint is affected by several factors including molecular weight, volatility, heat of combustion, and physical setting (urban or rural).\n\nThe alternative release scenario must be one that is more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario and that reaches an endpoint offsite, unless no such scenario exists.  The alternative release scenario is also evaluated to define the distance to the specified endpoint.\n\nUnder 40 CFR 68 Subpart B ?68.22(e), the RMP rule identifies surface roughness as a parameter to be used in the hazard assessment to determine the physical setting of the site, urban or rural.  \"Urban means there are many obstacles in the immediate area; obstacles include buildings or trees.  Rural means there are no buildings in the immediate area and the terrain is generally flat and unobstructed.\"\n\nDue to the presence of trees, hills, and/or other structures in the immediate vicinity of the Joslin, Illinois, facility, an urban dispersion environment was assumed.\n\nThe Joslin, Illinois facility has one chlorine system and two separate ammonia refrigeration systems: the Facility and TCCS refrigeration systems.  The worst-case release area for the chlorine system contains the area impacted by a worst-case release for the Facility and TCCS ammonia systems.  Therefore, one worst-case toxic release was specified for the entire facility.\n\nChlorine\n\nThe dispersion model applied to the worst-case and alternative chlorine release scenarios was the EPA-approved model, HGSYSTEM. HGSYSTEM is a consequence model that has seven distinct modules that are used to predict the potential ambient concentrations resulting from single (gas) and two-phase jet (gas and aerosol) releases from pressurized vessels, vapor releases, liquid spills and t"

HGSYSTEM was selected for this application because of its flexibility in simulating the necessary release characteristics, plume dispersion (e.g., dense gas dispersion), and its capability of simulating the dispersion environment through which the plume travels (e.g., time varying meteorological conditions).\n\nThe worst-case release scenario for chlorine included a release of all the contents of the storage vessel (2,000 pounds) in a 10-minute period. This release translates to a release rate of 200 lbs/min. Other assumptions for the worst-case chlorine analysis include the chlorine is a liquefied gas; the 1-ton cylinder is not diked; no passive mitigation system (including buildings) are in place; the nearfield dispersion environment is characterized as urban; 10-minute averaging period; the windspeed is 1.5 meters/sec and the atmospheric stability is classified as F (stable).  The results of the worst-case assessment for chlorine show that the regulatory defined endpoint of 3.0 ppm is found to occur at a distance of 3.23 miles (5.2 kilometers) from the release point.\n\nThe selected alternative-release scenario for the chlorine system is a release resulting from a fusible plug failure that leads to the release of the entire contents of the 1-ton chlorine cylinder.  Based on information in the Chlorine Institute Chlorine Handbook, the release rate of vaporized chlorine from the fusible plug opening is an average of 14.6 lbs/min.  Based on the calculated release rate of 14.6 lbs/min, the duration of a 2,000-pound release is 136 minutes.  The model assumes no active or passive mitigation measures are currently in place.  The meteorological data used for this alternative release scenario was a wind speed of 3 meter/sec, an atmospheric stability classification of D (neutral stability), and an urban dispersion environment in the nearfield.

The EPA's \"RMP Off-site Consequence Analysis Guidance\" (May 1996) was not used to determine the toxic endpoint since it classifies ammonia as a neutrally buoyant gas.  Since the worst-case ammonia release would involve liquid and would come from a pressurized system containing liquid, the released gas should be classified as a dense gas (a result of evaporative cooling).  The ammonia refrigeration document provides calculated endpoint distances for typical meteorological conditions.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario for an anhydrous ammonia release included a release of all the contents of the refrigeration system high temperature accumulator in a 10-minute period (per EPA guidelines).  This release translates to a release of 35,590 pounds of ammonia in 10 minutes or 3,559 lbs/min.  Other assumptions included in the worst-case assessment are: the ammonia is a liquefied gas; the refrigeration system high temperature accumulator is not diked; the release does not take place indoors; the nearfield dispersion environment is characterized as urban; 10-minute averaging period; the wind speed is 1.5 meters/sec and the atmospheric stability is classified as F (stable).  The results of the worst-case assessment for ammonia show that the plume must travel 2.14 miles (3.44 kilometers) before dispersing to the endpoint concentration of 201 ppm.\n\nThe selected alternative-release scenario for the ammonia systems is a release from a relief valve due to overpressure of a compressor unit.  The largest relief valve in the system was used in this scenario.  The largest relief valve has a relief rate of 41 pounds of air per minute.  As a matter of conve"

The release rate of 463.2 pounds of air per minute correlates to a release rate of 329 pounds of ammonia vapor per minute.  This release rate was applied to a release from the ammonia header on top of the building.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration document provides calculated endpoint distances for typical meteorological conditions (3 m/s wind speed, D atmospheric stability, 50% relative humidity).  It has been determined, through a review of IBP's operational history, that the total release would likely be 500 pounds of ammonia.  Based on the release rate of 29.9 lbs/min, the duration for a 500-pound release is 17 minutes.  Other assumptions include that no active or passive mitigation measures are currently in place and an urban dispersion environment in the nearfield.  The results of the alternative-release scenario for an ammonia release indicates that the endpoint concentration of 201 ppm is reached at 0.23 miles (370 meters) from the release point.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe Joslin, Illinois facility is governed by a set of OSHA and USEPA regulations that require planning and facility activities intended to prevent a release of hazardous material, or if a release inadvertently occurs, to minimize the consequences of a release to the employees of the facility, the public and to the environment.  These regulations include:\n\n* 40 CFR Part 68, Accidental Release Prevention\n\n* 40 CFR Part 112, Spill Prevention, Control and Countermeasure\n\n* 40 CFR Part 264, Hazardous Waste Contingency Plan\n\n* 29 CFR Part 119, Process Safety Management\n\n* 40 CFR Part 302, Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA)\n\nThe key concepts in IBP's release prevention program are employee participation, appropriate design and maintenance of equipment, and appropriate training of all employees.
