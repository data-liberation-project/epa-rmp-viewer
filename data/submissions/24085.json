Operations at Tippecanoe Labs began in 1954.  Tippecanoe Labs owns over 2000 acres, including farmland and a wildlife habitat.  The plant itself includes 128 buildings on 500 acres.\n\nThis document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that Tippecanoe Labs has designed and implemented, including:\n\n1.  Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies\n2.  The stationary source and regulated substances handled\n3.  The worst-case release scenarios and the alternative release scenarios, including administrative \n     controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\n4.

ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES:\n\nTippecanoe Labs is committed to operating and maintaining all processes in a safe and responsible manner.  This is especially important for those processes using hazardous substances.  Tippecanoe Labs has numerous systems in place to manage these chemicals.  Lilly uses a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to ensure the safety of employees and the public as well as protection of the environment.  Tippecanoe Labs' accidental release prevention programs and contingency planning efforts help effectively manage the hazards that are posed to employees, the public, and the environment by the use of these chemic"

Lilly is also thoroughly prepared to respond to accidents and other incidents with fully trained response teams.\n\nTippecanoe Laboratories plays an active role in its Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  A primary goal of the LEPC is to protect local citizens by developing and maintaining a coordinated emergency response plan and working with industry to minimize the impact of chemical hazards.  Through the LEPC, citizens can obtain information about hazardous substances handled at local facilities and about emergency planning efforts designed to successfully cope with accidents if they occur.  The LEPC maintains a coordinated emergency response plan for the community detailing operational procedures to be followed in the event of an accident involving hazardous materials.  The plan is available for public inspection.\n\nTippecanoe Laboratories actively supports local community outreach efforts through Community Advisory Panels and neighborhood groups.  These panels provide feedback from the community and advise Lilly on community issues.  Lilly also hosts plant tours and informative evening programs for nearby neighbors. \n\n2.  THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED:\n\nTippecanoe Labs is divided into three main functional areas.  Bulk Pharmaceutical Manufacturing manufactures bulk drug substances and clinical trials materials for human health products.  This area includes manufacturing facilities, Incineration Services, Solvent Recovery, and storage tanks.  Fermented Products Manufacturing manufactures antibiotics and animal feed additives.  This area includes manufacturing facilities, Environmental Controls, Solvent Recovery, and storage tanks.

WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS, INCLUDING ADMINISTRATIVE CONTROLS AND MITIGATION MEASURES TO LIMIT THE DISTANCES FOR EACH REPORTED SCENARIO:\n\nThe USEPA RMP regulations mandate the worst-case release scenario to assume that the entire contents of the largest vessel of a regulated substance in a process are released.  This event is unlikely and has never occurred at our facility.  \n\nThe USEPA requires that one worst-case scenario be reported to represent all regulated toxic substances held above the threshold quantity.  Tippecanoe Labs reported the worst-case scenario for phosgene.  Based on our analysis using USEPA-approved methods, the worst-case release scenario involves a release of the entire contents of one cylinder (100 pounds - gas release) and could potentially affect offsite receptors.  No administrative controls or mitigation measures were considered in the analysis.\n\nThe USEPA requires that one worst-case scenario be reported to represent all regulated flammable substances held above the threshold quantity. Tippecanoe Labs reported the worst-case scenario for pentane.  The USEPA also requires that the worst-case scenario for flammables to be a total release of the material and subsequent vapor cloud explosion.

The administrative controls and mitigation measures considered in the analysis were limitation of tank capacity to 90% for the pentane storage tank, which is accomplished by level control alarms and interlocks on the storage tank.\n\nThe USEPA RMP regulations require an analysis of the alternative-case release scenarios for each toxic substance held above the threshold quantity, and one alternative-case release scenario that is representative for all flammable substances held above the threshold quantity.  The alternative-case release scenario represents an accidental release that is more reasonable than the worst-case, but is still highly unlikely to occur.

FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\n\nTippecanoe Labs has had no accidents as defined in 40 CFR 68.42 during the past five years. \n\n6.  EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\n\nEMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AT TIPPECANOE LABS\nThe Tippecanoe Labs emergency response plan is linked to the plans of the Tippecanoe County Local Emergency Planning Committee.  The site's response is coordinated by plant security using the plant's emergency response teams and equipment.  The emergency response plan spells out the \"hows\" of emergency response and the roles and responsibilities of the incident response and management response teams.  Regular drills test readiness and help employees practice responses to alarms and incidents.\n\nCOMMUNITY ALERT NETWORK (CAN) SYSTEM\nTippecanoe Laboratories has implemented an innovative community emergency notification system.  The Community Alert Network, or CAN System, is an automated phone messaging system that can place more than 1000 calls in ten minutes to neighbors announcing a site emergency.  The phone call will ask the neighbors to shelter-in-place until the emergency is over.  Tippecanoe Labs routinely tests the CAN system.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE TEAMS\nTippecanoe Labs maintains a fully trained emergency response organization that is on-site 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  The site has approximately 100 fully trained emergency response personnel.  Site emergency response teams undergo regular training by security coordinators and officers.  These trainers attend and receive certification from the best emergency response schools in the country.  Each response team member receives at least 40 hours of training in handling industrial fires and hazardous materials.  The emergency response organization has responsibility for custom-designed, state-of-the-art response equipment.

PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\n\nTippecanoe Labs is committed to ongoing safety improvement.  Accident prevention is incorporated into each stage of the facility's life cycle, from the up-front design and construction through start-up, operation and maintenance to any facility expansion or modification.  The multiple safeguards ensure accident prevention.  Ongoing safety improvements include safely designing, building, or modifying facilities. Employees and contractors are appropriately trained and tested.  Equipment is safely started or re-started following pre-startup safety reviews.  The plant is safely operated using detailed operating procedures that include safe operating limits.  Equipment is regularly inspected and maintained.  Process hazard reviews are completed and periodically updated.  Approximately 15,000 man-hours per year are put into process hazard reviews at Tippecanoe Labs.  The entire safety system is regularly audited."
