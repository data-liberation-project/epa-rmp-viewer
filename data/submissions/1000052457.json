              "Description": "The prevention program for Fort Detrick?s WTP mirrors the OSHA PSM requirements and consists of a combination of engineering controls and administrative procedures.  For example, the vacuum regulators are mounted directly on the chlorine tanks to minimize the possibility of a leak in the lines, and all operators have been certified by the Maryland State Board of Waterworks and Waste Systems Operations.  The chlorine sensors, with audio and visual alarms to warn plant operators, are set to automatically alert first responders, the Fort Detrick Fire Department, if an alarm is triggered, via the Motorola Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (MOSCAD) system.  Operators are trained to not investigate or respond to a potential release, only the Fire Department.  Contractors are responsible for regular inspections and maintenance of the chlorine system and the alarms.  These inspections are done at a minimum of once every month.  There are no major changes to the RMP Prevention Program regarding the chlorination system have taken place since the last RMP update, since the pre-renovation and post-renovation chlorination systems are nearly identical.  The initial RMP report can be consulted for more information about the hazards of chlorine gas, the technology of chlorination, the process equipment, specific operating procedures, employee training and employee participation plans, as well as procedures for maintaining mechanical integrity, managing change, conducting pre-startup review and compliance audits, investigating incidents and issuing hot work permits.  The Prevention Program was last reviewed during a compliance audit in May of 2011.  The most recent PHA was conducted on 10 September 2015 and is included in this chapter.",

Its primary mission includes biomedical research and development, medical materiel management and global telecommunications.  Fort Detrick is situated on approximately 1,200 acres and is 46 miles northwest of Baltimore City and 45 miles north of Washington, DC.  Approximately 7,800 military, federal and contract personnel are employed by Fort Detrick.\n\n\n\nFort Detrick uses chlorine gas as a disinfectant at the Water Treatment Plant (WTP) in quantities greater than 2,500 lbs and therefore requires the development of a Risk Management Program according to the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.  Since the WTP is subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Agency (OSHA) Process Safety Management Rule (PSM), both chlorine storage systems are considered Program Level 3 processes under 40 CFR 68.  Chlorine is the only chemical stored at a facility operated by Fort Detrick that exceeds threshold quantities of 40 CFR 68 Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions.  \n\n\n\n The Risk Management Program at Fort Detrick is designed to prevent a catastrophic release of chlorine gas via the development and implementation of a comprehensive program to manage chemical process risk.  Key participants in this program include the Fort Detrick Environmental Quality Control Committee, Environmental Management Office (EMO), Directorate of Installation Services, Safety Office, Industrial Hygiene Office, Emergency Operations Center, Staff Judge Advocate, Fire and Emergency Services Division, Public Affairs Office, the Provost Marshal Office and the WTP operators.  \n\n\n\nThe prevention program for Fort Detrick?s WTP mirrors the OSHA PSM requirements and consists of a combination of engineering controls and administrative procedures.

Additionally, the chlorine sensors have audible alarms and lights that automatically alert the Fire and Emergency Services Division.  New this year, the two chlorine injection points have been consolidated into one point to allow for easier monitoring.  The PHA update for Fort Detrick's WTP chlorination system was performed on 10 September 2015 and revealed no significant additional safety issues that need to be addressed and only minor corrections to information provided in the previous PHA.\n\n\n\nSince the last RMP update, the WTP was offline in 2013 and scheduled to be back online in late 2015.  This update only applies to the new WTP chlorination system.  A compliance audit for the RMP was last conducted in 2011.  Compliance audits must be completed within every three years, however the WTP was offline and no chlorine was being stored in 2014.  A compliance audit is planned for 2016, once the WTP is fully operational.\n\n\n\nFort Detrick has not had any accidents involving chlorine gas with any off-site or on-site impacts in the past five years.  Information about the off-site consequence analysis is included in the RMP Submit.\n\n\n\nAs part of the Emergency Response Program, Fort Detrick WTP operators do not act as first responders in the event of a chlorine release.  Fort Detrick Fire and Emergency Services personnel act as first responders.  They are fully trained and equipped to handle a release or other chlorine emergency to the magnitude in which chlorine is stored.  They review their emergency response procedures periodically and continuously train their personnel as first responders and hazardous material (HAZMAT) technicians.
