Employee Participation - It is the policy of A&AT LLC LaPorte to seek participation of employees at all levels in establishing procedures and practices that govern Health, Safety and Environmental issues.  The PSM Manual Employee Participation element #PSM-001 outlines this process;\n\n2. Process Safety Information - Process safety information is maintained for each operating area.  The PSM Manual Process Safety Information element #PSM-002 outlines this process;\n\n3. Process Hazard Analysis - A detailed hazard assessment, using the HAZOP and WHAT-if/Checklist methodologies, is conducted on all processes to insure that they have been designed safely.  The process also includes a Layer of Protection analysis; \n\n4. Operating Procedures - A system is in place to ensure that updated and approved procedures cover all aspects of process unit operation;\n\n5. Training - A training program has been established to ensure that all personnel are well trained in the specific duties of their jobs (The process also includes an annual Training Needs Analysis);\n\n6. Contractors - It is A&AT LLC LaPorte's objective to partner with contractors that share the same safety philosophy.  A dedicated, collective, and consistent approach by A&AT LLC LaPorte and contractors will enhance and maintain the safety and health of our respective employees.  The PSM Contractor Management Program element #PSM-006 outlines this process;\n\n7. Prestartup Safety Review - A prestartup safety review walk down and checklist is completed for each managed change that significantly impacts the Process Safety Information.  The PSM Manual MOC/PSSR element #PSM-010 outlines this process; \n\n8. Mechanical Integrity - An equipment inspection program is in place to ensure equipment remains in good condition to prevent releases;\n\n9. Hot Work Permits - A work permit system is in place to ensure that all work on process equipment and all hot work are conducted in a safe manner.  The Safe Work Permit Procedure; SAF-002 (resides in the Site's Safety Manual) outlines this process;\n\n10. Management of Change - A management of change system has been established and implemented to ensure that any change is thoroughly reviewed prior to implementation.  The PSM Manual Management of Change element #PSM-010 outlines this process; \n\n11. Incident Investigation - Incidents are investigated using one of several industry recognized methodologies, such as Fishbone, to determine system level root causes that can be remedied to prevent a reoccurrence. Employees and contractors involved in the incident are included on the investigation team.  The PSM Manual Incident Investigation element #PSM-011 outlines this process; \n\n12. Emergency Planning and Response - An emergency action plan has been established for the entire plant including procedures for handling small releases of chemicals.  The plan is known as the One Plan and is a stand-alone document;  \n\n13. Compliance Audits - Programs are audited annually; at least every three years through PSM compliance audits; every three years through an internal corporate review; and weekly safety inspections of the facility are conducted by cross functional teams.  Action items resulting from these are tracked to a timely completion; \n\n14. Trade Secrets - Access by employees to information has few restrictions. Contractors access to information is managed based on their involvement in PSM and the day to day activities of the plant.",

A&AT LLC's management philosophy goals are achieved through the implementation of its Environmental Health and Safety Management Systems, by the personal commitments of employees and contractors, and by open communication with employees, customers, neighbors, and regulators. \n\n\n\nThe purpose of this Risk Management Plan is to provide information about operations at the facility, programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, emergency response plans in the event of an accidental release, the five-year accident history of the facility and planned changes to improve safety at the plant.\n\n\n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nThe LaPorte Plant is operated by A&AT LLC to produce a series of intermediate chemicals.  These chemicals, including; 1,4 Butanediol (BDO); Tetrahydrofuran (THF) and Polytetramethylglocol (PTMEG) are produced then loaded onto trucks and railcars for distribution.      \n\n\n\nThe facility consists of two manufacturing areas designated as the THF and PTMEG Units.  The THF Unit uses formaldehyde, above the EPA designated Threshold Quantity, in its process.  Both BDO and THF are manufactured in the THF Unit following a chemical reaction resulting from the combination of  formaldehyde and acetylene.  \n\n\n\nAlthough the LaPorte Plant uses several EPA RMP regulated toxic chemicals, formaldehyde is the only toxic chemical that is present in amounts above the EPA threshold quantity.  There are also no RMP regulated flammables in amounts greater than their threshold quantity used or stored at the LaPorte Plant.  The facility is regulated under the Program Level 3 requirements.\n\n \n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency"

These high standards include:\n\n\n\n* Operating in compliance with required environmental permits and regulations. \n\n* Operating and maintaining the assets in such a manner that unintentional releases are minimized.\n\n* Operating and maintaining assets in such a manner that the small releases associated with normal operation and maintenance will be minimized to the extent possible.\n\n* Correcting non-compliance found by regular audits of the facility.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevention Program\n\n\n\nThe LaPorte Plant is operating under the guidelines of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Program.  Ongoing analysis of the potential hazards of the process, detailed training of employees, and emphasis on safety has helped avoid any serious chemical release accidents over the last 5 years.  Part of this program has also involved identifying and taking steps to avoid potential accidental chemical releases.  A few examples of the prevention features implemented at this facility include:\n\n\n\n* Minimizing the possibility that combustion of \"chemical\" vapors would be interrupted by having a continuous pilot in the flare.\n\n* Minimizing the possibility of an interruption in power supply to the process control system by replacement of the existing substation with a new state-of-the-art substation.  Additionally the facility has a connection to a secondary power grid.\n\n* Minimizing the possibility of a release through installation and testing of an SIS (Safety Instrumented System) to automatically shut down the process upon certain conditions. \n\n* Preventive maintenance and testing of vessels through the Mechanical Integrity program helps to ensure that structural failures do not occur in process equipment.\n\n* Minimizing the possibility of a release of \"chemical\" by having emergency shutdown buttons at the loading areas.\n\n* Reducing the severity of fires"

As appropriate, also involved in emergency response for the facility would be the Texas State Police, and other coordinating agencies, and local hospitals.  The LaPorte Plant Manager is responsible for coordinating the emergency actions.
