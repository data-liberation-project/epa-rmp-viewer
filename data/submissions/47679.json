      "SummaryText": "Chemical & Metal Industries, Inc. (C&MI) is a manufacturer of antimony pentachloride catalyst. Antimony pentachloride is a fluorination catalyst used primarily in the manufacture of refrigerants (CFC replacement fluorocarbons), fluoropolymers, and pharmaceuticals. C&MI uses chlorine and chloroform in this manufacturing process. In addition, C&MI utilizes reactor residues containing antimony chloride fluoride - a byproduct from the fluorocarbon manufacturing industry. The utilization of this byproduct substantially reduces the amount of primary raw materials, including chlorine, necessary for manufacture.\n\nThis RMP submission is the revised/updated version of the one submitted in February 2002. No significant changes have been made to our processes since that time.\n\n1. Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies\nThe handling of antimony pentachloride and of the chlorine, chloroform, and other raw materials used in its manufacture requires certain safety precautions. C&MI's manufacturing process is a closed system. C&MI has developed an Emergency Response and Contingency Plan in accordance with applicable regulations. This plan has been reviewed by several governmental agencies, consulting firms, and was most recently update by C&MI in September, 2006. The plan includes procedures for notification of the local fire department, county HazMat team, and potentially affected neighbors in the event of an unauthorized release of hazardous chemicals. C&MI is dedicated to continual process and engineering improvements to reduce the amount of hazardous materials utilized and stored, to upgrade the manufacturing process and facility, and to improve process alarms and codes.\n\n2. The stationary source and regulated substances handled.\nThe RMP regulated substances handled at C&MI are chlorine and chloroform. Chlorine is received and handled in one-ton cylinders. The total inventory of chlorine tanks stored at this plant at one time is 6 (12,000 lb). C&MI also rec"

The chloroform, primarily received as an impurity in returned spent antimony catalyst residues, is isolated for reuse in C&MI's manufacturing process.The maximum inventory of chloroform is 4,000 gallons (~50,000 lb); average inventory of chloroform is estimated to be 2,800 gallons (~35,000 lb). \n\n3. The worst-case and alternative-case release scenarios\n\nWorst-case Scenario\nThe worst case scenario is the failure of a one-ton cylinder releasing 2000 lb of chlorine. It is assumed that the entire contents of the cylinder are released in 10 minutes. The distance to the endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L (3 ppm) was determined to be 2.2 miles. This distance does not reflect the active mitigation C&MI has taken to ensure no off-site consequences in the event of a chlorine release. Namely, the existence of a chlorine room with separate scrubber system on back-up/emergency power sized to neutralize the entire contents of a ton-cylinder and automatic shut-off controls.\n\nAlternative-case Scenario for Chlorine\nThe alternative release scenario for chlorine assumes the failure of a one-half inch liquid chlorine transfer hose and resulting release of 2,000 lbs of chlorine from a ton-tank into C&MI's chlorine room which is maintained at negative pressure. This scenario does consider active mitigation of the scrubber system with a 99.997% efficiency for chlorine neutralization, but does not consider active mitigation of the automatic shut-off controls.The distance to the endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L (3 ppm) was determined to be less than 0.1 miles with a chlorine release rate to the air from the scrubber outlet of 0.002 lb/min. \n\nAlternative-case Scenario for Chloroform\nThe alternative release scenario for chloroform assumes the failure of a bottom valve on a process vessel containing 500 gallons of chloroform. The distance to the endpoint of 0.49 mg/L was determined to be less than 0.1 miles.\n\n4. The general accidental release prevention program and the specific preve"

The RMP was last audited between January 29, 2003 and April 8, 2004, with different sections audited on a monthly basis.  C&MI recognizes the need to complete an audit of our PSM system, and have scheduled with a engineering/consulting firm with expertise in RMP to complete the audit by March 16, 2007.  Findings and recommendations will be priortized and addressed in timely fashion.\n\nC&MI operates its chlorine handling based on recommendations of the Chlorine Institute as applied to C&MI's unique process.\n\n5. Five-year Accident history\nNo reportable releases have occurred since January, 2002.\n\n6. Emergency Response Program\nC&MI's Emergency Response & Contingency Plan (ERCP) was developed to comply with OSHA, EPA and NFPA standards and guidelines. It has been submitted to and reviewed by OSHA, the Denver Fire Department, the Town of Hudson, Colorado State University's Occupational Health and Safety Service, URS Operating Services, Inc., and the EPA during a voluntary consultation in October 1998, Region VIII EPA and the CDPHE as part of a Hazardous Waste Management audit in October 1998, and VECO engineering as part of a facility process safety audit conducted March-May 1999.\n\nC&MI has an on-site Emergency Response Team that includes all chemical operators and plant managers. C&MI conducts on-site training and drills specific to process chemicals and equipment. Annual training is also conducted at external facilities, such as Red Rocks Community College. C&MI has Personal Protective Equipment, portable gas monitoring equipment, patching utilities, and neutralizing agents to handle a chemical release. All mitigation efforts will be coordinated with local authorities.\n\nFacility safeguards are in place to reduce or eliminate the occurrence of a chemic"

These safeguards include: (1) C&MI has a chemical operator training program that includes weekly safety meetings and written and demonstrations certification testing; (2) Chemicals are handled in a closed system vented to a neutralization scrubber; (3) Process equipment has been designed, tested, and engineered specifically for process conditions; (4) C&MI's primary manufacturing chemicals do not burn or ignite and there is no potential for a runaway reaction; (5) C&MI's facility is equipped with a gas-monitoring system which activates automatic shutdown and emergency interlocks and notifies plant personnel and on-call managers; (6) The perimeter of the process building is diked to contain a liquid spill anywhere within the building; (7) Chemical loading areas (railcar and truck docks) have liquid containment systems; (8) Chlorine is stored and dispensed within a dedicated, negative pressure room vented to an emergency neutralization scrubber having a reported removal efficiency of 99.997%.\n\n7. Planned changes to improve facility safety.\nC&MI relocated and expanded its facility in 2002. This relocation allowed a complete redesign and upgrade of the manufacturing and storage facility. The relocation considers facility siting to reduce potential for off-site impacts. The relocation site is adjacent to C&MI's supplier of chlorine and other raw materials, thus reducing hazardous materials transportation distances.\n\nC&MI has a continuing program to evaluate and improve the safety of its processes, procedures, and equipment. This effort is supported by in-house research and engineering and outside consultation. Dedicated to serving the inorganic specialty chemical and catalyst markets, C&MI has based more than 30 years of growth on a commitment to research, safety, and environmental concern."
