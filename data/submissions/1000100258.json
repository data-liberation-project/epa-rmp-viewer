The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first-aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  In addition, the Salt Lake City Refinery has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties.  The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to refinery processes or other refinery facilities.  Personnel are trained on or informed of all changes to the refinery emergency response program that affect them.\r\n\r\nThe overall emergency response program for the Salt Lake City Refinery is coordinated with the Salt Lake County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives.  The Salt Lake City Refinery has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department).  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.

All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\r\n\r\n\r\nContractors\r\n\r\nThe Salt Lake City Refinery uses contractors to supplement its workforce generally during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the Refinery has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform refinery personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.  In addition, the Salt Lake City Refinery evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.  Refinery personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling thei"

All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA team recommendations are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each recommendation is documented and retained.\r\n\r\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the Salt Lake City Refinery periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency for the life of the process.  The results and recommendations from these updates are documented and tracked.  The team recommendations are forwarded to management for consideration and their final resolution is documented and retained.\r\n\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\nThe Salt Lake City Refinery maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process.  These procedures are developed and updated by experienced operators as needed and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The procedures are maintained current and accurate by revising them in accordance with the management of change process.  \r\nIn addition, the Salt Lake City Refinery maintains a Not to Exceed document that provides guidance on how to respond to upper or lower limit exceedances for specific process or equipment parameters.  This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\nFor the written"

In addition, consequences of deviation from these NTE limits and the corrective actions to take are readily available.\r\n\r\nThe Refinery also maintains technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, piping and instrument drawings, etc.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\r\nThe Salt Lake City Refinery has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\r\n\r\nThe Salt Lake City Refinery  uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique combined with checklists to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.  \r\n\r\nThe PHA team recommendations are forwarded to management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA recommendations is based on a relat"

In addition, the refinery has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and employee safety issues.  These initiatives include forming teams to promote both process and personal safety.  The teams typically have members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and plant management. Examples of these are the Joint Health and Safety Committee and the SLC PSM Element Teams program.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\n\r\nThe Salt Lake City Refinery keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Asset divisions within the refinery are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.  A table summarizing the reference documents and their location is readily available as part of the process safety overview information for each process to help employees and visitors quickly locate any necessary process safety information.\r\n\r\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/ exposure treatment considerations, is provided in safety data sheets (SDSs).  This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For specific process areas, the Refinery has documented safety-related operating limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in Not to Exceed Limit Tables and in Standard Operating Instructions.

It was assumed that the single pressure vessel with the largest amount of flammable mixture (TK-329 BB Feed Sphere) had a catastrophic failure resulting in a vapor cloud explosion. ALOHA&trade; was used to calculate a distance of 1.0 miles to the 1 psi overpressure endpoint resulting in a VCE. The effects of administrative controls, mitigation systems, and safety systems are not included in determining the effect of the WCS.  Based on the distances to the endpoint, calculated using the ALOHA model, effects from the WCS would reach offsite.\r\n\r\nFlammable Alternative Release Scenarios (ARS):\r\nThe alternative release scenario (ARS) for flammable substances at the refinery is a VCE resulting from a release of flammable liquid isobutane from a isobutane sphere.  The distance to the endpoint, calculated using the methodology outlined in the ALOHA modeling, would reach offsite. This release scenario was selected based on industry history, and because it is a practical scenario for use in emergency planning and response.  \r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\r\n\r\nFollowing is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Salt Lake City Refinery.  Because processes at the refinery that are regulated by the EPA RMP regulation are also subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to carry out the accident prevention program.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\n\r\nThe Salt Lake City Refinery encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the refinery accident prevention program."
