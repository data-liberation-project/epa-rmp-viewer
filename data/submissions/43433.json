We focus our attention and resources towards the protection of our employees and the surrounding community.\n\nMinyard Food Stores, Inc. operates a distribution center for the purpose of supplying our retail grocery stores. Included in our warehouse operations is our cold storage of products. This portion of our warehouse uses anhydrous ammonia as the refrigerant.  \n\nMinyard is also involved in an ongoing effort to comply with regulations at the local, state and federal levels that require accident prevention, planning, training, and response.  Our facility is located at 777 Freeport Parkway, Coppell, Texas and is equipped with a refrigeration system that contains anhydrous ammonia (C.A.S. #7664-41-7). Ammonia is the sole regulated substance in regard to the aforementioned regulations.  The maximum quantity of ammonia in the system does not exceed 25,000 pounds.\n\nReleases are prevented by a combination of engineering and administrative controls.  Administrative controls involve manual isolation and shutdown procedures to be performed by trained personnel.  The system is also equipped with pressure relief valves that operate to prevent damage to system components should pressure reach unsafe leves.  Operation of pressure relief valves will result in a controlled release of refrigerant.\n\nThis facility has not experienced any reportable accidents in the past five (5) years. Incidental releases may occur during routine engineering activiites.\n\nWritten emergecy procedures are maintainted at our facility. All employees are trained to act based on their pre-assigned roles during emergency situations.  Minyard Food Stores works with the Coppell Fire Department in the event of an emergency.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety include the ongoing preventative maintenance program, and regular replacement of deteriorated system components.  In all cases,"
