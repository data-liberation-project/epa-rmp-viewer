This commitment is an inherent part of our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.

We coordinate our response efforts with the Stuttgart Fire Department, which provides additional emergency response expertise and the Local Emergency Planning Committee.\r\n\r\n  2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\r\nOur facility's primary activity is customized fertilizer blending with a base of aqueous anhydrous ammonia.  We have anhydrous ammonia stored intermittently for three day intervals in one 12,000-gallon tank at our facility in Stuttgart, Arkansas.  After three days the blended anhydrous is no longer a regulated substance.  The maximum amount stored at the beginning of a three-day interval at 85% standard maximum storage capacity is 10,200 gallons (52,489.2 pounds).\r\n\r\n  3.
