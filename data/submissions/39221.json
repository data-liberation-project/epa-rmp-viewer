The plant\u00bfs products are used to make high purity chemicals for the semiconductor industry. Manufactured chemicals include: Hydrofluoric Acid, 7:1 Sulfuric/Hydrofluoric Acid, and Ammonium Fluoride.\n\n\nThe materials used by the facility, which are on the RMP Rules List of regulated substances, are Hydrogen Fluoride (Anhydrous) and Ammonia (Anhydrous). The GEM plant's storage and use of Hydrogen Fluoride (Anhydrous) and -Ammonia (Anhydrous) exceeds the specified thresholds  of 5,000 lbs. and 10,000 lbs, respectively, as defined by the EPA\u00bfs RMP Rule.  \n\nIn accordance with the requirements of the RMP Rule, a description of the following six elements is provided for the GEM plant: \n\n1.\tAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies: It is the policy of the GEM plant to operate a safe and environmentally sound facility by identifying and controlling health, safety, or environmental risks related to its operations; by designing its processes to protect people, property and the environment; by conducting and continually reviewing and improving programs for safety, health and environmental excellence; and by establishing processes to assure that all laws and regulations applicable to its operations and products are known and observed.  The accidental release prevention and emergency response policy associated specifically with the plant's use of Hydrogen Fluoride (Anhydrous), and Ammonia (Anhydrous), involves the integration of safety devices and technologies inherent in the design of the process, safe operational procedures and management practices, operator training, the preparation and testing of site emergency response plans, the maintenance of onsite emergency response equipment and a professionally trained Emergency Management Team, coordinating our efforts and resources with local emergency response services, and communicating with the commu"

Regulated RMP substances handled include Hydrogen Fluoride (Anhydrous) and Ammonia (Anhydrous).\n\n3.\tThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:  GEM operates its process utilizing OSHA PSM Programs in conjunction with RMP Programs. These programs provide elements preventing and mitigating accidental releases of regulated substances to the air and minimize the consequences of such releases if they do occur by emphasizing preventative measures for those chemicals which are believed to pose the greatest risk. GEM\u00bfs programs focus on accident prevention efforts primarily at the local level, where the risk is found, with the goal of government and the public working with industry to reduce risk. Among the provisions of section 112(r) are the identification of hazards within a facility which could result in a release, the design, and maintenance of a safe facility, and the development of response actions to be taken in the event of a release. Sources subject to section 112(r) requirements must submit risk management plans (RMP) which includes an offsite consequence analysis, a five-year accident history and a compliance certification.\n\n4.\tThe Five Year Accident History:  There have been no releases of the RMP regulated hazardous chemicals since facility operations began in 1998.\n\n5.\tThe Emergency Response Plan:  A Emergency Response/contingency plan has been developed to provide a formal emergency preparedness program that protects human health and property for the employees and surrounding community in the event of an emergency such as: Fire; Explosion; Release of Highly Hazardous Chemicals (HHC); Transportation Emergency; Criminal Acts; and Natural Emergency.
