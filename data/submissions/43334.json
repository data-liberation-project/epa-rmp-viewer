      "SummaryText": "PROCESS SUMMARY\nThe Reddy Ice #611-CASSCO Cold Storage facility located in Marshville, North Carolina, is a refrigerated warehouse/cold storage facility. The approximately 88,000 square foot facility maintains approximately 26,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant for cold storage refrigeration. \n\nThe facility refrigeration system is a standard closed loop design consisting of compressors, condensers, storage tanks, and air-cooling evaporators for the freezer vaults. There are two suction loops in the system, one operating at ?30 degrees and one at 10 degrees. Each of the systems is supplied liquid anhydrous ammonia from a common high-pressure storage receiver. The system has numerous protective controls including motor overload, high and low temperature and pressure, low oil pressure, high and low liquid level cutouts, ammonia detectors and alarms, and pressure relief valves on all equipment.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia, when properly used, has proven to be a safe and reliable refrigerant. The sharp odor of ammonia provides its own warning agent. Practically all accidents involving anhydrous ammonia can be avoided through the facility?s program of proper training; knowledge of the equipment and procedures; and conducting preventive maintenance on all ammonia equipment. Reddy Ice has instituted administrative and engineering controls as well as training programs on the corporate level to prevent such accidents.\n\nThe facility has multiple safeguards pertinent to the anhydrous ammonia process. These include an ammonia detection and alarm system, exhaust purge fans, controls which shut down the compressors if operating limits are exceeded, and the capability of shutting the entire system down if required. Administrative controls are in place that limit the utilization of vessels to less than 50% of their intended capacities.\n\nThe company has developed an emergency action plan that includes procedures for notification of emergency authorities/agencies and the public, "

This accident prevention program is a way to make safe operations and accident prevention systematic throughout the facility. Reddy Ice Group corporate management and Reddy Ice-CASSCO/Marshville management are committed to operating a safe and compliant facility for the protection of its employees, the public, and the environment. A Combined Process Safety Management/Risk Management (PSM/RM) Program has been developed to meet the accidental release prevention requirements of both EPA?s Risk Management Program (40 CFR Part 68) and OSHA?s Process Safety Management Standard (29 CFR 1910.119) under the Clean Air Act. The Combined PSM/RM Program contains thirteen elements, establishing requirements for employee participation, safety information, hazard analysis, pre-startup safety review, standard operating procedures, employee training, management of change, mechanical integrity/preventive maintenance, hot work permits, contractor qualifications, release incident investigation, compliance audits, and trade secrets. These elements are tied together by a management system to ensure plant-wide development, implementation and integration of all the Program requirements.\n\nMANAGEMENT SYSTEM\nA management system has been developed to oversee the implementation of the PSM/RM Program elements. The plant engineer has been identified as PSM/RM Program Coordinator, with overall responsibility for developing, implementing and integrating the Program requirements. Under the PSM/RM Program, various responsibilities may be assigned to other individuals. The plant manager and others are listed as additional responsible personnel, but the plant engineer i"

A safety manager is responsible for conducting monthly safety meetings with dock employees and addressing any safety issues brought up by employees during the month.\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT\nAs required by the Risk Management Program regulations, the Reddy Ice-CASSCO/Marshville facility has conducted a hazard assessment including offsite consequence analyses (OCAs) for potential accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. The OCAs describe the potential offsite exposure to surrounding areas from an accidental release. A worst-case release scenario and alternative release scenarios were developed and calculated using the EPA RMP*Comp modeling program, and the potentially affected offsite population and facilities were identified.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThe Reddy Ice-CASSCO/Marshville facility has not had any releases that would require reporting as part of a five-year accident history.\n\nEMERGENCY PLANNING AND RESPONSE\nThe Reddy Ice-CASSCO/Marshville facility operates under an Emergency Action Plan (EAP) that includes procedures for: notifying plant personnel, the public, and local emergency responders; emergency evacuation/response procedures; use of emergency alarms and equipment; employee training in evacuation and response procedures; first aid for ammonia exposure; and periodic review and updating of the emergency action plan. The plan is reviewed regularly for verification of data, and revised and updated as necessary to reflect changes in facility operations and personnel.\n\nAs required, the facility has coordinated emergency response activities with the Union County Emergency Management Agency and the Beaver Lane Volunteer Fire Department, and has appropriate mechanisms in place to notify emergency responders if needed. The ammonia inventory is verified and reported annually to the state and local authorities, and the plant is incorporated into the community emergency response plan developed under 42 USC."
