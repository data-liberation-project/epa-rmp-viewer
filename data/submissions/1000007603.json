An outline of the RMP Program is provided in Table ES-1.  The disinfection process using chlorine and ammonia is covered under this regulation at the Sewerage and Water Board of New Orleans (S&WB) Carrollton Water Purification Plant (WPP).\n\nTo meet the regulation requirements, this report contains useful information on the chlorine and ammonia systems.  The technical information contained in this report may be used as a reference in initial and recurring operator training.  Training on process fundamentals, operations, and maintenance, coupled with the recommended process modifications discussed below, will reduce the potential hazards to plant personnel and the surrounding community.\n\nTable ES-1 \nOutline of RMP Program\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT\nWorst-Case Scenarios\nAlternative Release Scenarios\n5-year Accident History\nMANAGEMENT PROGRAM\nDocument Management System\nPREVENTION PROGRAM\nSafety Information\nHazard Review\nOperating Procedures\nTraining\nMaintenance\nIncident Investigation\nCompliance Audit\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nRISK MANAGEMENT PLAN\n\nAn overview of the Emergency Response Program and an Incident Investigation Program are also included in the report.  These two programs should be an integral part of both initial and recurring training.\n\nPrint outs from the RMP*eSubmit, which summarizes the RMP in the format required by the EPA, are included in Section 12 of this document.  It consists of a summary of data elements as required by EPA for inclusion in a public access database.  The RMP is intended to inform the public of Carrollton WPPA!A|s proactive stance toward protection of the environment and the surrounding community.\n\nES.1 Hazard Assessment\nThe Hazard Assessment is comprised of a Worst-Case Scenario (WCS) and Alternative Release S"

The Hazard Assessment was conducted as an initial screening procedure as part of determining which Program Level (I, II, or III) the Carrollton WPP falls.  Residences lie within the EPA-defined endpoint concentrations of CarrolltonA!A|s Worst-Case releases. Therefore, the plant is ineligible for Program I.  The Carrollton WPP is operated by public personnel and therefore excluded from Program III.  Carrollton WPP is included in RMP Program II.  The Hazard Assessment is provided in Section 1.\n\nES.1.1 Worst-Case Scenario\nThe WCS for the chlorine system is defined as a 55-ton railcar (110,000 pounds) of chlorine being released by a catastrophic event within a 10 minute duration.  This scenario was developed and modeled using the EPA approved RMP*Comp model. The toxic endpoint for chlorine was determined to be 9.9 miles by RMP*Comp at the 0.0087 milligrams per liter (mg/l) (3 ppm) concentration specified by the EPA.  It should be noted that at this concentration, a person may be exposed for up to one hour without suffering permanent injuries (Emergency Response Planning Guidelines [ERPG-2]).\n\nThe WCS for the ammonia system (10,000 gallon tank - 85% full) is defined as 8,500 gallons (48,435lbs) of ammonia being released by a catastrophic event within a 10 minute duration.  This scenario was developed and modeled using the EPA approved RMP*Comp model.  The toxic endpoint for ammonia was determined to be 2.6 miles by the RMP*Comp model at the 0.14 mg/l (200 ppm) concentration specified by the EPA.  It should be noted that at this concentration, a person may be exposed for up to one hour without suffering permanent injuries (ERPG-2).\n\nES.1.2 Alternative Release Scenario\nThe ARS of chlorine was modeled using RMP*Comp. An estimation of approximately 4,350 pounds of chlorine gas released was derived from the scenario of a flexible connection failure.  The toxic endpoint for the chlorine s"

Documentation for minor release incidents/leaks for the chlorine and ammonia systems are included in Appendix D.\n\nES.3 Management Program\nThe Management Program consists of the Document Management System described below:\n\nES.3.1 Document Management System\nA Document Management System was established to attribute responsibility for the development, implementation, and maintenance of the RMP Program. The Program must be updated every three years, or any time a covered process undergoes a physical or administrative modification.  The Document Management System is largely a function of the RMP Program Team, summarized in Table ES-2.\n\nES.3.2 Risk Management Program Team\nTable ES-2 lists the employees responsible for the RMP Program development, implementation, and maintenance.

Each is briefly described below.\n\nES.4.2 Chemical Safety Information\nComprehensive chemical data is provided in this section to include; regulatory reporting action thresholds, health hazard and chemical exposure limitations, as well as physical properties of chlorine and ammonia. This information was compiled from numerous sources, and is intended to be a one-stop source for the reader seeking data on these compounds.  The physical data will provide useful information in the inevitable event the plant process is modified, thereby requiring revisited dense gas dispersion modeling.  It is also imperative that plant operators and managers are appraised of the potential health hazards and exposure limits associated with these chemicals.\n\nES.4.3 Process Safety Information\nProcess Safety Information was compiled on each system studied.  Basic specifications on each process are included in this document for easy reference.  Details such as maximum inventory, safe upper and lower temperatures, safe upper and lower pressures, and codes and standards used to design, build and operate the process are provided in this section.  Used as a training reference, together with the process schematics, the reader will be able to understand the function and operation of the plant chlorine and ammonia systems.\n\nES.5 Hazard Review\nThe Hazard Review conducted for the chlorine system in 2004 has been reviewed and updated.  Progress made to date on the 2004 recommendations is provided.  Also, the EPA facility audit performed in the ammonia system in 2004 has been reviewed and updated.

The EPA has established strict guidelines to follow in the aftermath of any release involving the chlorine or ammonia system.  The Incident Investigation Program outlines key milestones that must be accomplished within 24 hours of any covered incident, and the actions that must occur subsequently.  Ultimately, it is desired that the plant learns from the incident and takes action to prevent similar incidents in the future.  Incident Investigation Report Forms are included, and must be maintained for a minimum of five years after each incident.  Copies of incident reports that occurred between 2004 and 2009 have been included in Appendix D.\n\nES.10 Compliance Audits\nInternal Compliance Audits must be conducted every three years to verify compliance with the programs and procedures contained in this document.  The Plant Manager must certify that the RMP Program team has evaluated compliance with the provisions of the Program, and verify that the procedures and practices are adequate and are being followed.
