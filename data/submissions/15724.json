      "SummaryText": "A.  Description of Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nVitafoam Incorporated is a flexible polyurethane foam manufacturing facility located in High Point, North Carolina.  As a result of the manufacturing process, the following regulated chemicals are present at the facility in quantities that exceed the threshold quantities specified by EPA regulations: toluene diisocyanate (TDI) (10,000 pounds).  The facility has one covered process that requires the facility meet Program 2 requirements of the Risk Management Program (RMP) regulations. \n\nTDI is delivered to the facility via railcars and offloaded into storage tanks.  In the process, TDI is used in the production of polyurethane foam. The facility manufactures polyurethane foam by the vigorous mechanical mixing of polyols with TDI along with water, catalyst and surfactants.  The resultant polymeric network is expanded with carbon dioxide which is formed in the reaction between the water and TDI.\n\nVitafoam has submitted a Title V permit applicatoin to the State of North Carolina but has not yet received a Title V permit at the time of this submittal.  Therefore, the Title V permit number was left blank in this submission.\n \nB. Accidental Release Prevention & Emergency Response Policies of Vitafoam\n\nVitafoam is committed to protecting facility personnel, the public and the environment from any workplace and accidental release hazards.  Appropriate responses to releases of TDI are documented in the Section 7 of the Risk Management Program document.  Safety, environmental protection and risk management programs are fully implemented and coordinated with community emergency responders for emergency planning and response efforts.\n\nC. Release Scenario Discussion\n\nIn accordance with the requirements of the RMP regulations each owner or operator of a stationary source is required to perform the following offsite consequence analyses.\n7 One worst-case release scenario to represent all regulated toxic substanc"

A worst-case scenario was conducted TDI.\n7 One alternative release scenario for each regulated toxic substance held in excess of the threshold quantity.  An alternative scenario was calculated for TDI.\n\nThe following are brief descriptions of the release scenarios that are being submitted by Vitafoam.   Vitafoam elected to use ALOHA to calculate estimated release rates and to determine the distances to the TDI endpoint.  Vitafoam evaluated a worst-case and alternative scenarios for inclusion in the Risk Management Plan (RMPlan).  More detailed information is provided in Sections 2 and 3 of the RMPlan. \n\nToxic Chemicals\nWorst-Case Release Scenario\n\nThe worst-case toxic release scenario for Vitafoam was determined to be an instantaneous liquid spill and vaporization of TDI from a 20,000 gallon (204,000 lbs) railcar.  A major release of this magnitude is extremely unlikely due to the advances that have taken place in railcar design.  ALOHA was used to estimate the distance to the toxic endpoint.  The results are presented in section 2 of the RMPlan.\n\nAlternative Release Scenarios\n\nThe alternative release scenario for TDI was determined to be the shearing off of an unloading hose during unloading resulting in a small liquid spill. The unloading is always conducted under observation.  ALOHA was used to estimate the distance to the toxic endpoint.  The results are presented in the RMPlan.\n\nD. Five-year Accident History\n\nUnder the EPA RMP regulations, an accidental release is defined as a release of a regulated substance that \"resulted in deaths, injuries or significant property damage on-site, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\"  Within the past five years, Vitafoam has had no accidents that meet these requirements.\n\nE.

The hazard review was performed using What-If/ Checklists.  The hazard review identified the hazards associated with the regulated substance in the TDI process; causes of potential accidental release scenarios; safeguards used to prevent accidental releases; and methods used to detect, monitor or control accidental releases.
