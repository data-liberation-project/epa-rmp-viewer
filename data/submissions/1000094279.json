Safety at our facility is inherent on the manner in which anhydrous ammonia is handled. While the design of the facility incorporates a multitude of safety devices, safe handling procedures combined with appropriate training of our personnel and the selection of qualified contractors are key aspects to maintaining safety at our facility.  \n\n\n\nFacility and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nValley Bakers is a storage and distribution facility. Storage and distribution requires the use of a refrigeration system to preserve the integrity of the products stored. This refrigeration processes uses anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant. Access to the facility is restricted to authorized employees, management personnel, and approved contractors.  The regulated substance handled at this facility is anhydrous ammonia.  The ammonia refrigeration system inventory is approximately 11,194 pounds of anhydrous ammonia. There is no standby or makeup inventory kept onsite.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program And Ammonia Specific Prevention\n\n\n\nValley Bakers complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations. The design and construction of this facility was in accordance with published standards, recommended methods of trade, industry or governmental organizations.  The written PSM plan incorporates many policies and procedures to ensure safe operation and maintenance of this facility. \n\nPlan elements essential to safe operation of the refrigeration systems include employee participation, process hazard information, process hazard analysis, operating procedures, training, contractor safety, pre-startup safety review, mechanical integrity, management of change, hot-work permits, incident investigation, emergency response and planning, and compliance audits.  This plan will be reviewed and updated a"

This training uses guidelines developed by the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) and Refrigeration Engineers Technology Association (RETA). Only qualified maintenance personnel operate and interact with the refrigeration system. This minimizes the chances of inadvertent error in operation that could lead to a release of ammonia.  Startup, shutdown, and any onstream adjustments are handled by qualified contractors.\n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThis facility has not had any significant or reportable release of ammonia at the facility in the past five years.\n\n\n\nWorst Case and Alternative Case Release Scenarios\n\n\n\nPlease see onsite records for detailed offsite consequence analysis.\n\n\n\nEmergency Action Program\n\n\n\nValley Bakers has a written Emergency Action Plan developed to ensure that precautions and procedures are in place to protect employee and public health and safety during a chemical emergency. It complies with the provisions of OSHA regulations, 29 CFR 1910.38. The Emergency Action Plan includes pre-emergency planning and coordinating with outside parties. This enables those who deal with emergencies to have a course of action to effectively deal with unplanned events.  The approach in the development of this plan has been to identify the ammonia emergencies most likely to occur at the site and establish precautions and procedures to protect life safety and health during an emergency. \n\nThe refrigeration process has back-up prevention systems to keep processing malfunctions from becoming ammonia release emergencies.\n\n\n\nThe role and procedures for obtaining external emergency assistance are established with the Greenville Fire Department, including the Regional HazMat Team stationed in Appleton. The Emergency Action Plan also includes procedur"

This plan will be reviewed and updated as necessary.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes To Improve Safety\n\n\n\nAll system components meet design specifications in ANSI/IIAR, equipment, design, and installation of ammonia mechanical refrigerating systems. All pressure vessels are built according to American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code, pressure vessels. Any upgrades or extensive maintenance work performed in the future will be in compliance with those standards applicable at that time and will also be evaluated through the management of change element as required by PSM standards.  In addition, all of the recommendations from the PHA will be addressed in a timely manner which will improve the safety and practice of the Valley Bakers facility.\n\n"
