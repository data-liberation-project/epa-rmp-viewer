As a requirement of the Clean Air Act Amendments 112(r) Accidental Release of Hazardous Air Substances program, IRE completed this risk management plan (RMP) for anhydrous ammonia, which is stored on site above the reporting threshold of 10,000 pounds.  This information is considered to be public. \n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\n\n\n\nIRE is committed to the protection of its employees, the greater community and the environment from hazardous substances used in the ethanol fuel production process.  It is the policy of IRE to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  In the event of an emergency, IRE will address small releases of ammonia with a response by trained and protected IRE employees.  In the event of an accidental catastrophic release of anhydrous ammonia, it is the policy of IRE to notify the local Rochelle police and fire departments and evacuate all employees at the facility.  \n\n\n\nRegulated Substances Handled:\n\n\n\nThe facility produces fuel grade ethanol and a process by-product known as dry distillers' grain, which is used as a livestock feed.  The ammonia is stored in liquid form in an on site, above ground storage tank and is introduced to the process feed mixture in the slurry tank in order to control pH prior to fermentation.  The maximum amount of anhydrous ammonia on site is estimated to be 86,600 pounds.  \n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program:\n\n\n\nThrough completion of this RMP, IRE has complied with the EPA requirements of 40 CFR Part 68.  Process safety information and operations/maintenance procedures are documented on-site.  Periodic functions such as process hazard analysis, training, change management and incident investigation are conducted on a regular basi"
