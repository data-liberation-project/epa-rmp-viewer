The facility is located on the southwest side of Cedar Rapids, Iowa at the intersection of 41st Avenue Drive and C Street Southwest.  This ISO 9001 and ISO 14001 certified facility employs 182 people and operates under a team-based organizational structure.\n\n\n\nThe facility manufactures enzymes through a fermentation based process.  Enzymes are chemicals comprised of large proteins and have been used in the food and detergent manufacturing industries for many years.  The facility's enzyme products are available in liquid or granular form.  The facility operates a continuous 24-hour-per-day process and has maintenance and laboratory support.  Support staff includes site management, safety, health and environmental (SHE), engineering, purchasing, finance, and systems personnel.\n\n\n\nAmmonium hydroxide is the regulated substance under EPA Risk Management criteria.  The enzyme manufacturing process requires the use of ammonium hydroxide at 29.9% concentration.  Average on-site storage of ammonium hydroxide solution is approximately 28,000 liters, equal to 16,485 pounds of ammonia content.  The ammonium hydroxide prevention program covers ammonium hydroxide unloading operations, storage, transfer, and fermentation operations.\n\n\n\nChemical Safety\n\n\n\nThe site's overall approach to chemical safety is comprehensive.  Systems are engineered with safety and environmental aspects in mind, with input from all affected areas of the plant prior to construction or use.  The goal is to provide a safe workplace while minimizing environmental impact.  Release prevention methods are implemented where possible, including automation, containment of all outdoor tanks and indoor sump areas, and on-site a"

All employees are trained in the site Emergency Action Plan as part of the established initial safety training for new employees.\n\n\n\nThe Emergency Action Plan also introduces the function and responsibilities of the site Emergency Response Team (ERT).  ERT members are trained in Fire Extinguisher Use, Operations Level Industrial Chemical Spill Response, First Aid/Adult CPR, Automatic External Defibrillator, and Bloodborne Pathogens. \n\n\n\nThis group trains annually as well as conducts drills and tabletop scenarios to prepare for incident handling.  On-site ERT equipment is maintained to support the ERT efforts.  The team partners with the Cedar Rapids Fire Department & HazMat Team with regards to chemical spill preparation and response.  The primary focus of the site ERT in the event of a chemical spill is to assess the situation, notify emergency services, evacuate and account for all employees and provide support to emergency responders as needed.
