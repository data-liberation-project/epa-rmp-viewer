      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\nWe at A.E. Staley Manufacturing Company-Sagamore are strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety. This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\nTHE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\nOur facility's primary activities encompass the manufacture of modified starches for food and industrial use. We have two regulated substances at our facility. These substances include Propylene Oxide [oxirane, -methyl] and Sulfur Dioxide (anhydrous). Propylene Oxide is used for starch product substitution in the manufacture of modified starches for industrial and food applications. Sulfur Dioxide (anhydrous) is used to control microbial growth during the corn steeping process and also weakens the starch-gluten bonds so the separation process following steeping is more efficient.\n\nThe maximum inventory of Propylene Oxide at our facility is 380,000 lb which is the sum of the maximum bulk tank capacity of 210,000 lb and the railcar capacity of 170,000 lb. The maximum inventory of Sulfur Dioxide at our facility is 61,486 lb. \n\nTHE WORST CASE SCENARIO AND THE ALTERNATE RELEASE SCENARIOS\nWe used EPA's RMP Guidance for Offsite Consequence Analysis and EPA's RMP Comp software to evaluate the Worst Case and Alternate Release Scenario for Propylene Oxide. EPA's RMP Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants and the EPA's RMP Comp software was used to evaluate the Worst Case and Alternate Release Scenarios for Sulfur Dioxide. The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nTHE WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO submitted involves catastrophic release from the Sulfur Dioxide tank. In this scen"

      "SummaryText": "ario 61,486 lb of Sulfur Dioxide (anhydrous) is released as a gas liquified by pressure with volitalization to the gasseous form over 10 minutes. The enclosure around the Sulfur Dioxide tank was considered passive mitigation and had the effect of mitigating the release rate to 55% of the maximum. At class F atmospheric stability, 1.5 m/s wind speed, and urban topography the maximum distance of 5.6 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.0078 mg/L.\n\nTHE PROPYLENE OXIDE ALTERNATE RELEASE SCENARIO involves a break of the flexible transfer line between a full railcar pressurized to 3 psig with a nitrogen blanket and the Propylene Oxide bulk tank. The scenario involves the release of 10,000 lb of Propylene Oxide . Since the transfer pipe connects to the suction side of the unloading pump, pumping would cease after transfer pipe break due to the loss of prime. The operator, who is present during the entire unloading process, would immediately shut off the nitrogen pressurizing the car. Propylene Oxide release would continue for 9.5 minutes until the pressure falls to atmospheric and the car head pressure is reduced below that necessary to lift Propylene Oxide out of the rail car. The toxic liquid released is assumed to form a pool on the ground within the earthen bermed area around the unloading area. The pool is assumed to evaporate within 5.53 minutes. Under neutral weather conditions of class D atmospheric stability and 3 m/s wind speed and an urban topography the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.59 mg/L of Propylene Oxide is 0.4 miles.\n\nTHE SULFUR DIOXIDE ALTERNATE RELEASE SCENARIO involves a break of the 1-1/2 inch transfer line between a Sulfur Dioxide truck and the bulk Sulfur Dioxide tank. The scenario involves the release of 11,250 lb of Sulfur Dioxide. The existing controls prevent bulk tank losses. The operator and the truck driver monitoring the truck unloading will require 30 minutes to stop the release. The toxic gas will be relea"

This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-30 Standard, applicable ANSI standards and ASME standards for pressure vessels. All chemical storage systems were designed and are maintained in conformance with chemical supplier recommendations. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION- A.E. Staley Manufacturing Company-Sagamore maintains a record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment design associated with all processes.\n\nPROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS- Our facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently. The methodology used to carry out these analyses is the What If Scenario. The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at regular intervals. Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner. The most recent PHA review for the Sulfur Dioxide system was performed 5/2/95 . The most recent PHA review for the Propylene Oxide system was performed on 12/15/1999.\n\nOPERATING PROCEDURES- For the purpose of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, A.E. Staley Manufacturing Company-Sagamore maintains written operating procedures. These procedures address various"

The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the process.\n\nTRAINING- A.E. Staley Manufacturing Company-Sagamore has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes. Refresher training is provided as needed. \n\nMECHANICAL INTEGRITY- A.E. Staley Manufacturing Company-Sagamore carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations. Process equipment examined by these checks includes: pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps. Qualified personnel carry out maintenance operations with previous training in maintenance practices. Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed. Any equipment deficiencies identified by maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nMANAGEMENT OF CHANGE- Written procedures are in place at A.E. Staley Manufacturing Company-Sagamore to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures. The most recent review/revision of maintenance procedures was performed in 11/1/2003. Process operators, maintenance personnel, or any other employee whose job task are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\nCOMPLIANCE AUDITS- A.E.
