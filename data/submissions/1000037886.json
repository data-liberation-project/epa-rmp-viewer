The facility began operations in 1962, and Lion Copolymer purchased the facility in June 2007.\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES AT THE STATIONARY SOURCE\r\nThe facility maintains a comprehensive Emergency Response Plan (ERP) to guide emergency response operations in the event of a spill or release of a hazardous material or other emergency event, such as a fire, explosion, process upset, property damage, medical incident, severe weather, or breach of security.  The ERP includes the following sections:\r\n     Core emergency procedures;\r\n     Individual procedures for responding to and managing specific types of hazardous conditions or emergencies that may occur at the facility;\r\n     Checklists designed for use by the persons that fulfill the positions in the Emergency Operations Center during an incident;\r\n     Chemical Emergency Response Guidelines for the primary hazardous materials at the facility; \r\n     Supplemental resources that can assist in managing and coordinating response to an emergency; and\r\n     Miscellaneous information supporting emergency planning and response.\r\nThe operational readiness of the ERP is maintained through regular drills and exercises, periodic internal reviews, and by incorporating best practices from within the chemical manufacturing industry as appropriate. \r\n\r\nThe facility is also a member of the Ascension Parish CAER (Community Awareness and Emergency Response) program.  This organization is part of an on-going effort to maintain communication between industry, the general public, and law enforcement, emergency response and environmental agencies.\r\n \r\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\r\nThe Geismar Facility handles three RMP chemicals (one toxic and two flammable) with quantities above the regulation threshold.

Also, on site, is a fully equipped exterior, industrial fire brigade, a confined space/high angle rescue team, a HAZMAT/Incident Command team, and trained Incident Commanders.  These teams are regularly drilled to handle fire fighting situations, confined space extractions, and chemical release containment.\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\nThe Geismar Plant is registered to the ISO 14001 international environmental standard and is also an OSHA Voluntary Protection Program (VPP) Star facility.  As part of these programs, the facility has committed to continual improvement of its environmental, health and safety programs.  As an example, this RMP Plan is being updated in 2014 to account for removal of two RMP regulated substances from the site, which has eliminated all toxic release scenarios.  Lion Copolymer's position has been and continues to be one of maintaining the safety of its employees and the general public."

The RMP eSubmit Program does not allow this chemical to be entered; therefore it is not included in the submittal file.  This chemical is associated with a Program 3 PSM process and is included in the Executive Summary for documentation. \r\n\r\nFLAMMABLE:  Propylene is used as a refrigerant in the Polymers Process.  A flammable mixture comprised of propylene, ethylene, propane, and ethane is contained in the Polymers Process.

Ethane and propane are generated during the reaction process from the ethylene and propylene.  \r\n \r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\nThe requirements in the RMP regulation to prevent accidental releases are being met at the Geismar facility by established programs which include:\r\n     Operator training and certification,\r\n     Work Permits,\r\n     Hazard Communications,\r\n     Management of Change for Process and Equipment,\r\n     Process Hazard Analysis,\r\n     Reports of Unsafe Conditions,\r\n     Safety Orientations,\r\n     Emergency response training,\r\n     Routinely updated operating procedures,\r\n     Computers and computerized control systems,\r\n     Emergency control / shutdown devices / interlocks,\r\n     Equipment / piping safety controls,\r\n     Warning alarms,\r\n     Regular safety checks, and\r\n     Equipment inspections.\r\n\r\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\nLion Copolymer has not had an accidental relea"
