Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\nCentral Coast Cooling conducts inspection procedures to review refrigeration equipment prior to startup and during operations. These procedures identify potential sources of release and equipment corrections required to prevent these releases. On-site personnel and certified refrigeration contractors review the equipment as required.\r\nOn-site personnel provide initial emergency response. On-site personnel will make a preliminary assessment in the event of a release and will provide first response. First response may include emergency equipment shutdown, system isolation, or controlled operation such as pump down to prevent or reduce an off-site release. No emergency operations will be performed that are beyond the capabilities of the operators or other on-site personnel. Local fire and police departments with mutual aid response will provide emergency response for a major release event. Refrigeration contractors would also be on-call to provide emergency response.\r\nEmergency response training will be conducted yearly for current employees and as required to for new employees. Records will be kept of all training performed at the site for a minimum of five (5) years.\r\n\r\n2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\r\nCentral Coast Cooling uses anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant in their operations. Drawings in Chapter 8 of RMP binder show the facility site plan and refrigeration system.\r\nThe ammonia system is used for cold storage, produce pre-cooling and ice generation. The refrigeration system is composed of both fixed and portable equipment. Fixed system includes, one twin screw compressor, evaporative condensers, pressure vessels, ammonia pumps, cold room evaporative cooling coils, pressure cooling systems, ammonia detection, control systems and diffusion tank. Portable systems are one compressor skid, two half car vacuum tubes, one hydroshower skid, and one ice generation trailer. All porta"

      "SummaryText": "ble equipment are removed from the site at the end of the operational season and fixed system is shut down and all ammonia in the system is pumped down to high pressure receiver. High pressure receiver is located under shaded structure and protected by pressure relief valves and the water sprinkler system against the high pressure situations in the summer time. Vacuum tubes, hydroshower and the portable compressor skid are tied to main system, while the ice generation trailer operates as a stand alone system. \r\nFacility operates seasonally from approximately April 15 through November 15. Portable refrigeration systems are brought to the site during this time only. All of the fixed refrigeration equipment except the room evaporators and pressure coolers are located outdoors. \r\nAll compressors have safety switches that would shut down the compressors upon detection of unsafe operating conditions. Refrigeration control system sends alarms to refrigeration manager in case of emergency situation or any high pressure, high temp or ammonia detection. All pressure vessels and compressors are protected against high-pressure situations by safety relief valves. There are ammonia detectors in the cold rooms for alarming. There are assigned responders experienced with ammonia refrigeration that would respond to and determine specific actions for any incident.\r\nThe refrigeration systems at the facility were constructed as per applicable codes and industry standards at the time of construction. The total ammonia charge of the refrigeration systems at the facility is approximately 19,100 lb \r\nRefrigeration system drawings are located in Chapter 8-Process Safety Information.\r\n\r\n3. General Accidental Release Prevention Program\r\nCentral Coast Cooling maintains a release prevention program to eliminate or minimize releases. The program includes regular inspections, monitoring equipment and logging conditions, scheduled maintenance, and operator training. There is a program to analyze r"

Operators and mechanics are trained for safe operation and maintenance of the refrigeration system. They are also trained in emergency response procedures in the event of an ammonia release. Ammonia detectors are installed in all refrigerated rooms. Personnel will automatically be notified if any detector exceeds its set point. Monitoring is done 24 hours per day. Most of the relief valves at the facility are tied into an ammonia diffusion tank to prevent high-pressure releases to ambient. A recommendation to tie remaining relief valves to diffusion tanks is added to \"Corrective Items\" list.\r\n\r\n4. Five-Year Accident History\r\nAccording to Central Coast Cooling personnel, there has been no releases of anhydrous ammonia resulting in reportable quantities or injuries since they acquired the facility in October 2014. Facility had one small incident in 04/04/2010 due to earthquake while it was operated by River Ranch Fresh Foods. \r\n\r\n5. Emergency Response Program\r\nIn event of a release, certain personnel are designated to determine the potential hazard and coordinate response procedures. The Safety Coordinator is responsible in coordinating emergency response and will be contacting emergency response agencies, schools, daycare centers, and acute care facilities that may be affected by the release. The Safety Coordinator will also be responsible for evacuation of employees if necessary and for coordination with community emergency responders if off-site evacuations are required. A description of the emergency response plan is included in Chapter 22."
