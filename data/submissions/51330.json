If an accidental release should occur, the Facility is prepared to work with the local fire department or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.  A detailed emergency response plan has been developed and will be implemented in the event of an accidental release.\n\n2.0  Facility Information\nThe primary activity at the Facility is the storage and sale of fertilizers and the sale of pre-packaged agricultural chemicals to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia and aqua ammonia are received, stored, and distributed for direct application as crop production nutrients.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received by truck and stored in one 15,000 gallon and one 18,000 gallon storage tanks (bullets) at the site.  The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia handled in this process is 144,200 pounds.  Anhydrous ammonia is converted to aqua ammonia that is stored in four 66,000 gallon above ground tanks at the site.  Alternatively aqua ammonia may be delivered by truck.  The maximum quantity of aqua ammonia handled is 2,019,600 pounds of 24% solution.\n\n3.0  Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\na.  Anhydrous Ammonia Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\nThe worst-case release scenario is failure of the largest storage tank when filled to the greatest amount.  This scenario would release 78,642 pounds of anhydrous ammonia which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85% capacity as limited by the regulations.  The alternative release scenario, based on a more plausible potential incident, is a release from a broken 2-inch diameter pipe with an increased wind speed and atmospheric stability class \"D\".\n\nb.

The alternative release scenario, based on a more plausible potential incident, is a release from a pipe break with an increased wind speed and atmospheric stability class \"D\".\n\n4.0  Accidental Release Prevention Program\nAnhydrous Ammonia and Aqua Ammonia:  the Facility implements the provisions of the \"Safety Requirements for Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K61.1\" published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc; California Code of Regulations, Title 8, Subchapter 1, \"Unfired Pressure Vessel Safety Orders\"; and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.\"\n\n5.0  Five-year Accident History\nThe Facility has not had an accidental release of either anhydrous ammonia or aqua ammonia in the past five years resulting in death, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, or property or environmental damage.\n\n6.0  Emergency Response Program\nThe Facility has developed an emergency response program in accordance with the following regulations:\n-  OSHA 29 CFR 1910.38;\n-  OSHA 29 CFR 1910.120; and \n-  Section 25503, Division 6.95 of the California Health and Safety Code.\n\n7.0  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\nSafety improvements are an on-going process at the Facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  Specific changes to the anhydrous ammonia and aqua ammonia processes at the Facility will be implemented as needed."
