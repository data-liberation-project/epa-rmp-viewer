As part of our continuous improvement efforts, the Facility reviews the effectiveness of these procedures on an annual basis.\r\n\r\nWe have developed and implemented an Emergency Response Program.  The program is documented in the Site's Emergency Action Plan (EAP). The purpose of the Emergency Response Program is to specify how Facility personnel will respond to emergencies of: fire, ammonia release, other chemical release, bomb or other criminal activity threat, severe weather, severe injury or illness, and power outage. \r\n\r\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nThe only regulated substance triggering the need for this RMP is ammonia.\r\n\r\nVentura Foods, Ontario Facility, operates a closed-loop ammonia refrigeration system.
