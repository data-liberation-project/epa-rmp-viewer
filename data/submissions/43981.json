All are present in quantities that exceed the threshold quantity for applicability of EPA's Accidental Release Program. Ethylene oxide, methyl chloride (both are toxic chemicals), and trimethylamine (a flammable chemical) are utilized at this facility for the manufacture of nutritional supplements, animal food products for the poultry, beef, dairy, and companion animal industry, and also in the oil well production industry. Ethylene oxide is also repackaged for use in the sterilization of medical implements and spices. BCP Ingredients commitment to providing a safe and healthy work environment for employees, as well as providing a safe and healthy environment for the surrounding community is supported by the incorporation of the latest technology in process controls, active mitigation, passivemitigation, and monitoring detection systems. BCP Ingredients adheres to all applicable Federal, State, and local safety and environmental regulations for the prevention of releases of these and all chemicals. All information regarding BCP Ingredients Risk Management Plan has been submitted to EPA utilizing EPA's RMP Submit Software.

      "SummaryText": " 3. Program 3 ( which is OSHA's Process Safety Management Plan) is a comprehensive program with fourteen elements, including process hazard analysis, employee training, operating procedures, mechanical integrity, pre-safety startup, contractor safety, emergency planning and response, compliance auditing, and employ participation. The Process Safety Management Program ensures that the processes and the equipment in the processes are designed, constructed, and maintained according to industry codes and standards, and that the processes follow good engineering practices. The mechanical integrity element of the program includes continuous inspections and testing of equipment and monitoring devices in the processes to detect any deficiences and correct them before it contributes to a potential release incident. All elements of the Process Safety Management Program help to ensure that an uncontrolled release of ethylene oxide, methyl chloride, or trimethylamine is prevented.
