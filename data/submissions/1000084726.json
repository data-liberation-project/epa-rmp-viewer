Tanimura and Antle has developed their Risk Management Plan / Process Safety Management (RMP/PSM) Manuals to document policies and address the implementation of these regulations. The PSM sections pertain to the prevention of accidental releases and include the Process Hazard Analysis study and procedures for operating, training, maintenance, emergency response, and others. The RMP sections pertain to management systems and include the Hazard Assessment (Offsite Consequence Analysis) Report.\r\n\r\nFederal regulations require reporting when there is a release of ammonia exceeding 100 pounds in 24 hours.\r\n\r\nState regulations require reporting when there is an accidental release of ammonia or a threat of accidental release of ammonia. Tanimura and Antle interprets this regulation as any release that poses a threat of injury above and beyond minor irritation to anyone.\r\n\r\nAll releases and near misses are to be recorded using the incident investigation forms. All releases are to be monitored and all readings recorded. All releases and near misses are to be reviewed to develop procedures that may prevent future incidents.\r\n\r\nAny release of more than 25 ppm may result in immediately shutting down the ammonia system depending on the location of the release.

Releases less than 25 PPM shall result in immediately calling the Operations Manager and the Refrigeration Manager, if not on site, for instructions.\r\n\r\nThere is no full time employment at this facility. Employees are hired on a seasonal basis, with approximately 30 employees on site during the peak production period from October through April. The Maintenance Supervisor and other employees are trained to conduct visual and audible inspections of the ammonia system on a regular basis. They are instructed to report any condition that could result in an ammonia release immediately. An example would be excessive rust on piping or tanks. This team activity is the core of Tanimura and Antle's prevention program.  \r\n\r\nSTATIONARY SOURCE ACTIVITIES AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\r\nThe Tanimura and Antle facility provides product cooling, and short-term storage for fresh vegetables.\r\n\r\nThe facility is located in an light industrial area of Fresno county on a contiguous property. Ammonia is used as the refrigerant in the Main Plant Refrigeration System and Vacuum Cooling which includes interconnected portable equipment. The total ammonia inventory in the Main Plant system exceeds the Federal and State thresholds.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the Main Plant, smaller portable systems are located on the property. Because they contain less than 10,000 lbs of ammonia, they are covered as part of CalARP. Some of the standalone portable systems move to another facility for parts of the year. Some interconnecting piping between the portable components and the Main Plants are permanently mounted while others are removable.\r\n\r\nThe refrigeration systems are direct, mechanical refrigeration systems. The original facilities were built prior to 2003 and have been expended and modified since then. There is ammonia equipment is located outside or in the Refrigerated Rooms.\r\n\r\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT\r\nThe regulation requires that the Worst-Case Release Scenari"

In addition the Main Plant Systems are separated by walls and distance. Furthermore, as the refrigerant escapes, pressure will decrease, reducing the release rate. The scenario parameters are established by the regulation to provide uniformity for dialog between the industry, community, and regulatory agencies.\r\n\r\nThe regulation allows the facility to select the Alternate-Case Scenario.\r\n\r\nPREVENTION PROGRAM\r\nTanimura and Antle's Prevention Program is described in the RMP/PSM Manual. The RMP Prevention Program is equivalent to OSHA's Process Safety Management Program (PSM). The Prevention Program implemented by Tanimura and Antle is essential to help prevent or minimize the effects if a release occurs.\r\n\r\nKey objectives of Tanimura and Antle's Prevention Program are briefly described below:\r\n\r\n1) Maintain current and complete refrigeration system technical information. (Addressed under the Process Safety Information Element)\r\n\r\n2) Provide thorough team evaluation of the refrigeration system. The evaluation considers a number of potential problems including: mechanical problems, human errors, and external events (e.g., earthquakes). All safety recommendations developed by the team are reviewed and addressed by Tanimura and Antle. (Addressed under Process Hazard Analysis and Mechanical Integrity Elements).\r\n\r\n3) Written procedures and policies that establish how the refrigeration system should be operated and maintained and how to investigate accidental releases.

(Addressed under Training Element.)\r\n\r\n5) Employee involvement in the Prevention Program. This is addressed on two levels. First, refrigeration equipment operators participate in the planning and evaluation of the Prevention Programs (e.g., Process Hazard Analysis study team, writing and/or reviewing operating procedures, Incident Investigation team, etc.). This involvement encourages ownership of the Prevention Program and positively affects the operators' day-to-day activities. Second, all Tanimura and Antle employees (direct hires and contract) at this facility receive ammonia awareness training. Additionally, they have access to the RMP/PSM information. These activities improve the overall safety of the employees. (Both levels are addressed under the Employee Participation Element)\r\n\r\n6) Implementation of additional measures when changes are planned (procedural or mechanical). These measures begin before any changes are made and may include a Process Hazard Analysis, operator training, and Process Safety Information updates plus other measures required by Tanimura and Antle's Management of Change Procedure. \r\n \r\nIf a mechanical change is required and for maintenance contracts, Tanimura and Antle has a procedure for selecting a contractor based on the company's experience and safety history. Additionally, if welding, grinding, or other Hot Work occurs close to the refrigeration system, a Tanimura and Antle Hot Work permit is required. The purpose of the permit and the associated Hot Work procedure is to minimize the possibility of a fire. \r\n\r\nFollowing completion of a mechanical change, a pre-startup safety review is required before the system can be started.

Responders are not trained to enter an IDLH condition. Responders are trained to the (300 PPM) Air Purifying Respirator level. Responders will assist outside agencies during larger releases.\r\n\r\nDetailed plans (emergency action plans) have been developed to assist responding facility personnel. All areas (zones) inside the building can be brought under control within 20 minutes of any ammonia emergency or breakdown if personnel are on site. Small releases can be brought under control immediately.  \r\n\r\nThe emergency release response plan for all releases is to gain access to the shut down valves and switches for the system with the release.
