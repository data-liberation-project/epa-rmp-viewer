This Plant is one of six water and\n\nWastewater Plants operated by the City. Wastewater Plant#1 and \n\nfour other plants have quanties of regulated hazardous \n\nchemicals above the EPA threshold. The City has a unified Risk\n\nManagement Program which applies to each plant. Only\n\nWastewater Treatment Plant #1 operations and policies are \n\npresented in this Plan.\n\n\n\nWastewater Treatment #1 uses two regulated substances chlorine \n\n(CAS Number 7782-50-5)in the chlorination process.\n\nThe chlorination process consists of the use of chlorine from \n\none-ton cylinders to disinfect treated wastewater.\n\nThe other regulated substance is Sulfur dioxide (Cas Number 7446-09-5)\n\nused in the dechlorination process.\n\nThe sulfur dioxide process consist of the use of sulfur dioxide \n\nfrom one-ton clyinders for dechlorination of the treated wastewater.\n\n\n\nIn order to fulfill the requirements of the Risk Management Program \n\n(RMP), the facility has developed an accidental\n\nrelease prevention program and emergency action plan for the facility.\n\nThe accidental release prevention program\n\nsatisfies the requirements for the USEPA RMP and the Occupational \n\nSafety and Health Administration's (OSHA)\n\nProcess Safety Management (PSM) program.  The prevention program \n\nensures that the facility is operated under safe\n\nconditions and that any risk of an accidental release due to human \n\nerror, the facility's prevention program ensures that\n\noperating procedures are current and reviewed annually.Training \n\nalso plays a vital part in the facility's program.\n\nEmployees and contractors working near or on the chlorination \n\nprocess or sulfur dioxide process are required \n\nto be trained in the chlorination pro"

In \n\naddition, equipment pertaining to the chlorine process and\n\nthe sulfur dioxide process is visually inspected daily.  \n\n\n\nAll existing and proposed future chlorination and sulfur dioxide\n\nequipment have been designed according to applicable\n\nstandards and codes.The facility maintains records and documentation \n\non equipment inspection and tests. Precautions \n\nare taken to ensure that new equipment and processes are inspected \n\nand tested, that all changes on the process are authorized, and employees\n\n are informed of changes.\n\n\n\nThe facility performed a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) to address \n\nthe hazards in the chlorination and sulfur dioxide \n\nprocess to evaluate and control where potential for a chlorine or\n\nsulfur dioxide release exists.  \n\nEmployees were involved in determining hazards of the process and \n\nsubsequent consequences. The chlorination\n\nand sulfur dioxide process was found to be operating safely and no\n\nchanges were recommended.\n\n\n\nActive employee participation will ensure the success of the RMP \n\nat the facility.  Employees have been assigned various\n\ntasks to ensure that all elements of the RMP are implemented. \n\nThe facility has developed management forms to\n\nassist employees in recording and documenting the various elements \n\nof the RMP.\n\n\n\nAt the time of the submittal of this Risk Management Program, there\n\nhave been no accidental releases of chlorine\n\nor sulfur dioxide at this facility in the past five years.However, \n\nin the event that there is an accident"
