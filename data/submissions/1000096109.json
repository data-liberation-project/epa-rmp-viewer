Plant\n\nLDEQ facility ID # 1314\n\nDate of report: 12/2/2019  \n\n\n\n1.   Our Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nThe ECO Services Baton Rouge, LA Plant is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, hazard analysis, installation, operating procedures, mechanical integrity, management of change, incident investigation and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. The Baton Rouge site has also established an Emergency Response Team, consisting of plant personnel, that is well trained and prepared to respond to emergency situations.\n\n\n\n2.  Our Facility and the Regulated Substances handled\n\n\n\nThe Baton Rouge facility produces Sulfuric Acid including Oleum. Our facility's manufacturing activities encompass Sulfuric Acid Regeneration from Spent Acid, Oleum Production and Hazardous Waste Treatment Operations. The RMP-covered processes at our facility together handle the various regulated substances identified in this plan. \n\n\n\n3. Our General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nThe Baton Rouge facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR 68 of the EPA RMP regulations. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our facility.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\nThe Baton Rouge Facility maintains detailed records of safety information that describes the properties and hazards of the chemicals used in our manufacturing units, the process technology employed, safe operating parameters and safety "

The methodologies used to carry out these analyses are What-If and HAZOP.  The studies are undertaken by a cross-functional team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering, process operations and equipment maintenance, and are revalidated at a periodic interval of five years.  Any recommendations related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, the Baton Rouge Facility maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is periodically reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\n\n\nThe Baton Rouge Facility has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every three years and more frequently as needed.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\n\n\nThe Baton Rouge Facility carries out documented maintenance inspections on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these inspections includes, among others, pressure vessels, storage tanks, heat exchangers, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps. Process equipment that are in contact with the hazardous RMP-listed chemicals receive priority for inspections. Maintenance functions are carried out by qualified personnel with previous traini"

Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance inspections are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change\n\n\n\nWritten procedures are in place at the Baton Rouge Facility to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  Proposed changes are implemented after they have been justified and reviewed for potential hazards that are addressed prior to implementing the change.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of the change and why it is necessary, and offered training to understand and work with the modification.\n\n\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews\n\n\n\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to significant modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at the Baton Rouge Facility.  The extent of review is based on the complexity of the modification.  These reviews are conducted by a cross-functional team to confirm that construction, equipment, instrumentation, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\n\n\nThe Baton Rouge Facility conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP regulations are being implemented.  These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are prioritized and undertaken in a safe and timely manner.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\n\n\nThe Baton Rouge Facility promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated chemical.
