Five Year Accident History\n\nIn the five years previous to the submission of this report, the Texas Eastman Division Tyler Terminal facility has had no RMP reportable incidents.\n\nVI. Emergency Response Program\n\nTexas Eastman Division maintains a comprehensive site emergency response plan.  Employees study the plan as they prepare for the annual plant wide drill.  Key elements of the emergency response plan as it relates to community emergency response include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n* Selected Texas Eastman Tyler Terminal employees are provided with specialized training and proper personal protection to allow them to respond to flammable gas and liquid leak, disperse vapors with water, stop the leak and extinguish a fire.\n* For emergencies beyond the capabilities of Tyler Terminal employees to respond and control, outside assistance is available from the Tyler Fire Department and Smith County emergency response organization by calling the 911 emergency number.\n* For significant emergencies, emergency response personnel from the Texas Eastman Longview Plant are dispatched to the Tyler Terminal facility to assist. \n* Texas Eastman maintains a comprehensive site emergency plan for Tyler Terminal which includes procedures for notifying the City of Tyler Fire Department, Smith County Sheriff's Office and Smith County Fire Marshal's Office of any incident that has a potential for offsite impact.\n* Texas Eastman serves on Smith County LEPC\n* Texas Eastman hosts the Northeast Texas Fire School where local municipal and volunteer fire fighters from through"

All of the gases handled at the Tyler Terminal facility are colorless gas with a mild petroleum type odor and all are extremely flammable.  Leaks of these materials can ignite and create a flash fire or a vapor cloud explosion. \n\nUses:\nTexas Eastman Division uses butane and propane as the basic feedstock for the Texas Eastman Longview plant site.  Ethylene is used by the Texas Eastman Longview plant site as one of the basic building blocks for most of the other chemicals produced.\n\nIII. Worst Case Release Scenarios and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nToxic Substance Worst Case Scenario\n\nThere are no toxic substances at the Tyler Terminal facility above the threshold quantity and no potential for impact of the community with toxic materials.  \n\nFlammable Substance Worst Case Scenarios\n\nEthylene constitutes one of Tyler Terminal's flammable worst case scenarios.  In this scenario, the well head on one of the underground storage wells was assumed to fail catastrophically and ethylene was assumed to escape from the well at full flow until the largest possible flammable vapor cloud formed (about 10 minutes).  It was assumed that all of the safety systems in place to mitigate and reduce the amount of vapor in the atmosphere and prevent ignition also failed.  It was assumed that the vapor cloud then ignited and exploded.  This scenario shows potential off-site consequences.\n\nButane constitutes a second flammable worst case scenario for the Tyler Terminal because its potential off-site consequences impact in a slightly different part of the community.  In this scenario, it was assumed that the largest storage tank containing butane failed catastrophically and the entire contents of the storage tank plus all adjacent connected storage tanks immediately vaporized.  It was assumed that all safety systems in place to miti"

The assumed alternate release scenario was a 2-inch hole in a propane pipeline.  It was assumed that the propane leaked to form the largest possible vapor cloud from this leak (approximately 10 minutes), then ignited and created a flash fire.

This approach includes, but is not limited to, the following elements:\n\nDesigning For Safety\n\n* Storage tanks, vessels, and equipment are designed and constructed to strict industry and government standards.\n* Process design and operations are analyzed for safety prior to their installation, and periodically thereafter, in accordance with the requirements of OSHA's Process Safety Management standard.\n* Control systems and instruments provide continuous monitoring of operating conditions and alarm operators of upset conditions.\n* Emergency shutdown systems automatically shut down operations to a safe state if emergency conditions develop. \n* Area and equipment are protected by automatic deluge systems to cool the equipment in the event of a fire and disperse flammable vapors in the event of leaks.\n* Combustible gas monitors are installed in critical locations to sound an alarm and turn on the deluge systems in th"
