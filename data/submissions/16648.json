These documents specify practices and procedures to help ensure the safety of our employees, our contractors, our community, and the environment.\n\nDetails of Texas Eastman Division's emergency response efforts are contained in the above documents as well as the Texas Eastman Emergency Plan.  This plan specifies the responsibilities and duties of Eastman personnel during emergencies and potential emergencies.  These responsibilities and duties provide for the prompt mobilization of the Company's resources, including both personnel and equipment in an emergency situation.  \n\nThese plans are updated routinely, and are periodically reviewed in their entirety. \n\nII. Description of Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nStationary Source Description\n\nEastman Chemical Company is a leading international chemical company that produces more than 400 chemicals, fibers, and plastics.  Founded in 1920 in Kingsport, Tennessee, as a unit of Eastman Kodak Company, Eastman Chemical Company was spun off in 1994 and "

      "SummaryText": "is now an independent, publicly held company traded on the New York Stock Exchange (ticker symbol EMN). Eastman has approximately 5300 customers worldwide and posted 1998 sales of $4.48 billion. With corporate headquarters in Kingsport, Eastman employs 16,100 people in more than 30 countries.\n\nThe Texas Eastman Division of Eastman Chemical Company has its Tyler Terminal  facility located on a 320-acre site in Smith County near Tyler, Texas.  The Tyler Terminal facility receives butane, ethylene, propane and propylene by pipeline and truck and stores these materials in above-ground tanks and in underground caverns in a salt dome formation over 1000 feet below the surface.  There are no chemical manufacturing operations at the Tyler Terminal facility.  The materials received and stored at Tyler Terminal are sent by pipeline to the Texas Eastman Longview plant site where they are used in the manufacture of over 40 different chemical intermediates, solvents, coatings, resins and plastics.  No consumer items are made directly at Texas Eastman.  Instead, the Texas Eastman products are supplied to industrial customers for use in the manufacture of hundreds of consumer items which enhance the quality of life of millions of people worldwide.  These products include automobile interiors, paints, tires, food preservatives, adhesives, furniture, cosmetics, pharmaceutical products, disposable baby diapers, food packaging, toys, soft drink bottles, floor polish and waxes, printing inks, latex paint, fiberglass, fabric and many other consumer and industrial products.\n\nRegulated Substances Description\n\nTexas Eastman Division's Tyler Terminal site handles a number of flammable gases listed in 40 CFR Section 68.130 in quantities above the threshold limit.  The Tyler Terminal site does not have any of the toxic substances listed in 40 CFR Section 68.130 in quantities above the threshold limit. \n\nFlammable Gases and Liquids\n\nBasic Information:\nTexas Eastman Division uses flammable gase"

All of the gases handled at the Tyler Terminal facility are colorless gas with a mild petroleum type odor and all are extremely flammable.  Leaks of these materials can ignite and create a flash fire or a vapor cloud explosion. \n\nUses:\nTexas Eastman Division uses butane and propane as the basic feedstock for the Texas Eastman Longview plant site.  Ethylene is used by the Texas Eastman Longview plant site as one of the basic building blocks for most of the other chemicals produced.\n\nIII. Worst Case Release Scenarios and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nToxic Substance Worst Case Scenario\n\nThere are no toxic substances at the Tyler Terminal facility above the threshold quantity and no potential for impact of the community with toxic materials.  \n\nFlammable Substance Worst Case Scenarios\n\nEthylene constitutes one of Tyler Terminal's flammable worst case scenarios.  In this scenario, the well head on one of the underground storage wells was assumed to fail catastrophically and ethylene was assumed to escape from the well at full flow until the largest possible flammable vapor cloud formed (about 10 minutes).  It was assumed that all of the safety systems in place to mitigate and reduce the amount of vapor in the atmosphere and prevent ignition also failed.  It was assumed that the vapor cloud then ignited and exploded.  This scenario shows potential off-site consequences.\n\nButane constitutes a second flammable worst case scenario for the Tyler Terminal because its potential off-site consequences impact in a slightly different part of the community.  In this scenario, it was assumed that the largest storage tank containing butane failed catastrophically and the entire contents of the storage tank plus all adjacent connected storage tanks immediately vaporized.  It was assumed that all safety systems in place to miti"

This scenario shows potential off-site consequence.\n\nToxic Substance Alternate Release Scenarios\n\nThere are no toxic substances at the Tyler Terminal facility above the threshold quantity and no potential for impact of the community with toxic materials.  \n\nFlammable Substance Alternate Release Scenario\n\nFor flammable substances at Texas Eastman Tyler Terminal, an alternate release or emergency-planning scenario was estimated.  The assumed alternate release scenario was a 2-inch hole in a propane pipeline.  It was assumed that the propane leaked to form the largest possible vapor cloud from this leak (approximately 10 minutes), then ignited and created a flash fire.  This scenario shows a potential for off-site consequence. \n\nIV. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nTexas Eastman Division utilizes a \"layers of protection\" approach to protect people and the environment.  This approach includes, but is not limited to, the following elements:\n\nDesigning For Safety\n\n* Storage tanks, vessels, and equipment are designed and constructed to strict industry and government standards.\n* Process design and operations are analyzed for safety prior to their installation, and periodically thereafter, in accordance with the requirements of OSHA's Process Safety Management standard.\n* Control systems and instruments provide continuous monitoring of operating conditions and alarm operators of upset conditions.\n* Emergency shutdown systems automatically shut down operations to a safe state if emergency conditions develop. \n* Area and equipment are protected by automatic deluge systems to cool the equipment in the event of a fire and disperse flammable vapors in the event of leaks.\n* Combustible gas monitors are installed in critical locations to sound an alarm and turn on the deluge systems in th"
