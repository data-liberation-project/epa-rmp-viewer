The s prevent wetting and penetration of the pulp fibers and are used in a variety of products from writing paper to food packaging.  The wet-strength resins are used in paper tissue and towels, so that they will not come apart easily when they get wet. \n\n\n\nEpichlorohydrin is a raw material for the Kymene process and is consumed in a chemical reaction to make the wet-strength resin.  The plant receives epichlorohydrin in tank trucks and railroad tank cars and stores the material in a gallon storage tank that holds a maximum of 206,000 pounds.  The storage tank is provided with a containment dike to minimize the adverse impacts from any leaks or spills.  Spill containment capability is also provided for the area where tank trucks are unloaded.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release and Accident Prevention Program:\n\n\n\nThe Chicopee plant is subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management standard (29 CFR 1910.119) and has a complete process safety management system in place.  This includes the use of process hazards analysis to identify and address potential hazards, management of change procedures to control modifications, mechanical integrity procedures for minimizing mechanical failures, detailed operating procedures for process control, and operator training for the personnel involved in the process.\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History:\n\n\n\nTwo minor incidnts were reported from the last RMP submission.  \n\n\n\nOn 3/18/2013 ~1-lb of epichlorohydrin was released from a small line leak on a hose flange connection going to a hard pipe system. Operations shut off pump, isolated valves and disconnected unloading line.  Material was cleaned up preventative actions were implemented to prevent recurrence.  There were no injuries on or off site and no impacts to the environment.\n\n\n\nOn 4/18/2013 ~0.25 lbs of epichlorohydrin was released from a dry disconnect fitting that had a gasket failure. Operations shut off pump"

There were no injuries on or off site and no impacts to the environment.  Note: RMP Submit only accepts whole numbers for 5-year accident history so 1-lb was used versus the 0.25-lbs as the volume releases under Accident 2.\n\n\n\nThere have been no injuries on-site or off-site over the past 5-years as a result of reported incidents.  There have been no environmental impacts on-site or off-site over the past 5-years as a result of reported incidents. \n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program:\n\n\n\nThe Chicopee Plant has written emergency response plans and coordinates emergency response matters with the Chicopee Fire Department and the District Hazmat team.  The plant provides ongoing emergency response training for all plant employees.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\n\n\nThe site conducted a PHA Revalidation on 5/30/2014 and came up with a recommendation to tie the grounding system for railcars into the plant DCS system to have the epichlorohydrin pump shutdown off upon loss of ground.  Additional upgrades to epichlorohydrin interlocks will be added along with the current epichlorohydrin sensors located at the tank dike to alert the plant's monitoring contractor (ADT) of any issues during the off-shift and weekends. \n\n\n\nIn 2008 a site security vulnerability assessment at the Chicopee facility.  Additional \"No Trespassing\" signage was added to the main gate and on plant fenceline.  Vegetation along railroad tracks is keep trimmed to maintain 5 feet of clearance next to the fenceline.  Upgrades to the Chicopee facility camera surveillance are currently under development. The upgrades planned include installing a camera in the front foyer to check visitor identification from remote locations before allowing the visito onto the facilty.   A second LEL detector has been installed outside the Epicholorhydrin dike next to the transfer pumps.  There"
