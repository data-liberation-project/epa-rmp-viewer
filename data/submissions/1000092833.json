The syngas is further purified and separated into Hydrogen.  The Hydrogen is compressed and routed to the Phillips Refinery for use in their processes.  Additional hydrogen is compressed and sent to the Linde-Sweeny Site pipeline. The plant will start in 2021 and is subject to 29 CFR1919.119 and 40 CFR Part 68.\n\n\n\nRegulated Substances:\n\nThis facility uses, manufactures, or stores a chemical listed in part 68 of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, beyond a threshold quantity, as established by the EPA. The chemical is:  Flammable mixture containing hydrogen, methane, and other components, manufactured on site.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Policy:\n\nLinde-Sweeny Site is dedicated to being the best performing industrial gas company in all aspects of our business, including safety, health, and environmental affairs. Our safety, health, and environmental policy call for a commitment to protecting the health and safety of our employees, neighbors, and the surrounding environment.\n\nThis policy is the basis for engineering and construction programs that produce equipment and process systems that minimize the possibility of accidental chemical releases and operational safety programs that ensure safe operation of our facilities. Linde-Sweeny Site is committed to the continuous improvement of these programs.\n\nLinde-Sweeny Site is an active member of the American Chemistry Council and subscribes to the council's program of Responsible Care and the Employee Health and Safety Code of Management Practices.\n\n\n\nPrevention Program:\n\nIn accordance with OSHA's Process Safety Management standard and EPA's Risk Management Program rule, the Sweeny, TX facility has a comprehensive accident prevention program in place. This program is built around process safety concepts such as:\n\n- Technical documentation of PSI (Process Safety In"

The prevention program is audited periodically by our corporate assessment group to ensure that the process safety concepts and practices are in place and working effectively.\n\nChemical-specific Prevention Steps:\n\nIn addition to the required prevention program elements, we have implemented safety features specific to the covered process at our facility. Following is a description of some of these safety features.\n\n-At this location we have field mounted fire alarm control systems which tie into the central control unit that will alarm and indicate the location of the problem.\n\n-Fire extinguishers are located in key areas of the plant. They are maintained monthly and undergo yearly inspections by an outside vendor.\n\n- Plant operation emergency shutdowns (if process variable is exceeded) will shutdown the Plant and isolate the process.  This location has multiple plant emergency trips located throughout the facility.\n\n-During plant emergency alarm conditions, this facility contacts the Phillips Refinery first responders.\n\n\n\nFive-year Accident History:\n\nThis is a new facility and there are no releases of a regulate"

Linde-Sweeny Site employees will respond to minor incidents.  Linde-Sweeny Site has an emergency action plan in place to coordinate with the Phillips Refinery.  The plan requires Phillips be called for any incident on site related to fire, spills, or release of the covered chemical or medical emergencies.  All facility employees are trained on the emergency plan and emergency drills will be conducted at least annually.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\nLinde has a commitment to safety that is expressed in a company-wide goal of \"Zero/Zero\" which means zero accidents and zero injuries or illnesses at each and every location. We look to constantly improve the safety of our processes using recommendations developed through the prevention program and a program soliciting safety suggestions from our employees.  This is a new Site and currently there are no additional major projects for safety improvements. \n\n"
