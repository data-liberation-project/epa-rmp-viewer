This Risk Management Plan (RMP) has been developed in accordance with the requirements specified under 40 CFR Part 68, Subpart G.  The RMP certifies that Westvaco, Chemical Division has instituted a Risk Management Program at the North Charleston, South Carolina facility that is in compliance with U.S. EPA ARP requirements. \n\nThe RMP includes an Executive Summary and Data Elements following the format published by U.S. EPA.  In addition to identifying the applicable corporate policies and risk management systems, including comprehensive accident prevention and emergency response programs, this RMP document identifies the worst case release scenario and the facility's five year accidental release history. \n\n\n1.0   WESTVACO CHEMICAL DIVISION ACCIDENTAL RELEASE AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n1.1 Control of Hazardous Materials\n\nWestvaco strives to conduct its business in strict conformity with all applicable laws and in a safe and responsible manner.  Westvaco has always placed the very highest priority on the safety and health of its employees and members of the communities in which it operates.\n\nThis policy applies to the North Charleston, SC facility and to each location of Westvaco and its subsidiaries and to all materials which may be hazardous to health and/or the environment, whether solid, liquid or gaseous.\n\nIt is the responsibility of the Chemical Division Manager and the Corporate Research Director to insure that each location within their respective authority is in full compliance with the provisions of this policy.\n\nManagement at each company facility, by utilizing effective process safety management, is knowledgeable on a current basis as to ma"

The Corporate Property Conservation Manager provides annual written confirmation of compliance to the Chairman and the President.\n\nEach location promptly investigates, corrects, and reports in writing to the Division Manager and the Corporate Property Conservation Manager all incidents involving hazardous materials having caused, or having the potential for causing, injury or loss.\n\nClear understanding and careful observance of this policy throughout the organization is of great importance to Westvaco, its employees, and the public.  While line management has the primary responsibility for providing safe conditions and for creating a climate in which the whole organization shares in the concern for both employee and community safety and health, each member of the organization plays a key role in assuring success.\n\n1.2 Emergency Response Coordination with the Westvaco Kraft Division\n\nWestvaco Corporation operates three separate industrial operations at a site in North Charleston, South Carolina, two of which are subject to Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act.  These two facilities are a pulp and paper mill operated by the Westvaco Kraft Division and a chemical manufacturing plant operated by the Chemical Division.  The third facility is an energy co-generation plant (COGEN South) and is not subject to this rule.  \n\nThe two subject facilities are located on adjacent properties, but belong to different SIC codes and are under separate management.

A separate Risk Management Plan (RMP) is submitted for each facility, because each has an independent risk management program, but utilizes an emergency response staff and a single emergency management system.  These two facilities also share information on hazardous chemicals and coordinate their emergency response plans.  Thus, the Westvaco Chemical Division facility has a program in place to notify the neighboring Kraft Division facility in the event of an accidental release.  Because it would not be necessary for the LEPC or other on-site emergency responders to coordinate intra-company emergency response, it is not appropriate to consider the Kraft Division as off-site for the RMP.  \n\n1.3 Risk Management System\n\nWestvaco Chemical Division has developed a management system to implement and maintain compliance with the ARP and related chemical safety and emergency response programs.  This management system identifies lines of responsibility for the entire program and each of its key elements.\n\nThis management system is coordinated with the system developed by Westvaco's neighboring Kraft Division.\n\n\n2.0   PROCESSES AND SUBSTANCES SUBJECT TO 40 CFR PART 68\n\nThe Westvaco Chemical Division facility manufactures industrial intermediates (kraft crude tall oil, modified fatty acids and polychemical products) using raw material supplied through pipeline by the neighboring Westvaco Kraft Division facility and other material supplied by truck and rail from external sources.  Chemical manufacturing processes at the facility utilize a number of chemicals, some of which are regulated under 40 CFR Part 68.  At the Chemical Division facility, only polychemicals production contains threshold amounts of a regulated substance, formaldehyde.\n\nThe polychemicals process area includes a number of reactors that produce a variety of products.

Because there have been no accidental releases during the most recent five-year period that had an off-site impact and modeling of a worst-case release shows that off-site concentrations of formaldehyde would not exceed the endpoint concentration , the Westvaco Chemical Division is subject to Program 1 ARP requirements.\n\n3.1 Five-Year Accident History\n\nIn conjunction with the current ARP programs in place at the Westvaco Chemical facilities, there is a standard management practice that requires immediate internal reporting of unusual events, including those in which any abnormal emission of regulated chemicals is observed or suspected. The incident information is reviewed by supervisory staff and a determination is made as to whether a reportable quantity of any chemical listed as requiring reports to regulatory authorities is involved.  If so, the appropriate authorities are promptly notified. \n\nDuring the past 5 years there has been no accident involving formaldehyde that qualifies for reporting under 40 CFR Part 68.  This means that no accident has resulted in reportable on-site injury, off-site injury, off-site evacuation or sheltering in place, or off-site damage to property or the environment.  Thus, the Westvaco Chemical Division facility meets the Program 1 accident history criteria.  \n\n3.2 Worst-Case Release for Toxic Substances\n\nThe worst-case release scenario for the Westvaco Chemical Division facility, as defined by 40 CFR Part 68, is an instantaneous spill of the entire contents of the 30,000 gallon capacity"

The formaldehyde is stored at a temperature of 125 deg. F.  The first step in the evaluation is to estimate the evaporation rate of formaldehyde from the solution to the air.  This was computed using estimation methods provided in Appendix B of the  EPA RMP Off-Site Consequence Analysis Guidance (OCAG, May 24, 1996).  The calculation used the vapor pressure of formaldehyde at a 37% concentration  and 125 degree F temperature.   Because active mitigation is not allowed for the worst-case release assessment, it is assumed that the emission continues unabated.  [In reality, Westvaco staff would respond to limit the duration and magnitude of the airborne release.]  U.S. EPA's Off-site Consequence Analysis Guidance recommends that for emissions lasting more than 10 minutes, modeled concentrations should be averaged over a 1-hour period when computing the endpoint distance.\n\nThe toxic endpoint established for formaldehyde  by the EPA (10 ppm, 0.012 mg/liter) is based on the Emergency Response Planning Guideline, Level 2 (ERPG-2).  This is defined by the American Industrial Hygiene Association as the maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to 1 hr without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects, or symptoms which could impair an individual's ability to take protective action. \n\nFor the worst-case, the ARP regulation prescribes that the release occurs during light wind, stable conditions  (atmospheric stability F and 1.5 m/sec wind speed).  Analysis of meteorological data from the National Weather Service at Charleston indicates that these dispersion conditions, which can occur at night under clear skies, are present about nine percent of the time (or about 2 hours per day, on average).

Formaldehyde is delivered to the site via tank truck in the form of a 37% solution and stored in an above ground tank with a 30,000 gallon (270,000 lb) capacity.  The tank is surrounded by a 30 ft x 30 ft dike that provides passive mitigation  by limiting the surface area of a spill.\n\nThe EPA Risk Management Regulation identifies three levels of requirements defined as programs.  EPA recognizes that some regulated processes would not pose an off-site hazard in the event of an accidental release.  Such processes are classified as Program 1.  Program 1 is applicable to any process for which it can be demonstrated that the public would not be adversely affected by a release. Thus, to qualify for Program 1, a facility with a regulated toxic chemical needs to meet two criteria.  \n\n1) no release over the most recent 5-year period has resulted in off-site injury or environmental damage; and \n\n2) dispersion modeling demonstrates that a worst-case release (as defined by the regulation) will not result in concentrations at public receptors that exceed the toxic endpoint.\n\nWestvaco has determined that the polychemicals production process that uses formaldehyde qualifies for Program 1.  Program 2 and 3 are applicable to processes that do not qualify for Program 1.  Program 3 applies to processes that are subject to Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management Standard (PSM) or listed among nine North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) codes.  Otherwise, a process would be subject to Program 2.  If a change were to occur such that the polychemicals process no longer met the Program 1 criteria, it would be subject to Program 3.  This is because that process belongs to a listed NAICS code (325199, industrial organics) and is subject to PSM.\n\nThe Risk Management Plan requirements for Program 1 processes are as follows:\n\n* Registration\n* Accident history\n* Ha"

Because of the large number of structures, tanks and buildings at the chemical plant, adjacent paper mill and vicinity, the area is characterized by  an urban dispersion environment. \n\nEmissions of formaldehyde, released from the diked area,  become mixed with the air passing over the dike and transported downwind.  Because formaldehyde has a density nearly identical to that of air, it mixes readily with the air and disperses passively. Dispersion modeling of the worst-case release was performed with the U.S. EPA SCREEN3 model. This model was selected because it can simulate all of the features of the worst-case formaldehyde release: area source, continuous emissions, passive dispersion, urban dispersion environment and 1-hour averaging time.  \n\nThe resulting endpoint distance from the formaldehyde storage tank is 0.10 mile (530 ft).  Beyond this distance, according to the criterion established by the regulation, the worst-case formaldehyde release would not pose a significant health hazard.  The nearest Westvaco facility fenceline is located about 900 ft to the south of the formaldehyde storage tank.  As such, concentrations exceeding the endpoint concentration are isolated within the confines of the Westvaco North Charleston facility and such that no public or environmental  receptors would be affected by a worst case release.  This meets the worst-case modeling criteria for Program 1.  \n\n3.3 Program 1 Applicability\n\nSince the modeled endpoint distance predicted for the worst-case toxic release does not affect public receptors and no accidental release involving formaldehyde has occurred over the past 5 years that has impacted off-site public or environmental receptors, the formaldehyde system in the polychemicals process area at the Westvaco Chemical Division facility is subject to Program 1 Accidental Release Prevention Requirements under CFR Part 68.  \n\n\n4.0   ACCIDENT PREVENTION\n\nBecause the p"
