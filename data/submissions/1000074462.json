This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention programs and policies at our facility regarding items such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls for prevention of possible releases of hazardous substances.  If such a release should accidently occur at Frac 4, 5 our responses are coordinated with authorities such as Mont Belvieu's Police & Fire Departments, and Mutual Aid Mont Belvieu (MAMB).\n\n\n\nThe Frac 4,5 plant involves activities related to extraction and fractionation of products from raw Y Grade feed.  The Plant consists of 2 units each capable of processing approximately 120,000 BPD of Y Grade feed.  Feedstock for the facility is delivered to Mont Belvieu via pipeline.  The Frac 4 and 5 units are essentially identical in size and design and are designed to produce purity Ethane, Propane, N-Butane, Isobutane, and Natural Gasoline Products.  \n\n\n\nThe \"general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps\" taken by Frac 4,5 were developed to be compliant with the accident release prevention requirements set forth in 40 CFR Part 68.  The following sections briefly describe elements of the release programs in place at the facility.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nFrac 4,5 maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nThe facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.

Any findings brought to light by the hazard and risk analysis studies are to be managed and resolved in a timely manner.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nFrac 4,5 maintains written operating procedures to promote the safe conduct of activities for our covered processes,.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is periodically reviewed and validated.  These procedures are readily accessible to operators involved in these processes.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\nFrac 4,5 provides comprehensive personnel training and testing programs to ensure employees who operate our processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every three (3) years, and more frequently as needed.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nIn order to ensure proper operations Frac 4,5 conducts documented maintenance review and checks on process equipment.  Examples of process equipment included in the preventative maintenance program includes, pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, instrument controls, pumps, valves, gas detectors, flame detector, and temperature and pressure switches.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices with specialized training as needed.

These reviews are in place to confirm construction, equipment assembly, operating, and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to introducing hazardous material and returning or placing equipment in operation.  \n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nFrac 4,5 audits the RMP program on a scheduled basis in an effort to confirm provisions set out by the RMP rule are being properly and adequately implemented.  Comprehensive audits are to be conducted no less frequent than every three (3) years.  Any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are to be addressed in a safe and timely manner.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nFrac 4,5 will promptly investigate any incident that results in, or could reasonably result in, a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.
