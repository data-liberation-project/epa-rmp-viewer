We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n\n\n *  A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulation\n\n  *  An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\n\n *  A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule\n\n *  An overview of our emergency response program\n\n *  An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment\n\n *  The certifications required by EPA's RMP rule\n\n *  The detailed information (called data elements) about our risk management program\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nOur facility packages high purity laboratory, microelectronic, bulk pharmaceutical chemicals.  Our facility also accomplishes limited purification operations and some aqueous blending operations.  The Avantor Performance Materials Facility consists of a single building situated on 70 acres. The building consists of 40,000 sq. ft. manufacturing, 50,000 sq. ft. lab and administration, and 200,000 sq. ft. warehousing.   In our processes, we use the following chemicals that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause off-site consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release:\n\n\n\nToxics\n\n\n\nChloroform:  Chloroform is brought to th"

In addition we follow the same process for our non-bulk 52% HF process\n\n* Utilize a preventive maintenance program to help ensure proper operation of the systems.\n\n* Operating procedures are in place and operators trained to make sure all operations are understood and established procedures followed.\n\n* All changes which do not involve replacement in kind are managed through a management of change system to insure proper review prior to implementation.\n\n* Pre-startup safety reviews are conducted for all systems\n\n* Surveillance systems are in place to assist with timely identification and remediation for all leaks at the bulk unloading points.\n\n* These individual elements of our prevention program work together to prevent accidental chemical releases.  Our company and employees are committed to the standard that these management systems set for the way we do business.  We have specific accountabilities and controls to ensure that we are meeting the highest standards for accident prevention.\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nWe keep records of all significant accidental chemical releases that occur at our facility.  During the past five years there was only one accidental chemical release involving materials covered under the EPA's RMP rule and that release did NOT result in serious injuries, significant property damage, or environmental damage either on site or off site.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE "

      "SummaryText": "PROGRAM\n\n\n\nWe maintain a site emergency response plan, which consolidates all of the various federal, state, and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning.  Our program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  To ensure the effectiveness or our emergency response plan, routine drills are conducted including testing emergency notice systems.  \n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nThe following is a list of actions that we are planning to implement at the facility to help prevent and/or better respond to accidental chemical releases:\n\n\n\n* Conduct another exercise with the Bourbon County LEPC, EMS, Police, and Hospital to ensure preparedness during an incident.\n\n* Continue to conduct annual tours with the local fire and EMS departments to help them better understand and be prepared to assist in onsite emergency response."
