It is the  City of Deer Park policy to notify the Deer Park Police Department and Deer Park Volunteer Fire Department which is the first responder. The Fire Department evaluates the situation and notifies the public through the LEPS's ONE CALL SYSTEM.\n\nStatonary Source:\n\nThe stationary source of a possible chemical release is the  Deer Park Surface Water Purification Plant at 2117 East  \"X\" Street, Deer Park, Texas 77536. The chemical stored and used above the EPA Threshhold at this location is chlorine gas.\n\nWorst Case Release Scenario:\n\nThe release of chlorine at a rate of 15 pounds per minute from a ruptured 150 pound cylinder would affect an area with a radius of 0.4 miles according to Exhibit 4-3,page 4-7 of the EPA Risk Management Program Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants.\n\nThese cylinders are rotated on a regular basis at which time they are returned to the chemical supplier for inspection and refill.\n\nThe release of chlorine at a rate of 200 pounds per minute from a ruptured one ton cylinder would affect an area with a radius of 1.3 miles according to Exhibit 4-3,page 4-7 of the EPA Risk Management Program Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants.\n\nOne ton cylinders of chlorine are used  infrequently and when empty are immediately returned to the chemical supplier for inspection and refill.\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenario:\n\nThe release of chlorine at a rate of 37 pounds"

Daily inspections by Plant personnel allows early detection of possible equipment failure. Frequent preventative maintenance of chemical feed equipment by the Maintenance Department ensures proper operation.\n\nFive Year Accident History:\n\nThe facility has not experienced a offsite accident in the past five years.\n\nEmergency Response Program:\n\nIn case of a chlorine release, the procedure is to notify the Deer Park Police Department and Deer Park Volunteer Fire Department by telephone or radio as to wind direction,type of leak and size of the leak. The Fire department evaluates the situation and notifies the public through the LEPC's ONE CALL SYSTEM.\n\nSafety:\n\nThe City of Deer Park remains committed to maintaining it's safety record and will continue the equipment inspection and maintenance as well as continuing education for it's employees.\nCity personnel have attended safety classes taught through Texas A&M Extension Service.\nThere are frequent in-house discussions and safety meetings during the year."
