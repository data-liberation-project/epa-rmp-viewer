In addition, it is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.\r\nOne of our company goals states, To provide for the Safety of our employees, our customers, the general public and to be good stewards of the environment for which we serve. To fulfill these goals, we enroll in regulatory management services that assist in maintaining and administering comprehensive safety and environmental programs, procedures, and training courses. We perform a thorough annual audit program and monitor facility compliance with the safety standards and oversight assistance with this specialty firm. The program consists of utilizing internal audit checklists and survey forms that are reviewed regularly and updated as necessary to ensure all applicable federal, state, and local regulations are covered.  These checklists are used to measure regulatory compliance, including those governing the safe handling and storage of Anhydrous Ammonia.  Procedures require a timely response and correction of all recommendations resulting from these audit checklists.\r\nA Site Safety Coordinator is identified and used as an extension of the general manager and management service personnel for a hands on manager of the day to day safe working activities, to maintain the required regulatory recordkeeping, to conduct monthly safety meetings, to conduct employee training, and to act as the location's contact during emergency incidents that are rehearsed biannually.\r\nA DESCRIPTION OF THE FACILITY AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED-\r\nThe facility is a wholesale farm supply and distribution center and as such we store and distribute a wide variety of pesticides and fertil"

Anhydrous Ammonia is received by truck, is handled and stored on site, and is a regulated substance requiring us to comply with EPA's Risk Management Program. We sell Anhydrous Ammonia to growers in nurse tanks manufactured to the requirements to do such.  The customer applies the Anhydrous Ammonia into the soil as a needed source of nitrogen fertilizer for growing agricultural crops.  \r\nOur facility maintains 19 one-thousand gallon nurse tanks for customer delivery.  Our combined storage capacity in nurse tanks is 88,612 pounds.  Anhydrous Ammonia is stored in one twelve thousand gallon stationary storage tank on site.  Therefore, the total facility Anhydrous Ammonia storage capacity for this location is 144,577.8 pounds.\r\nWORST CASE SCENARIO-\r\nOur worst case scenario is the loss of the total contents of the 12,000 gallon storage tank, when filled to the greatest amount allowed at 85% of capacity, being released as a gas over 10 minutes, resulting in total vaporization of the product released.  The maximum quantity released would be 55,965.6 pounds.  According to DEGADIS modeling of off-site impact, the distance to the endpoint, or the point of dispersion in the atmosphere to 200 ppm, is what is considered with the total release of the 12,000 gallon tank. It should be noted that our company has never had a total release of an entire storage tank of product.\r\nALTERNATE RELEASE SCENARIO\r\nThe most common alternate release scenario from an Anhydrous Ammonia storage facility would not reach an endpoint off site. The alternate release scenario modeled for the purposes of the plan is a two-minute release from a stationary storage tank representing a valve and hose failure requiring a manual shutdown.  The total amount of Anhydrous Ammonia released in this scenario would be 100 pounds.  The distance to the end point in this release would not have an impact off-site.\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC"

This facility complies with the ANSI G-2.1 Standards(2014 edition), OSHA-29CFR 1910.111, EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule as well as all applicable federal, state, and local codes and regulations.\r\nOur Anhydrous Ammonia system is protected from major releases by internal excess flow valves, check valves, relief valves, manual shutoff's, and emergency shutoff valves.  The load-out risers used for the purpose of filling nurse tanks are protected by excess flow valves and the fill lines break-away to immediately stop the flow of Anhydrous Ammonia if a line or a hose would fail.  All of the main storage tank valves and the riser load-out valves are locked when not in use. \r\nOur Anhydrous Ammonia system is inspected on a regular basis with maintenance and preventative maintenance scheduled and documented.  Liquid and vapor valves, hoses, excess flow valves, gauges, and relief valves are replaced when necessary and or according to the guidelines within the ANSI Standards.\r\nTraining is provided to all employees every three years with a refresher review at least annually, whenever there is a change in the process, or whenever competency with the regulations is questioned.  In accordance with the ANSI G-2.1-2014 Standards, training is also offered for all Anhydrous Ammonia customers to attend on a regular basis and offered to the local fire department personnel during their annual tour of our facility and operations.  These training courses consist of classroom lecture, current and approved videos or CD, testing both verbally and written, as well as demonstration and observation for each person working with the process to be certified while subsequent on the job training is always approved as well.\r\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\nThere have been no accidents involving Anhydrous Ammonia that have resulted in deaths, recordable i"

In preparation for this, we have coordinated with all of the local response agencies by providing information and facility tours annually to ensure that they are familiar with and properly prepared for an incident at our facility.
