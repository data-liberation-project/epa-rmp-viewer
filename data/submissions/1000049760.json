Our SHE Commitment and Policy complements our community commitment, which is that the community gives us the consent to operate to the extent that we must operate our facilities with the highest standards with the focus on operating excellence.  Our SHE Commitment and Policy statements reflect the position of our company.  In the Chemours Commitment to environmental excellence, we affirm to all our stakeholders, including our employees, customers, shareholders and the public that we will conduct our business with respect and care of the environment.  To accomplish these aspects of our mission and community commitment, we are committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes in a safe and environmentally responsible manner.  We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as the protection of the environment.  The approach to accidental release prevention is to fully comply with OSHA's PSM rule and Chemours's standard on Process Safety Management, S21A-PSM.  While complying with the OSHA rule and our own standard, we address all elements of the RMP rule for a Program 3 Prevention Program. The Chemours - Johnsonville Plant has been an OSHA VPP site since 1998.\n\n\n\nSITE INFORMATION\n\nThe Chemours - Johnsonville Plant at New Johnsonville, Tennessee, is located on the west border of Humphreys County, bordering the Tennessee River, and approximately 2 miles north of Hwy. 70 and the city of New Johnsonville, Tennessee.  The facilities are situated on a 1500-acre site; however, only about 200 acres are developed. The remaind"

We manufacture titanium dioxide (TiO2), under the trade name TiPure as our primary product, and titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4).  Titanium dioxide is manufactured via the chloride process in which titanium dioxide ore is chlorinated to titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4); the TiCl4 is subsequently re-oxidized to refined TiO2. A small amount of TiCl4 is further processed for sale. Sodium Chloride (salt) is also produced as a by product from the TiO2 manufacturing process.

Our on site medical department or first aid responders treated the injured and all returned to work. We conduct formal incident investigations to identify and correct the root cause for all safety incidents.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nJohnsonville's emergency response program is contained in our Emergency Manual. It consolidates the various regulations for emergency response planning.   It provides the essential planning for effectively protecting our workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations. We coordinate our emergency plan with applicable community emergency response plans and local emergency responders (Humphreys County and Benton County LEPC).  \n\nImportant keys to the success of our emergency response program include:\n\n1. A trained on-site emergency organization,\n\n2. Training for all employees, including routine drills,\n\n3. Drills and information sharing with local emergency responders and,\n\n4. The use of our SAFER system.\n\nOur Emergency Response Program is managed by the emergency Response Coordinator. Our site h"

Some of these are PSM processes such as process hazard reviews, incident investigations and auditing. We also make improvements as identified by Chemours and Titanium Technology networks (PSM, Safety, and Environmental). These networks have membership from each of our TiO2 production sites.
