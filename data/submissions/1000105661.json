Planned changes to improve safety\n\nSIGMA PROCESSED MEATS will continue to implement any recommendations resulting from the Process Hazard Analysis, Offsite Consequences, and program audits. The flexibility of the program allows SIGMA PROCESSED MEATS to respond effectively to prevent or minimize any potential exposure of SIGMA PROCESSED MEATS employees, the surrounding public, and/or the environment to a release of anhydrous ammonia. Specific actions taken to improve safety are the implementation of the Program 3 Prevention Program described above, improved operator training, administrative controls, and computerized system controls."

A variety of administrative controls and computerized controls are in place to shut the system down when operating parameters and limits are exceeded.\n\n4. The general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific preventative steps\n\nThe basic elements of the Program 3 Prevention program have been developed and are now in place. These include:\n\nProcess Safety Information\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nStandard Operating Procedures\nSafework Practices\nEmployee and Operator Training Programs\nMechanical Integrity Program\nManagement of Change Procedures\nPSM Compliance Audit Procedures\nIncident Investigation Procedures\nEmployee Participation Program\nHot Work Permit Procedures\nContractor Safety Program\nEmergency Evacuation Program\n\nAmmonia specific prevention steps include:\n\nAdministrative controls\nOperator Training\nComputerized controls\n\nThe Preventive Program 3 provides extensive maintenance and operator/mechanic training to ensure that the system's mechanical integrity is maintained for the life of the covered process.

The stationary source and regulated substances handled\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is used as a refrigerant in the SIGMA PROCESSED MEATS refrigeration system. The liquid is circulated as needed to the evaporators and heat exchangers/chillers where heat is absorbed and removed from the medium. The anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system is a closed loop single stage industrial refrigeration system. The ammonia is not used or mixed in any manner with other chemical processes.\n\n3.
