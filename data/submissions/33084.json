In addition to other state and local codes applicable to our facility and process. We have undertaken this process to deal with the risks involved with the storage, handling, and use of Anhydrous Ammonia in our facility.\n\nOur goal is to promote overall worker, public, and plant safety.\n\nGerber Products Company is located at 405 West State Street, Fremont, Michigan. The facility includes processing tanks, piping, packaging equipment, raw materials warehousing, finished goods refrigerated storage, an Ammonia refrigeration engine room, boilers, and miscellaneous utilities.  \n\nThe refrigeration system required for our production process necessitates the submission of this Risk Management Plan.  The refrigeration system contains in excess of 16,400 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  This surpasses the threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds outlined in Process Safety Management and Risk Management Program regulations.\n\nGerber Products Company has implemented numerous policies and procedures to enable our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences of significant releases of Anhydrous Ammonia as well as other hazardous substances, fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents.  Overall these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, and illnesses and avoid property damage.\n\nOur safety programs prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices that govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment.  These rules are detailed and improved as necessary.  They are also communicated to and accepted by all employees at our facility.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis was recently completely in April of 2004.

Ammonia vapor, High Stage Suction, (HSS) from the 30?F High Temperature Suction Accumulator (V-15) is routed to the suction inlet of four High Stage Screw Compressors (HS-1, HS-2, HS-3, and HS-4).  \n\nAt the High Stage Compressors (HS-1, HS-2, HS-3, and HS-4), ammonia vapor (HSS) is compressed to a super heated vapor (HSD).  The super heated vapor (HSD) from the High Stage Compressors (HS-1, HS-2, HS-3, and HS-4) is routed from the Machine Room to the roof.  On the roof it is fed to an Evaporative Condensers (EC1, EC2, and EC3).  At the Condensers the super heated vapor (HSD) rejects heat and converts to high pressure Condensed Liquid Drain (CD).  The condenser accomplishes this by using a combination of air and water flow across ammonia coils.  The condensers are equipped with Safety Relief Valves, which vent directly to atmosphere.  Air flow is supplied to the condensers via fans internal to the condenser.  Water is supplied by Condensers (EC1, EC2, and EC3) via a Water Pumps.  \n\nWater from the Condenser Water Sump is pumped via a Water Pumps to the Evaporative Condensers (EC1, EC2, and EC3).  At the Condenser the water is sprayed via a spray header over the ammonia coils.  Water is collected"

As the water level of the Condenser Water Sump lowers it trips a Water Makeup Float which opens allowing water makeup to refill the Condenser Sump Tank.  The Condenser Water Sump is also equipped with a water treatment for the control of contaminates in the water system.  \n\nThe Condensed Liquid Drain (CD) from the Evaporative Condensers (EC1, EC2, and EC3) gravity drains to the Thermosyphon vessel (V17) and the High Pressure Receiver (V16).  \n\nHigh Pressure Liquid (TSS) gravity drains from the Thermosyphon vessel (V13) portion of the High Pressure Receiver (V-16) to Thermosyphon Supply Headers which supply liquid to the Thermosyphon Oil Coolers of the High Stage Compressors (HS-1, HS-2, HS-3, and HS-4) and the Low Stage Compressors (LS1 and LS2).  At the Thermosyphon Oil Coolers on the Compressors (HS1, HS2, HS3, HS4, LS1, and LS2) the High Pressure Liquid (TSS) absorbs heat from the oil pumped through the Compressor.  As it absorbs heat it changes from a liquid (TSS) to a Liquid/Vapor Combination (TSR).  This Liquid Vapor Combination (TSR) is returned from the Thermosyphon Oil Cooler on each Compressor (HS1, HS2, HS3, HS4, LS1, and LS2) to the Thermosyphon Return Header (TSR) where it returns to the Thermosyphon vessel (V17).

Purged Gas (PUR) is piped from the Purged Points to the Auto Purger (RPU).  This system has a multiple purge points. The Evaporative Condensers (EC1, EC2, and EC3) has two Purge Points on the Condensed Liquid Drain Outlets.  Each Purge Point consists of a solenoid valve with shutoff valves on either side for isolation.  Any non-condensibles in the Vapor Stream are removed periodically by the Automatic Purger (RPU).  The Purge Gas (PUR) is separated by the Automatic Gas Purger (RPU).  Its separates ammonia from the non-condensibles by condenses the ammonia into a liquid.  Any non-condensibles are piped to a Water Bubbler to remove any traces of ammonia.

The glycol solution is then piped under the freezer floors to prevent a buildup of permafrost.  This Heat Exchanger (V13) utilizes High Stage Discharge (HSD) which is a high temperature compressed vapor.  This vapor enters the Heat Exchanger via a solenoid valve.  In the Heat Exchanger the vapor rejects heat thus condensing to a liquid where it collects on the bottom of the Heat Exchanger and gravity drains to a liquid drainer.  As the liquid drainer becomes full it will dump the liquid back into the High Stage Suction Main where it is returned to 30 F High Temperature Suction Accumulator (V-15).\n\nLow Temperature Recirculated Liquid (LTRL) that has been pumped from the ?20 F Low Temp"

The incident command system will be put into place.  Members of the ERT have completed IC training.  Should additional resources be needed the ERT will request site security to call 911 for assistance from local fire departments and/or medical services.\nThe site Novartis Emergency Management Team (NEM) will assume an additional support and management role.  This role will include resource allocation, logistics, data, documentation, and communications both internal and external.\n\nRecognition and Prevention\nEmployees are trained to recognize a chemical emergency during their job orientation and hazard communication training.  Employees and supervisors are instructed to call for the ERT if a release cannot be contained without potential exposure.  Between Gerber employees and site security, chemical process systems and chemical storage are monitored around the clock seven days a week (24/7).  Preventative maintenance is performed on the anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system.  The site has a Risk Management Plan and a Process Safety Management Plan for the anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system.\n\nSafe distances and places of refuge\nIn the event of a chemical release inside a building, which has the potential to create an unsafe atmosphere, the building will be evacuated.  In the event that the chemical release would not pose an inhalation hazard, the area of the spill and an appropriate buffer zone will be evacuated until the spill can be cleaned up. Should a site wide chemical emergency occur, the maintenance departments will shut down air handling systems as needed.

Access to an emergency scene is limited to members of the ERT and local emergency resources that may have been requested.\n\nEvacuation routes and procedures\nEvacuation routes are posted for sheltering in place and evacuation from buildings.  Supervisors are responsible for assisting in the evacuation and determining that all employees are accounted for. \nProcesses that could pose further danger if left unattended will be shut down according to emergency shut down procedures prior to operators evacuating (if the procedure can be performed without risk of exposure to the operator).  Evacuation drills are practiced annually and evacuation routes are reviewed for effectiveness.  \nSafe areas will always be upwind of the release.\n\nDecontamination \nDecontamination of people, property and personal protective equipment is the responsibility of the ERT and is performed after a chemical release clean up. Decontamination water is neutralized or contained and treated as hazardous waste in accordance with hazardous waste regulations.
