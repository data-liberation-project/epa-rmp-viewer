We insure it is designed and installed correctly; that it is operated safely and properly; and a formal procedure is established for training system-operators to perform these tasks.\nA sound preventive maintenance program is vital to the continued safe and efficient operation of the system.  We ensure this purpose is met by ongoing, documented inspection and testing program.  We conduct Daily, Weekly, Monthly, Quarterly, Semi-Annual and Annual Inspections on all critical process equipment.\nSince our last Process Hazard Analysis on November 15, 2001, we have installed twenty-seven (27) Ammonia Sensors inside and outside the plant.  All these sensors are wired to a central alarm panel in the Engine Room.  We have also installed three (3) manual shut-off switches located outside the Engine Room doors.  When these switches or sensors are activated, the compressors are shut down and all of the plant?s ventilation fans are turned on",

Since ammonia releases from the system could pose a risk of offsite public impact and the system is regulated under the OSHA PSM standard (29 CFR 1910.119), the system is subject to the Program 3 requirements of the EPA?s Risk Management system.\n\nThe overriding purposed of the Ammonia PSM System is to prevent the unintended release of Ammonia from the refrigeration system as well as prevent fires, explosions and other types of catastrophic events.\n\nThe PSM system covers in written format the following elements:\n\n-Employee Participation\n-Process Safety Information\n-Process Technology\n-Operating Procedures\n-Non-Routine Work Practices\n-Contractor Requirements\n-Process Safety Review\n-Mechanical Integrity\n-Training Requirements\n-Management of Change\n-Pre-Startup Safety Review\n-Incident Investigation\n-Emergency Planning and Response\n-Compliance Audits\n-Security Against Theft\n\nThere have been no ammonia-related incidents at the Springdale Dairy within the last five years that have resulted in onside or offsite impacts.\n\nEmployee Participation:\nThe Engine Room technicians are in charge of administration as well as actual operation of the system and maintain PSM files that are open to all employees.\nIn addition to being run by the technicians involved in it?s operation, the other people in the plant are kept informed of PSM System status by initial training upon hire and periodic refresher training in safety meetings and plant wide events.\n\nProcess Safety Information:\nWritten information has been collected which enables the employees to identify and understand the potential hazards in the system.  The written information includes the ammonia MSDS and a description of the de"

This analysis has indicated shortcomings in the system which have been corrected.\n\nOperator Procedures:\nWritten, detailed procedures have been developed which describe the steps which should be followed to safely operate the ammonia refrigeration system.  These procedures are regularly audited for completeness and followed by al the operators.\n\nTraining:\nA training program has been developed which ensures that employees are trained in all aspects of the system and the duties which they must perform in it?s operation.  The program includes classroom, on-the-job and performance demonstration elements.\n\nContractors:\nAll contractors working on the system are screened and evaluated by the operating technicians in charge of the PSM system before being allowed to work on the Ammonia Refrigeration System.  Their work is constantly monitored by these same operators and they have complete authority to suspend work if it?s not been done properly.\n\nPre-Startup Safety Review:\nA pre-startup safety review is required for all new ammonia projects to verify that all safety programs are operational, training has been performed and that construction has been completed to design standards.  This same review is also conducted when there is a charge in the process safety information.\n\nMechanical Integrity:\nThis element of the system ensures that the Ammonia refrigeration system is built and maintained using preventive and predictive maintenance procedures to minimize unexpected breakdown or failures.\n\nHot Work Permit: \nThis element of the system ensures that a signed permit is obtained before any cutting, welding, or open "

Any recommendations are resolved immediately to improve the safety of the facility and personnel.\n\nCompliance Audits:\nThere are procedures to conduct regular audits of the PSM system both by internal and external experts.  Any recommendations by these audits are resolved.\n\nSystem Security:\nA system has been implemented to prevent theft or tampering with the system, including perimeter guarding, physical and electronic locks on critical equipment and around the clock monitoring by operators and Security Personnel.\n\nAll records of the PSM system are maintained in the PSM Office located in the Engine Room of the facility, where they are open to examination at any time by concerned employees or management."
