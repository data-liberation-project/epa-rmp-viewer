Neither \nCSW personnel nor community members would be in contact with the ammonia \nexcept for certain planned maintenance functions or accidental release.\n\nChemical Release Prevention and Response\n\nCSW is committed to providing a safe environment for its employees and \nneighbors, including the appropriate use and control of facility chemicals.
