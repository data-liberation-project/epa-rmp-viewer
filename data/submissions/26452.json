Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Brenntag Mid-South, Inc. are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, we are completely coordinated with Clearwater Fire Department which provides highly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Distribution of chemical products.  We have 1 regulated substances present at our facility.  This substance is Chlorine.The Chlorine is received prepackaged in 90 ton railcar's.  Chlorine, is used for  the manufacture  of Sodium Hypochlorite.\n\nThe maximum inventory of Chlorine at our facility is 1,440,000 lbs. \n\n\n3.    The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\nTo evaluate the worst case scenarios and alternative release scenarios, we have used the look-up tables and equations provided by the EPA in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance as well as RMP COMP VER. 1.07 for Chlorine. The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program  3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from a 180,000 pound Chlorine railcar. The scenario involves the release of 180,000 lb. of chlorine in a liquid form over 10 minutes.  Under worst case we"

The scenario involves the release of 12,000 lb. of Chlorine in a gaseous form over 60 minutes.   With Class D atmospheric stability and windspeed of 3.0 m/sec the maximum distance of 0.3 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/l.\n\n\n\n4.    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA STANDARD 30-1996).  \nThe following sections briefly describe the elements of our release prevention program that are in place at our stationary source.\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is     \"WHAT IF\". The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of three years Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Brenntag Mid-South, Inc. maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as loading/unloading, normal operations, temporary operations, forklift operations, emergency operations, storage inspection, bleach manufacturing and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved wi"
