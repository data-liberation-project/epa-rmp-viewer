      "SummaryText": "Harlan Bakeries, Inc. is a food production facility located at 7597 East U.S. Highway 36, Avon, IN. Anhydrous ammonia is used as a refrigerant at this facility to maintain temperatures in the production and storage areas. This is a closed loop system with normal operating pressures ranging from a low of 0 lbs to a high of 165 lbs. Total system charge is estimated at 26,000 pounds. After reviewing our PSM progrm, it became evident to us that we needed to devote more time and effort into complying with the regulation and documenting the maintenance on our system. We have set a deadline of October 30, 1999 to have completed all elements satisfying both the PSM and RMP regulations.\n\nWorst-case Release Scenario for a Toxic Substance:\nOur worst-case release is the failure of the largest vessel in our refrigeration system. This vessel is called the High Pressure Receiver (HPR) and has a maximum capacity of 13,650 pounds and is located in our compressor room. The compressor room measures 92' x 27' x 22' and has a total air volume of 54,650 cubic feet. Roof ventilation in this room produces approximately 20 room air exchanges per hour. Using the tables and equations found in chapter 4 of  EPA's \"RMP Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration\", the toxic endpoint was calculated at .80 miles. Based on census data provided by \"Landview III\", within this radius is a population of 710, three schools, residential housing, retail and light industrial businesses. No hospitals are located within this area. \n\nAlternative release scenario for a toxic substance:\nThe alternative release toxic endpoint was also determined using EPA's \"RMP Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration\" reference tables and equations. A pressure relief valve failure was the most likely cause of an ammonia release. Using the tables provided in the RMP Guidance, a 10 minute release of ammonia at 400 lbs/min, from the High Pressure Receiver relief valve, would affect an area of .20 miles. The estimated population, according to L"

      "SummaryText": "andview III, within distance to endpoint is 40. There are also one school, some residences, industrial and retail businesses. There are no hospitals within this radius. \n\nAccidental Release and Emergency Response Policies:\nAll employees at Harlan Bakeries receive training on what to do in the event of an ammonia release. This training includes a copy of the Emergency Response Program, who to notify if ammonia is detected, type of alarm system used at the facility, exit locations from the building, evacuation routes, and assembly areas. Supervisors have received additional training as area coordinators to facilitate the evacuation and account for all employees. \n\nResponse to major ammonia releases will be the responsibility of the Avon Fire Department HAZMAT Team. Minor releases, such as small fitting leaks, will be handled by trained maintenance employees. We have also trained several authorized  maintenance employees as HAZMAT responders to provide limited assistance to the Avon Fire Department if necessary.        \n\nFive Year Accident History: \nWe have had one accidental release of ammonia in the past five years. The amount released was 700 pounds. There were no off site evacuations, injuries, or deaths. \n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps:\nHarlan Bakeries, Inc., to maintain the mechanical integrity and safety of this process, complies with the following industry codes and standards:\n \nASME Boiler & Pressure Valve Codes\nANSI B31.3 Piping Code\nIIAR industry guideline for safety and good engineering practices\nNFPA guidelines for fire protection equipment\n  \nHarlan Bakeries, Inc. has established a history of safe and reliable operation of the refrigeration and production systems, and believe in making every effort to protect the safety and health of  our employees and the community. \n\nPlans to improve safety:\nCompletion of all PSM elements."
