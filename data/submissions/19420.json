It is Interline Energy Services policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local rules and regulations.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  If a release does occur, the plant's emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of the local fire authority and/or Sheriff's office and release control or containment.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Well Draw Gas Plant is located about 20 miles north of Douglas, Wyoming, and uses fractionation to separate methane, ethane, butane, iso-butane, propane, and gasoline from liquid petroleum gas and natural gas.  As a result of this operation, several EPA regulated flammable substances are processed, recovered, and stored at the facility (e.g., methane, ethane, propane, iso-butane, n-butane, iso-pentane and n-pentane). The maximum amount of covered flammable mixture that could be onsite is 1,600,000 pounds.  \n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with a release of flammable mixture in Program Level 1 process at the Well Draw Gas Plant is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) resulting from a release of 292,435 pounds (100% of tank capacity) of butane from the plant's largest storage vessel (SV-105).  Although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for administrative controls, or active or passive mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating this WCS.  The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint"

Residential population is estimated at 0 people.  \n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe Well Draw Gas Plant complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.  The plant is subject to OSHA's PSM program and complies with all elements of that program.  Plant process equipment is designed, constructed, and maintained in accordance with recognized engineering codes and standards (e.g.: API, ASME, NFPA, etc.). \n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nWe investigate every incident very carefully to determine ways to prevent similar incidents from recurring.  The facility has had only one accident involving an EPA listed substance in the last five years.  This accident occurred in July of 1997, when a small propane release from a handheld instrument caught fire - injuring the operator's hand.  Instrument operating procedures were revised and the equipment upgraded to prevent future incidents.  We have had NO releases, involving an EPA covered substance, that resulted in off-site deaths, injuries, significant property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place in the last five years.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\n\nThe facility maintains a written emergency response plan, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment. The plan consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion.  Company employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties. If an emergency were to occur, the yard's emergency response plan provides instructions to employees for notification of the local fire authority and/or Sheriff's office.\n\nThe emergency response plan is updated when necessary based on modifications made to the plant proces"
