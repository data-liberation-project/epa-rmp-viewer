The receiving goods procedure details for the identification of the chemical to be offloaded to avoid cross contamination with the wrong chemical. High and low level indicators are installed on the receiving tank. The valves invloved in the offloading of this chemical are locked during regular operation and must be physically removed by authorized personel to allow offloading. The quality system is set up to set forth the location of all maintenance records, schedules, and inspections within an electronic maintenance system (MapCon). The quality system is audited on a schedule and allow for the quality and safety commitees to utilize an issues database to track failures of the system, incident investigations, and quality issues. There are operational rounds for visual checks for potential leaks as well. ",

The production rounds include visual checks for leaking pipes, valves, and pumps for the final product tank farm. The quality system is set up to set forth the location of all maintenance records, schedules, and inspections within an electronic maintenance system (MapCon). The quality system is audited on a schedule and allowfor the quality and safety commitees to utilize an issues database to track failures of the system, incident investigations, and quality issues.

This commitment is demonstrated in the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel on the proper operation and maintenance of plant equipment and having preventative maintenance programs in place.  BLE has emergency response policies in place that are addressed in the facility's Health and Safety (H&S) Plan, Spill Prevention, Controls, and Countermeasures (SPCC) Plan, Facility Response Plan (FRP), and Emergency Action Plan.  Most of the listed Plans have a minimum of annual training requirements in order to keep employees educated on emergency response procedures in place at the facility.  New employees are required to read the Plans listed above and undergo training on emergency response procedures prior to initiating responsibilities onsite.  BLE's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, plant personnel will respond to contain the release as necessary.\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED:\n\nBLE is located in Fairmont, Martin County, Minnesota.  The facility operates 24 hours per day, 7 days per week for the purpose of manufacturing fuel grade ethanol from the natural fermentation of grain (mainly corn).  The regulated substances stored at the facility are aqua ammonia 23% concentration and a flammable mixture - natural gasoline - typically referred to as denaturant.  \n\n\n\nWORST CASE AND ALTERNATE CASE SCENARIOS:\n\nWorst Case Scenarios:\n\nAqua ammonia 23% - Aqua ammonia is stored in a 70,700 gallon aboveground steel tank.  The worst case scenario used is a release of the entire contents of the stor"

      "SummaryText": "age vessel, equal to 544,249 pounds, creating a toxic vapor cloud.  A determination spreadsheet is included as part of BLE's RMP documentation file detailing the conversion from gallons to pounds of ammonia.  RMP Comp was used to determine the worst case distance to endpoint, the model results are also included in BLE's RMP documentation file.  The ammonia tank sits on a concrete pad, passive mitigation was not included as part of this scenario.  The facility can elect to place a fence around the ammonia tank for security purposed, but the typical chain link fence would not prevent migration of an ammonia release.  Residential receptor information was obtained using LandView 6, other public receptor information was obtained using the facility's knowledge of the surrounding area.  It has been determined that no environmental receptors would be affected by a worst case release of ammonia.\n\n\n\nFlammable Mixture (Denaturant) - The flammable mixture stored onsite is natural gasoline.  Natural gasoline is used onsite to denature 200 proof ethanol prior to shipment off-site.  Denaturant is stored in a 123,291 gallon aboveground steel tank within the facility tank farm.  The tank farm is located within a lined containment berm with gravel overlay.  A worst case MSDS was used to determine RMP applicability and to run the flammable mixture constituents in RMP Comp.  The breakdown of reportable constituents and RMP Comp model results are included as part of BLE's RMO documentation file.  The worst case scenario used is the release of the entire contents of the denaturant tank, approximately 690,430 pounds, causing a vapor cloud explosion.  Of the entire tank contents, only 234,746 pounds is reportable (due to listed constituents) under CAA Section 112(r).  RMP Comp was used to determine the worst case distance to endpoint.  Residential receptor information was obtained using LandView 6, other public receptor information was obtained using the facility's knowledge of the surroun"

      "SummaryText": "ding area.  It has been determined that no environmental receptors would be affected by a worst case release of denaturant.\n\n\n\nAlternate Scenarios:\n\nAqua ammonia 23% - The alternate scenario used for ammonia is a release of 88,200 pounds (11,458 gallons) due to a transfer hose failure.  This scenario is considered the most likely cause of an ammonia release at the BLE facility.  The alternate release duration assumed is 120 minutes with an atmospheric stability of D and wind speed of 3.0 m/sec.  The facility control room is manned 24 hours/day and would be alerted of any losses associated with the ammonia system that were tracked on the plant's DCS system.  No passive or active mitigation strategies were considered for this scenario.  RMP Comp was used to determine the alternate distance to endpoint, model results are included as part of BLE's RMP documentation file.  Residential receptor information was obtained using LandView 6, other public receptor information was obtained using the facility's knowledge of the surrounding area.  It has been determined that no environmental receptors would be affected by an alternate case release of ammonia.\n\n\n\nFlammable Mixture (Denaturant) - The alternate scenario used for the flammable mixture is the release of 43,680 pounds (7,800 gallons) of natural gasoline due to a tanker truck loadout spill, causing a vapor cloud fire.  The endpoint used was an over-pressurization of 1 psi, a worst case option.  Denaturant deliveries at the facility typically occur during normal business hours with a facility staff member overseeing loadout operation, if able - therefore a release at the loadout area could be ceased within minutes by manual overrides.  The loadout area also has a catchment basin with underground piping to the tank farm berm.  For this scenario passive and active mitigation was not considered, as the mitigation strategies currently in place at BLE would not contain a vapor cloud fire.  RMP Comp was used to determine the al"

It has been determined that no environmental receptors would be affected by an alternate case release of denaturant.\n\n\n\nThe facility qualifies as a Program 3 due to the close proximity of public receptors and therefore, a Process Safety Management (PSM) program has been implemented at the BLE facility.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS:\n\nPlease review the first section of this Executive Summary for general accidental release prevention program information.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\n\nBLE has not had an accident related to any of the cover processes in the past five years.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\n\nBLE has several safety programs in place at the facility that incorporate emergency response, including H&S Plan and FRP.  BLE also has an Emergency Response Action Plan that details evacuation and response procedures for spills and releases, fire, etc.  The Plans listed in this section have been prepared in accordance with applicable regulations, as necessary.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\n\nBLE will continue to provide training programs to ensure the safety of employees and contractors.\n\n\n\n  \n\n    "
