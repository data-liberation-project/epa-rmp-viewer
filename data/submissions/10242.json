      "SummaryText": "Hog Slat, Inc. - Newton Grove Facility\nRMP Executive Summary\n\nThe Hog Slat Newton Grove Facility uses relatively few hazardous chemicals in its manufacturing processes. These include a cryogenic tank of argon, various compressed welding gases and mixtures, Portland cement and a 30,000 gallon tank of liquefied propane gas used to fuel a powder coating oven. Senior management is committed to safety at the facility and chemical safety is taught to all company employees on initial hiring and annually thereafter.\n\nThe company is one of the world's largest manufacturers of quality equipment for the hog industry and all metal fabrication is conducted at the Newton Grove facility. Raw metal stock is brought to the plant by truck and is cut, formed, bent, punched, welded, shot-blasted and sent through an electrostatic powder coating booth. The LP gas fuels the oven used to bake the coating to the metal. A minor amount of specialty precast concrete work is conducted at the facility. Other SICs include a retail sales building, vehicle maintenance garage, research farm, equipment installation and service and post frame building construction.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario is based on the entire weight of the 30,000-gallon LP tank \n(126,000 pounds) with an 80% correction factor applied as an administrative control by the LP gas company. The alternative scenario is based on the TNT equivalent with a 3% yield factor as opposed to a 10% yield factor. There is no known feasible active or passive mitigation for the storage tank; however, there is a cutoff switch to shut off the flow of gas to the building in the event of a fire or explosion.\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of LP gas in the last five years or in the 25-year history of the company. \n\nThe Chief of the Newton Grove Volunteer Fire Department and the Captain of the Newton Grove Rescue Squad are employed by our company, as are 10 firefighters and rescue personnel. Fire drills are conducted approximately twice a ye"
