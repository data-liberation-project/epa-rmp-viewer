Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n\nAt this facility, we manufacture gaseous hydrogen.  Hydrogen, in the amounts handled by our facility, is considered hazardous by the EPA.   It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and state rules and regulations.  Air Products manages the safety of the regulated processes by means of operating procedures, equipment testing and inspections,  safety devices (e.g., alarms, shutdowns, instrumentation, relief devices) inherent in the design of this facility and other controls and systems designed to prevent accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  Safe work practices and training of our personnel supplement the inherent safe design of the plant.\n\nOur emergency response program is based upon OSHA?s HAZWOPER regulation.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for the request of local fire support through Channel Industries Mutual Aid so that appropriate measures can be taken by local emergency responders to control accidental releases.\n\nThis document has been prepared in accordance with the EPA?s Risk Management Plan regulation (40 CFR, Part 68). The substances and processes considered during the preparation of this RMP and the scenarios described were selected based on criteria established in the regulation.\n\n2.  The stationary source and regulated substances handled:\n\nOne of the principal  purposes of this facility is the manufacturing of gaseous hydrogen. Gaseous hydrogen is used by our customes in their manufacturing processes. Gaseous hydrogen is produced in the partial oxidation process unit and transmitted to the customers via pipelines. In addition, hydrogen is filled into Department of Transportation regulated tube trailers for the over the road deliveries to customers. The pipelines are connected to a 20,000 gallon liquid hydrogen backup tank that supplies the pipelines when the par"

      "SummaryText": "tial oxidation process unit is shut down.\n\n\nProcess Description: Natural gas and oxygen are received by our plant via pipelines and used as  feedstock.  The oxygen and natural gas are combined in the gasifie,  in a process called partial oxidation reaction.  The partial oxidation process is a process where oxygen and natural gas are injected through a burner into a hot refractory lined gasifier.  The oxygen and natural gas are converted in the gasifier at 2500 F to syngas.  Syngas consists mainly of hydrogen and carbon monoxide.  Carbon dioxide and steam are also produced in the partial oxidation process.  Carbon dioxide is removed from the syngas by flowing through a scrubber.  The syngas is dried to remove moisture, then separated into hydrogen and carbon monoxide through a cryogenic distillation process.  The hydrogen is sent through a pressure swing adsorber to remove residual carbon monoxide.  The pure hydrogen is then compressed and delivered to our customers via pipelines or filled into tube trailers.  Back up hydrogen is provided by a 20,000 gallon liquid hydrogen storage tank and gaseous hydrogen storage tube banks.\n\nThe regulated substance handled at this facility is the flammable mixture.  The maximum amount of this substance at this facility is:\n\n81,000 pounds of flammable mixture containing approximately 31% hydrogen and 10% methane\n\n3.  The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario, including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distance for each reported scenario:\n\nSection (c) omitted per the amended Section 68.155\n\n\n4.  The general accidental release prevention program and specific prevention steps:\n\nThe facility developed prevention program elements  based on the Federal EPA?s Accidental Release Prevention Plan and OSHA?s Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation.  This facility was designed and constructed to comply  with applicable state and industry codes.\n\n5.  Five-year accident history:\n\nThere hav"

The emergency response program:\n\nThe facility?s emergency response program is based upon OSHA?s HAZWOPER standard.  At this site, employees are trained to recognize emergencies and initiate emergency response from outside agencies.  They have been trained to OSHA?s First Responder Awareness Level.  The employees receive annual refresher training in their role in the emergency plan.  Emergency response activities have also been coordinated with the Channel Industries Mutual Aid for emergencies related to the hydrogen process.  Periodic drills are conducted with agencies to review the effectiveness of our emergency procedures. \n\n7.  Planned changes to improve safety:\n\nThe facility resolves recommendations from PHAs and Incident Investigations, some of which may result in modifications to the plant design and operating procedures."
