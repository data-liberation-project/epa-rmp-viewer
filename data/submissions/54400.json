The facility has undergone two major construction projects for capacity expansion and facility improvements.  During 1999 through 2001, the Griswold WTP underwent a major rehabilitation, which included significant improvements for the chlorine and aqueous ammonia systems.\n\nIn accordance with Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 68, Sections 48 through 60 (40 CFR Part 68.48 through 68.60) Subpart C, under section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act (CAA), the facility has established a Program 2 Prevention Program as a part of the Risk Management Program and Plan.  The overall goal of the risk management program and plan are to reduce the risk to employees and to the public of injury or death from accidental release of chemicals.\n\nThe facility is not subject to ?Program 1? because a release could affect off-site receptors.  ?Program 3? does not apply because the facility is not subject to the federal or state Occupation Safety and Health Act (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) rule, nor is it one of the listed industries required to develop ?Program 3? prevention programs.  Thus, ?Program 2? applies to the facility.  The prevention program includes information for two process chemicals:  chlorine and ammonia.\n\nRequirements for the Program 2 Prevention Program contained in Subpart C include:\n\n* Safety Information (40 CFR 68.48)\n\n* Hazard Review (40 CFR 68.50)\n\n* Operating Procedures (40 CFR 68.52)\n\n* Training (40 CFR 68.54)\n\n* Maintenance (40 CFR 68.56)\n\n* Compliance Audits (40 CFR 68.58)\n\n* Incident Investigation (40 CFR 68.60)\n\n\n\n"
