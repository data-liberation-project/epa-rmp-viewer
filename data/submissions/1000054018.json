Aerosol container filling services at the facility utilize a series of eight  Liquefied Petroleum (LP) Gas tanks ( seven 3,500-gallon tanks, and two 1,500-gallon tanks) that house a combination of 1,1 Diflouroethane (DFE), Dimethyl Ether (DME), Propane and Isobutane (Aerosols).  These exterior tanks serve a series of four exterior gas houses.  The aerosols are circulated through the gas house(s) in liquid form and injected into partially-filled and sealed aerosol containers. Pressurized containers return to the facility, via conveyor systems, for inspection and packaging. At maximum, the facility may store (for brief time periods) approximately 185,000 small (1 to 5 ounce) bottles of finished product awaiting shipment to customers.  Finished product bottles contain varying amounts of aerosol.  \n\n\n\nAt any given time, the assumed combined maximum inventory of 1,1 DFE, DME, Propane and Isobutane is approximately 130,000 pounds (present in tanks and finished product). 1,1 DFE, DME, Propane and Isobutane are covered substances under the Risk Management Program, each with an applicability threshold of 10,000 pounds.  As such, the Precise Packaging facility is subject to the RMP requirements.  \n\n\n\nBased on the evaluation performed by ERM in conjunction with Precise Packaging personnel, it was determined that the facility is eligible for classification under the Program level 3 requirements.   A covered process is subject to Program 3 if the process is subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management standard, 29 CFR 1910.119, and does not meet the Program Level 1 eligibility conditions which, among other things, require that the facility must analyze the worst-case release scenario for the covered process(es) and document that the nearest public receptor is beyond the dis"

Based on the molecular structure of DFE, C2H4F2, there are two fluorine atoms available for HF formation for every molecule of DFE.  Using the molecular weight of DFE (66.05 lb/lbmole), approximately 946.25 lbmoles of DFE is the maximum storage quantity on site.  If every fluorine atom were to convert to HF during an explosion (a 2:1 ratio), 18,925 lbmoles of HF would be produced.  Using the molecular weight of HF (20.01 lb/lbmole), this would equate to a maximum theoretical release of approximately 37,868.25 lbs HF.  This level would"
