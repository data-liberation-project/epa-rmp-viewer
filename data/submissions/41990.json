The Facility Policy\n\nThe owners, management, and employees of  Ouachita Fertilizer are committed to\nthe prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia or aqua ammonia.  If an accidental release would occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire company, or other\nauthorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and\nthe environment.\n\n  2. Facility Information.\n\n       - The primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to\nfarmers.\n\n       - Anhydrous ammonia and aqua ammonia are stored for blending into mixed-grade fertilizers for crop\nproduction nutrients.\n\n       - The maximum quantities at the facility would be 140,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia in the 30,000\ngallon storage tank and 200,000 pounds of aqua ammonia in various storage tanks.  The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia handled would be the 140,000 pounds in the storage tank.\n\n  3. The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario.\n\n       a. The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of anhydrous ammonia from the storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be\n140,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the storage tank.   The distance to the\nendpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.16 miles.\n\n       b. The alternative release scenario based on the most likely potential incident is a\nrelease from a break in an anhydrous ammonia transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 0.56 miles.\n   \n  4. The accidental release prevention program.\n\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of  \"Safety Requirements for the\nStorage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American\nNational Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and\nHealth Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of anhydrous\nammoni"

      "ESSeqNum": 1,
      "FacilityID": 41990,
      "SummaryText": "a\".  \n\n  5. The Five-year Accident History.\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia or aqua ammonia in the past five\nyears that:\n     - have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility;\nnor\n     - to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering\nin place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n      \n  6. The emergency response program.\n\n     - The facility has provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and\ncommunity right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\n  7. Planned changes to improve safety.\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are\nperformed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions. There are no additional specific\nanhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
