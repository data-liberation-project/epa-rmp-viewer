The facility where the hydrogen is stored is unmanned except during loading of the hydrogen storage tank or during maintenance activies by the contractor, Air Liquide.\n\n1.  Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n\nAt this facility, we store hydrogen, vaporize the hydrogen and transfer the hydrogen through dedicated piping to be used in a manufacturing process at the Cincinnati Crisco Plant.  Hydrogen, in the amounts stored and handled by our facility, is considered hazardous by the EPA.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State rules and regulations.  The J.M. Smucker Company and its contracted operator (Air Liquide) manages the safety of the regulated process by means of operating procedures, equipment testing and inspections, safety devices (e.g., alarms, shutdowns, instrumentation, relief devices) inherent in the design of this facility, and other controls and systems designed to prevent accidental releases of hydrogen.  Safe work practices and training of personnel supplement the inherent safe design of the plant.\n\nOur emergency response program is based upon OSHAs HAZWOPER regulation.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for the notification of the local fire authority, Air Liquide, and hazardous materials unit, if applicable, so that appropriate measures can be taken by local emergency responders and the operator to control accidental releases.\n\nThis document has been prepared in accordance with the EPAs Risk Management Plan regulation (40 CFR, Part 68).  The substances and processes considered during the preparation of this RMP and the scenarios described were selected based on criteria established in the regulation.\n\n2.  The facility (stationary source) and regulated substance handled:\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is the "

      "SummaryText": "storage of hydrogen and the transfer of the gas to the manufacturing process at the Cincinnati Crisco Plant.  \n\nThe hydrogen is delivered by the contractor via truck and unloaded into the hydrogen storage tank as a cryogenic liquid.  The liquid hydrogen is pumped through 2 high pressure ambient air vaporizer modules which  transform the liquid hydrogen to gaseous hydrogen.  The gaseous hydrogen is then transferred to the manufacturing process.  The regulated process is strictly the transfer of hydrogen from a large storage container into one of two reaction vessels.\n\nThe regulated substance handled at this facility is hydrogen, which is stored as a cryogenic liquid.  The maximum amount of this substance at this facility is:  10,620 pounds of liquid hydrogen \n\n3.  Worst-case and Alternative Case Scenarios\n\nWorst Case: Instantaneous release and vaporization of the entire 18,000 gallon tank (10,620 pounds) to the atmosphere resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  No passive controls were applicable to the mitigation of a worst-case release of hydrogen.  The distance to the 1.0 psi overpressure endpoint does have the potential to impact public and environmental receptors.\n\nAlternative: Five separate scenarios were identifed for this facility and the manufacturing process. Three of the five were determined to be very unlikely. The remaining two are: 1) The relief valve nearest Mill Creek vents and releases hydrogen to the atmosphere and results in a fire or explosion; and 2) The unloading truck transfer hose ruptures releasing hydrogen to the atmosphere and results in a fire or explosion.  Both scenarios were examined and the most far reaching scenario (#2) was identified as the alternative scenario.  The distance to the 1.0 psi overpressure endpoint does have the potential to impact environmental receptors.\n\n4. The general accidental release prevention program:\n\nThe facility developed prevention program elements based on OSHAs Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation. "

      "SummaryText": " This facility was designed and constructed to comply with applicable state and industry codes.\n\n5.  Five-year accident history:\n\nThere have been no accidents or accidental releases of hydrogen in the past five years, that resulted in any deaths, injuries or significant property damage on site or known off site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.  There were two near miss incidents, one in Spring of 2005 na one in Spring of 2006. Incident reports and corrective actions were completed following the incidents.\n\n6.  The emergency response program:\n\nThe facility's emergency response program is based upon OSHAs HAZWOPER standard.  At this site, employees are trained to recognize emergencies and initiate emergency response from outside agencies.  They have been trained to OSHAs First Responder Awareness Level.  The employees receive annual refresher training in their role in the emergency plan.  Emergency response activities have been coordinated with the City of Cincinnati Fire Department.  The emergency response program will be updated to include the hydrogen process and the associated emergency response procedures.  \n\n7.  Planned changes to improve safety:\n\nReference the PHA completed January 3rd through 7th."
