      "SummaryText": "Abengoa Bioenergy Company, LLC - York (ABC-York) is an ethanol plant located in York, Nebraska currently producing approximately 50-60 MM gallons of ethanol per year.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Response Policies:\n\n\n\nABC-York has a commitment to worker and public safety.  ABC-York's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, plant personnel will respond to contain the release as necessary according to emergency response plans.\n\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances:\n\n\n\nABC-York ethanol plant is located at 1414 Road O, York, Nebraska, 68467.\n\n\n\nThe facility operates 24 hours per day, 7 days per week for the purpose of manufacturing fuel grade ethanol from corn.  The regulated substance under the RMP program is anhydrous ammonia.  ABC-York has determined that the radius of impact from a worst-case release would be about 5.6 miles due to the amount of ammonia stored on site.\n\n\n\nOff-site Consequence Analysis Results:\n\n\n\nThe worst case scenario at the facility is the release of all 140,000 pounds of ammonia creating a toxic cloud.  This scenario is based on the release of all ammonia stored on site.  The vapor cloud endpoint is approximately 5.6 miles from the center of the plant.  Rural residence homes are located within this 5.6 mile radius.\n\n\n\nSince the facility qualifies as a Program 3 due to the close proximity of public receptors, Process Safety Management has to be completed for this facility.\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History:\n\n\n\nABC-York has not had any spills on-site in the previous five years.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program Information:\n\n\n\nThe ABC-York ethanol plant has several safety programs in place at the facility that incorporate emergency response, including a Health and Safety Plan.  A Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasure (SPCC) procedure has also been revised and implemented in accordance with applicable regulatory standards "
