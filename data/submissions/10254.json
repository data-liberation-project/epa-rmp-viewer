Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies\n\n     The owners and employees of C & M Supply are committed to the prevention of\nany accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia or propane.  If an accidental release\nshould occur, we are prepared to work with the local fire department and other\nemergency response authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the\nrelease to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility information\n\n     C & M Supply is an ag-supply business that sells fertilizers, farm chemicals, and\nfuels.  Our facility holds reportable quantities of both anhydrous ammonia and propane\nfor storage and distribution to customers.  The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia\nstored in our 30,000 gallon tank is 120,000 pounds.  Our two propane storage tanks\n(18,000 gallons and 5,000 gallons) will hold a maximum of 83,000 pounds.\n\n3. Worst-case and alternative release scenarios\n\n     Anhydrous ammonia worst case:  The worst-case release scenario would be the\nrelease of the total contents of the 30,000 gallon storage tank as a gas over 10 minutes. \nThe maximum quantity released would be 120,000 pounds, which represents the weight\nof the contents of the storage tank at 80 percent capacity as limited by company operating\nprocedures.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 parts per million) is\n1.9 miles.\n\n     Anhydrous ammonia alternative:  The alternative release scenario based on the\nmost likely potential incident is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to\nthe endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 parts per million) is 0.92 miles.\n\n     Propane worst case:  The worst-case release scenario would be the release and\nvapor cloud explosion of the contents of the largest storage tank.  The maximum quantity\nreleased would be 65,000 pounds, which represents the weight of the contents of the\nstorage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by company operating p"
