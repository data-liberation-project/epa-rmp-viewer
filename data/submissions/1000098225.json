The warehouse stores greater than 10,000 pounds of butane and propane in aerosol products. \r\n\r\nThe aerosol products are typically in metal containers, with the maximum size of 24-ounces. The average weight of these aerosol products is 17.28 oz and the average amount of propellant in each can is 14%. Per EPA Helpline, the worst case scenario was clarified as the release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a single aerosol can.  The worst case scenario was based on an event consisting of one 18 oz aerosol can containing 15% of propane and 15% of butane. The quantity released in a vapor cloud explosion would not affect any residential population or public receptor or have any off-site consequences. \r\n\r\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps \r\n\r\nLawson's McCook facility is subject to OSHA's PSM rule.
