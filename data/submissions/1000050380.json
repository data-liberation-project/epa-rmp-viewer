The Emergency Plan is provided to assist personnel who react to and respond to plant emergencies.  It contains information relating to recognition and reporting of emergencies, minimizing hazards, and actions that must be taken to protect personnel, property and gas service.  The objective of the Emergency Plan is to assure that personnel who could be involved in an emergency are adequately trained to recognize and deal with emergency situations in an expeditious and safe manner.\n\n\n\nFacility personnel are trained to take defensive or incipient firefighting actions.  Local fire departments will be responsible for extinguishing fires that have gone beyond the incipient stage.  Therefore, this plan is limited to providing guidance for our employees to evacuate the facility and notify the appropriate authorities.\n\n\n\nEmployees receive training in these procedures, as necessary, to perform their specific emergency plan duties. The emergency plan is updated when necessary, based on modifications made to gas plant processes or other facilities.  The emergency plan changes are administered through the Plant Supervisory approval process, which inc"
