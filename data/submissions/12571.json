AND ITS EMPLOYEES ARE COMMITTED TO SAFETY AND THE PREVENTION OF ANY ACCIDENTAL RELEASE OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA (NH3).  NEW EMPLOYEES ARE TRAINED BY AN EXPERIENCED EMPLOYEE IN THE AREA OF THEIR JOB DESCRIPTION.  THE NEW EMPLOYEE WILL BE EXPECTED TO FAMILIARIZE THEMESELVES WITH OUR SAFETY PLOICIES AND PROCEDURES THROUGH ON THE JOB TRAINING AND/OR WRITTEN POLICIES.\nOUR PRIMARY ACTIVITY IS ANHYDROUS RECEIVING, AND STORAGE AND DISTRIBUTION FOR SALE TO FARMERS.  WE PROVIDE RUBBER GLOVES GOGGLES AND RUBBER SUITS FOR THEIR SAFETY WHILE HANDLING NH3.  OUR STAFF HAS ONE EMPLOYEE THAT IS VOL FIRE DEPT. FIRE CHIEF AND ON THE VOL. AMBULANCE SERVICE, AND ONE EMPLOYEE THAT IS A MEMBER OF THE FIRE DEPT.  THIS CAN GIVE US A JUMP ON AN ACCIDENT IF IT SOULD OCCUR.  IN THE PAST FIVE YEARS WE HAVE NOT HAD AN ACCIDENT AT THIS LOCATION.\nOUR FACILITY HAS A WRITTEN EMERGENCY PLAN IN ACCORDANCE WITH OSHA STANDARD 29.CFR 1910.38.  WE HAVE PROVIDED LOCAL AUTHORITIES WITH  THE EMERGENCY PLAN AND EMERGENCY PLANNING AND COMMUNITY RIGHT-TO-KNOW INFORMATION AS REQUIRED BY SARA TITLE III.  SAFETY IMPROVEMENT IS AN ON-GOING PROCESS AT THIS FACILITY.  THERE ARE NO SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS FOR SAFETY IMPLEMENTATION AT THIS TIME.\nTHE MAXIMUM QUANTITY OF NH3 STORED AT THIS FACILITY IS, 1 TANK THAT IS 12,000 GAL AND 1 TANK THAT IS 14,000 GAL.  THIS IS A TOTAL OF 190,060 LBS WHEN FILLED TO 85% CAP.\nTHE WORSE CASE RELEASE SCENARIO WOULD BE THE RELEASE OF THE TOTAL CONTENTS OF ONE TANK, BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT HOOKED TOGETHER."
