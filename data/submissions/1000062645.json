      "SummaryText": "RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nROGERSVILLE PLANT\n\n\n\n(a)    Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response.  Public and employee safety, as well as environmental protection, are primary issues of concern to Eco-Energy Stone Mountain, LLC (Eco).  Accidental release prevention is a key factor in the design, construction and operation of all Eco facilities.  Eco facilities are constructed in accordance with applicable codes/standards and are evaluated to ensure that the equipment complies with recognized and generally accepted good engineering practices.  Eco facilities are equipped with many engineering safeguards (i.e.:  pressure relief valves, shutdowns, alarms, etc.) that are designed to prevent situations that would require an emergency response.  This plan is provided to applicable outside agencies that might be called upon for assistance in an emergency situation (i.e.:  police department, fire department, etc.).\n\n\n\n(b)    Stationary Source and Regulated Substances.  The Stone Mountain Processing facility is a stationary source as defined in 40 CFR 68.3.  The regulated substance at the facility is a flammable chemical mixture, Natural Gas Liquids (NGL), which is an aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbon mixture.  The mixture includes N-pentane, isopentane, N-butane, isobutane, propane, ethane, and methane.  These chemicals have an RMP regulated threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds.  \n\n\n\n(c)    Worst-Case Release Scenario, Alternative Worst-Case Release Scenario, and Administrative/Mitigative Controls.  The worst-case release scenario (WCRS) would be a rupture of an NGL Product Storage Tank.  Such a release has the potential to form a vapor cloud that could explode with a 10% yield when exposed to an ignition source.  Using the EPA's Risk Management Program RMP*Comp (TM) for Offsite Consequences Analysis, the WCRS endpoint of 1psi was calculated to be 0.5 miles from the tank.  Using EPA's MARPLOT program, census data, and knowledge of the area, it was determined"

      "FacilityID": 1000062645,
      "SummaryText": " that 33 residents or public receptors were within this WCRS distance.  An alternate release scenario was performed using the same procedure described above, except that a 3% yield was used in accordance with guidance.  The resulting 1psi endpoint was 0.5 miles from the tank.  Using Census data and MARPLOT it was determined that 33 residents were within the alternate WCRS distance.  \n\n\n\nVarious administrative and mitigative (engineering) controls have been implemented/installed as safeguards to prevent deviations outside safe operating limits.  Administrative controls include utilizing a well-trained operation and maintenance staff that periodically visit and inspect the facility.  Mitigative (engineering) safeguards include such things as high pressure/overpressure relief valves, high-pressure shutdowns, high temperature shutdowns, high level shutdowns, etc.\n\n\n\n(d)    Hazard Communication Program.  Eco has developed and implemented a Company Hazard Communication Program that ensures:  1) an SDS is on file for all hazardous chemicals used or stored in the facility; 2) all applicable containers of hazardous chemicals are properly labeled/marked; and 3) employees receive annual training on the Company Hazard Communication Program.\n\n\n\n(e)    Five Year Accident History.   The Stone Mountain Processing Facility has not had a regulated flammable chemical release in the previous five years.\n\n\n\n(f)    Planned Changes to Improve Safety.  Eco is always looking for ways to improve their safety program.  Eco believes the effectiveness of the safety program is directly proportional to employee involvement and senior management support.  Recently performed work consisted of arc flash assessments update and implemented recommendations for fuse swap outs.\n\n"
