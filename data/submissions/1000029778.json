(AUT) is committed to protecting facility personnel, the public, and the environment from any workplace and accidental release hazards.  An appropriate response to releases of TDI is in the written Risk Management Program.  Safety, environmental, and risk management programs are fully implemented and coordinated with community emergency responders for emergency planning and response. \n\n\n\nB. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled:\n\n\n\nAUT is located at 1200 Rink Street in Brenham, Texas.  AUT manufactures and fabricates slab stock polyurethane foam and finished foam products (i.e., mattresses, pads, and pillows) and is classified under the NACIS Code of 326150, urethane and other foam products (except polystyrene) manufacturing.  \n\n\n\nPolyurethane foam is a product made of combining various chemicals that undergo a chemical reaction.  The finished product is produced in a variety of colors, thicknesses, and densities.  One of the chemicals used is Toluene Diisocyanate (TDI).  The TDI is stored in three (3) storage tanks - one (1) 10,000 gallon storage tank and Two (2) 5,000 gallon storage tanks.  At times, TDI is stored in an 18,000 gallon railcar until unloading occurs.  Therefore, the total combined maximum physical volume on site at any one time is approximately 38,000 gallons (386,460 lbs).\n\n\n\nThe EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) is part of the Clean Air Act and applies to a process storing a specified chemical above a threshold quantity. The chemicals and threshold quantities are specified in Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 68.  One such chemical is Toluene Diisocynate (TDI) in excess of 10,000 pounds which is used as an ingredient in the manufacturing process.\n\n\n\nAfter reviewing the facility operations and the RMP regulations, it was determined that the entire facility is considered one process.

Accidental Release Prevention and Specific Prevention Steps:\n\n\n\nAUT is committed to protecting facility personnel, the public, and the environment from any workplace and accidental release hazards.  An appropriate response to releases of TDI is in the written Risk Management Program.  Safety, environmental, and risk management programs are fully implemented and coordinated with community emergency responders for emergency planning and response.  AUT's specific prevention steps include:\n\n\n\n    1. Hazard reviews to identify, evaluate and control potential TDI process hazards,\n\n    2. Develop, review and update operating and maintenance procedures for the TDI process,\n\n    3. Provide the appropriate training for TDI process operators, maintenance\n\n        personnel,and emergency response personnel.\n\n    4. Conduct timely investigations of all incidents involving the TDI process.\n\n    5. Conduct RMP Compliance audits as per RMP regulations.\n\n\n\nC. Hazard Assessment:\n\n\n\nThe RMP requires AUT to evaluate the maximum potentially affected area for accidents involving TDI for a worst case release scenario and an alternative scenario.\n\n\n\nThe worst case release is highly improbable since it involves the combination of a certain set of conditions for a large release of the chemical without any employee intervention.  Because the assumptions required for the worst-case analysis are very conservative, the results likely will be very conservative.  The endpoints specified for regulated toxic substances are intended to be protective of the general public.  The distance to the endpoint estimated under worst-case conditions should not be considered an area in which the public would likely be in danger; instead, it is intended to provide an estimate of the maximum possible area that might be affected in the unlikely event of catastrophic acc"

      "SummaryText": "ident.  EPA intends the estimated distances to provide a basis for discussion among the regulated community, emergency responders, and the public, rather a basis for any specific actions.\n\n\n\nA release from the railcar with a capacity of 18,000 gallons of TDI has been identified as the worst-case release and was considered in the hazard assessment.  The 18,000 gallons of TDI equates to approximately 183,060 lbs.  The railcar unloading area is located on the east side of the building.  At present there is no secondary containment for the railcar unloading area.\n\n\n\nThe impact distance from the worst-case scenario has been estimated using EPA's RMPComp Model.  The RMPComp model estimates a distance to the endpoint of 0.6 miles for the worst case scenario. The impact distance extends beyond the facility property. There are approximately two thousand and sixty-two (2062) people residing within the potentially affected area.\n\n\n\nThe alternative scenario is an event more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario and is a more realistic accident scenario.  AUT has determined that the most likely alternative scenario for the facility is a process piping release (flange leak or failure in process line) from the process line carrying TDI from the tank to the pouring head.  The leak would release approximately 1,080 lbs of TDI.  The RMPComp Method estimates a distance to the endpoint of 0.1 mile for the alternative release scenario.  The impact distance extends beyond the facility property line. There are approximately thirty (30) people residing within the potentially affected area.\n\n\n\nD. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information: AUT will complete a compilation of written safety information to be used in conducting the Hazard Review.  The Hazard Review will be conducted using the process safety information gathered in order to identify and understand the hazards posed by the TDI System. \n\n\n\nHazard Revi"

A system was established to promptly address the team's findings and recommendations; assure that the recommendations are resolved in a timely manner and that the resolution is documented; develop a written schedule of when these actions are to be completed; and communicate the actions to operation, maintenance and other employees who may be affected by the recommendations or actions.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures: AUT will develop written operating procedures to provide clear instructions for safely conducting activities at each operation where TDI is utilized.  These written operating procedures will be consistent with the process safety information for each operating phase, operating limitations, safety and health considerations, safety systems and their functions.  The operating procedures will be readily accessible to employees who work in or maintain the TDI system.  These operating procedures will be reviewed as often as necessary to assure that they reflect current operating practice.  AUT will develop and implement safe work practices to provide for the control of hazards during operations such as lockout/tagout; opening process equipment or piping; and control entrance into the TDI facility.\n\n\n\nTraining: AUT will provide training for each employee associated with the TDI system.
