Effective SOPs, when combined with operator training, are instrumental in ensuring safe operation of the system and in preventing accidental releases.\n    The purpose of the mechanical integrity program is to ensure the continued integrity of the process equipment.  An effective mechanical integrity program is integral to preventing accidental releases that may result from mechanical failure of improperly maintained equipment.  The Fiveash WTP\u00bfs mechanical integrity program includes maintenance, inspection, and testing procedures and schedules along with maintenance personnel training.\n    Knowledgeable well-trained personnel are essential to preventing and mitigating the effects of accidental chemical releases. The Fiveash WTP\u00bfs training program ensures that personnel working on or near the chlorine and ammonia systems are adequately trained in operation and maintenance procedures and the appropriate response actions to an accidental release.\n    The process hazard analysis is a valuable risk reduction tool that outlines deficiencies in equipment and procedures, identifies potential system failure modes, and provides recommendations for system and operational improvements.\n                                                                                                                                                                           EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n    A comprehensive emergency response program has been prepared which outlines the procedures and lines of communication that are necessary to effectively respond to and mitigate a potential chlorine or ammonia release.

The chlorine alternatives being evaluated include switching to on-site generation of sodium hypochlorite (at 0.8% concentration) and purchasing bulk hypochlorite (at 12% concentration).  In addition, these alternatives are being compared to staying with chlorine gas and enclosing the existing facilities (to contain a chlorine leak) and adding an emergency chlorine scrubber.  The anhydrous ammonia alternatives evaluated include switching to using ammonia solution or staying with anhydrous ammonia and enclosing the existing facilities (to contain an ammonia leak) and adding an emergency ammonia scrubber. It is estimated that the new disinfection system will be selected and implemented by mid year 2005 and the end of year 2007, respectively."

      "SummaryText": "INTRODUCTION\n    At the turn of this century water borne diseases were a leading cause of death in the United States.  Epidemics of typhoid, cholera, dysentery and other water-borne diseases occurred.  After chlorine\u00bfs introduction into public water supplies, deaths from typhoid in the U.S. dropped dramatically from 25,000 in 1900 to less than 20 in 1960.  Water-borne disease is even still a leading cause of infant mortality in many countries throughout Asia, Africa, and Latin America where infant mortality rates are 10 to 20 times greater than in the U.S.  In the U.S., however, water-borne disease has been virtually eliminated due to an effective public health strategy of utilizing chlorine for drinking water disinfection.  Chlorine disinfection is arguably one of the greatest achievements for public health worldwide in the last hundred years and is credited with increasing the life expectancy of Americans by more than 50 percent.  Furthermore, public health has benefited from the use of anhydrous ammonia in water disinfection processes because of the reduction in the formation of disinfection by-products.\n    However, it is important to recognize that the use of chlorine and anhydrous ammonia is not risk free.  Historically it is clear that utilities have recognized the risks and have been successful in developing procedures to handle chlorine safely and to protect the off-site public and the environment from potential accidental releases.\n    As an added layer of protection, the United States Environmental Protection Agency promulgated Hazardous Chemical Risk Management Program regulations to further ensure that facility owners understand the risks and take proactive efforts to reduce risk through comprehensive training programs, procedures, and risk mitigation measures.  Additionally, EPA wanted the public to be informed regarding these issues.\n    The City of Fort Lauderdale Public Services Department has always understood these risks and has maintained a well-"

The facility\u00bfs mission is to protect public health by providing our community with safe drinking water, free of harmful pathogens.  Approximately 3,600 pounds per day of chlorine gas and 680 pounds per day of anhydrous ammonia are used to disinfect the water and make it safe for human consumption.  A maximum of 202,000 pounds of chlorine and 55,800 pounds of anhydrous ammonia are stored on-site.  The chlorine and ammonia are stored as gases that are liquefied under pressure.\n                                                                                                                                                                             CHLORINE PROCESS AND SAFETY EQUIPMENT\n    The chlorine system at the Fiveash WTP is a liquid feed system.  Under normal operations, chlorine is supplied to the process from a railcar that contains 90 tons of chlorine. Two chlorine containers (each holding 2,000 pounds of chlorine) are also connected to the chlorine supply header and are used to cupply chlorine to the process during the change out of an empty railcar for a new railcar. The liquid chlorine process operates by feeding chlorine to the evaporators. The liquid chlorine in the evaporator iscontained in a pressure vessel. A hot water bath surrounding the pressure vessel transfers heat to the chlorine, which in turn va"

The deluge system is designed to automatically spray water on the tank and cool it if sensors detect a high pressure or temperature in the tank.  In addition, the deluge system can be used to mitigate the consequences of a leak because ammonia gas would readily be absorbed by the water spray.\n                                                                                                                                                                                     RISK MANAGEMENT AND PROCESS SAFETY MANAGEMENT PROGRAM OVERVIEW\nChlorine and anhydrous ammonia are subject to the Environmental Protection Agency\u00bfs (EPA's) Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation which can be found in 40 CFR 68 and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration\u00bfs (OSHA\u00bfs) Process Safety Management Program (PSMP) regulation which can be found in 29 CFR 1910.119.\n    The primary components of the RMP are as follows:\n* A five-year accident history\n* An off-site consequence analysis for a worst-case and alternative release scenario\n* A comprehensive prevention program to minimize risks (i.e. minimize the potential for a release)\n* An emergency response program to ensure that an accidental release is appropriately handled\n* An overall management program to supervise the implementation of the RMP\n    Following development of the RMP submitted in year 1999, the facility must submit a RMP Update to the EPA by June 21, 2004.  The RMP update, which is presented every five years, reports any process changes or if a new process is added.
