Albertsons operates many retail grocery stores throughout the West that are supplied through a distribution and transportation complex located in North Salt Lake, Utah. The Albertsons Refrigerated Distribution Center #8231, located on this facility site employs over 475 people and uses anhydrous ammonia for refrigeration of the products in storage. Anhydrous ammonia is subject to EPA regulation under 40 CFR 68, Accidental Release Risk Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals.\nAlbertsons North Salt Lake distribution center stores and uses anhydrous ammonia for refrigeration of grocery products in storage.  Albertsons\u00bf North Salt Lake distribution center has never experienced a release of ammonia involving consequences that affected residents or the environment.\nPursuant to the RMP regulations (40 CFR 68) and the Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations, Albertsons has developed a comprehensive PSM written program to protect employees and the surrounding community from exposure to the hazardous chemicals onsite.  The facility completed a process hazards analysis (PHA) for ammonia using the industry standard What-If?/Checklist Analysis developed through the International Institute for Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR). The PHA was completed using technical and operations staff from the North Salt Lake facility as well as experienced facilitators from an outside engineering firm (ERM-West, Inc.), and was revalidated to meet PSM and RMP requirements in 2001.\nAlbertsons\u00bf implementation of the PSM program includes employee education in the hazards of ammonia and measures that can be used to reduce employee and community exposure to accidental releases of ammonia. The plans include preventive maintenance programs (mechanical integrity) for the ammonia system, and a program for both pre-startup safety reviews and management of changes (MOC) to this system.

Although such a release is highly unlikely, the regulation requires this review.  \nAlbertsons is committed to minimizing accidental releases of ammonia from the refrigeration process at the North Salt Lake distribution center.  Facility management is involved in the design, operation, and maintenance of the system.  Albertsons\u00bf employees have been involved in the development of the PSM and RMP programs.  Management has committed to working with local agencies and the community to educate the public regarding the hazards of ammonia and to ensure a safe workplace and surrounding community.  Specific questions regarding RMP compliance at Albertsons should be addressed to Albertsons Environmental Affairs Department.  \nAlbertsons has prepared this RMP in accordance with the requirements imposed by the April 2004 revisions to the RMP regulations."
