The Company\u0012s Policy on Environmental and Health and Safety Responsibility and Ethics requires employees and facilities to conduct operations in conformance with all applicable laws and regulations and in a manner that will protect employees, the community and the environment.  This Policy is implemented by our facility through specific programs designed to assure safe and responsible handling of all chemicals throughout the manufacturing process.\n\n\nRegulated Substance\nThe covered process is the chlorine storage building.  The storage area is a separate building located away from other processes on the north side of the facility site on the west side of the warehouse.  It can hold up to nine partially full one ton chlorine containers.  We have a contract with a chemical supplier to partially fill one ton chlorine containers not to exceed 1400 lbs of chlorine.  These will be used one at a time in other processes.  A container is located on the west side of the building connected to the germanium tetrachloride production area.   A container is also located on the east side of the gallium trichloride production area.  The storage area maximum intended inventory of chlorine is 13000 lbs., and contains no process vessels or equipment of any kind.  The storage area is a three-sided enclosure isolated from other structures to reduce potential fire hazards, with no sources of energy associated with the building.\n\nWorst Case\nAFTOX dispersion modeling predicts that the worst case release of 1400 pounds over 46 minutes would adversely affect an areas extending 2.29 miles from the release.  Census data from 1990 indicates that  692 people reside in this area.  AFTOX further predicts that a less serious alternate case release of 55 pou"

In addition,\nall fourteen elements of the PSM program are reviewed every three years to ensure the\nprogram is in compliance with all OSHA PSM requirements.\n\nThe EOM facility has 41 operators that are trained under the Hazardous Waste\nOperations and Emergency Response (HAZWOPER) 40-hour operations level.
