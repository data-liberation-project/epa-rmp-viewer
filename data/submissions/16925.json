The Companys Policy on Environmental and Health and Safety Responsibility and Ethics requires employees and facilities to conduct operations in conformance with all applicable laws and regulations and in a manner that will protect employees, the community and the environment.  This Policy is implemented by our facility through specific programs designed to assure safe and responsible handling of all chemicals throughout the manufacturing process.\n\n\nRegulated Substance\nThe covered process is the chlorine storage building.  The storage area is a separate building located away from other processes on the north side of the facility site on the west side of the warehouse.  It can hold up to nine partially full one ton chlorine containers.  We have a contract with a chemical supplier to partially fill one ton chlorine containers not to exceed 1400 lbs of chlorine.  These will be used one at a time in other processes.  A container is located on the west side of the building connected to the germanium tetrachloride production area.   A container is also located on the east side of the gallium trichloride production area.  The storage area maximum intended inventory of chlorine is 13000 lbs., and contains no process vessels or equipment of any kind.  The storage area is a three-sided enclosure isolated from other structures to reduce potential fire hazards, with no sources of energy associated with the building.\n\nWorst Case\nAFTOX dispersion modeling predicts that the worst case release of 1400 pounds over 46 minutes would adversely affect an areas extending 2.29 miles from the release.  Census data from 1990 indicates that  692 people reside in this area.  AFTOX further predicts that a less serious alternate case release of 55 pou"

The worst case affected area includes schools and residences, whereas the alternative case affected area includes no public receptors .  No release scenario is predicted to affect any environmental receptors.\n\n\n\n\nRelease Protection\n\nThe chlorine process area has been regulated by OSHAs Process Safety Management\n(PSM) since 1994.  The facility has successfully implemented all fourteen elements of\nthe PSM program for the covered process.\n\nThis facility has developed written operating and safety procedures for the storage and\nhandling chlorine containers.  Employees working with these containers are routinely\ntrained annually in forklift safety and chlorine handling.\n\nThe handling of chlorine is routinely reviewed by operating staff.  A process hazard\nanalysis must be preformed at least every five years and in the event of specific process\nmodifications to identify process concerns and develop solutions for them.  In addition,\nall fourteen elements of the PSM program are reviewed every three years to ensure the\nprogram is in compliance with all OSHA PSM requirements.\n\nThe EOM facility has 41 operators that are trained under the Hazardous Waste\nOperations and Emergency Response (HAZWOPER) 40-hour operations level.  This\nprogram requires that operators be trained in the hazardous chemical awareness and\nemergency response procedures.  These individuals are trained to respond to\nhazardous chemical releases and implement proper responses to minimize any affects\non human health and the environment.  All HAZWOPER operators receive an annual\neight-hour refresher training to maintain their certification.\n\nIn addition, the operators in the facility undergo an annual evaluation for their specific\nduties.  They are evaluated on all aspects of their job including hazardous chemical\nsafe work practices.  Any deficiencies noted in this evaluation would require retraining\nbefore the ope"

The storage area is a three-sided enclosure isolated from other\nstructures and chemicals to reduce potential fire hazards and striking by heavy objects\nor vehicles. The enclosure also has secondary containment.\n\nA removable steel valve protective housing protects the individual chlorine container\nvalves.  All ton containers are equipped with fusible metal pressure relief devices. \nThese containers have six fusible metal plugs that are designed to yield or melt\nbetween 158oF and 165 oF to relieve pressure and prevent rupture of the container in\nthe unlikely event of fire or other exposure to high temperature.  The relief device is\nactivated only in the event of a temperature increase.\n\nThe chlorine container storage area is inspected once per operating shift.  The\ncontainers are maintained by our supplier.\n\nEOM facility has a very experienced operating staff with years of experience handling\nhazardous materials.  We have an excellent safety record that demonstrates our\ncommitment to safety.\n \nFive Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidents at this facility in the past five years involving chlorine.\n\nThe Emergency Response Program\n\nEagle-Picher has a monitoring system in the process area that continuously monitors\nfor gas releases.
