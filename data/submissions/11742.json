The corporate environmental compliance manager has been \nassigned overall responsibility for chemical safety in general and \nfor ammonia refrigeration safety in particular since 1991. \nSchwan's maintains 3 - shift coverage of emergency responders \ntrained to the 24-hour technician level at all facilities with \nammonia refrigeration systems covered by this rule.\n\nThe Marshall, MN (Convenience Foods) facility manufactures frozen \nconvenience foods. Anhydrous ammonia is used in the refrigeration \nsystem at this facility. Ammonia is the most efficient and \nenvironmentally compatible refrigerant available. Although it is \ntoxic at high concentration and is an irritating gas, it is not a \ncumulative metabolic poison, does not cause cancer or other dread \ndiseases and does not cause lasting environmental damage. The \nrefrigeration system at this facility contains about 15,000 pounds \nof ammonia.\n\nSchwan's calculates ammonia worst case release scenarios using the \nModel RMP for Ammonia Refrigeration, May 1996. All Schwan's \nmanufacturing facilities are located in areas that meet the \ndefinition of \"urban\". Schwan's has chosen to calculate worst case \nrelease poundage for the largest high-pressure receiver in the \nsystem, filled to full calculated hydraulic capacity. Reduced \nvolume for administrative controls was not used, since the \ndescribed scenario would probably occur only as a result of a \ncatastrophic vessel rupture caused by a total filling of the \nvessel, closure of all vessel block valves, failure of all \npressure relief valves, with a simultaneous increase in liquid \ntemperature sufficient to overpressure the vessel to the point of \nfailure.\n\nIt is the professional judgement of Schwans Environmental Health \nand Safety Department that a release rate of 400 lb./min. should \nbe used as an alternate case scenario in lieu of the 100 lb./min. \nrate suggested in the Model RMP.\n\nThe \"urban\" site condit"

The alternate case will \nbe a release rate of 400 pounds per minute. Both scenarios have \noff-site impacts. The ammonia refrigeration system is covered by \nthe OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) rule, 29 CFR 1910.119.\n\nThe Marshall, MN (Convenience Foods) facility maintains a 3-shift \nemergency response team, trained at the 24-hour technician level. \nThe team numbers 40 members. The training is conducted by the \nVendor. The training is designed with a heavy emphasis on ammonia \nsafety, mechanical isolation, personal protective equipment up to \nuse of Level `A' suits and interaction with an incident command \nsystem (ICS). Copies of emergency plans are filed with the Fire \nDepartment and annual facility walkthroughs are conducted with \nFire Officers. Preplanned command posts and staging areas have \nbeen designated and Incident Command transfer and liaison \nfunctions have been established. A post-incident debriefing is \nconducted after each incident.\n\nSince a continuous improvement philosophy is deeply imbedded in \nthe Schwan's corporate culture, improvements in system safety are \nimplemented as a result of employee-based Total Quality Management \n(TQM) teams, a designated PSM team and as a result of system \nengineering modifications and extensions. Post incident \ndebriefings and incident investigations are used to identify \nadditional improvements to system safety."
