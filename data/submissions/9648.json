Chlorine is the only chemical manufactured and stored at the facility that is present at or above threshold amounts for regulated substances and are regulated under 40 CFR Part 68. \n\nThe EPA Risk Management Regulation identifies three levels of requirements for industrial processes.  Program 1 can be applied to any process which has not had a \"significant\" release of a regulated substance over the five year period prior to the June 1999 compliance date and for which the worst-case release does not affect \"public receptors\" (e.g., residences, parks and recreation areas, commercial/industrial facility, hospitals).  Program 2 applies to any process that is ineligible for Program 1 and is not subject to Program 3.  Program 3 applies to all processes, such as those present at the Holtrachem facility, that are subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management Standard (PSM). The Holtrachem Accident Prevention Program elements are adopted directly from the compliance program for the PSM standard, consistent with the Level 3 RMP Program requirements for this Holtrachem facility under 40 CFR Part 68.  Program 3 related information is included in the Data Elements section of the Risk Management Plan.\n\n2.1 Chlorine Production System \n\nChlorine is produced at the Holtrachem Riegelwood facility as part of an integrated process using electrolysis. Ultra-purified brine is pumped through electrolyzers and chlorine is stripped off, under vacuum. It is then de-watered using sulfuric acid in a gas cooler. The brine is neutralized, has a reducing agent added to react residual chlorine, and is recycled. Meanwhile, the electrolyzers produce caustic soda, which is concentrated through evaporation, to desired strength. Chlorine is also taken off in a side stream and combined wi"

In order to standardize and simplify the many factors that can potentially occur in an accidental release situation, some of these assumptions may not take into account the available preventive measures or mitigation methods that could diminish or even eliminate the implied risks that are suggested by \"worst-case\" analyses. For that reason, both the results for the standardized \"worse-cases\" defined by the EPA methods and a set of alternative cases which are believed by Holtrachem to more realistically represent situations that may possibly, but rarely, occur within the lifetime of the facility are also presented. The sections of the Risk Management Plan which discuss both worst-case, and alternative cases, are meant to provide the data necessary to develop and evaluate possible improvements in the overall safety programs of the Holtrachem RMP program. \n\n\n\n3.1  Worst-Case Release for Toxic Substances\n\nThe worst-case release scenario, as defined by 40 CFR Part 68, is a sudden release of the maximum amount of a stored regulated substance from a single vessel, regardless of whether several vessels are interconnected.  For toxic gases such as Cl2 stored at ambient temperatures it is assumed that the release occurs over a 10-minute period.  Only passive mitigation (e.g., dikes, enclosures) and administrative controls may be accounted for in the evaluation.\n\nEPA has established \"toxic endpoints\" for various chemicals based on the American Industrial Hygiene Association (ACGIH) Emergency Response Planning Guideline, Level 2 (ERPG-2), which protects individuals from health-threatening or escape-impairing injury.  The ERPG-2 is defined as:\n"

      "SummaryText": "\n\"the maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to 1 hr without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms which could impair an individual's ability to take protective action.\"\n\nGiven that the worst-case is a 10-minute release duration with a 10-minute concentration averaging time, the actual hazard zone is typically overestimated by the ERPG-2. Within such a time period there are a number of emergency measures that can reduce or eliminate exposures to levels this high for an interval much shorter than an hour.\n\nUnder Section 68.22 (e), the RMP rule identifies \"surface roughness\" as a parameter to be specified in the hazard assessment. The surface roughness affects the amount of dispersion that occurs within a released plume and influences the distance to toxic endpoint. The surface roughness used in determining the distance to toxic endpoint should be characteristic of the transport path of the plume from the release point to the endpoint distance.  'Urban' surface roughness indicates areas where there are many obstacles, such as industrial buildings or trees.  'Rural' indicates that there are no buildings in the immediate vicinity of a facility and that the terrain is generally flat and unobstructed. \n\nIn the immediate vicinity of the Holtrachem Riegelwood facility, the aerodynamic surface roughness is clearly 'urban' in nature, whereas at greater distances, the surface roughness is more 'rural'.  In order to report the most conservative 'distance to toxic endpoint' estimates in the Risk Management Plan, Holtrachem has elected to model the worst-case release scenario assuming 'rural' surface conditions. However, it should be noted that under actual conditions, plume dispersion would be enhanced by the 'urban' type surfaces located near the facility, and result in shorter distances to toxic endpoint.\n\nThe EPA's RMP Off-site Consequence Analysis Guidance (19"

The OCAG guidance lists a number of refined dispersion models that are also available for off-site hazard assessment applications for risk management programs.  The molecular weight of chlorine is substantially greater than the ambient air.  For this reason, concentrated plumes of this substance resulting from accidental releases often display heavy-gas behavior.  In such a case, near-field dispersion is dominated by gravitational slumping of the plume and entrainment of air at the plume-air interface.  One of the models listed in the OCAG  commonly used for heavy-gas releases is SLAB.  SLAB, developed by Lawrence Livermore Laboratory, can be utilized to model scenarios that are not directly addressed in the 1999 Revised OCAG.   For these reasons, the OCAG was used to determine the endpoint distance for the worst case release, while SLAB was used to determine the endpoint distances for the more complex alternative release scenarios.\n\nIn accordance with 40 CFR Part 68, the worst-case modeling is conducted assuming a very stable atmosphere with limited dispersion (F stability and 1.5 m/sec wind speed).  Analysis of three years of meteorological data from the National Weather Service in Wilmington, NC, indicates that these dispersion conditions occasionally occur in the area. The windrose based on the three year period 1989-1991 indicates that the most predominant directions of transport are to the northeast and southwest. \n\nThe toxic endpoint for Cl2 is 0.0087 mg/L.  Since the resulting planning zone predicted for the \"worst-case\" Cl2 toxic release potentially affects public receptors, regulated processes at the Holtrachem Riegelwood facility are subject to Program 3 requirements.  40 CFR Part 68 requires that the substance with the largest distance to toxic endpoint be reported in the Worst-Case Release section of the Risk Management Plan. \n\n3.1.1 Worst-"

      "SummaryText": "Case Release: Chlorine\n\nThe worst-case scenario for the Riegelwood facility consists of a 10-minute gaseous ground-level release of 180,000 lbs of stored Cl2, dispersed under atmospheric conditions of F stability and 1.5 m/sec wind speed.  A gaseous release of this magnitude over such a short time-span is physically impossible because the amount of heat energy required to so rapidly vaporize the liquid Cl2 would not be available.  Even if the storage tank were to breach, liquid Cl2 would spill to the ground in a boiling pool.  If a hole were to form in the vapor space of the storage tank, the flashing vapor in the tank would cause the tank to auto-refrigerate, thereby gradually reducing the release rate with time.  The selection of the worst-case release for Cl2 should, therefore, be viewed as a regulatory necessity, rather than a realistic representation of a worst-case release event.\n\nThe modeling results indicated that under 'rural' surface conditions the worst-case Cl2 release would result in a distance to toxic endpoint of greater than 25 miles. The worst-case impact zone encompasses a resident population of approximately 160,000, based on the 1990 Federal Census, and estimated by applying EPA's Landview III program.  Public receptors were identified using 1:24,000 scale U.S.G.S maps, supplemented with comprehensive maps of the local Eddyville area (Rand McNally, 1990, and DeLorme Street Atlas USA, Version 5).   The potential worst-case hazard zone includes schools, hospitals, prisons, public recreation areas, and industrial/commercial areas. Several environmental receptors (defined as National or State parks, forests, officially designated wildlife sanctuaries, preserves, refuges, and federal wilderness areas) are also located within the worst-case impact zone.  The closest environmental receptor is the Moores Creek National Park.  \n\n\n3.2   Alternative Releases of Toxic Substances\n\nAlternative releases are intended to represent release scenarios that have a gr"

Alternative releases do not necessarily represent the types of releases that the PSM hazards analysis and/or accident history indicate would be most frequent, but rather a release that is somewhat more likely than the worst-case release and that generally still has the potential to affect off-site receptors. In accordance with the EPA's OCAG, a single alternative release scenario is reported for each regulated substance. \n\nHoltrachem performed a thorough review of the facility utilizing engineering plans, operational experience, and maintenance records, in order to determine alternative release scenarios that could potentially result in off-site impacts. Each scenario was evaluated and the scenarios most likely to occur and to result in off-site impacts were selected for modeling. In order to determine the most conservative off-site consequence estimates, Holtrachem has chosen to include in the Risk Management Plan the alternative release scenarios that resulted in the greatest toxic endpoint distance for each regulated substance.\n\nIn accordance with the RMP rule, alternative releases are modeled under typical (rather than worst-case) dispersion conditions.  The EPA OCAG default dispersion conditions are neutral atmosphere, with dispersion neither enhanced nor limited (D stability and 3 m/sec wind speed). A review of climatological data for Wilmington, NC, confirmed that these conditions are typical of the area and therefore are suitable for the evaluation of alternative releases. Unlike the worst-case release (for which an instantaneous spill or 10-minute ground-level gas release is assumed), alternative scenarios can account for the actual release configuration, and account for both active and passive mitigation.\n\nAlternative dispersion modeling was conducted using the SLAB dense gas dispersion model.

The modeling indicated that Cl2 would be released at a rate of 1000 lbs/min.  It is conservatively assumed that the Cl2 would then be dispersed as a heavy gas.  Holtrachem has estimated that it would take an operator approximately 10 minutes to respond and shutdown the flow of Cl2, resulting in a total release of 10,000 lbs.  This alternative Cl2 release scenario is expected to be more representative of the maximum anticipated release at the facility than the \"worst-case\".  \n\nThe SLAB modeling indicates that under urban conditions, the distance to toxic endpoint would be 3.8 miles. The hazard impact zone encompasses an estimated residential population of approximately 1400 persons, based on the 1990 Federal Census, and estimated in conjunction with EPA's Landview III database program.  Public receptors in the alternative impact zone include  public recreation areas, schools, and industrial/commercial areas.  No environmental receptors, as defined by the regulation, would be affected.\n\n\n\n\n4.0 ACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\nSome processes subject to the Risk Management Regulation are also subject to Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management Standard (PSM).  PSM governs the same processes and regulated substances at the site that are subject to 40 CFR Part 68.  Holtrachem has a PSM program at the Riegelwood plant that includes the following elements:\n\n- Employee Training and Participation \n\n- Process Safety Information \n\n- Process Hazards Analysis \n\n- Standard Operating Procedures \n\n- Training\n\n- Contractors\n\n- Pre-Startup Safety Review\n\n- Mechanical Integrity\n\n- Safe Work Practices\n\n- Management of Change"

The incident information is reviewed by supervisory staff and a determination is made as to whether a reportable quantity on any chemical listed as requiring reports to regulatory authorities is involved.  If so, the appropriate authorities are promptly notified.\n\nDuring the past 5 years (June 1994 to June 1999), there have been no accidents involving any RMP regulated substance that qualifies for reporting under 40 CFR Part 68. \n\n\n6.0  EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\nEmergency situations at HoltraChem's Riegelwood plant can include fire, chemical release or spill, explosion, bomb threat, and weather emergencies.  The plant has three basic documents which address forseeable emergency situations at the facility and provide appropriate hazard and emergency preparedness information to employees, contractors, emergency response personnel, and the community. The first of these, mindful of the ongoing risks presented by weather emergencies such as tornadoes, is an Emergency Action Plan. This is designed to protect both the plant's operational integrity and the safety of its workers and neighbors from the consequences of weather emergencies.  In regards to chemical releases, HoltraChem has a command structure and specific procedures to handle the unlikely event of a chemical emergency. These procedures cover the following:\n\n* Escape routes for non-involved personnel\n* Emergency shutdown procedures\n* PPE needed\n* Alarm system\n* Accounting for persons at the facility\n* Procedures for various weather emergencies\n* Fire fighting systems\n* Ignition sources and control procedures\n\nA separate document, the Emergency Re"

Both the advanced planning aspects of process design, operating procedures, and emergency preparedness, and the operational elements of system maintenance, safe operating practices and ongoing personnel training are necessary to support a continual improvement in facility safety.  These programs are thoroughly documented so that information about the safe handling of chemicals present at the facility is available to all employees, and can be readily accessed by emergency response team staff and the Incident Commander. This is especially important when questions arise from public safety officials regarding potential risks to the community.  All of these features of the RMP and the integrated risk management program at the Riegelwood plant are intended to protect both the safety of employees and the community.\n\nThese programs which involve operating procedures for the new membrane cell process have not yet been tested, but only because this new portion o"
