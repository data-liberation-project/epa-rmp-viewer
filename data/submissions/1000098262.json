      "SummaryText": "This facility serves as an apple storage and processing plant which operates ammonia refrigeration systems.  The system consists of Engine Rooms with Controlled Atmosphere (CA) rooms and Common Storage rooms.  The type of refrigeration system used is a flooded system, using a pressure regulator to control temperature.  \n\n\n\nThe major ammonia vessels (high-pressure receiver, suction accumulator and liquid transfer unit) are located in each machine room.    Also located in the machine room are the recip and screw compressors, which pull the vapor from the suction accumulator and discharge the vapor to evaporative condensers that are located outside, above the roof of the engine rooms.  \n\n\n\nThe largest vessel in the machine rooms (the high-pressure receivers)can hold the entire system charges of ammonia.  Following standard operating procedures these vessels will never be filled to over 80% full.  However, CPC Intl Apple Co has decided not to use the full capacity (or even 80% full capacity) for the operation of this system. The ammonia is continually circulated throughout a closed system and never held in any one vessel.  \n\n\n\nEach pressure vessel in the mechanical refrigeration process has a safety relief valve attached.  The outlet is piped to an area away from any personnel (the roof).  SRVs are inspected and documented every six months, and replaced every five years. The chances for a leak occurring are reduced because of the following safety systems:  \n\n  Suction trap hi-level float\n\n  High discharge pressure shut down\n\n  Low suction pressure shut down\n\n  High discharge temperature shut down\n\n  Oil pressure failure shut down\n\n  High amperes shut down\n\n  Computer auto timer to prevent short cycling\n\n  Oil filters plugged shut down\n\n  250 psi relief valves on high pressure side\n\n  150 psi relief valves on low pressure side\n\n\n\nAt CPC Intl Apple Co all employees who are involved with ammonia, are trained to understand the safety and health hazards of this refrigerant a"

Each employee is properly trained in:  Understanding SDSs; routine refrigeration system operation; emergency refrigeration system operation; emergency and normal refrigeration safety procedures; and their role in the emergency response plan.  Management has also established a procedure to ensure that contractor and maintenance personnel are trained.\n\n\n\nA comprehensive maintenance and mechanical integrity program covering the equipment and system components is strictly followed.  The mechanical integrity program includes planned maintenance and quality assurance activities to be performed, inspection and testing procedures, training procedures and documentation instructions. \n\n\n\nStandard operating procedures have been written and made available to all employees in the refrigeration department.  The development and use of SOPs are an integral part of CPC Intl's ability to maintain the quality control and quality assurance processes and ensure compliance with governmental regulations.\n\n\n\nCPC Intl Apple Co employees are trained to follow an emergency response plan that moves all employees to an assembly area away from the facility in case of a release of ammonia.  The employees are not trained to respond to releases of hazardous chemicals.  Yakima County Fire Department has a hazmat team that will respond and take control of the situation should a release occur.  CPC Intl has provided the fire department with a copy of their Emergency Response Plan and given a tour of the facility.  \n\n\n\n   \n\n "
