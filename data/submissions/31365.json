A combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs is used to ensure the safety of  employees and the public as well as the protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that  have been designed and implemented, including:\n\nl    A description of the facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulation\nl    A summary of results from our assessment of the potential offsite consequences from accidental chemical releases\nl    An overview of accidental release prevention programs\nl    A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule\nl    An overview of the emergency response program\nl    An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring\n                      and adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment\nl    The certifications that EPA's RMP rule requires us to provide\nl    The detailed information (called data elements) about the risk management program\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Jacksonville facility produces aroma and flavor chemicals using a variety of chemicals and processing operations.  The facility consists of 54 acres in a predominantly residential and commercial neighborhood. The main processes are distillation and catalytic reactions. The chemical in use  that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release, are as follows:\n\nToxics\n\nNone, although Ammonia and Anhydrous Hydrogen Chloride are present at the site, the quantities do not exceed the threshold es"
