The District provides treated drinking water to approximately 6000 taps for\ncustomers in a service area of approximately 130 square miles in portions of unincorporated \nBoulder and Weld counties in Colorado.\n     Surface water from Left Hand Creek and the Boulder Feeder Canal (Colorado-Big\nThompson Project water) is treated at the Dodd Plant during the months of April through\nOctober.  During the months of November through March the plant is taken out of service when\nthe Boulder feeder canal is de-watered for the winter.\n     Chlorine is added to the water at the plant as a disinfectant and to oxidize iron and\nmanganese for removal from the water during the filtration process.  \n     Chlorine gas is delivered to the plant and placed in the chlorine storage and containment\nroom in 2000 pound containers.  This room is designed to contain any chlorine gas in the event of\na  container or pipe leak.  An R. J. Environmental Chlorine Vapor Scrubber System is in place to prevent chlorine gas emissions from being exhausted to the atmosphere.  Chlorine gas detectors constantly test the air in the room for any chlorine gas.  If chlorine gas is detected, an alarm is activated and the scrubber is automatically started.  The scrubber pulls air from the room and removes any chlorine from it before exhausting it to the atmosphere.  An alarm sounds in the plant control room and also sends out pages to all plant operators for immediate response.\n     The Dodd Water Treatment Plant has never had a reportable release of chlorine gas.  This\nis due in a large part to the priority that the District places on safety.  All of our plant personnel\nhave received training and have been tested in their knowledge of safe chlorine handling and\nemergency response.  We follow written procedures w"

The chlorine\nsystem at the Dodd plant was recently upgraded with all new equipment, piping, and gas feed\ntubing.   \n     In addition to these safety features, the chlorine feed equipment is maintained in excellent\ncondition, inspected on a regular basis, and repaired immediately if a problem is found.  We have\nwritten procedures for emergencies, and the operators are trained to respond to emergencies. \nA list is kept up to date of phone numbers and addresses of all residences within the worst case\nscenario circle for quick notification and evacuation if needed.
