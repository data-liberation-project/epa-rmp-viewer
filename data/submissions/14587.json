The plant superintendent is Ann MacDonald.  The daytime number to reach her is 1-219-926-1032, and the twenty-four(24)  hour number is 1-219-928-7085.\n This plant is a 2.7MGD publicly owned wastewater treatment plant.  The effluent is chlorinated for disinfection.  There are two (2), one (1) ton containers of chlorine on site.  The system is maintained to reduce the chance of a chemical release.  Annually the maintenance department takes the manifolds apart to inspect them for corrosion.  The plumbing is inspected and replaced if needed.  The staff reviews the safety aspects of chlorination and the operation of the chlorination system.  The process is a standard one and it has not changed for several years.  There have been no chemical releases in the thirty-six year plant history.  We realize that does not guarentee that a release will never occur.    \nThe emergency response is handled by the Porter County, IN emergency response team.  In conjunction with them the Porter and Chesterton fire and police departments will work together to evacuate the area and handle the situation until the hazardous materials team arrives.   The plant is surrounded by residential areas, recreation areas, and a business district.  There is a train track directly behind the plant within several hundred feet of the chlorine storage area.  There is another set of tracks nearby.  There is also an expressway, 80/94 and a highway, state highway 20.  Within the worst case scenario area are three schools.  Chesterton High School, Yost Elementary, and Saint Patricks Catholic School.  The business districts of Chesterton and Porter are also in the worst case area.  The emerge"
