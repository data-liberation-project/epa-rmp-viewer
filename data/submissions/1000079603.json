Training is conducted to ensure the proper use of emergency response equipment, such as fire-fighting equipment.  Employees are assigned specific roles that they would fill in the event of an emergency, and all employees receive specific training to enable them to fulfill their roles in an emergency.  The incident response plan is updated when necessary based on legal requirements and modifications made to plant processes.\n\nThe overall incident response program for the San Juan Basin Gas Plant is coordinated with the San Juan County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives.  This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee to review incident response plans and facilitate communications and planning.  The San Juan Basin Gas Plant has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department).  This provides a method for notifying the public in the event of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.  In addition to periodic LEPC meetings, the San Juan Basin Gas Plant conducts periodic emergency response drills that involve the LEPC and emergency response organizations.  \n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nRather than implement improvements in an ad hoc manner, the San Juan Basin Gas Plant has processes in place that are employed to improve safety on a continuing and ongoing basis, to ensure that the safety programs are continuously improved.

The following is a description of existing safety features in place to prevent accidental releases of regulated substances at the facility.\n\nUniversal Prevention Activities\n\nThe Risk Management Program summarized above is applied throughout the San Juan Basin Gas Plant. Collectively, these prevention program activities work to prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures or human errors.\n\nSpecialized Safety Features\n\nThe San Juan Basin Gas Plant has safety features throughout the facility to: \n\n* Contain/control a release.\n* Quickly detect a release.\n* Reduce the consequences of a release in the unlikely event of an accidental release.\n\nThe following types of safety features are used in the plant's processes:\n\nRelease Detection, including:\n\n* Hydrocarbon gas detectors with alarms\n\nRelease Containment/Control, including:\n\n1. Process relief valves that discharge to a flare system to contain and incinerate releases;\n2. Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated);\n3. Automated shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high pressure or temperature);\n4. Curbing or diking to contain liquid releases;\n5.

The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and underlying cause(s) of the incident to develop corrective actions and implement steps to prevent a recurrence of the incident and prevent similar incidents.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent similar incidents, and forwards these results to management for further action. Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are fully implemented.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected.

The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure before startup of the modified process or unit that the modification was completed in accordance with design specifications.  The PSSR is also intended to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are properly prepared for startup before the modified equipment is put in service.  Another key purpose of the PSSRs is to ensure that all personnel have been trained on the modification, including any revisions to the operating procedures or to the safety systems and controls.  This review provides one additional check to make sure that all personnel and supporting systems are operationally ready to operate the newly-modified process or equipment.  The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction, and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention, Process Safety Management Program, and Risk Management Program requirements are properly implemented.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe San Juan Basin Gas Plant has well-established practices and procedures to maintain process equipment in a safe operating condition.  This mechanical integrity program includes pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps, compressors, and emergency shutdown systems, among other items.

Each contract employee is provided an orientation on the known potential fire, explosion, or release hazards related to the contractor's work and the process, as well as the applicable provisions of the incident response plan.  \n\nManagement of Change (MOC)\n\nThroughout the life of any operating facility, changes will often be necessary -- for example, to meet changing circumstances, to make needed improvements, or to alter the technology of the process.  The San Juan Basin Gas Plant has a comprehensive system in place to manage and document any such changes to the plant's processes.  This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, or other changes be properly reviewed and authorized by a number of people with different functional expertise before being implemented.  This system of managing facility modifications is called Management of Change (MOC).  This system consists of a set of written procedures that are used to identify and eliminate hazards associated with a change to the facility's processes.  MOC ensures that facility modifications are formally reviewed and approved before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been negatively affected by the change.  A part of the MOC process ensures that any chemical hazard information, process operating limits, equipment information, and/or procedures are updated as appropriate to incorporate the effects of the modification.

These assumptions are required without regard to whether a scenario is realistic or improbable.  The EPBC (Ethane-Propane-Butane-Condensate) Mix was used in the model for the hypothetical worst-case flammable scenario.  The worst-case scenario was modeled on the assumption of the instantaneous release of all of the EPBC in the largest EPBC vessel. Under the stipulated guidelines, this hypothetical release, if ignited, would have an off-site impact, as determined by the use of the OCA Guidance.  [Note: The OCA Guidance is EPA's Off-Site Consequence Analysis Guidance document.]\n\nPassive mitigation systems were not applied because of the assumption for the scenario that the entire contents of the vessel be instantaneously released.  We believe that a vessel failure such as this is extremely unlikely because the vessels are carefully designed with significant engineering safety factors.  In addition, all pressure vessels are carefully inspected and pressure tested before they are placed in service, and the San Juan Basin Gas Plant follows a rigorous Mechanical Integrity Program to ensure that all process equipment is properly maintained and inspected, to prevent leakage or failure.\n\nALTERNATIVE FLAMMABLE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nThe RMP regulations require the operator to model a single alternative release scenario for all regulated flammable substances.  For the San Juan Basin Gas Plant, this hypothetical scenario was modeled on the basis of a seal failure on a pump, which was assumed to last for five minutes.  \n\nPassive mitigation systems such as leak detection, gas detection, and emergency shutdown systems would enable the plant to isolate and eliminate such a release within that time-frame.
