              "Description": "The wastewater treatment process at this facility utilizes two regulated toxic substances - chlorine and sulfur dioxide.    The Safety Section of the prevention program addresses both chlorine and sulfur dioxide safety.  Material Safety Data Sheets for both substances are included.\n\nAlan Plummer Associates, Inc. performed the hazard review on December 15, 1998.  The latest review was in May 2009.  The hazard review covered both chlorine and sulfur dioxide.  Safeguards for both were found to be similar.  The recommendations that resulted from the Hazard Review generally apply to both substances.  The Hazard Review demonstrated that the City's risk management program for regulated substances is excellent.  Many of the recommendations that resulted from the Hazard Review are procedural in nature.  Actions taken as a result of the 1998 hazard review include enclosing chlorine and sulfur dioxide storage areas in separate rooms in a new chemical building and installing an emergency gas scrubber to mitigate chlorine or sulfur dioxide leaks.  Other actions resulting from the 1998 hazard review were development and presentation of a two-day RMP training course and video and increased documentation of various training activities. The latest training course was in May 2011.\n\nThe Operations, Maintenance, and Training elements of the Prevention Program have been addressed, as a result of the Hazard Review, through development of a single Procedures Manual.  This manual provides single source of information for most of the day to day aspects of operating the chlorine and sulfur dioxide systems for the facility.  Inspection and testing of the chlorine and sulfur dioxide systems were formalized through the Procedures Manual.  Inspections of equipment, corrective action, and preventive maintenance program are all included in procedures followed by the City.  The Procedures Manual was updated in July 2011.\n\nRisk Management Program Compliance Audit were performed in May 2009 and July 2011.  All significant findings of these Audit have been addressed.\n\nThe incident investigation element of the Prevention Program was addressed by including a form to be completed should an accidental release of chlorine or sulfur dioxide occur.  Also included are instructions for developing a team to investigate an incident, should one occur.  To date no reportable accidents have occurred.",

The facility is owned and operated by the City of Garland.  This wastewater treatment plant uses chlorine and sulfur dioxide as part of the treatment process.  Currently, a maximum of 32,000 pounds of chlorine and 18,000 pounds of sulfur dioxide are maintained on the site.  No other toxic or flammable substances, as listed in 40 CFR 68, are stored or utilized at the facility.\n\n\n\nSafety Policies:\n\nThe City of Garland is fully committed to safety at the wastewater treatment plant.  The City recognizes the importance of safety in storing and using regulated toxic substances and has used the 40 CFR 68 requirements to further refine its program.  The City has also used this opportunity to strengthen its emergency response procedures between the plant and the Garland Fire Department.  The Fire Department is capable of responding to accidental releases of chlorine or sulfur dioxide, should a release occur.  Finally, the City is committed to continuing to improve its risk management program for chlorine and sulfur dioxide at the Rowlett Creek WWTP.\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History:\n\nThe City's commitment to managing risks associated with chlorine and sulfur dioxide is demonstrated by its excellent track record with these substances.  The Rowlett Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant has not experienced an accident related to chlorine or sulfur dioxide within the past five years or at any time.\n\n\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis:\n\nAir dispersion modeling for both chlorine and sulfur dioxide was updated in October 2012.  This modeling produced the same radius of impact for both substances for the worst-case scenario.  Public receptors including residences and major commercial/business/industrial buildings are located within the worst-case radius.  As required by the risk management regulations, the offsite consequence analysis also developed alternative-"

An alternative scenario involving a scrubber malfunction resulted in a 0.68 mile radius of impact.  These radiu of impact are useful tools for emergency response teams in planning for and responding to emergency situations.\n\n\n\nPrevention Program Description:\n\nThe City's prevention program represents the core of the day-to-day means by which accidental releases of regulated substances into the air are minimized.  This component is used primarily by plant personnel responsible for the operation and maintenance of regulated processes at the facility.  The prevention program has become a useful tool in ongoing training of plant personnel.\n\n\n\nThe Prevention Program includes seven  primary components:\n\n\n\n*Safety Information:  Up-to-date safety information has been compiled relating to regulated substances, processes, and equipment.  Safety information will also be updated any time a major change occurs that would make the safety information inaccurate.\n\n\n\n*Hazard Review:  Regulated processes at the facility have been reviewed to identify potential hazards.  The results have been documented in a hazard review report.  Problems identified by the hazard review have been resolved in a timely manner.\n\n\n\n*Operating Procedures:  Written operating procedures have been prepared providing instructions for safely conducting activities associated with regulated processes.  These procedures have been updated to account for a revent major change in the handling or storage of regulated substances.\n\n\n\n*Training:  Plant personnel responsible for operating regulated processes receive training in thr processes.  Periodic refresher training is required.\n\n\n\n*Maintenance:  Procedures have been implemented to ensure that the mechanical integrity of the process equipment is maintained.

Process equipment for regulated substance processes is inspected and tested on a regular basis.\n\n\n\n*Compliance Audits:  The prevention program must be audited at least once every three years to evaluate compliance with risk management rules.  The initial audit was conducted in June 2002 and deficiencies have been addressed. Most recent audits were in May 2009 and February 2011.\n\n\n\n*Incident Investigation:  Should an accident involving a release, or near release, of a regulated substance occur, it will be investigated promptly.  The findings of any such incident investigation will be used to improve the safety process.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program:\n\nThe City of Garland has determined that the Rowlett Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant  will assume a non-responder status with respect to accidental releases of chlorine or sulfur dioxide.  The Garland Fire Department will instead be the appropriate local emergency response agency in such cases.  The Garland Fire Department has the necessary training to respond to chlorine and sulfur dioxide leaks.  Rowlett Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant personnel have coordinated with the Fire Department to ensure that the facility is included in the community emergency response plan regarding response to a potential release.\n\n\n\nThe facility's employees have a significant role in the event of a release of chlorine or sulfur dioxide.  Should a release occur or be suspected, employees responsible for working with chlorine and sulfur dioxide will follow procedures for assessing the situation and attempting to safely stop the release using normal shutdown procedures.  Facility personnel receive ongoing training in identification of potential releases, and in how to determine when emergency response personnel should be involved.\n\n\n\nRowlett Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant will continue to work closely with the Fire Department to ensure that emergency response, should it become necessary, is efficiently and safely carri"
