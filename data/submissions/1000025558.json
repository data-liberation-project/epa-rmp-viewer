EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 68.155\n\nThe City of Atlantic Beach Public Works Department operates the City of Atlantic Beach Wastewater Treatment Plant # 2 located at 739 Renault Drive, Atlantic Beach, Duval County, Florida.  This plant is one of six water and wastewater plants operated by the City.  Wastewater Treatment plant # 2 and four other plants have quantities of regulated hazardous chemicals above the EPA threshold.  The City has a unified Risk Management Program which applies to each plant.  Only Wastewater Treatment Plant # 2 operations and policies are presented in this Plan.\n\n1.1. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES     (a)\n\nThe City of Atlantic Beach, Florida Wastewater Treatment Plant # 2 accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures and management practices.  Our prevention program complies with all applicable procedures of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) 40 CFR-68, Prevention Program.\n\n1.1.1. MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (a) (1)\n\nThe City of Atlantic Beach has a management system in place which is led by the Utilities Director, which oversees the implementation and on-going use of the RMP elements.  This program, along with other City wide and plant specific policies, eliminates and /or reduces the likelihood of a hazardous chemical release at the plant.\n\n1.1.2.    PREVENTION PROGRAM LEVEL 2 (a) (2)\n\nThe City of Atlantic Beach maintains policies, procedures and systems as part of their prevention program.  These are applied to each treatment plant and specifically Wastewater Treatment Plant # 2.

Chlorine and sulfur dioxide are used as part of the treatment process. \n\n1.2.1. SITE DESCRIPTION (b) (1)\n\nThe site is owned and operated by The City of Atlantic Beach.  The site is located at 739 Renault Drive, Atlantic Beach, Duval County, Florida.  The site is boarded by Mayport Road on the east, Regulus Road on the west, Renault Drive on the south and Wonderwood Road on the north.\n\nThe Plant includes a chlorine and sulfur dioxide storage and distribution system contained in a specially designed storage and process building. The boundaries of the chlorine and sulfur dioxide system subject to the RMP regulation include the Bulk Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide Storage and Feed Control rooms and the associated vent make up and exhaust systems.  These are detailed in the Process and Instrument Drawings (P&ID) which are part of the plant Process Safety Information (PSI).\n\n1.2.2. REGULATED SUBSTANCE (b) (2)\n\nChlorine and sulfur dioxide are the two regulated substances on site which exceed the EPA 40 CFR-68 rule threshold quantity.  The City of Atlantic Beach chlorine and dechlorination processes were installed as part of the process of treating wastewater to make it meet strict FDEP discharge permit requirements.  It operates under permit from the State of Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP).  The chlorine and sulfur dioxide are received, stored and distributed to two process control systems. \n\nChlorine is an EPA and OSHA-listed toxic chemical.  It is an irritant and it is corrosive.  Chlorine is a halogen with the formula Cl2.  It is a chlorinating or oxidizing agent that is not flammable.  It has a 1 ppm OSHA ceiling Permissible Exposure Limit (PEL) and a NFPA health rating of 4, severe; with immediate and delayed health hazards.  Chlorine is not a carcinogen.\n\nSulfur"

It is a dechlorinating or oxidizing agent that is not flammable.  It has a 5 ppm OSHA Permissible Exposure Limit (PEL) and a NFPA health rating of 4, severe; with immediate and delayed health hazards.  Sulfur dioxide is not a carcinogen.\n\n1.3. WORST AND ALTERNATIVE CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS (c)\n\nTwo offsite consequence analyses were conducted for each regulated substances which include two chlorine and two sulfur dioxide release scenarios.  The first is a worst case release.  The second is a more probable, but unlikely alternative release scenario.  The first scenario is defined by EPA, which states that the worst case scenario; shall assume that the maximum quantity in the largest vessel is released as a gas over 10 minutes due to an unspecified failure.  The alternative scenario is defined as a more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario.\n\nAtmospheric dispersion assessment was performed to determine the distance traveled by the chlorine and sulfur dioxide released before its concentration decreases to the toxic endpoint.  The EPA selected endpoint for chlorine and sulfur dioxide is 0.0087 mg/l which equals 3 ppm. The 3 ppm endpoint is the Emergency Response Planning Guideline Level 2 (ERPG-2).  This is defined by the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) as the a maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms which could impair an individual's ability to take protective action.  The residential population within a circle with a radius corresponding to the toxic endpoint distance was defined, to estimate the population potentially affected.\n\n1.3.1.

The residential population that could potentially be affected by the release is estimated at __people.\n\n1.3.2.    ALTERNATIVE CASE   (c) (2)\n\nThe alternative release scenario for each regulated substance involves the failure of the yoke assembly regulator of the pressure system connected to one of the one ton-containers. This failure is equal to creating a 1/16 inch diameter hole in the yoke assembly, the drip tube, a pipe, or even the container.  Modeling using the EPA wastewater guidance demonstrated the rate of chlorine or sulfur dioxide release is 20.0lbs/min.  The toxic endpoint distances determined is ___ miles.  The residential population potentially that would be impacted by this release is ___.\n\n1.4.    ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM (d)\n\nThe City of Atlantic Beach accidental release prevention program is based on similar elements as the OSHA PSM Prevention Program; however, being a public entity, COAB is subject to only the EPA's RMP Level 2 prevention program.  A Prevention Program has been in place and effectively used.  It is part of the plants operating culture.  There are two parts to the program.  The first is the general overall City wide and Wastewater Treatment Plant # 2 site program.  The second is the chlorine and sulfur dioxide-specific actions within the site program.  \n\n1.4.1.    GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM   (d) (1)\n\nPlant-wide, many elements of the prevention program are used for all operations. The overviews of these programs are listed below:\n\n1) The City of Atlantic Beach has detailed process safety information on each of its operations. \n\n2) The DMS, document maintenance system, is integral to the management of change for all operations on site control.  \n\n3) Training is the backbone of employee knowledge, job operations and is ongoing in each area.
