The resources invested in the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances demonstrate this commitment.  The Monett City Utilities Water System implements reasonable controls, such as training of personnel and the safe design, installation, operation and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to make every effort to prevent the release of hazardous substances but in the event of a release, our trained personnel and local emergency response agencies will respond to control and contain the release in a manner that will be safe for workers and will help prevent injuries to the public or the environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.0    Description of The Monett City Utilities Water System and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nThe Monett City Utilities Water System handles one substance regulated by the Risk Management Plan Rule (RMP Rule) in quantities above the Threshold Quantity.  This substance is:\n\n\n\n* Chlorine - stored in 150 pound cylinders at the Monett City Utilities Wastewater Treatment Facility and transported and used for disinfection of water at the city well sites prior to distribution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.0    Hazard Assessment\n\n \n\nThe RMP Rule requires The Monett City Utilities Water System to perform a Hazard Assessment of the regulated substances stored in the covered process at the facility.  This Hazard Assessment includes an offsite consequence analysis for the following scenarios:\n\n \n\n* One worst-case and one alternative release scenario for the toxic substance chlorine for the chlorination process unit at the facility.\n\n\n\nThe Monett City Utilities Water System completed a Hazard Assessment for the covered process and the results have been appropriately communicated to the local emergency respon"

The Hazard Assessment has been recently updated to reflect changes in population.\n\n\n\n\n\n4.0    Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nThe RMP Rule requires that a prevention program be established for The Monett City Utilities Water System chlorine storage area.  In accordance with RMP Rule General Duty Clause, we have also included each of the well sites in this program. The following details the prevention program elements at The Monett City Utilities Water System that apply to these processes.\n\n\n\n4.1    Safety Information\n\n\n\nThe Monett City Utilities Water System maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to help ensure safe operation of The Monett City Utilities Water System processes.  Material safety data sheets (MSDSs) document the physical and chemical properties of hazardous substances handled at The Monett City Utilities Water System, including the chlorine in the covered process.  The engineering design documents include the operating parameters, the design basis and configuration of the equipment in each covered process, and references to applicable codes and standards.\n\n\n\n\n\n4.2    Hazard Review\n\n\n\nThe Monett City Utilities Water System performs and periodically updates hazard reviews of the covered processes to help identify and control process hazards.  Checklists are used to guide the hazard review.  These checklists include items to help ensure The Monett City Utilities Water System operates and maintains the equipment in a manner consistent with the applicable design specifications, codes, standards, and regulations.\n\n\n\n4.3    Operating Procedures\n\n\n\nThe Monett City Utilities Water System develops and maintains operating procedures to define how tasks related to process operations should be performed.  The operating procedures are used to:\n\n\n\n1. train employees and contractors, and\n\n2. serve as reference guides for appropriate actions to take during both normal and abnormal process conditions.\n\n"
