Improvements are identified and implemented throughout the facility's planning and operating cycles.  The employees at Hopewell are committed to the safe and reliable operation of the plant in a manner that safeguards life, health, property and the environment. The process safety and risk management initiatives are implemented as proactive approaches to minimize the potential for accidental releases.  \n\n\n\nEach of the five chemicals on the EPA list at Hopewell has been evaluated based on the EPA's guidelines.  Specific information related to each chemical is supplied in our risk management plan, available from the EPA.  Hopewell has numerous safety devices to prevent and/or reduce the chance of a release occurring.  Examples of these devices include:\n\n?    Remote operated shutoff valves\n\n?    Remote detectors\n\n?    Continuous monitoring \n\n?    Containment dikes \n\n\n\n    Hopewell has established specific guidelines and procedures for compiling and maintaining written information for the chemical processes we operate.  Specific responsibilities for maintaining this process safety information have been identified and assigned to qualified individuals.  The plant's hazard communication program communicates the health and environmental effects of chemicals to our employees.  We also maintain comprehensive evaluations of the process chemistry and operating conditions of our processes.\n\n    \n\n    Each chemical process is analyzed utilizing a method designed to identify, prevent and minimize the effects of hazards such as fire, chemical release and e"

The process safety analysis approach is applied to major modifications and also to minor operating changes.  We review the process hazard analyses on a continuing 5-year cycle so that we can maintain the safety of our processes.  Each PHA uses appropriate methodology to analyze potential hazards and their effects and provides for timely resolution of recommendations.\n\n    \n\n    Written operating procedures are structured to cover the significant aspects of plant operation including startup, shutdown, normal operations, upset conditions and emergency response. Each operating area of Hopewell has specific operating procedures developed by people knowledgeable in the operation of that area, the operators and area supervisors.\n\n\n\n    Besides standard operating procedures, Hopewell has developed training materials to support the development of individuals into trained and qualified process operators.  These training materials have been developed by the operators themselves and include their knowledge from years of on-the-job service.  The training program is supported with computer based training modules as well as hands-on training by qualified area trainers. Operators are trained on computers that simulate real-life plant situations before they can qualify to work in the operating areas of the plant.  Hopewell operators are required to complete a three-year training program before becoming fully qualified.\n\n    \n\n    Mechanical integrity of plant equipment is another way Hopewell reduces the probability and consequences of potential releases.  On-going inspection programs are a key part of maintaining the mechanical integrity of the process equipment.  Guidelines and procedures have been developed and are followed by people performing the inspections.

Hopewell has notified the US EPA regarding this event.  \n\n\n\n(a)    On June 8, 2016, an oleum release occurred from a section of transfer piping during the unloading of an oleum railcar in the Sulfuric Acid Production area.  The Hopewell site immediately notified local authorities and industrial neighbors of the event while activating our internal Shelter-in-Place plan.  The released liquid was contained on-site; however, some vapors being released from the material did cross the facility boundary going towards an industrial neighbor.  The City of Hopewell did not initiate a Shelter-in-Place for the community; however, a voluntary Shelter-in-Place was activated by the industrial neighbor as a precautionary measure.  Railcar transfer shutdown and system isolation measures were initiated by onsite personnel keeping the duration of the release to approximately six (6) minutes.   Four (4) contractors working at the industrial neighbor's facility were exposed to some of the vapors but no known off-site injury was noted as they were evaluated and released without receiving any medical treatment.\n\n\n\n\n\n(5)  Emergency Response Plan:\n\n\n\nIt is the policy of AdvanSix and Hopewell to operate a safe and environmentally sound facility by identifying and controlling health, safety "

By designing its processes to protect people, property and the environment and by conducting and regularly reviewing and improving processes and programs, Hopewell has an active prevention strategy for its chemical processes. Chemical risk management involves the integration of safety devices and technologies inherent in the design of the process, safe operational procedures and management practices, operator training, emergency response planning, maintenance of process and emergency response equipment, coordination of resources and plans with the local and state emergency services and communication with the community.\n\n\n\nThe plan is designed to alert employees by an audible alarm system and as the situation dictates, notify the community through the local police and fire departments.  Evacuation procedures are included in the emergency response plan.  Communication is provided through a specialized radio service, where Hopewell can review the situation and coordinate directly with other emergency response agencies.  Direct 2-way radio links are in place to quickly notify local school systems and media sources.  \n\n\n\nHopewell has its own emergency response brigade made up of approximately 80 trained, qualified, certified emergency response individuals.  These responders receive additional training in chemical plant emergency response and many have been trained at nationally known emergency response schools in Texas and Nevada.  These plans and responses to incidents are tested annually through drills involving the brigade and local police, fire, rescue and other emergency service personnel. The brigade receives periodic training e.g., tabletop drills and hands-on exercises, throughout the year. \n\n\n\n(6) Planned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\n\n\nHopewell strives to continually improve process safety at the site.
