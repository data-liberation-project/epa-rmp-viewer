              "Description": "PREVENTION PROGRAM FOR THE CHLORINE PROCESS\n\nChlorine is the most common oxidant used in water treatment.  Illinois American Water uses chlorine from pressurized metal cylinders.  Chlorine is added to water by evaporating chlorine liquid to gas, metering the gas into water through an injector and then diffusing the solution into the flow stream at the point of application.\n\nIllinois American Water's prevention program for this process consists of a Management System, Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Contractor Safety, Management of Change, Pre-Startup Safety Review, Mechanical Integrity, Safe Work Practices, Incident Investigation, Emergency Planning, Compliance Audits and Training.  An explanation follows:\n\nManagement System- The purpose of the management system is to ensure that employees are involved in the development, implementation, and maintenance of the RMP/PSM Program and understand their roles and responsibilities and that responsibility is assigned for all elements of the program.\n\nProcess Safety Information- Process safety information is developed and maintained in a format that provides easy access by employees and auditors.  Information on the hazards of chlorine, feed process technology and process equipment is kept up to date.\n\nProcess hazard Analysis- A \"What-if\" process hazard analysis is performed to evaluate and control the risks associated with chlorine feed process hazards.  The overall purpose of the PHA is to prevent or minimize the effects of a chemical release.  \n\nOperating Procedures-  Operating procedures are required for all stages of system operation.  Illinois American Water maintains up-to-date, accurate written procedures that provide clear instructions for safely conducting activities involved in the chlorine feed process.\n\nContractor Safety-  Only contractors with safe work histories and safety and health programs are selected to perform work on or around chlorine system.\n\nManagement of Change/Pre-Startup Reviews-  This portion of the prevention program ensures that process changes and new systems are ready to operate safely in accordance with the original or new system design.\n\nMechanical Integrity-  This portion of the program addresses the following:\n* Critical equipment\n* Inspection schedules\n* Maintenance training\n* Maintenance documentation\n\nEquipment involved in the process is listed below:\n* Piping/Valves\n* Pressure relief devices\n* Vacuum regulators\n* Injectors\n* Chlorine detectors\n\n\n\n\nSafe Work Practices-  Company employees, contractor employees and visitors must adhere to all safety rules and procedures.  Some of the safe work practices utilized in the maintenance/operation of the chlorine feed process are as follows:\n\n* Hot Work Permit\n* Lockout/Tagout\n* Line opening Procedures\n* Plant Security- Sign In/ Sign Out\n* Confined Space",

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY/RMP SUBMIT\n\n14.1 CORPORATE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE APPROACHES\n\nAt this facility, Illinois American Water handles chlorine for the purpose of disinfecting and treating drinking water.  OSHA and EPA consider chlorine a hazardous chemical.  The hazards of chlorine make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in the use and handling to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is Illinois American Water's policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State rules and regulations.  Safety depends on the manner chlorine is handled and used, combined with the safety devices inherent in the design along with operating procedures and the training of our personnel.\n\nOur emergency action plan is based upon OSHA 1910.38 (Employee Emergency Plans)  1910.120 (Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response) and experience obtained from community drills.\n\n14.2 THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n??A???A? The maximum amount of chlorine stored at this location is 14,000 pounds.\n??A???A? The chlorine is delivered by truck in one-ton cylinders.  Liquid chlorine is added to water by evaporating chlorine liquid to gas, metering the gas through an injector, and then diffusing the gas into the flow stream of water at the point of application.\n\n14.3 THE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND THE SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n??A???A? This facility and process uses design codes and standards from the Chlorine Institute, Wallace and Tierman Manuals, American National Standards Institute, American Society for Testing and Materials, and applicable state codes and regulations.\n\n14.4 FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n??A???A?  We have had no accidental releases of chlorine in the past five years.\n\n14.5 THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n??A???A? The written emergency response program as mentioned in the openi"
