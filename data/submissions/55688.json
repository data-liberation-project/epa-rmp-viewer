      "SummaryText": "The City of Gallatin, Department of Public Utilities owns and operates a Wastewater Treatment Plant in Gallatin, Tennessee.  This plant uses chlorine for the disinfection of treated wastewater prior to discharge; this chemical is classified as an extremely hazardous chemical by the USEPA and OSHA.  The same properties that make chlorine excellent for disinfecting treated wastewater, also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions to protect the health and safety of our employees, the members of our community, and the environment.  This Risk Management Plan was developed to help prevent the accidental release of extremely hazardous chemicals and/or to minimize the impacts of of an accidental release.  The City of Gallatin - Department of Public Utilities is committed to complying with these regulations, thereby reducing the risks to our employees and our community.\n\nThis facility is undergoing a $25 million expansion project, which will include the installation of a UV disinfection system to replace the chlorine system currently un use.  It is anticipated that the chlorine system will be removed from service in the next 18-24 months."
