      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY - NORTH LOVING REGIONAL OIL TREATMENT FACILITY (N. LOVING ROTF)\r\nThe N. Loving ROTF is committed to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will evaluate the situation, take actions within the capabilities of the facility, and notify the necessary outside agencies.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\nThe North Loving ROTF will process up to 133,800 barrels of oil per day (BOPD) on an annual average basis. Oil enters the site through the inlet gathering line, and is heated by one of the four (4) line heaters  before going through the inlet surge vessel. The gas from the inlet surge vessel is sent to the overhead compressor header where it is combined with the gas from the 3-phase separator and the reflux accumulator before being compressed in one of the five (5) electric driven booster compressor units.  The compressed gas is then separated from Natural Gas Liquids (NGL) in the compressor scrubber. The NGL exiting the compressor scrubber is sent through a NGL stabilizing tower. Gas and NGL each exit the facility via sales pipelines.\r\n\r\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\nThe N. Loving ROTF is a newly constructed facility. There have been no accidents within the past 5 years.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\r\nThe N. Loving ROTF is a non-responding facility. The facility maintains a written emergency response plan, which has been written in accordance with OSHA PSM requirements. The plan identifies steps to be taken in case of an accidental release including: proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evac"
