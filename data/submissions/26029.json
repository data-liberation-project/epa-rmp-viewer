ACCESS TO THE SITE IS RESTRICTED TO AUTHORIZED FACILITY  EMPLOYEES, AUTHORIZED MGT PERSONNEL AND AUTHORIZED CONTRACTORS. \n\nTHE MAXIMUM QUANTITY OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA THAT CAN BE STORED WOULD BE 132,000 POUNDS. THIS INCLUDES ANHYDROUS AMMONIA THAT COULD BE STORED IN NURSE TANKS.\n\n\n3.  THE WORSE-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO.\n\nTHE WORSE CASE RELEASE SCENARIO WOULD BE THE RELEASE OF THE TOTAL CONTENTS OF A STORAGE TANK RELEASED AS A GAS OVER 10 MINUTES.  THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY RELEASED WOULD BE  56,000   POUNDS, WICH REPRESENT THE VOLUME OF THE LARGEST STORAGE TANK AS LIMITED BY DESIGN STANDARDS.\n\nTHE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT OF .14 MG/L FOR THE WORST-CASE SCENARIO IS .74 MILES.\n\nTHE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO BASED ON THE MOST LIKELY POTENTIAL INCIDENT IS A RELEASE FROM A BREAK IN A TRANSFER HOSE.
