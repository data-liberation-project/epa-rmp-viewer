The properties which make ammonia valuable as a refrigerant also necessitate certain safety precautions.  Quality Pork International strives to protect all its valuable resources and assets -both personnel and property.  We live and have families in this community.  We want to prevent exposure to all our personnel as well as nearby members of our community, existing natural resources, and the surrounding environment.  It is our policy to comply with Federal, State, and Local regulations.  Through continual, accurate training and various safety devices and procedures, we work to minimize potential releases.\r\n\r\n2.\tOUR FACILITY AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCE HANDLED\r\n\r\nQuality Pork International, Inc. (QPI) is a privately owned pork processing facility.  We utilize anhydrous ammonia as the primary means for refrigeration, cooling and freezing.  A nationally recognized, reputable and professional ammonia delivery company is used to fill our main receiver tank.  Steel piping then carries the ammonia to the needed refrigeration, cooling or freezing units.  Access to the site is restricted to facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.\r\n\r\nThe regulated substance used at QPI in West Point, NE is anhydrous ammonia (NH3).  We currently have 21,345 pounds of NH3 at our facility.\r\n\r\n3.\tWORST CASE SCENARIO AND ALTERNATIVE CASE SCENARIO\r\n\r\nThe worst case release scenario would be failure of the high pressure receiver releasing 21,345 lbs of ammonia (the entire charge) for duration of ten minutes. Under worst-case weather conditions, ammonia could travel 1.75 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public."

For the release of gas we found the distance to the endpoint to be 0.2 miles.  The scenario of an alternative case ammonia release is unlikely due to the following reasons:\r\n\r\n- The mechanical integrity program for regular maintenance, inspection and testing, and replacement of equipment if necessary.\r\n- The emergency action plan at the facility.\r\n- Preventative Maintenance actions and rounds.\r\n\r\n4.\tGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nOn February 24, 1992, the U.S. Department of Labor, Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) issued the Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals, final rule, 20 CFR 1910.119.  QPI Falls under and complies with the PSM standard.  It has been estimated that nearly 25,000 work sites and three million employees are covered under this standard.\r\n\r\nThe PSM regulation became effective on May 26, 1992, except for requirement listed under the Process Safety Information paragraph and the Process Hazard analysis paragraph which were phased in the following five years.\r\n\r\nThe standard for process safety management of highly hazardous chemicals is des"

It is a management standard, meaning that it sets performance requirements for management programs, rather than prescribing specific methods that must be used to control the hazardous chemicals.  The requirement s are intended to prevent or reduce the risk of major industrial incidents that might expose employees to the hazards of toxicity, fire, or explosion.\r\n\r\nQPI's ammonia refrigeration system design and construction is based upon proven and accepted engineering design practices. The system was designed and constructed to meet the Uniform Building Code, International Mechanical Code, Uniform Fire Code, ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 15, and the National Electric Code.  Shut-off valves are strategically located throughout the refrigeration system to allow emergency shut-off, periodic maintenance and repair.  All system pressure vessels are ASME rated and fitted with safety relief valves as required by ASME.\r\n\r\n5.\tFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nQPI took ownership of the property in 2018. Since then, they have not had any accidents.\r\n\r\n6.\tTHE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\n\r\nIn the event of an accidental release of ammonia, the West Point Volunteer Fire Department would be called. Our employees would evacuate the facility and meet at the East parking lot of the property.  We perform a practice evacuation annually.  Tier II forms which describe our facility's hazardous chemicals are filed with the Nebraska DEQ annually.  Additional copies are sent to the local emergency planning committee and the West Point Fire Department.\r\n\r\n7.\tPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nQPI trains and tests all refrigeration technicians.  Our preventative maintenance program is above standard and our Process safety Management Program (PSM) is reviewed annually and updated periodically.  We take advantage of new technologies when safer, more efficient, and more economical alternatives are"
