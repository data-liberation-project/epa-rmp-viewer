The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n     af agronomy complies with ANSI K-61-1 requirements for anhydrous ammonia storage and it is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state and local laws.  We are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to call the Adams Fire Department, and request that they respond to the emergency.\n\n2.  A description of AF AGRONOMY headquarters location and the regulated substance handled:\n     The primary purpose of this facility is storage of fertilizers for sale to the agricultural sector.  Anhydrous Ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for both direct application and for blending into mixed grade fertilizers for sale to farmers.  Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel, and authorized contractors.\n\n3.  The worst case release scenerio:\n     We used rmp comp to determine the worst case scenerio release at our facility.  Failure of our largest storage tank when filled to the greatest amount would have off site consequences. the alternative release scenerio would be a release caused by a break in a transfer hose.  Excess flow and check valves as well as manual shut off vlaves would hlep stop the release in this altrenative case scenerio.\n\n4.  AFAGRONOMY complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.  The facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc. and the standards of the U.S. Ocupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"STORAGE AND HANDLING OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA\".\n\n5.

Planned changes to improve safety:\n     Safety improvement is an ongoing process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintainance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
