      "SummaryText": "Preferred Freezer has created and implemented a PSM/RMP Program for their Facility located at 2800 Polar Way, Richland, Washington 99354. The PSM/RMP program was developed in accordance with OSHA's PSM Standard (29 CFR 1910.119) and EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs under Clean Air Act Section 112(r) per the General Duty Clause of Clean Air Act Section 112(r)(1) because the Site handles a regulated substance (anhydrous ammonia) listed in Appendix A of 29 CFR 1910.119 and 40 CFR 68.130. \n\n\n\nEPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule, which is authorized under 112(r) of the Clean Air Act (CAA), requires that facilities that have covered processes establish RMPs to reduce the risks of accidental release of toxic or flammable materials and establish emergency response procedures in the event of an accident. This Executive Summary summarizes the efforts that Preferred Freezer has undertaken to establish a RMP in conjunction with the PSM Program. \n\n\n\nA management system is in place at the Facility to oversee implementation of the Facility's RMP. This management system is considered one of the most important elements of this Facility's RMP, as its goal is to ensure that lines of authority and responsibility are clearly defined, helping to ensure that all elements of the RMP are implemented. The person who has the overall responsibility for the RMP/PSM program and overall program implementation at the Facility is the General Manager. \n\n\n\nThe Facility uses anhydrous ammonia within a closed loop refrigeration system consisting of vessels, compressors, evaporative condensers, evaporators and associated piping and valves. The on-site maximum intended quantity of anhydrous ammonia handled at the Preferred Freezer facility is approximately 15,000 pounds within the ammonia refrigeration system. The Facility does not use any other chemicals or flammable materials in excess of threshold quantities covered by RMP requirements. The ammonia refrig"

      "SummaryText": "eration systems were re-designed and constructed in accordance with applicable federal, state, and local regulations at the time of design for construction (2014 -2015).\n\n\n\nAmmonia safety considerations have been incorporated into the construction of the ammonia system. The Site utilizes Manning/Honeywell ammonia sensors within the Engine Room and throughout the cold storage areas (freezers and dock). Within the Engine Room an alarm occurs at 50 ppm, emergency ventilation activates upon a high level alarm at 300 ppm, and a high-high level detector initiates refrigeration system shutdown in the event of a catastrophic ammonia release at 10,000 ppm.  Within the cold storage areas (freezers and dock), the alarm set point is 25 ppm (alert to control panel and shut down of affected valve group to evaporators). In addition, the facility has a sensor on the pressure relief vent to detect an overpressure release; this detector is set at 150 ppm and alarms to the control panel.   \n\n\n\nThe Facility maintains a Prevention Program that minimizes the possibility of any accidental release from the ammonia system. The Prevention Program incorporates a mechanical integrity program, regularly scheduled maintenance, daily visual operational checks of equipment, and employee training in proper operating procedures and emergency response.\n\n\n\nPreferred Freezer has performed a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) on the refrigeration system design to evaluate potential hazards and consequences of deviation for the covered process. The PHA study was performed according to the procedures described in \"Guidelines for Hazard Evaluation Procedures; Center for Chemical Process Safety\" published by the American Institute of Chemical Engineers, New York. The PHA was performed by a team of subject matter experts in the refrigeration system engineering, operations and maintenance, and environmental, health, and safety. Each identified consequence was assigned a relative risk ranking based on the severity "

The team then discussed recommendations, which resulted in corrective actions; these corrective actions were recorded and tracked to resolution. Preferred Freezer has implemented these various analyses and training programs to prevent and prepare for an emergency release. \n\n\n\nPreferred Freezer has designed the Mechanical Integrity Program for the ammonia refrigeration systems in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.119(j) and 40 CFR 68.73. The purpose is to verify that critical process equipment is designed, installed, and maintained properly, and operates correctly. In accordance with this program, the ammonia process and equipment must be constructed, installed, and maintained to minimize the risk of releases of the highly hazardous chemicals. The Mechanical Integrity Program at the Facility includes identifying and categorizing equipment; inspecting and testing of instrumentation and documenting maintenance procedures; training of maintenance personnel; establishing criteria for acceptable test results; documenting test and inspection results, including any corrective actions taken to address deficiencies; and documenting manufacturer information for equipment and instrumentation.\n\n\n\nThe Facility performs daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, semi-annual, and annual inspections of the ammonia refrigeration system and a system integrity check is conducted every 5 years. The equipment is maintained with guidance from the manufacturer specifications, and applicable standards and codes. The facility has adopted guidance from the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) Bulletin 110 for conducting these inspections.\n\n\n\nThe Engine Room maintains a sprinkler system that would activate in the event of a fire and the Engine Room ventilation system provides continuous exhaust ventilation during normal operation and additional ventilation volume under emergency operation.

The basic principle of the Oxygen Reduction Fire Prevention System is that combustion cannot occur without sufficient oxygen. Whereas our atmosphere contains approximately 21% oxygen by volume, an Oxygen Reduction Fire Prevention System maintains an atmosphere within the protected area containing approximately 16% oxygen by volume. Due to the reduction in oxygen concentration within the freezers, access to the freezers requires special precautions during entry under normal and emergency operations.\n\n\n\nAll new employees, regardless of position, are provided with ammonia awareness training. Special emphasis is placed on the nature of the anhydrous ammonia and actions of all personnel in case of an ammonia problem (i.e., leak). All persons hired who are responsible for operations and maintenance of the ammonia system will be given on the job training before they are allowed to work on, operate or otherwise manipulate or affect the ammonia system. The demonstration and on the job training includes detailed instruction on the ammonia system including the physical aspects of ammonia, operating the ammonia system, and casualties involving the ammonia system. Employees are trained regarding the hazards and safety precautions to be observed for the ammonia system. In addition, annual refresher training is required.  The Facility has also implemented a formal Contractor Safety Program to address work on or around the covered process.\n\n\n\nThe Facility has an Emergency Action Plan, or Refrigeration Emergency Response Plan (RERP).

Further, the RERP contains a list for internal notifications, refrigeration contractor, and emergency response clean-up contractor.\n\n\n\nPreferred Freezer has an Emergency Action Plan (29 CFR 1910.38)in place with appropriate mechanisms for notifying emergency responders when there is a need for response. If offsite during an alarm or emergency condition, responsible personnel will return to the Facility to investigate the situation, at which time a determination as to the appropriate response will be made.\n\n\n\nTo date, the Facility's Five Year History does not include any accidental releases from the ammonia system which resulted in any of the following (onsite or offsite): deaths, injuries, significant property damage, evacuations, sheltering in place, environmental damage, or a reportable quantity of ammonia released to the atmosphere.\n\n"
