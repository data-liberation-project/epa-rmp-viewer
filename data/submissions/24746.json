The OSHA Standard is referenced in the Registration Form Section 8.3.b.\n\n5. Five Year Accident History:  There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries or significant property damage at the facility, nor, to our knowledge, have resulted in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering-in-place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\n6. Emergency Response Program:  The facility has: A) a written Emergency Action Plan (EAP) in accordance with OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.38 and B) provided state and local authorities with the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety:  Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions. There are no additional specific safety recommendations regarding storage or use of anhydrous ammonia for implementation at this time."

Facility Policy:  The owners, management and employees of Gold-Eagle Cooperative at its Corwith, Iowa location (the facility) are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur,  the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information:  The primary activity at the site is the storage and sale of fertilizers to area farmers. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application for crop production. Anhydrous ammonia is stored in 1 - 26,000 gallon tank (about 112,700 pounds) and 28 - 1,000 gallon nurse tanks (about 121,400 pounds) with a total maximum amount stored of about 234,100 pounds.\n\n3. Worst Case and Alternate Case Scenarios: A) The Worst Case Scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank as a gas over a period of 10 minutes. The maximum quantity released would be about 112,700  pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 % capacity as limited by design standards. The distance to the end point (point of dispersion to 200 parts per million, or ppm) is about 2.4 miles. B) The Alternate Case Release Scenario, based on the five year accident history, or the most likely potential incident, ia a release from a break in a 3 transfer hose. The distance to the end point (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is about 1.6 miles.\n\n4. Accidental Release Prevention Program:  The facility has been reviewed for general compliance with the provisions of Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1, published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc., (ANSI) and the standards of the United States Occupat"
