      "SummaryText": "RMP Executive Summary\nWabash \u0096 Little Falls, Minnesota\n\nA. Description of Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\nWabash is located at 700 Paul Larson Memorial Drive, Little Falls, MN and is a commercial facility that manufactures semi-trailers for commercial use. One of the most important components of Wabash's manufacturing process is the production of polyurethane insulative foam.   This process utilizes pentane-based resin (known as \u0093B-Side\u0094) and R-152a (difluoroethane, CAS #75-37-6), along with other additives contained in unique formulations.\n\nAlthough other chemicals will be present in the process, R-152a is the primary consideration as a chemical covered under the RMP regulation due to its acute flammability.  R-152a is used in the production of insulative foam.  The RMP-covered process includes unloading and bulk storage R-152a through two (2) production lines in which the chemicals are injected into wall panel cavities to produce foam insulation.  Wabash\u0092s covered process specifically includes the following equipment and operations:\n\u0095\tBulk R-152a unloading and storage\n\u0095\tR-152a day/tempering tank storage\n\u0095\tR-152a transfer from bulk storage to day/tempering tank storage and up through the mixers\n\u0095\tTransfer of blended resin from the mixers and the blended resin intermediate tanks\n\u0095\tTransfer of blended resin from the intermediate tanks up through two manufacturing production lines\n\nBulk R-152a is delivered to the facility via a tanker truck.  The liquid chemical is transferred from the delivery vehicle into an exterior aboveground storage tank (AST) using a transfer pump at the site.  A vapor recovery system is employed to prevent the release of potentially flammable vapor into the atmosphere during the transfer by directing vapor displaced from the bulk AST headspace back into the delivery truck (creating a closed system). Once stored in the bulk AST, R-152a is transferred to an interior tempering and blending room, where the chemical\u0092s temperature"

From there, the B-Side mixture is transferred to production equipment out at one of the two manufacturing production lines, and eventually to the foaming mixheads.  At the mixheads, the B-Side mixture and an A-Side chemical (isocyanate, which is not regulated under RMP) are simultaneously injected into a cavity.  The two components chemically react, rapidly expanding to fill the cavity and producing insulative foam.  After several minutes, the foam will harden, permanently and irreversibly trapping the chemicals within the cellular structure of the foam.\n\nThrough this foam production process, R-152a is stored and used at the facility in a quantity that exceeds the 10,000-lb. threshold quantity specified by EPA regulation 40 CFR Part 68. Wabash's covered process requires compliance with Program Level 3 of the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) due to the fact that the process is also subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard (29 CFR 1910.119).  The facility operates under North American Industrial Classification System Code (NAICS) 441310 - Automotive Parts and Accessories Stores.\n\n\nB. Accidental Release Prevention & Emergency Response Policies of Wabash\nWabash is committed to protecting facility personnel, the public and the environment from any workplace and accidental release hazards. Appropriate responses to releases of regulated chemicals are documented in the site Emergency Action Plan. In addition, Wabash complies with the OSHA Process Safety Management regulation. Design criteria established include safety relief valves, fail safe automatic control valves, nitrogen blanketing, hydrocarbon detection systems, lightning protection, electrical grounding protection, ventilation flow controls, extensive exhaust ventilation design and implementation.

Release Scenario Discussion\nIn accordance with the requirements of the EPA RMP regulations, Wabash performed the following offsite consequence analyses.\n- One worst-case release scenario for the R-152a bulk storage.\n- One alternative release scenario for the R-152a-containing process equipment.\n\nWabash used the EPA RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance to calculate the estimated release rates and to determine the distance to the appropriate flammable endpoints.\n\nD. Five-year Accident History\nUnder the EPA RMP regulations, an accidental release is defined as a release of a regulated substance that \"resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on-site, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\"  There were no accidental releases that have occurred during the past 5 years.\n\nE. Prevention Program Elements\nManagement System - Wabash has a management program in place that assigns overall responsibility for the\ndevelopment and implementation of the RMP Program to a qualified individual or position of responsibility. It clearly delineates accountability and responsibilities for any elements where responsibilities are delegated.\n\nProcess Safety Information (PSI) - Up-to-date process safety information is maintained for use by employees operating the covered process in accordance with 40 CFR Part 68.65, including the following:\n- SDS's for the R-152a that contains toxicity information, permissible exposure limits, physical data, reactivity data, thermal and chemical stability data and synergistic effects from mixing process flows.\n- Block flow diagrams for the covered process.\n- Process chemistry and maximum intended inventory data for the covered process.\n- Safe operating limits and evaluation of consequences of deviations"
