And we believe the foundation for success is open communication with our employees and community neighbors.  Together, we provide products and services to our customers in the community that improve their lives.  It is Rowell's policy to strictly adhere to all Federal, State and Local regulations.  This commitment to safety and environmental protection carries through to every employee of Rowell.\n\n\n\nRowell Chemical was formed in 1980.  The three founders had a combined 65 years of experience in the chemical industry.  Integrity, solid planning, and conservative decision-making drove the company's success.  Today, Rowell Chemical is a leading Chemical Distributor in the Chicago area.  Rowell Chemical is a member in good standing in the National Association of Chemical Distributors and complies with NACD Responsible Distribution&reg; program.  The company is also an active member of The Chlorine Institute. The Chlorine Institute was formed in 1917 to promote safe handling and production of chlorine.  The success of the Institute and its members is evident by the large volume of liquid chlorine that is transported through and used in our communities without incident.\n\n\n\nRowell Chemical purchased the Willow Springs Terminal in 1982.  Formerly an alcohol distribution facility, the corporation converted and upgraded the facility to handle simple inorganic, corrosive chemicals like caustic soda and hydrochloric acid.  These chemicals are used widely as additives to produce soap, water treatment compounds, food products, and other household and industrial products.  In 1985, Rowell began to handle liquid chlorine to produce bleach and to repackage for use in municipal water treatment.\n\n\n\nLiquid chlorine is considered hazardous by EPA.  Chlorine's most recognized use is for water disinfection.  The use of chlorine to purify wate"

      "SummaryText": "r has reduced water-borne illnesses so common less than 100 years ago to nearly zero.  Even today, developing countries that do not have ready access to chlorine disinfection suffer from tragic loss of life due to typhoid-type epidemics.  The same properties that make chlorine valuable as a commodity also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions.\n\n\n\nIn 1992, OSHA formalized industry requirements for handling substances like liquid chlorine under its Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.  Rowell had since the first day of handling liquid chlorine followed similar requirements, such as those recommended by the Chlorine Institute in Pamphlet #64 (Emergency Response Plans for Chlorine Facilities), Pamphlet #6 (Piping Systems for Dry Chlorine) and Pamphlet #57 (Emergency Shut-Off Systems for Bulk Transfer of Chlorine).  All safety programs have been reviewed at Rowell's request by OSHA's free consultation service (Department of Commerce and Community Affairs).  \n\n\n\nRowell Chemical has provided for Six Layers of Protection of safety and protection for the environment.  The first and most important layer is our employees.  Rowell Chemical employees are well-trained professionals that are committed to safety first.  All emergency responders and other key employees are trained and certified to OSHA's Emergency response requirements by an outside consulting and training school.  They are also required to pass rigorous medical and drug-free testing protocols.\n\n\n\nThe second Layer of Protection is mechanical integrity.  This comprehensive inspection and testing program for operating equipment provides reliability and greatly reduces the chance of failure.\n\n\n\nThe third layer is Hazard Reviews.  Hazard reviews are conducted every five years on all systems as well as new designs prior to operation.  These reviews identify accident potential and correct situations before they become a problem.\n\n\n\nNext, process controls are employed to ensure all reactions and proc"

This process utilizes state-of-the-art electronics and redundant safety backup devices ensure smooth, safe operation.  Automated railcar shutoffs and video surveillance are employed on chlorine railcars.\n\n\n\nMonitoring systems provide the fifth layer of protection.  Rowell has invested in sensitive chlorine monitors to identify impending problems, giving operators early warning and enabling them to provide a quicker and more effective response.\n\n\n\nFinally, Rowell is prepared for Emergency Response.  The key to minimizing the effect of an accidental release is to get the right people and equipment to the scene quickly, including both on-site and off-site responders.  Rowell has a well-trained emergency response team on-site and a contract with a professional response company as back-up.  Rowell has also drilled with the Willow Springs and Metro area fire departments to ensure a seamless response in the unlikely event that an emergency should arise.\n\n\n\nRowell Chemical has submitted to EPA the required release scenarios, accident history and Risk Management Program summary information.  Should interested community members or other stakeholders desire further information, the company would welcome their inquiries.\n\n"
