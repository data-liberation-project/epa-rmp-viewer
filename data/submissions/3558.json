The maximum storage quanity of Anhydrous is 140,196 lbs..The facility has a written emergency response plan and has provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right to know information as required under SARA Title III.\n\nWorst Case Scenario- A maximum of 140,196 lbs of Anhydrous Ammonia could be released in a gaseous state over a duration of 10 minutes at 14,020 lbs/min into the rural area surrounding the plant up to 1.10 miles radius. The offsite consequences could include approximately 900 people, including residential, schools and commercial industrial personnel.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario- A transfer hose failure of Anhydrous Ammonia has the potential to release 26,638 lbs. of product in a gaseous state over 2 minutes at a rate of 13,319 lbs/min in the urbanl area surrounding the plant up to .59 miles.  The offsite consequences could include appoximately 600 people.  The effected population would include residential, school and commerical industrial individuals.\n\nThe owners, management and employees at the facility are prepared to work with local fire department and other authorities to minimize the impact of any release to the community and the enviornment.
