Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Evans Houston are committed to employee, public and environmental safety. This commitment is inherent to our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If such a release does occur, our trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  \n\n2.  The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nThe Evans Houston facility's primary activities are repackaging and warehousing of chemicals. Evans either repackages or warehouses up to a maximum of 11 regulated substances at our facility.  These substances are listed below.  Evans receives the regulated substances in bulk and packages the products for customer distribution.  Drummed products are then warehoused or shipped depending on customer specifications.  Inventory is dependent upon customer orders and not all regulated substances are present onsite at a given time.  \n\nChemical                                                                CAS No.\nToxic Substances:\nAcrylonitrile                                                           107-13-1\nAllyl Alcohol                                                          107-18-6\nCyclohexylamine                                                   108-91-8\nEthylenediamine                                                    107-15-3\nFormaldehyde (37%)                                              50-00-0\nToluene 2,4 diisocyanate                                      584-84-9\nToluene 2,6 diisocyanate                                        91-08-7\nToluene diisocyanate                                         26471-62-5\n\n\nFlammable Substances (Liquid Form):"

Evans is a Program 3 level facility because the processes covered under RMP are also subject to the OSHA process safety management standard, 29 CFR 1910.119. \n\nTo evaluate the worst case and alternative scenarios, Evans used EPA's program RMP*Comp to calculate the off-site consequences.  RMP*Comp is based on the look-up tables and equations provided by the EPA in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nScenarios for Toxic Substances\n\nThe worst-case release scenario submitted for toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from Acrylonitrile.  The scenario involves the release of 40,557 lb. of Acrylonitrile in a liquid form over 10 minutes.  The release is completely contained within a diked area.  Evaporation from that pool within the dike occurs over 60 minutes.  Calculations take into account the worst case weather conditions (stable, low wind speed) in an urban setting, and are calculated to a toxic endpoint of 0.076 mg/l.\n\nOne alternative release scenario is submitted for each toxic substance that may be present in Program 3 processes cumulatively.  Inventory is dependent upon customer orders and not all regulated substances are present onsite at a given time. \n\nThe alternative release scenario for Acrylonitril"
