This includes:\r\n\u00bf\tConducting our business with a goal of zero injuries and incidents\r\n\u00bf\tProviding a safe, healthy and secure work environment for employees and contractors\r\n\u00bf\tMaintaining a risk-based management system that is designed to ensure compliance with applicable legal and other requirements and promoting continual performance improvement\r\n\u00bf\t Providing stewardship of our processes and products, practice pollution prevention and optimizing resource use across all stages of the product life cycle\r\n\u00bf\t Communicating openly with all stakeholders on relevant health, safety and environmental issues\r\n\r\nThe facility's overall approach to chemical safety can be summed up by \"Goal Zero\"; zero injuries, zero releases and zero quality defects.  Senior management has made it clear that working safely is a \"first and forever\" expectation and all employees are held to the highest level of performance with regards to both process and occupational safety and environmental performance.  Through tools such as the Rules of Performance and Check Signals and Operational Excellence initiatives, the site is committed to achieving \"Goal Zero\" performance.\r\n\r\n2.\tFacility and Regulated Substances Handled:\r\n\r\nEquistar uses the patented Spheripol & Catalloy technologies to manufacture polypropylene plastic resins.

The site was designed and built according to strict engineering standards using Equistar's world-wide experience and long history with polyolefin technology process design.\r\n\r\nThe following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program:\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\nEquistar maintains a record of written safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associated with the process.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazards Analysis\r\nEquistar conducts studies to ensure the hazards associated with the process are identified and controlled efficiently.  Process Hazards Analysis, PHA, methodology is used to carry out these analyses using a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering, maintenance and process operations.  PHA's are revalidated at least every 5 years and findings are addressed in a timely manner.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\nEquistar maintains written operating procedures that address various modes of operation such as start-up, shutdown, normal operation, temporary operation, emergency shutdown, emergency operation and start-up after a turnaround.  Operating procedures are validated annually and made accessible electronically to operations personnel.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\nEquistar's training program ensures that employees that operate the process are competent, trained in their assigned tasks and familiar with the appropriate operating procedures.  New employees receive basic training in process operations followed by on-the-job supervision until they are deemed competent to work independently.  Written tests and field observation are used to verify understanding of the training.  Additional training is provided regularly and operators are recertified at leas"

These inspections include piping, pressure vessels, tanks, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps to name but a few.  Maintenance is performed by qualified personnel who receive specialized training on specific pieces of equipment.  Deficiencies found during inspections are addressed in a timely manner.\r\n\r\nManagement of Change\r\nThe Management of Change process controls changes to process chemicals, equipment, technology, personnel and procedures.  Changes are reviewed by a multidisciplinary team of competent personnel prior to implementation to determine if there is any impact on safety, health or the environment and the process includes notification or training of affected personnel.\r\n\r\nPre-Start-up Safety Reviews, PSSR\r\nPSSR's of new processes or modifications to existing processes confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures, and training or communication of the change are suitable for safe start-up prior to putting equipment into operation.\r\n\r\nCompliance audits\r\nA team of company subject matter experts audits site management systems at least every 3 years to ensure that the provisions set out under the PSM and RMP regulations are being implemented.  Any findings are addressed in a timely manner.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation\r\nEquistar investigates any incident that results in or could reasonably be expected to result in an employee injury or a catastrophic release of a hazardous material.  The investigation identifies the immediate and underlying causes and generates corrective actions to prevent recurrence.  The multidisciplinary investigation team issues a report that is retained for 5 years.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\nEquistar believes that process safety"

Employees have access to all information created under the PSM and RMP rules including PHA's, and they participate in investigation teams, safety teams, and other related projects. \r\n\r\nContractors\r\nContractors are hired to complete specialized maintenance and construction projects.  Prior to selecting a contractor, Equistar conducts a thorough evaluation of the contractor's safety performance.  Equistar has a strict policy of informing all contract personnel of known and potential hazards related to the contractor's work and the site's processes.

The plan addresses adequate first aid and medical treatment; evacuation; notification of local emergency response agencies and the public; and the post incident decontamination of affected areas.  The Emergency Response Plan has been coordinated with the Local Emergency Planning Committee, LEPC, and the Southwest Louisiana Mutual Aid organization and is updated regularly based on the analysis of actual emergencies or scheduled drills.
