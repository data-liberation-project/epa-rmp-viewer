(AGC-Bayonne) has implemented an Accidental Release Prevention Program which includes Process Safety Information according to a documentation plan.\n\nProcess Hazard analyses are conducted on a five-year schedule by a process hazard analysis team, using checklist and/or HAZOP techniques.  The team is composed of a Hazard Study Team Leader, Process Supervisors, Process Operators, Maintenance Personnel and other personnel familiar with site production and safety.  Results of these Hazard Analyses have been recorded on the Hazard Studies 1, 2 and 3 proformas.  Recommendations resulting from these hazard studies are recorded, assigned to specific personnel and tracked by the Process Safety Supervisor. The functions of the Process Safety Supervisor may be carried out by the Manager or the Vice President of Environment, Health and Safety.           \n\nOperating Procedures are written by process supervisors, operators and others with input from all affected parties. These Operating Procedures are reviewed by representatives of the site Safety, Health and En"

Any changes to Operating Procedures must be reviewed by the above noted departmentsand go through an approval process before adoption onto the site's computer network.\n\n40 CFR 68.155(b) Site Description and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nAGC-Bayonne occupies approximately 34.5 acres in the Constable Hook area of the city of Bayonne, NJ, a heavily industrialized area bordered on three sides by Upper New York Bay to the East, Newark Bay to the West and Kill Van Kull Waterway to the South. The site employs 124 full-time staff and two part-time employees.  The site produces two products. One is polytetrafluoroethylene, an adhesion-resistant plastic used in numerous consumer and industrial applications whose trade name is Fluon, the other is HCFC 225 - a specialty cleaning solvent whose trade name is Asahiklin AK-225.\n\nThe regulated substances handled at the site are approximately twenty thousand pounds of Anhydrous Ammonia, CAS # 7664-41-7  which is used as a refrigerant gas in the site's refrigeration and chiller system; forty thousand pounds of Tetrafluoroethylene, CAS # 000116-14-3, a raw material which is polymerized to form Fluon; and thirty seven thousand pounds of ammonia contained in 27.5% by weight of aqua ammonia, CAS # 7664-41-7 which is utilized in the plant's Wastewater Treatment system.\n\n40 CFR 68.155 (c): Worst-Case and Alternate Release Scenarios\n\nThe Worst Case Release Scenario (WCS) for Anhydrous Ammonia is estimated to reach a Toxic Endpoint of 1.4 miles, determined using the Lookup Tables in the EPA OCA Guidance Document.  This may result in impacts on public receptors within the City of Bayonne and possibly Staten Island. Diking of the bulk Ammonia rece"

While this technically crosses the site's nearest property line, it is not expected to have any appreciable offsite impact.\n\nThe WCS for Aqueous Ammonia will result in a Toxic Endpoint at approximately 0.05 miles, and is not expected to have any appreciable offsite impact.  Diking of the Bulk Storage tank is used as passive mitigation.\n\nThe Alternate Scenario (ACS) for Anhydrous Ammonia is predicted via dispersion modeling to reach a Toxic Endpoint of  0.38 miles. This ACS was based on a vesselr leak, releasing 668 pounds of Ammonia at a release rate of 11.1 lbs/min.\n\nThe ACS for Aqueous Ammonia reaches the Toxic Endpoint of 0.08 miles at 60 minutes.  This release was given a duration of two hours , and does not account for mitigation features ordinarily in place.\n\n40 CFR 66.155(d): Accidental Release Prevention Program \n\nRelease prevention steps at the site include relief valves, check valves, manual shutoff systems, automatic control interlocks, alarms, written procedures, direct attendance by process operations personnel, keyed bypasses, emergency air supplies, emergency power systems, grounding equipment, rupture disks, excess flow monitors, alarms and controls, purge systems, and excess pressure and temperature control interlocks.\n\nMitigation systems used are water deluge systems, sprinkler systems, firewalls, and neutralization systems.\nThe process areas are monitored by a system of continuous leak detection sniffer systems, which are interlocked with readouts and alarms in the Control Room.\n\nOperator initial and refresher training is actively revised and reconducted as changes to these and other production systems are made.  This retraining is encompassed within the site's Operator Training program.\n\nAll release prevention, mitigation and area sniffer systems are subject to the site's Preventive Maintenance pro"

Equipment reliability information is used in scheduling routine inspections and tests  of these systems to ensure their uninterrupted operation.\n\nThe site's Management of Change program is monitored by the AGC Safety, Health and Environmental Department and ensures that equipment, process or software changes are not made without the direct input of all affected individuals.  All changes are screened by the SHE Department to determine if further hazard studies are required for a particular change.  No changes are made which do not conform to company standards for safe design and operation.\n\nAll incidents are investigated to determine root cause and identify any potential system deficiencies requiring correction.\n\n40 CFR 68.155(e) Five-Year Accident History\n\nThe company experienced one incident involving a regulated substance, Anhydrous Ammonia, on March 19, 2002.  The incident involved a small release (0.016 pound) of ammonia while a technician was performing maintenance on a pressure switch. The release sprayed onto the technician's exposed right wrist although he was wearing a glove resulting to a minor injury to the wrist. There were no offsite or onsite impacts. There was no property damage.  Ten action items were executed in response to the investigation of the incident and all actions were completed.\n\n40 CFR 68.155(f)    The Emergency Response Program\n\nAGC-Bayonne maintains an Integrated Contingency Plan known onsite as the FEPP or Facility Emergency Preparedness Program.  The plan defines the structure of AGC-Bayonne's on-site response team, it's coordination with the local emergency response agencies such as the Bayonne OEM or LEPC which is\nmanaged by the Bayonne Fire Department, equipment inventories and locations on site, response procedures, site emergency notification procedures, and emergency response drills.  The FEPP is updated as necessary based on results of emergency response drills, response team staffing, or other detail changes.\n\n40 CFR 68."

To this end, AGC-Bayonne actively maintains a Behavior-Based safety Management program known as SABRE.  Other changes include those items resulting from the latest hazard study revalidation, conducted in May 2003."
