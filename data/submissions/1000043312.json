      "SummaryText": "Kalamazoo Area Water System Overview\n\n\n\nThe City of Kalamazoo Public Water Supply System is designed, operated, and maintained by the Kalamazoo Public Services Department, Water Division. (KPSWD). The mission and the purpose of the System is to provide a safe, sufficient, reliable water supply and related services to the public within the Kalamazoo metropolitan area. Ground water provides 100 percent of the water served. The average daily flow rate is about 23 MGD.\n\n\n\nChlorine is used to disinfect the water prior to supply. Chlorine is delivered and used in one ton containers. The containers are stored in storage room.  The Water Supply System uses vacuum system that is inherently safe. These systems involve the use of water flowing through an eductor which creates vacuum. This vacuum allows for the feed of chlorine from the containers into the piping system. If a chlorine line downstream of the vacuum regulator is broken or develops a leak, the vacuum is interrupted and the vacuum regulator automatically closes, preventing discharge of chlorine.\n\n\n\nWater Pumping Station #1 Central Overview\n\n\n\nCentral Pumping Station #1 is located at 215 W. Stockbridge Ave. in the City of Kalamazoo.  It is bounded on the north and west side by W. Crosstown Parkway, on the east side by Stockbridge Ave., on the south side by a commercial business and Balch Street.\n\n\n\nThere are a total of six wells located on the property, which supply raw water to the pumping station.  The original pumping Station #1 was built in 1884 and has been abandoned.  The present facility was built in 1995.  The six wells provide a raw water capacity of 6,750 gallons per minute (gpm), or 9.73 million gallons per day (MGD).  There are two 200, one 150, and one 100 hp treated water pumps at this station.  Iron is removed from the raw water through air stripping towers and filters.  Central Pumping Station #1 is on of the two iron filtration plants on the system and is an unmanned facility.

If the facility manages a regulated substance\n\n3.    If the facility manages a regulated substance in quantities exceeding regulated threshold quantities\n\n4.    And it is defined as a process\n\n\n\nThe CAA defines \"stationary sources\" as, \"any buildings, structures, equipment, installations, or substance emitting stationary activities\".  Central is a structure that stores both 1-ton and 150 lb chlorine gas cylinders.  Chlorine is fed to the drinking water system from the 1-ton cylinders utilizing a vacuum feed system.  Therefore, WPS #1 meets the definition of a \"facility\".\n\n\n\nThe list of substances regulated under Part 68.130 is in Appendix A of the rule.  Chlorine gas is included on the list of regulated substances.  The maximum threshold quantity for chlorine gas is 2500 lbs.  \n\n\n\nThe chlorine used and stored at the WPS #1 is delivered in one-ton and 150# cylinders.  The 150# cylinders are delivered in storage racks of six cylinders attached to one rack with a maximum intended inventory of 16 racks resulting in a maximum intended storage volume in 150# cylinders of 14,400 lbs of chlorine. \n\n\n\nIn addition, Water Pumping Station #1 has provisions for storing a maximum intended inventory of eight one ton cylinders (including the ones in use).  Therefore the maximum intended inventory of chlorine stored/used in one ton cylinders is 16,000 lbs.  Therefore, the maximum intended inventory of chlorine in one ton and 150 lb cylinders is 30,400 lbs.  Therefore the quantity of chlorine managed in the facility exceeds the regulatory threshold quantity.\n\n\n\n\"Process\" is defined in 40 CFR 68.3 as, \"Any activity involving a regulated substance, including any use, storage, manufacturing, handling, or on-site movement of such substances, or combination of these activities.

The rule defines three Program levels based on processes' relative potential for public impacts and the level of effort needed to prevent accidents.  For each Program level, the rule defines requirements that reflect the level of risk and effort associated with the processes at that level.\n\n\n\nProgram 1:  Processes which would not affect the public in the case of a worst-case release and with no accidents with specific offsite consequences within the past five years.\n\n\n\nProgram 2:  Processes not eligible for Program 1 or subject to Program 3 are placed in Program 2, which imposes streamlined prevention program requirement, as well as additional hazard assessment, management, and emergency response requirements.\n\n\n\nProgram 3:  Processes not eligible for Program 1 and either subject to OSHA's PSM standard under federal or state OSHA programs or classified in one of ten specified North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) codes.\n\n\n\nPursuant to the above criteria, WPS #1 falls under the Program 2 requirements because the operation is not eligible for Program 1 due to the location of the facility in proximity to residences, hospital, and commercial establishments; the process is not subject to MIOSHA PSM because there are no Public Services employees stationed at this location; and the process does not fall under any of the ten specified North "

The OCA was completed using EPA's software program, RMP*CompTM that performs calculations described in the USEPA's RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance. In order to complete the Offsite Consequence Analyses (OCA), \"Appendix F:  Supplemental Risk Management Program Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants\" was used since use of chlorine at Central is similar to how it is used at a WWTP.  This guidance provides additional information for wastewater treatment plants (or water pumping stations using chlorine).

In essence, if a chlorine leak were to occur in a ton cylinder that is connected to the vacuum feed system and the contents of the cylinder were released, the scrubber will respond and the release of chlorine gas to the atmosphere would be minimal.  These additional factors help to mitigate the worst-case release scenario.

Experience at WPS #1 indicates that it is more probable that a release may occur in other ways.  Specifically, leaks from the connection at the ton container valve may occur if the lead washer is not installed properly.  \n\n\n\nThe procedure for a ton container change out specifies that the operator/maintainer making the connection verify that this connection does not leak by the use of ammonia vapor.  A white vapor cloud will indicate a chlorine release.  However, it is conceivable that the person making the connection may not check the connection and not detect the release by smell (an air purifying respirator is worn during the procedure).  Therefore, the alternative release scenario to be considered is described in the following.\n\n\n\n3.3.1    Alternative Release Scenario\n\n\n\nA lead gasket is leaking chlorine vapor while a full ton container is in operation, i.e., connected to the supply system and the chlorine room is unattended.

Under this scenario, the release should be detected by the stationary, chlorine gas leak detector in the area.  The leak detector would alarm and system operators would be alerted.  It is assumed that mitigation stops the release in one hour.\n\n\n\nThe methodology used to calculate the alternative release concentration considers the mitigative effects of the building and interior chlorine room in which the ton containers are located.

As concentrations increase, there is an increase in the irritating effect on the eyes, coughing mechanism and on the upper and lower respiratory tract with eventual difficulty in breathing.  As the duration of exposure and/or concentration increase, the affected individual may become apprehensive and restless with coughing accompanied by throat irritation, sneezing, and excess salivation.  At higher levels, there is vomiting associated with labored breathing.  In extreme cases, difficulty in breathing can progress to the point of death through suffocation.\n\n\n\nLow concentrations of chlorine gas in the air may have minor irritating effects or may produce slight symptoms after several hours of exposure, but careful examination of persons repeatedly exposed to such conditions reportedly has shown no permanent physiological effect.

The 150 lb cylinders are delivered attached to storage racks of six cylinders per rack with a maximum intended inventory of 16 racks resulting in a maximum intended storage volume in 150# cylinders of 14,400 lbs of chlorine. \n\n\n\nIn addition, Water Pumping Station #1 has provisions for storing a maximum intended inventory of eight one ton cylinders (including the ones in use).  Therefore the maximum intended inventory of chlorine stored/used in one ton cylinders is 16,000 lbs.  Therefore, the maximum intended inventory of chlorine in one ton and 150 lb cylinders is 30,400 lbs.  This information is summarized in the following table.\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 4-1\n\nMaximum Intended Inventory\n\n\n\nContainer Type    Net Capacity, lbs.    Weight Empty, lbs.

If the temperature elevation was due to fire, the escaping chlorine gas would further accelerate the fire as chlorine is an oxidizer and is capable of supporting combustion of certain substances.\n\n\n\n \n\nPressure in the chlorine container is directly related to the temperature of the container.  As the temperature increases, so too does the pressure.  Excessive pressure would be relieved through the fusible plug system described above.  Deviation from the above limits may result in the release of chlorine form the containers or piping system.  The water operator/maintainers would be alerted by stationary chlorine leak detectors installed in the Chlorinator Room. In addition, exhaust fans are operated on a timer and are able to be manually overridden to remove any accumulated chlorine vapor to reduce exposure to personnel in the container and chlorinator rooms.\n\n4.1.4    Equipment Specifications\n\n\n\n"

A block flow diagram of the chlorination process is indicated in Figure 4-1 along with the chlorine feed system safety controls for the pumping station.  Chlorine gas (under pressure) from the one ton cylinder is routed to the vacuum regulators.  These vacuum regulators are mounted on the ton containers with a yoke and valve vacuum regulator arrangement attached to a valve on the upper portion of the cylinder.  The vacuum regulator serves to reduce the supply pressure from the ton container to a regulated vacuum for safe transport of the chlorine gas.  A liquid chlorine trap is installed on each vacuum regulator. It consists of a drip leg pipe that is heated with an AC powered heating tab arrangement that is attached to the drip leg. These liquid chlorine traps are used to catch and evaporate any liquid chlorine or condensed gas vapors which might enter the piping system.\n\n\n\nFrom the vacuum regulators, chlorine gas is piped to the chlorine feed points on the water main or water supply line.  The chlorinators serve as flow regulators which control the amount of chlorine sent to the chlorine injectors, or ejectors.\n\n\n\n \n\nThe injectors are devices which create a vacuum by using a pressure difference created by the use of low pressure raw water coming from the wells and high pressure water coming from the booster pump flowing through a venturi.

A vacuum condition, created in the feed line by the ejector which is in line of the water supply opens the inlet valve to admit chlorine gas into the regulator.  A diaphragm regulates the vacuum at this point to a closely controlled value.  The system is completely under vacuum from the ejector to the gas inlet valve at the vacuum regulator during operation.  If the water supply to the ejector is stopped, or the operating vacuum is lost for any reason, the spring-loaded gas inlet valve immediately closes to isolate the chlorine supply.  Any gas, under pressure, which might enter the regulator, is vented from the system through the built-in pressure relief valve through a chlorine vent line to the atmosphere outside the Chlorine Storage Room.  If the source of chlorine gas is exhausted, a gas port on the vacuum regulator closes to prevent excess vacuum levels from developing upstream of the vacuum regulator and also prevents any moisture from being drawn back into the operating components or the gas supply lines.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, the vacuum regulator features a liquid trap which will trap any liquid chlorine which might enter the regulator.  A liquid chlorine trap consists of a drip leg pipe that is heated with an AC powered heating tab arrangement that is attached to a drop leg. This set up vaporizes the liquid chlorine into chlorine gas.  If liquid chlorine were drawn into the chlorine vacuum lines, and the lines were subsequently isolated by shutting valves, the trapped liquid could cause excessive pressure in the lines due to its 3:1 expansion rate from liquid to gas which could result in a feed line rupture.\n\n\n\nInjector check valve - Each ejector is equipped with a check valve to protect the vacuum regulator f"

For instance, a chlorine reaction can cause stainless steel to catch fire or melt.\n\n\n\nChlorine leaks are usually confirmed using a standard ammonia test.  This test is safe because it uses ammonium hydroxide (ammonia dissolved in water or moist air) rather than pure ammonia.  Chlorine reacts readily with ammonium hydroxide to form ammonium chloride, a relatively harmless compound.  This reaction forms a white cloud, indicating a chlorine leak.  The continuous monitors now required indicate chlorine leaks automatically, but the ammonia test is still useful for pinpointing the exact location of a leak.\n\n\n\n4.2.2.4  Corrosion - Chlorine reacts with water or moisture in the air to form highly corrosive acids.

All major equipment at various facilities, including the chlorination equipment, are assigned a unique identification number and are included in this program.  Relevant equipment data, including serial or model numbers, location, process application, etc., is entered into the computer data base.  Various PM tasks and frequencies are also entered into the data base allowing for the generation of PM work orders based on elapsed time since the last scheduled occurrence.  The computer-generated PM work orders are given to the maintenance or process control employees for completion.  When completed, the work order tasks are initialed and returned to the Operator who enters the completion date, materials used, labor expended, other maintenance performed, etc. into the data base.

The Water Operators prepare the demand work order and provide this information to the Water Services Manager. The Water Services Manager then generates a demand work order after entry of certain information into the data base.  When completed, the demand work order tasks are initialed and returned to the Operator.  This information becomes part of the equipment history file.\n\n\n\nThe operations and maintenance manuals or instructions provided by the manufacturers of the equipment are an important element of the maintenance management system.  These manuals or instructions often contain recommended PM tasks, written instructions for performing maintenance, replacement parts identification, and other important data.  These manuals and instructions are kept in Engineering..  Extra copies of some of the more frequently used manuals are kept in the offices of the Maintenance Supervisor or Water Operations Supervisor.  Where there are no O&M manuals or instructions, reliance on maintenance fundamentals and staff experience may be necessary for PM or demand maintenance activities.\n\n\n\nChlorination system equipment items are listed in Table 4-5 along with the locations of their maintenance or technical support information, if any.\n\n\n\nSome special maintenance considerations are noted in the following sections.

In addition, a vacuum alarm condition will result which will alert system operators of the loss of chlorine feed.  \n\nb.    PVC piping- Schedule 80 PVC piping is used to convey chlorine gas, under vacuum, from the chlorinators to the injectors and chlorine solution, under pressure, from the injectors to the various chlorination locations.  No inspection or testing is required for the piping under vacuum conditions since the piping is under vacuum and is inherently safe.  If the piping develops a leak or otherwise fails, vacuum is lost and the flow of chlorine gas is immediately halted by the vacuum regulator.  In addition, a vacuum alarm condition will result which will alert system operators of the loss of chlorine feed.  The chlorine solution piping is not regulated under the PSM standard and inspection and testing is not required.\n\n\n\nValves \n\nTwo types of valves are used in the chlorination system.\n\n\n\n\n\na.    Standard ton container valves- The valves on the ton container are industry standard valves.  No maintenance on the valves is attempted with the possible exception of tightening the packing if a leak develops.  If a valve is found to be defective, the other container valve may be used or the container is returned to the supplier.  In addition, an auxiliary container isolating valve is used to prevent moisture from entering the piping system during a container changeout.  This isolating valve is the same type of valve as the container valve.\n\nb.    PVC ball valves- Numerous PVC ball valves are installed on the chlorine gas (vacuum) and chlorine solution lines.  The valves used for vacuum service may require replacement of internal gaskets, O-rings, etc.  These valves are included in the PM system and are exercised regularly.  Kits for re-building these valves are kept in stock in storage at Central Pumping Station.\n\n\n\nTon Containers\n\n"

Essentially, if a chlorine release occurs at Central the response procedures are purposed to ensure the safety of department personnel.  The water operator/maintainer personnel will not respond to a catastrophic release of chlorine from the facility.  If a release occurs from one of the two chlorine 1-ton cylinders in the Chlorine Room, the lease will be detected which will, in turn, activate the caustic scrubber system thus mitigating a catastrophic release.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, Public Services staff has developed the Kalamazoo Water Pumping & Distribution System Emergency Response Plan (ERP).  The ERP is a multi-disaster plan includes a chlorine gas release from Central as one of the scenarios.  For the chlorine gas release scenario, the ERP includes the threat evaluation and response procedures.  Excerpts from ERP pertaining to responses to a chlorine release (Part 2.5 and Part 4.1 of the Kalamazoo Water System ERP) are included in Appendix E of this written program.\n\n\n\nProcedures for notifying the local emergency response agencies about accidental releases.  The agencies that will respond are the City of Kalamazoo Department of Public Safety and Kalamazoo County Office of Emergency Management (OEM).  The Kalamazoo Department of Public Safety (KDPS), an integrated police and fire department will be responsible for notifying the public in the City of Kalamazoo.  The KDPS has mutual aid agreements with surrounding jurisdictions, including the City of Parchment and Kalamazoo Township.  \n\n\n\nThe KDPS will be the first responder to a chlorine gas release at Central.
