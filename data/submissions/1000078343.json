      "SummaryText": "Chlorine is the most commonly used substance for disinfecting drinking water.  The addition of chlorine or chlorine compounds to water is called chlorination.  Chlorination is considered to be the most important process for preventing the spread of waterborne disease in drinking water.  The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP) also uses chlorine for drinking water disinfection purposes at the Los Angeles Aqueduct Filtration Plant (LAAFP) facilities to protect public health per state and federal water quality standards. Storing and handling large quantities of chlorine can create hazardous situations. The LADWP takes safety obligations in storing and using chlorine as seriously as it takes in providing safe drinking water.\r\n\r\nThe LAAFP facilities complex consists of four different chlorination stations and one chemical depot: (1) the LAAFP facility; (2)  the Los Angeles Reservoir Outlet Chlorination Station (LAROCS); (3) the Van Norman Chemical Depot (VNCD); (4) the Van Norman Chloramination Station # 1 (VNCS#1); and (5) the Van Norman Chloramination Station #2 (VNCS#2). The LAAFP facilities chlorine handling processes are subject to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program and Plan and also to the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program requirements. The facilities subject to the EPA and the CalARP regulations are required to prepare and update Risk Management Plans (RMPs). The RMP is to include policies and procedures followed to safely operate the facility and the actions, which will be taken by the facility in an event of an emergency.\r\n\r\nThe LADWP updated and submitted the RMP for all the above five chlorination stations in June 2014. Subsequent to the submission of the RMP in June 2014, the LADWP made modifications to the LA Reservoir Outlet Chlorination Station. Modifications to the LAROCS were completed in January 2016 and the updated RMP was submitted in July 2016. The July 2016 RMP demonstrated co"

Ton  containers connected to the feed header are equipped with Halogen valve actuators that automatically close the ton container feed valve when a chlorine concentration of 10 ppm is detected in the chlorine storage room by two chlorine sensors. \r\n\r\nLiquid chlorine is normally withdrawn from the bulk tank to a piping header that leads to either one of the three evaporators. The gas discharge piping from the evaporators supply pressurized chlorine gas to the chlorinators through pressure regulating valves. A gas header from the bulk tank serves as a backup supply that automatically takes over when the evaporator is shut off due to a low temperature condition. The bank of eight ton containers can also feed liquid or gaseous chlorine through the header system to the evaporators or chlorinators.\r\n\r\nThere are a total of eleven chlorine injectors located in four injection vaults.
