Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n\nAt this facility, we manufacture gaseous hydrogen.  Hydrogen, in the amounts handled by our facility, is considered hazardous by the EPA.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and state rules and regulations.  Air Products manages the safety of the regulated processes by means of operating procedures, equipment testing and inspections, safety devices (e.g., alarms, shutdowns, instrumentation, relief devices) inherent in the design of this facility and other controls and systems designed to prevent accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  Safe work practices and training of our personnel supplement the inherent safe design of the plant.\n\nOur emergency response program is based upon OSHAAA?s HAZWOPER regulation.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for the notification of Industrial Emergency Services (IES) at Motiva Enterprises Refinery in Convent, Louisiana so that appropriate measures can be taken by local emergency responders to control accidental releases.\n\nThis document has been prepared in accordance with the EPAAA?s Risk Management Plan regulation (40 CFR, Part 68). The substances and processes considered during the preparation of this RMP and the scenarios described were selected based on criteria established in the regulation.\n\n2.  The stationary source and regulated substances handled:\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is the manufacturing of gaseous hydrogen.  Our refinery customer uses the hydrogen.  Natural gas and refinery fuel gas is received by our plant via pipeline and used as feedstock.  The feedstock is reacted in the reformer furnace.  By exposing the feedstock to a catalyst in the presence of heat (approximately 1,600 degrees F.) and steam, a chemical reaction takes place that converts the feedstock into hydrogen, carbon monoxide and carbon d"

The carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide are then separated from the hydrogen in a Pressure-Swing Adsorption (PSA) system.\n\nThe regulated substance handled at this facility is the flammable gas mixture. \n\n3.  The general accidental release prevention program and specific prevention steps:\n\nThe facility developed prevention program elements based on the Federal EPAAA?s Accidental Release Prevention Plan and OSHAAA?s Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation.  This facility was designed and constructed to comply  with applicable state and industry codes.\n\n4.  Five-year accident history:\n\nWe have had one accidental releases of flammable gas that did not result in any off-site impact to people or the environment.  It did result in property damage on site but no injuries.  \n\n5.  The emergency response program:\n\nThe facilityAA?s emergency response program is based upon OSHAAA?s HAZWOPER standard.  At this site, employees are trained to recognize emergencies and initiate emergency response from outside agencies.  They have been trained to OSHAAA?s First Responder Awareness Level.  The employees receive annual refresher training in their role in the emergency plan.  Emergency response activities are coordinated with IES at Motiva Enterprises Convent, Louisiana refinery. \n\n6.  Planned changes to improve safety:\n\nThe facility resolves recommendations from PHAs and Incident Investigations, some of which may result in modifications to the plant design and operating procedures."
