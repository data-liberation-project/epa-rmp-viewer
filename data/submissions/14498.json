Bluff facility.  The Ammonia storage and transfer process is subject to the RMP rule as a Program 3 process. \n\nAccidental release prevention and Emergency Response Policy\n\nIt is Farmlands corporate policy to eliminate accidental releases of any substance, in particular hazardous and regulated materials.  The management and employees of this facility are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases.  Accidental release prevention is critical to the safe operation of this terminal, the safety of its employees and the community.\n\nTo achieve its accident and accidental release prevention goals, Farmland is committed to the following:\n\n7 A knowledgeable, motivated and highly trained employee group\n7 A well-designed facility that is maintained and operated in a superior manner\n7 Implementation of a Comprehensive Process Safety Management and Prevention Program\n7 Continual review and improvements that enhance safety and accident prevention\n7 Excellence in safety programs and practices, and a superior safety and accident record\n7 Planning, preparation and training for emergency response\n\nThe Sgt.

Bluff ammonia terminal is subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) rule, 29CFR1910.119.  This rule has required this facility to establish an accident prevention program which is equivalent to that required for Program 3 processes under the EPAs RMP rule.\n\nThe OSHA PSM/EPA Prevention Program consists of a set of facility management policies and procedures that promote and recognize process safety and the prevention of accidents in processes that handle, use, store or process hazardous materials.  The procedures provide accident prevention process controls to all aspects of process activities.\n\nThe Sgt. Bluff terminal adheres to the requirements of PSM and has written policies and procedures addressing all aspects of PSM and EPA Prevention Program requirements including routine training and testing of employees and drivers that operate any part of the process, alarms to indicate operating conditions outside the norm, an off-hours phone notification system for abnormal conditions and automatic shutdown of ammonia transfer should control parameters fall outside normal conditions.

The impact of these potential releases must be quantified in accordance with release criteria dictated in the rule.  The projected impact distance is determined using EPA defined atmospheric conditions and is intended to provide a conservative estimate of the maximum possible area that might be affected.  According to the EPA, the worst-case scenario is intended to ensure that no potential risks to public health are overlooked, but the distance to an endpoint estimated under worst-case should not be considered a \"public danger zone.\""

It is prepared industrially from natural gas, steam and air.  Some of this ammonia is used for direct injection into croplands as a fertilizer.  A large amount of industrial ammonia is reacted with carbon dioxide to make urea fertilizer, or reacted to make ammonium nitrate fertilizer.  Ammonia is also frequently used as a refrigerant for the storage of perishable foods.\n\nAmmonia vapors can be irritating to the nose, throat, eyes and skin.  Direct liquid contact to the skin can cause severe burns.\n\nFarmland has considered potential worst-case releases from the refrigerated atmospheric storage tank which is passively mitigated by a secondary containment dike and a bullet tank, the two largest vessels onsite.\n\nFarmlands hypothetical worst-case scenario involves an anhydrous ammonia release from the terminals 30,000-ton refrigerated  atmospheric storage tank.  The worst case release assumes, as required by the rule, that this entire quantity is released as a result of a catastrophic failure of the tank,with subsequent evaporation from the diked pool.  This unlikely event was modeled with a publicly available model (DEGADIS).  The impact of this release scenario is predicted to extend beyond the facility boundary and impact public receptors.\n\nThis scenario, we believe, is a hypothetical worst-case event dictated by the rule and extremely unlikely to occur for many reasons.  In addition to the stringent design controls for this type of  vessel, facility maintenance and inspection programs address the int"

Generally, significantly lower quantities are involved, due to numerous shutdown safeguards present, as they are through out the terminal, and operator intervention which tend to mitigate and limit the consequences of failures.\n\nThe hypothetical ammonia alternative release scenario considered for this process is a release of ammonia due to the failure of a 4\" transfer pipe.  The pipe is assumed to fail and release ammonia for several minutes before employee intervention activates the Emergency Shut Down System which stops the release.  The impact of such a release was modeled with the DEGADIS model which shows that, under typical ambient conditions, the impact of the release would extend off-site.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes for Safety Improvements\n\nSafety improvements are a continual and ongoing process at the facility which is facilitated by the Prevention Program/Process Safety Management Program.  Formal process hazard analysis is conducted at least every five years, but review is constant through management of change procedures, operator training, incident investigation and mechanical integrity programs.  As a result, changes relevant to safety occur continuously as needs are identified through these procedures and policies."
