The Dayton facility is a batch process organic chemical production facility that operates 24 hours a day/ 7days a week.  The facility produces numerous products on three production lines, with a majority of products related to the production of chemicals for product manufacturing.\n\n\n\nThe chemicals regulated by RMP are Phosphorus Trichloride, Formaldehyde, and Acetaldehyde. They are utilized in various processes that are operated periodically as dictated by product demand each year.  Each individual chemical campaign may utilize a range of these chemicals as additives. Chemicals are ordered in as raw materials in bulk and non-bulk containers.The maximum amount of  phosphorus trichloride, 40000 lbs. will be the maximum amount(order quantity) stored on site. The maximum amount of Formaldehyde stored on site may reach 20000 pounds prior to use, and acetaldehyde may reach a maximum quantity of 40000 pounds. With the exception of the Acetaldehyde, most commodities are stored in the facility warehouse until used in the process. the acetaldehyde will be brought in via tankers.\n\n\n\nThe Dayton facility has robust safety, environmental and emergency response programs.   The facility is covered under OSHA's Process Safety Management standard, which requires it to conduct Process Hazard Assessments that identify hazards and protective measures in a chemical process; mechanical integrity programs to ensure proper equipment maintenance and numerous other requirements.  The facility is also ISO 9001-2015 certified, corporate policies require CYMER,LLC to document and conform to environmental procedures and conduct internal and receive external audits.\n\n\n\nCYMER, LLC Facility at Dayton has equipment and various hazmat trained response team.
