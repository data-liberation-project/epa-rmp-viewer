      "SummaryText": "   Bordulac Farmers Elevator, located in Bordulac, ND, handles an anhydrous ammonia plant which was opened in the spring of 1999.   As with our mother company, Kensal Farmers Elevator of Kensal, ND, which has been operating for over 20 years with no accidental discharge or injuries as a result of operations,  the Bordulac plant will also be operated with the utmost care, concern and training.  This will be accomplished by a rigid maintenance program on both the storage facility and the application equipment.  We will also provide training to all employees who are involved in the operation of the facility.  These employees in turn are qualified to inspect customer owned application equipment as well as instructing end users on proper handling.  We have also hired an independent Safety and Health Director to provide regular facility inspections and employee training sessions.  Through these training sessions, our employees are reminded of the preventive maintenance needed, and train them how to respond properly to an emergency.  We are coordinated with our local emergency management department.  In the remote case of a hose lead, or the complete loss of product from our largest container, we are prepared to handle it as safely for everyone as possible."
