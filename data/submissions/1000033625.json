California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program - Title 19 CCR, Chapter 4.5\n\n?    Federal EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) - Title 40 CFR ?68\n\n?

As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible and updated as necessary. To accomplish this, Castle Rock Vineyards has elected to use PSMWriter, software developed and distributed by Resource Compliance, Inc. This software will assist us with updating, maintaining, scheduling, and tracking RMP-PSM related activities. \n\n\n\n1.1    CASTLE ROCK VINEYARDS, RISK & PROCESS SAFETY MANAGEMENT PROGRAM \n\n\n\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that Castle Rock Vineyards has updated/developed their unified RMP-PSM Program.

The program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of hazardous chemicals. Overall, the program is designed to prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.\n\n\n\nCastle Rock Vineyards has an exemplary safety record, one that we are quite proud of.

Organized the program so that it meshes closely with general Castle Rock Vineyards business practices\n\n3.    Utilized PSMWriter software to ensure that all necessary Castle Rock Vineyards employees have access to relevant information (SOPs, PHAs, audits, etc.)\n\n\n\nThe RMP-PSM program sets forth rules, procedures and practices that will help our employees protect themselves and our neighbors.\n\n\n\n1.2    PROCESS DESCRIPTION\n\n\n\nThe Castle Rock Vineyards facility is a commercial cold storage facility for table grapes. The facility has an ammonia system that provides refrigeration capacity to multiple cold rooms equipped with forced air tunnels for cooling fruit. Some rooms are designated as \"precooling\" rooms, while others are for cold storage. The rooms are equipped with \"bunker style\" and ceiling suspended evaporator coils that contain chilled liquid ammonia. There is a cooled loading dock area as well. A computer system provides substantial control and alarm capability.\n\n\n\nHigh pressure liquid from a high pressure receivers is piped to a main king valve. From there, high pressure liquid is piped to each cold room, where it passes through an expansion valve into a low pressure accumulator vessel. Low temperature liquid circulates by thermal convection through the evaporator coils located behind bunker walls in the cold rooms. Low pressure and temperature gas collects in the accumulator vessel, and passes through a pressure regulator into a suction line. The suction line returns the vapor to the main suction accumulator vessel, which separates any residual liquid from the gas. The gas is piped to compressors which elevate the temperature and pressure of the gas. The high pressure discharge from the compressors is sent to water cooled evaporative condensers where the high pressure gas ammonia is liquefied and returned to the high pressure receivers. Liquid separated from the suction return "

      "SummaryText": "gas in the main suction accumulator drains into liquid transfer vessels. Operation of a float switch activated solenoid valve raises the pressure in the liquid transfer vessel to the point the liquid can be drained into the high pressure receivers.\n\n\n\nThe facility was built by professional refrigeration engineers in accordance with industry standards at the time. It was also built in compliance with the Uniform Mechanical Code and Uniform Building Code applicable at the time of construction. Recently the following major system modifications have occurred:\n\n?    2006 - California Controlled Atmosphere installed the a new control system for the refrigeration system\n\n?    2008 - California Controlled Atmosphere supplied and installed the refrigeration equipment for Rooms 15-18\n\n?    2009 - California Controlled Atmosphere replaced the coils in Room 9\n\n?    2010 - California Controlled Atmosphere moved a screw compressor from Plant 2 to Plant 1\n\n\n\nThe system contains numerous safety devices including sensors which stop the compressors if temperatures or pressures exceed or drop below established limits, and safety relief valves which vent ammonia gas to the atmosphere or a water diffusion tank (Rooms 15-18) if the pressure in the system exceeds their set point. In addition, ammonia detectors are located throughout the facility, and will shut down equipment if ammonia is detected. Lastly, an emergency \"dump box\" contains switches and valves to turn off equipment and vent ammonia if necessary.\n\n\n\nThe ammonia system at this facility consists of equipment and vessels which are interconnected by piping. Therefore, the system is treated as a single process.\n\n\n\n1.3    GENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE & CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\n1.3.1    GENERAL \n\n\n\nWe inform our employees engaged in process operations of the dangers of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia in annual safety meetings. During these meeting we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared "

      "SummaryText": "for a release.\n\nCastle Rock Vineyards has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the ammonia refrigeration process. These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release. The results of the analyses are reported in the body of the program. \n\n\n\n1.3.2    ANHYDROUS AMMONIA\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration process at the Castle Rock Vineyards facility is an integral part of the overall business and operates most of the year. It is extremely important that this process is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner. Management is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.\n\n\n\nOur refrigeration personnel monitor the ammonia refrigeration process and keep an active log book of all procedures and transactions that pertain to ammonia. In addition, the process is checked frequently by one of the outside refrigeration contractors that we use. These contractors also assist in performing the annual mechanical integrity inspection of our ammonia equipment. \n\n\n\n1.4    FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nCastle Rock Vineyards has had no accidental release within the last five (5) years.\n\n\n\n1.5    EMERGENCY ACTION AND RESPONSE PLAN\n\n\n\nCastle Rock Vineyards' emergency action and response program has been developed to satisfy the following requirements:\n\n?    California \"Emergency Action Plan\" - Title 8 CCR ?3220\n\n?    Federal \"Emergency Action Plan\" - Title 29 CFR ?1910.38 \n\n?    California \"Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response\" (HAZWOPER) - Title 8 CCR Title 8 ?5192(q)\n\n?    Federal \"Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response\" (HAZWOPER) - Title 29 CFR ?1910.120(q)\n\n\n\nStrategically, we will respond \"minimally\" to a release. Under this plan we will call emergency personnel and evacuate the facility. All response activities would be done in coordination with the Local Fire Department and their Hazardous Materials Response Team. \n\n\n\nEver"

Nevertheless, Castle Rock Vineyards continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.\n\n\n\nBy utilizing PSMWriter software, all necessary employees have access to every aspect of the RMP-PSM program. This has improved Castle Rock Vineyards' ability to communicate hazardous situations to employees and contractors. In addition, PSMWriter tracks all RMP-PSM related events so that Castle Rock Vineyards' management team can ensure that the RMP-PSM program is being implemented.\n\nCastle Rock Vineyards has implemented all aspects of the RMP-PSM program. When a RMP-PSM program requirement is completed (i.e. mechanical integrity inspection, process hazard analysis, compliance audit, etc.) any specific action items related to that event are entered into PSMWriter, assigned a responsible person, and given a due date. Once the action item has been completed, the resolution can be documented using PSMWriter as well. A list of current or past due action items can be accessed at any time by those with access to PSMWriter.\n\n\n\nIn addition to utilizing PSMWriter to create, schedule, track, and document events, Castle Rock Vineyards has also entered into a contract with Resource Compliance to obtain help with RMP-PSM program implementation. A copy of Resource Compliance's service agreement has been included in this program with the support material.\n\n\n\nFor the future, Castle Rock Vineyards now thinks of the RMP-PSM program as a \"living document\". It is an interactive framework that guides safe action for Castle Rock Vineyards employees, but allows for feedback and continual improvement. Through the RMP-PSM program Castle Rock Vineyards will continue to maintain overall plant worker and"
