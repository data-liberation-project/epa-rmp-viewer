A PHA was conducted for the main HF and aqueous HF processes in 1989 and was recertified in 1995 and 2000.  A PHA was conducted for the ultra-high purity HF process in 1994 and again in 1999.  Management of change evaluations and prestartup safety reviews are conducted for all modifications.",

Introduction \n\n\n\nThe Honeywell International Inc. (Honeywell) Geismar Site is a manufacturing facility located in Geismar, Louisiana.  It is part of the Specialty Chemicals Business Unit of Honeywell International Inc.  Headquartered in Morris Township, New Jersey, Honeywell is an advanced technology and manufacturing company serving customers worldwide with aerospace and automotive products, chemicals, fibers, plastics and advanced materials.  With 1999 sales of approximately $24 billion, the company ranks among the top 100 of the Fortune 500.  Honeywell has approximately 125,000 employees in 95 countries.  Honeywell is a diversified technology and manufacturing leader, serving customers worldwide with aerospace products and services; control technologies for buildings, homes and industry; automotive products; power generation systems; specialty chemicals; fibers; plastics; and electronic and advanced materials.  More information about Honeywell may be found at its Web Page: www.honeywell.com.\n\n\n\nIt is the world wide policy of Honeywell to design, manufacture and distribute its products and to handle and dispose of materials throughout their life cycle in a manner that protects the environment and safeguards employees, customers, and the public from unacceptable risk.  Honeywell's complete Health, Safety and Environmental Policy may be found at the Honeywell Web Page.\n\n\n\nThe Honeywell Geismar Site participates in the Responsible Care program of the Chemical Manufacturers Association.  The Community Awareness and Emergency Response Code of Responsible Care brings chemical plants and local communities together through communications and cooperative emergency planning. The Process Safety Code of Responsible Care is designed to prevent fires, explosions, and accidental chemical releases.  The code requires safety audits, inspection a"

Facilities are encouraged to listen to the concerns of the community and to consider these concerns when designing and implementing process safety systems.  The Honeywell Geismar Site endeavors to accomplish this by sponsoring and regularly meeting with established local Community Advisory Panels. Honeywell's Geismar site participates in community advisory panels for both Ascension and Iberville Parishes.\n\n\n\n2. Plant Description\n\n\n\nThe Honeywell Geismar Site is located primarily in Ascension Parish on the Mississippi River at Mile 187.0 and is bounded by highways 75, 3115 and 30. Honeywell shares the site with three other chemical manufacturing facilities.  The area is predominately rural with adjacent and nearby chemical manufacturing facilities. There are no immediate residential neighbors.  The plant employs approximately 180 company and about 90 contract workers.\n\n\n\nThe Honeywell Geismar Site's five covered processes manufacture new generation ozone friendly refrigerants, inorganic acids and fluoropolymer resin. The Hydrogen Fluoride Plant manufactures hydrogen fluoride.  The Multiproducts Plant manufactures 1,1,1,2 tetrafluoroethane (HFC 134a), pentafluoroethane (HFC 125) and 1-chloro-1,2,2-tetrafluoroethane (HCFC 124).  The Aclon Resin Plant manufactures fluoropolymer resin.  The 125 Plant manufactures pentafluroethane (HFC 125).  The 245fa Plant manufactures 1,1,1,3,3-pentafluoropropane (HFC 245fa).\n\n\n\nAnhydrous hydrogen fluoride is used as a raw material in the manufacture of refrigerants, fluorocarbons, gasoline, as well as other chemical derivatives.  Aqueous solutions of hydrogen fluoride are used in the manufacture of electronic components, circuit boards, steel, high-purity quartz, light bulbs televisions, and computer monitors.\n\n\n\nHFC 134a is used as a refrigerant in automotive applications.  HFC 125 is used as a refrigerant in residential air conditioners and commercial "

The largest anhydrous hydrogen fluoride storage vessel is a horizontal, cylindrical steel tank located in an outdoor tank park in the hydrogen fluoride plant.
