SCR is located near the intersection of Louisiana Highways 44 and 70 at Union, St. James Parish Louisiana. The refinery is situated along the east bank of the Mississippi River at mile marker 168.\n\nConvent Refinery operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products (e.g., refinery gas, propane, butane, gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, furnace oil, etc.) from raw crude oil. The refinery has several regulated flammables, such as propane and butane, as well as flammable mixtures.\n\n\n\nOne of the by-products of petroleum refining is hydrogen sulfide, which is an EPA RMP listed toxic substance. Within the refinery, hydrogen sulfide is converted into elemental sulfur, which is a marketable product. Hydrogen sulfide is not stored in the refinery, and the quantity in any single process does not exceed the EPA RMP threshold quantity. Other substances used in the refinery that appear on the EPA RMP toxic substance list include aqueous ammonia. However, the quantity of this material in a process unit is below the EPA RMP thresholds quantity.\n\n\n\nSCR RMP is composed of three elements. These elements are: 1. Identification and Assessment of Hazards, 2. Prevention and Preparedness, and 3. Emergency Response. These three elements are summarized below. This RMP revision is being submitted as required by 40 CFR 68.190 (b) (1), as a five year update.\n\n\n\nIDENTIFICATION AND ASSESSMENT OF HAZARDS\n\n\n\nThe SCR facility was reviewed for the storage or usage of chemicals from the list of covered chemicals. Through the review process, it was determined that SCR has sufficient quantity such"

This commitment is expressed in the Company's policy statement: Shell is committed to protecting the health and safety of employees and others in our workplaces and protecting the environment and public wherever we conduct business activities. We are committed to the belief that all occupational injuries and illnesses are preventable and that serious or fatal injuries resulting from our activities are unacceptable. Each employee has a personal and vital responsibility to contribute to safe work performance. Our objective is to continuously improve our Safety, Health and Environmental performance, and in so doing, to be recognized as a leader in our industry. The refinery complies with all safety, health, and environmental laws and regulations and will manage performance in these areas in the same manner as other aspects of our business.\n\n\n\nSCR's first objective is prevention of all accidents. Recognizing the possibility of an accident despite prevention efforts, this refinery places high value on preparedness. Safety features are designed into the process units to help control, detect, and minimize the impact of a release. Some of these are:\n\n- Elimination of the risk through engineering design. In all of these cases, the changes have resulted in significant reduction of chemical risk. This risk reduction has greatly minimized the\n\nchance of an accident that could have a public impact, as well as reducing the risk to contractors and support staff, and the environment.\n\n- This site has release detection systems and alarms to warn personnel of potential hazard in a controlled process unit.\n\n- Release mitigation systems, including:\n\n     Fire suppression and extinguishing system\n\n     Deluge syste"

Because processes at the refinery that are regulated by the EPA RMP regulations are also subject to the OSHA PSM standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\n\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nConvent Refinery maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address the hazards of the chemicals in the processes, the technology of the processes, and the equipment used in the processes. Specific departments within the refinery are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information. Employees and contractors are informed of the location of process safety information that is relevant to their work.\n\n\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs). MSDSs are readily available through Convent Refinery's computer system. \n\n\n\nConvent Refinery also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature rating, electrical area classifications, piping and instrument diagrams (P&IDs), etc. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenanc"

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify reasonably foreseeable hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these potential hazards.\n\n\n\nSCR uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations. HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques. The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates potential hazards of the\n\nprocess as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\n\n\nThe PHA team findings are entered into a computer database called Fountain Assurance Management (FAM) system. The findings are assigned to appropriate departments for resolution.\n\n\n\nImplementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team. This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention. All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\n\n\nThe PHAs are revalidated on a 5 year cycle or when a significant change is required.\n\n\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nSCR maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as Startup,Normal Operations, Temporary Operations, Emergency Shutdown, Normal Shutdown, and Initial startup of a new process.

These procedures are periodically reviewed for accuracy. The procedures are maintained current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process. Operating procedures are readily available to operators and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\n\n\nUpper and lower operating limits, consequences of deviation, and steps required to correct or avoid deviation for critical parameters, such as pressure, temperature, level, etc., are included in the operating procedures. This can be found in the ESP and UTL variable table. \n\n\n\nIn addition to Operating Procedures, SCR has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety. Examples of these include control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, procedure for safe removal of hazardous materials before process piping or equipment is opened, a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (I.E. hot work), and a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space. These procedures and others along with training of affected personnel form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\n\n\n\n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, Convent Refinery has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.

Thus, refresher training is a continuing effort. Operator training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\n\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nConvent Refinery has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition. The basic aspects of this program include: Conducting Training, Developing Written Procedures, Performing inspections and tests, Correcting Identified Deficiencies, and Applying Quality Assurance Measures. In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process equipment.\n\n\n\nMaintenance personnel receive training on an overview of the process, safety and health hazards, applicable maintenance procedures, emergency response plans, and applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their job in a safe manner. Applicable written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training. Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended, and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels).

The final resolution of each finding is documented in a computer database, and the two most recent audit reports are retained. \n\n\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nSCR promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury. The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team documents its findings,develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and enters the information into a computer database for tracking. Each recommendation is promptly assigned to an appropriate department for resolution.

An approved hot work permit is required if a source of ignition may be created on the refinery property. Sources of ignition include welding, burning, portable internal combustion engines, electrical power tools, drilling, etc., and any other work or operations which by its nature may produce flame, spark or sufficient heat to ignite flammable vapors. In addition to hot work, the work permit system also includes requirements for entry into confined spaces, as well as requirements for other than hot work. The existing work permit system serves as a framework for all other safe work practices.\n\n\n\n\n\nContractor Safety\n\nSCR uses contractors for routine maintenance activities, maintenance during shutdown periods, and for construction activities. Contractors are also used for less safety sensitive work, such as security, janitorial, ground maintenance, engineering, clerical, etc. \n\n\n\nContractors performing the more safety sensitive work dealing with direct maintenance and construction activities are subjected to more stringent safety requirements to assure that they perform their work in a safe manner, have the appropriate knowledge and skills, are aware of the hazards of the workplace, understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, understand and follow site safety rules, and inform refinery personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.
