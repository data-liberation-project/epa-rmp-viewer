SCR is located near the intersection of Louisiana Highways 44 and 70 at Union, St. James Parish Louisiana. The refinery is situated along the east bank of the Mississippi River at mile marker 168.\r\nConvent Refinery operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products (e.g., refinery gas, propane, butane, gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, furnace oil, etc.) from raw crude oil. The refinery has several regulated flammables, such as propane and butane, as well as flammable mixtures.\r\n\r\nOne of the by-products of petroleum refining is hydrogen sulfide, which is an EPA RMP listed toxic substance. Within the refinery, hydrogen sulfide is converted into elemental sulfur, which is a marketable product. Hydrogen sulfide is not stored in the refinery, and the quantity in any single process does not exceed the EPA RMP threshold quantity. Other substances used in the refinery that appear on the EPA RMP toxic substance list include aqueous ammonia. However, the quantity of this material in a process unit is below the EPA RMP thresholds quantity.\r\n\r\nSCR RMP is composed of three elements. These elements are: 1. Identification and Assessment of Hazards, 2. Prevention and Preparedness, and 3. Emergency Response. These three elements are summarized below. This RMP revision is being submitted as required by 40 CFR 68.190 (b) (1), as a five year update.\r\n\r\nIDENTIFICATION AND ASSESSMENT OF HAZARDS\r\n\r\nThe SCR facility was reviewed for the storage or usage of chemicals from the list of covered chemicals. Through the review process, it was determined that SCR has sufficient quantity such"

This commitment is expressed in the Company's policy statement: Shell is committed to protecting the health and safety of employees and others in our workplaces and protecting the environment and public wherever we conduct business activities. We are committed to the belief that all occupational injuries and illnesses are preventable and that serious or fatal injuries resulting from our activities are unacceptable. Each employee has a personal and vital responsibility to contribute to safe work performance. Our objective is to continuously improve our Safety, Health and Environmental performance, and in so doing, to be recognized as a leader in our industry. The refinery complies with all safety, health, and environmental laws and regulations and will manage performance in these areas in the same manner as other aspects of our business.\r\n\r\nSCR's first objective is prevention of all accidents. Recognizing the possibility of an accident despite prevention efforts, this refinery places high value on preparedness. Safety features are designed into the process units to help control, detect, and minimize the impact of a release. Some of these are:\r\n- Elimination of the risk through engineering design. In all of these cases, the changes have resulted in significant reduction of chemical risk. This risk reduction has greatly minimized the\r\nchance of an accident that could have a public impact, as well as reducing the risk to contractors and support staff, and the environment.\r\n- This site has release detection systems and alarms to warn personnel of potential hazard in a controlled process unit.\r\n- Release mitigation systems, including:\r\n     Fire suppression and extinguishing system\r\n     Deluge syste"

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify reasonably foreseeable hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these potential hazards.\r\n\r\nSCR uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations. HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques. The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates potential hazards of the\r\nprocess as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\r\n\r\nThe PHA team findings are entered into a computer database called Fountain Assurance Management (FAM) system. The findings are assigned to appropriate departments for resolution.\r\n\r\nImplementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team. This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention. All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\r\n\r\nThe PHAs are revalidated on a 5 year cycle or when a significant change is required.\r\n\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\nSCR maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as Startup,Normal Operations, Temporary Operations, Emergency Shutdown, Normal Shutdown, and Initial startup of a new process."

The procedures are maintained current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process. Operating procedures are readily available to operators and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\r\n\r\nUpper and lower operating limits, consequences of deviation, and steps required to correct or avoid deviation for critical parameters, such as pressure, temperature, level, etc., are included in the operating procedures. This can be found in the ESP and UTL variable table. \r\n\r\nIn addition to Operating Procedures, SCR has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety. Examples of these include control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, procedure for safe removal of hazardous materials before process piping or equipment is opened, a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (I.E. hot work), and a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.

This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology, (including process operation conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented. A risk assessment is performed on all changes. \r\n\r\nChanges are reviewed to ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and to verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.
