Rogers Water \nTreatment Plant, in compliance with 40 CFR 68. \n\nThe main objectives of this RMP are to: \n\n(1) Communicate the extent of a possible chlorine release \nand identify possible receptors (Hazard Assessment), \n\nThe Hazard Assessment communicates the possible extent of a \nworst case release and an alternative `more likely' release. \nThe Hazard Assessment also identifies potential public and \nenvironmental receptors that may be affected in the event of \na chlorine release.\n\n(2) Develop strategies to prevent an accidental release \n(Prevention Program), \n\nThe goal of the Prevention Program is to integrate \ntechnologies, procedures, and management practices to \nminimize the probability of an accidental chlorine release. \nThe Prevention Program incorporates safety information, \nhazard review, operating procedures, training, maintenance, \ncompliance audits, and incident investigations.\n\n(3) Formulate contingency planning in the case of an \naccidental release (Emergency Response Program).\n\nThe Emergency Response Program is modeled after the EPWU-\nPSB's `Emergency Response Action Plan' and the Chlorine \nInstitute's `Emergency Response Plans for Chlorine Plans for \nChlorine Facilities.' The Emergency Response Program \nincorporates an emergency response plan, emergency response \nequipment procedures, training in relevant procedures for \nemployees involved in the chlorination process, and \nprocedures to review and update, as appropriate, the \nemergency response plan to reflect changes and ensure that \nemployees are informed of changes.\n\n2 STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE HANDLED\n\nThe Jonathan W. Rogers Water Treatment Plant is located in \neast El Paso on Southside Road approximately two miles east \nof Americas Avenue. The r"

      "SummaryText": "egulated substance handled at this \nfacility is chlorine. The chlorination process building at \nthis plant is located at the east end of the facility. The \nenclosed chlorination process building includes a chlorine \ncontainer storage area and a chlorination process room. The \nchlorine storage area contains ten (10) one-ton pressurized \nliquid chlorine containers, scales and manifolds, a monorail \nhoist system, and chlorine gas sensors and alarms. \nTypically, ten (10) chlorine containers are used in the \nchlorination process at a time. The chlorination process \nroom contains the chlorinators, injectors, pumps, residual \nanalyzers, and the chlorine leak detectors. The leak \ndetection system is capable of alarming when the chlorine \nlevels reach or exceed 3.0 parts per million(ppm). The \naudible and visual alarm system alerts personnel in case of \na chlorine release.\n\nThe level of concern or `toxic endpoint' for chlorine is 3.0 \nppm (40 CFR 68.22).  An accidental release of a regulated \nsubstance is considered to result in no adverse impact to \npublic health at distances, from the point of release, \nextending beyond the toxic endpoint.\n\n3 WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO(S) AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE \nSCENARIO(S)\n\nThe RMP rule requires the EPWU-PSB to conduct offsite \nconsequence analyses for two chlorine release scenarios, \nidentified as `worst case release' and `alternative release' \nscenarios. The worst case release scenario is defined by the \nRMP rule as `the release of the largest quantity of a \nregulated substance from a vessel or process line failure \nthat results in the greatest distance to [the toxic] \nendpoint' (40 CFR 68.3). The alternative release scenario is \ndefined as a release more likely to occur than the worst \ncase scenario.  \n\nThe release scenarios were modeled using the air dispersion \nmodel Areal Locations of Hazardous Atmospheres (ALOHA). The \nworst case release scenario is the release of the entire \ncontents of a one-ton container under the conditions \n"

      "SummaryText": "prescribed by the RMP rule. The distance to the toxic \nendpoint for the worst case release scenario is 2.5 miles. \nThe alternative release scenario is the release of chlorine \nfrom a pipe leak with a hole diameter of 1/8 inch. Since the \nfacility is equipped with a scrubber with a capacity to \nneutralize 25 tons of chlorine, the distance to the toxic \nendpoint for the alternative release scenario is 0 miles.\n\n4 GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL \nSPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe EPWU-PSB accidental release prevention program is based \non the following elements:\n\n(1) Preventive maintenance program;\n(2) Use of accurate and effective operating procedures;\n(3) Performance of a hazard review of equipment and \nprocedures; and\n(4) Implementation of an auditing and inspection program.\n\nChemical-specific prevention steps include availability of \nself-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA), worn by the \noperators during connection/disconnection of chlorine \nsupply, awareness of the hazardous and toxic properties of \nchlorine, and presence of chlorine detectors.\n\n5 FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nNo accidental releases have occurred at the facility in the \npast five years (June 1994 - June 1999).\n\n6 EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe Emergency Response Program for this facility is based \nupon the EPWU-PSB's `Emergency Response Action Plan' and the \nChlorine Institute's `Emergency Response Plans for Chlorine \nFacilities.' The Emergency Response Program has been \ncoordinated with the El Paso County Local Emergency Planning \nCommittee (LEPC) and the El Paso Fire Department Hazardous \nMaterials Division. This program is in compliance with the \nRMP Emergency Response Program requirements. \n\n7 PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe EPWU-PSB plans to review and revise, as necessary, the \nchlorination process operating procedures in order to make \ncertain that the operators understand the human factors that \nmay lead to accidental releases."
