To assist with ongoing compliance, a \"Chemical Accident Prevention Compliance Manual\" has been prepared and implemented.  Concerning the emergency response policy at the facility, the owner has made the decision that employees will not respond to accidental releases of regulated substances and will instead evacuate.  This facility processes natural gas liquids (NGL).  Gas wells are routed through high pressure separators and a gas plant is used to strip out NGL product which is stored in a 30,000 gallon pressurized bullet tank operating at approximately 150 psig.  The NGL is removed from the facility by transfers to tank trucks.  The stationary source covered by this plan is only that equipment downstream of the gas plant and including the gas plant.  The facility is subject to the RMP requirements since it is a natural gas processing plant producing NGL and contains threshold quantities of regulated substances.  The NGL is a mixture of hydrocarbons consisting of methane, ethane, butane, isobutane, and propane.  For purposes of determining the largest weight on site, the highest density substance was used (butane for NGL) which yielded a total weight of 156,000 pounds.  Since this facility is a Program 2, a documented prevention program is required.  This program is discussed in a \"Chemical Accident Prevention Compliance Manual\" prepared for the facility.  The facility has not experienced a release as defined in the regulation within the past five years.  Since this facility is a Program 2, a written emergency response program is required.  This program is contained in Section 5.0 of the \"Chemical Accident Prevention Compliance Manual\" prepared for the facility.  Further, emergency response procedures have been developed and are contained with the RMP and these procedures will be impl"
