Shasta that the receipt, storage and handling of chlorine at its facilities be done in a manner which meets regulatory requirements and minimizes the probability and severity of accidental releases of chlorine to the atmosphere, in order to protect the health and safety of its workers, the public, and the environment.  In order to accomplish this goal, the City of Mt. Shasta has gathered safety information on chlorine and on the process, equipment and procedures involving chlorine; performed a structured assessment of hazards of the process and external events which might affect the process; performed an offsite consequences analysis of defined release scenarios; established a written program for prevention and mitigation of accidental releases; and has plans to establish a written emergency response program coordinated with emergency response agencies.\n\nADMINISTRATIVE CONTROLS\n\nAdministrative controls in effect at the City of Mt. Shasta which were considered to mitigate the severity of the Worst Case and Alternative Case release scenarios include the City's written policies and procedures for training of operators and maintenance personnel, written procedures for control of the inventory of chlorine at the facility, and policies regarding quality level of replacement materials and components for the chlorine system.\n\nMITIGATION MEASURES\n\nPassive mitigation measures were considered to limit the severity of the Worst Case scenario.

Shasta are categorized as administrative (management) programs; procedures, training, and engineering controls; and emergency response programs.\n\nThe City of Mt. Shasta has instituted a Process Safety Management (PSM) Program meeting OSHA requirements at 29 CFR 1910.119 and CalOSHA GISO Section 5189 covering the disinfection process at the Wastewater Treatment Plant.  This constitutes the general accidental release prevention program for the City's operations at this facility. The program and document management procedures included in the PSM Program will be used as the management system for the Risk Management Program.\n\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC RELEASE PREVENTION STEPS\n\nRelease prevention steps specific to chlorine have been identified and implemented.  These include improvements in operating procedures, installing a wind sock, replacing the manual hoist with a motorized trolley, sealing off the doorway connecting  the chlorine storage room and the rest of the Operations Building, and improving the egress of the ton container storage room by adding a personnel door with panic hardware. The installation of a motorized trolley was accomplished within the last update period.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no reportable accidents involving chlorine at this facility within the past five years. \n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe City of Mt. Shasta's Emergency Response plan applicable to chlorine has been coordinated with Siskiyou County Public Health Department, the agency responsible for hazardous materials inventory reporting and release response coordination. The emergency response program is coordinated with the seven-county Shasta-Cascade HazMat Response Team (SCHMRT).\n\nPLANNED CHAN"
