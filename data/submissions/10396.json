However, should a release occur, plant personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\nDescription of Stationary Source and Regulated Substances:\nThe Keystone gas processing plant is located in the Allegheny National Forest two miles east of state highway 2003 on Zimmerman Hill road and then 0.5 miles east on gravel road.  The plant processes about 6 MMSCFD of natural gas and provides both a service and a product.  The gas is dehydrated and hydrocarbons, which might otherwise condense in the transmission pipeline and cause problems, are removed, thus producing a saleable gas product.  The hydrocarbons that are recovered are fractionated into propane, butane and natural gasoline products.  Total liquid production is approximately 350 BPD with total propane and butane storage capacity of 1,930 Bbls.  The plant has inlet gas dehydration and utilizes a mixed refrigerant process for hydrocarbon recovery.  The plant contains several regulated flammables such as propane and butane.  No threshold quantity of a regulated toxic is present at the plant site.\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results:\nThe WCS is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) involving the full capacity of the largest propane storage tank, 123,000 Lbs.  Although a written procedure is in place to limit the inventory to 90% of capacity, the entire tank capacity was used in this scenario.  EPA's RMP*COMP software was used to determine that the maximum distance to a 1 psi endpoint was 0.4 miles.  \n\nGeneral Accidental Release Program:\nThis facility was built in accordance with the appropriate mechanical and electrical codes for gas processing plants and is subject to OSHA's PSM program.  Written programs and procedures cover all of the"

      "SummaryText": "key elements of the PSM program and the employees are well trained in the safe operation of this facility.  \n\nChemical-Specific Prevention Steps: \nThe Keystone plant includes the following safety features:\n1. Hydrocarbon detectors with alarms.\n2. Process safety relief valves.\n3. Automated plant shutdown system.  The plant will be automatically shutdown should key process parameters vary from specified ranges. \n4. Manual valves to permit isolation of various portions of the process.\n5. Appropriately placed portable fire extinguishers to combat incipient stage fires.\n\nFive Year Accident History:\nThe Keystone plant was placed in operation in 1986.  The plant has had no accidental releases that resulted in deaths or injuries on site or produced offsite effects.  In January of 1998 the plant did experience the failure of a pressure vessel which resulted in significant damage ($500,000) to on site facilities.  This was caused by exterior corrosion (rust) that occurred under the vessel insulation.  Since that time, the plant's entire mechanical integrity program has been reviewed and the inspection program has been enhanced to detect future losses of metal thickness.\n\nEmergency Response Program Information:\nThe Keystone plant Emergency Response Plan has been coordinated with the Warren County Control Office.  The plan has been posted at the plant and all employees have been trained in the actions to be taken in event of an emergency.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\nNo changes to the safety program or plant facilities are currently planned.  However, weekly safety meetings are held during which incidents are reviewed, safety procedures discussed and changes proposed.  Our safety program is constantly improving."
