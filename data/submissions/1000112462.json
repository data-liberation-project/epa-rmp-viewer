      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY FOR ARG\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nAt American Refining Group, Inc. (ARG), we are committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes in a safe and responsible manner. We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n* Facility specific information and use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulations\n* Results from our assessment of the potential offsite consequences from accidental chemical releases\n* An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\n* A five year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP regulations\n* An overview of our emergency response program\n* Certification statement required by EPA\n* Detailed information (data elements) about our risk management program\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nARG produces petroleum base oils, naphtha's, distillates, resins, extracts, gasoline, diesel fuel, fuel oils, and blended lubricant products. The oil refinery consists of a Crude Oil Tank Farm, Crude Distillation Unit, Unifiner/Platformer Unit, Isomerization Unit, ROSE (de-resining) Unit, MEK (Dewaxing) Unit, Extract Unit, Boiler House, and Bulk Loading (fuels, naphtha's).  Of these processes/areas, the ROSE and MEK Units have each been identified as containing more than 10,000 pounds of a RMP regulated substance (propane) and are thus covered under EPA's RMP regulations.  The remaining processes/areas either do not contain flammable or toxic materials above threshold quantities, or contain mixtures of listed regulated flammable substances above the threshold quantity but are exempt based on Subpart F of the EPA's RMP rule. The ROSE and MEK processes"

      "SummaryText": "contain the following RMP regulated flammable chemicals with the potential for causing off-site consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release:\n\nROSE Unit - propane is unloaded from trucks to E-1 storage vessel (71,105 lbs). Propane is used as a solvent in the ROSE process to extract resins from the cylinder stock charge.\n\nMEK Unit - propane is unloaded from trucks to D-23/D-18 storage vessel (34,157 lbs). Propane is used for chilling the products charged to the MEK Unit for de-waxing operations. \n\nWorst case scenario for the Rose unit was calculated off the volume for E-1 begin full 4012.9 ft3 and using a propane density of 30.777 lb/ft3, the total volume would be 123505 lbs.\n\nWorst case for the MEK was established based on the unit SOP which uses a 60% maximum limit for D-23 when filling from a delivery truck, that is 60% height in the horizontal vessel based on the sight glass.  \nD-23: 1288.4 ft3, 9637.8 gal, 40713 lbs. \n\nOur accidental release prevention programs and our contingency planning efforts help us effectively manage the hazards that are posed to our employees, the public, and the environment by our use of these chemicals.\n\nWe use our off-site consequence analysis information to help us ensure that our emergency response plan and the community emergency response plan address potential scenarios.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nWe take a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental release of hazardous chemicals.  Our management systems address each of the key elements of successful prevention programs including:\n\n* Process Safety Information\n* Process Hazard Analysis\n* Operating Procedures\n* Training\n* Mechanical Integrity\n* Management of Change\n* Pre-Startup Safety Review\n* Compliance Audits\n* Incident Investigation\n* Employee Participation\n* Hot Work\n* Contractors\n* Emergency Planning & Response\n\nThese elements of our prevention program work together to prevent accidental"

Our company and our employees are committed to the standard that these management systems set for the way we do business, and we have specific accountabilities and controls to ensure that we are meeting our high standards for accident prevention.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nWe keep records for all significant accidental chemical releases that occur at our facility. There have been no accidental chemical releases involving materials covered under EPA's RMP rule during the past five years.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nWe maintain an Emergency Response Plan, which incorporates state and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning. Our facility maintains volunteer emergency response teams for responding to emergency situations including a Fire Brigade, Hazardous Materials Response Team, Rope Rescue Team, and First Aid Medical Response Team.  Our program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations. We are active participants in our Local Emergency Planning Commission (McKean County) and coordinate our plan with the community emergency response.  \n\nRECENT AND PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nStarting in 2022 ARG began using LOPA analysis  within the PHA's for risk assignments at a severity level of \u0093A\u0094 or \u0093B\u0094 for safety, environmental and financial impacts. The LOPA study utilized the newly developed ARG corporate guidelines to further identify all applicable safety systems in place and determined the likelihood of the scenarios. The LOPA process then determines if the risk is mitigated enough to satisfy the risk tolerance criteria. Any LOPA \u0093GAPs\u0094 were documented and recommendations were developed to close the gaps. \n\nSignificant improvements continue to be made in the  plants infrastructure including fire protection equipment (800 tank (ongoing) a second fire truck, foam chambers on storage tanks etc...), replacement of aged equipment"

      "SummaryText": ", and general increased maintenance of the facility.\n\nARG continues to enhance its incident management system by recently sending 14 employees to the ABS training for Root Cause Analysis and Incident Investigation.  These employees are now trained in leading investigation teams within the refinery.  \n\nARG recently enhanced its near miss and incident reporting software system and continues to train all new hires on near miss and incident reporting.\n\nARG is currently in the process of enhancing the Change Management program.  The new program includes more change reviews as well as different levels of approvals. \n\nStarting in 2023, ARG now conducts \"Weekend Drills\".  These drills are completed weekly at each process area and cover Emergency and Normal Operating conditions.  These drills are reviewed by each crew and all concerns or findings are documented. \n\nAmerican Refining Group is committed to quality environmental, health and safety programs. We strive to continuously improve our procedures and equipment.  We use audits, training, equipment inspections, recommendations from PHAs, and incident investigations to improve our environmental, health, and safety programs in order to better protect our employees and our community."
