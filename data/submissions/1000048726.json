In this capacity, Coyne is a re-seller of prepackaged chemicals to industrial, commercial and municipal customers.  Of the current inventory consisting of 200 types of chemicals, three are considered extremely hazardous and are stored above threshold values making them subject to RMP regulations.  The facility is located on 8.393 acres within the Edgely Industrial Park and is bordered by a rail siding to the North, a water retention basin on the East, State Road to the\n\nSouth and Gilbreth International to the West.\n\n\n\nThe three chemicals on site subject to RMP regulations are:\n\n\n\nChlorine (CAS # 7782-50-5)\n\nSulfur Dioxide (CAS # 7746-09-5)\n\nOleum - 20% (CAS # 8014-95-7)\n\n\n\nChlorine is contained within cylinders containing 150 lbs. of product.  Sulfur Dioxide cylinders contain 150 lbs. of product.  All full cylinders are stored inside the warehouse in storage racks with 16 cylinders per rack. Oleum is transferred from tank trucks to 55-gal drums and stored prior to shipment. There have been no on-site releases of these chemicals within the last 10 years.  The worst-case scenario is a Chlorine release of the entire contents of one 150 lbs. cylinder in 10 minutes resulting from a broken valve.  This scenerio has an endpoint distance of 0.3 miles.  Due to the fact that that this item is stored and transported in storage racks designed to house this type of cylinder, the worst case scenerio is not likely to occur. An alternate worst-case scenario for Chlorine, Sulfur Dioxide or Oleum is a small leak from the valve or packing nut of a cylinder releasing 150 lbs. of Chlorine or 150 lbs. of Sulfur Dioxide or a drum leak releasing 750 lbs. of Oleum over a period of one hour with an endpoint of 0.1-0.2 miles.  Mitigation for Chlorine or Sulfur Dioxide scenarios includes applying a cylinder \"A\" Kit or placing the"

Coyne Chemical has an in-house Emergency Response Team trained to handle these types of emergency.  In addition to the above actions, a manager can be reached for emergency response via the emergency voice mail system whenever the facility is closed in order to organize an emergency response.\n\n\n\nCoyne Chemical is a member of the National Association of Chemical Distributors (NACD) and subscribes to its Responsible Distribution Processes.  As part of this Process, Coyne Chemical has developed policies and procedures regarding Risk Management, Emergency Response and Security.\n\n\n\nRISK MANAGEMENT POLICY\n\nIt is the policy of the George S. Coyne Chemical Co., Inc. to have programs in place to promote the process of risk assessment and management in relation to the chemicals and services provided by the Company. These programs address the primary goal of continual risk reduction by analysis of the hazards of the chemicals distributed, the likelihood of accidents/incidents, and the impact of these releases on the public and the environment.  The Company fully supports and encourages employee participation in the safety programs established and requires strict adherence to the guidelines established for the safe operation of its facilities.\n\n\n\nContinuous risk reduction will be encouraged through the following steps:\n\n\n\nA. Product review and hazard assessment,\n\nB. Hazard ranking of the chemicals distributed,\n\nC. Review with Manufacturer of products supplied,\n\nD. Incident review and analysis, and\n\nE. Employee training\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE & PUBLIC PREPAREDNESS POLICY\n\nIt is the policy of the George S.

Procedures for response, reporting, investigation and preventative measure implementation with respect to incidents which could have or did result in a release, explosion and/or fire.\n\nC. Procedures for supplying emergency response information regarding chemicals handled to emergency response agencies and communication with state and local emergency planning and response organizations regarding potential hazards of products handled at facilities.\n\n\n\nSECURITY\n\nAn (8) eight feet chain link fence equipped with barbed wire around the top protects the outside boundary of Coyne Chemical.  The Northeast gate serves as the main entrance for all traffic.  This gate is electrically controlled and cannot be opened from the outside without a pass card and remains closed at all times.  The gate on the South side is kept locked at all times, but can be unlocked and opened if evacuation through that direction is necessary.\n\n\n\nOverhead light standards are located on the exterior perimeter of the plant property as well as positioned along the top of the building proper to illuminate all exterior areas of the property. All entries to the office and warehouse are secured and monitored by an alarm system.  In the event of an unauthorized entrance, an alarm is sounded at a central monitoring station, the local police department is dispatched and a Coyne Chemical manager is notified.\n\n\n\n"
