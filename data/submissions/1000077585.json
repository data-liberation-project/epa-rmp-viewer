Affected personnel are trained on the changes to the emergency response program.\r\n\r\nThe overall emergency response program for the Holly Tulsa Refinery is coordinated with the Tulsa County - Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency officials, local government officials, and industry representatives. The Holly Tulsa Refinery has around the clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire departments). This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident. In addition to periodic LEPC meetings, the Holly Tulsa Refinery conducts periodic emergency drills and provides training to the Tulsa Fire Department rookie classes. The Holly Tulsa Refinery maintains an in-house trained group for initial response for fires or emergencies.\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nThe Holly Tulsa Refinery resolves all significant findings from PHAs, some of which result in modifications to the process. The following types of changes are examples of planned future risk reduction projects:\r\n\r\n1. Improvements to emergency isolation valves\r\n2. Improvements to fire protection systems\r\n3. Improvements to heater safety systems\r\n4. Improvements to relief valve protection\r\n5. Improvements to instrumentation systems\r\n6. Improvements to gas detection systems\r\n7. Improvements to operator shelters\r\n \r\nThe Holly Tulsa Refinery is resolved to have a program of continued improvement for safety and risk reduction investments. For example, various new installations over the last five years (2014-2018) have resulted in spending about $53,700,000 for East and West site projects improving safety and fire protection."

The backup steam-driven compressors failed to come online, resulting in loss of instrument air and all three boilers which did not allow the full shutting down of units in the East facility. The lack of utilities allowed excess flaring and atmospheric RV releases of RMP-regulated flammable mixtures at the FCCU and CDU, but it appears that the only offsite effects were caused by the non-RMP-regulated heavy gas oil that was released from the steam muffler and carried by strong winds onto cars and houses offsite.

The refinery does not have any of the listed regulated toxic chemicals above the threshold quantity for reporting. The refinery's process units containing RMP-covered flammable materials are considered a single program 3 covered process.\r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\r\n\r\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the Holly Tulsa Refinery.
