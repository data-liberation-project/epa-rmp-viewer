      "SummaryText": "Fishbeck, Thompson, Carr & Huber, Inc. (FTC&H) has been retained by Grand Haven/Spring Lake Wastewater Treatment Plant (GH/SL) to revise and resubmit a Risk Management Plan (RMP) for the facility located at 1525 Washington, Grand Haven, Michigan. GH/SL is a municipal wastewater treatment plant. A site location map and site plan are shown as Figures 1 and 2, respectively.\n\nAs required in the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Clean Air Act Risk Management Program rules listed in 40 CFR Part 68, this document contains information intended to analyze the impacts of an accidental release of an extremely hazardous substance and to highlight the steps the facility is taking to prevent a release from occurring. The intent of the rule is to reduce the likelihood of a chemical release and the consequences of a release if one were to occur. The process utilizes chlorine and sulfur dioxide which are both regulated substances under the Risk Management Program.\n \nBecause of the potential hazards when using chlorine and sulfur dioxide, it is essential that steps be taken to minimize the risk of a catastrophic release. The prevention program for GH/SL includes process safety information(PSI), a process hazard analysis (PHA), and procedures for the following: operating, training, mechanical integrity, management of change, prestartup safety review, compliance audit, incident investigation, employee participation, hot work permit, and contractors. The purposes of the PSI are to compile and update written process safety information for use by employees, PHA Teams, and auditors. The PHA identifies, evaluates, and controls the hazards and risks associated with processes using regulated substances. \n\nThe operating procedures are instructions for initial and emergency startup operations; normal, temporary, and emergency operations; and emergency and normal shutdown operations. Training ensures that operators and other personnel working on or near regulated processes are properly "

Furthermore, mechanical integrity creates and implements written practices for maintaining the mechanical integrity of the process equipment. \n\nManagement of change reviews the changes made to process chemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures. The prestartup safety review is to be performed in conjunction with the management of change. The review examines the safety of new and modified regulated processes. \n\nThe purpose of the compliance audit is to analyze the owner?s or operator?s compliance with the requirements of Program 3. Incident investigations review all occasions that resulted in or had the possibility of resulting in a release of the regulated substance. \n\nEmployee participation specifies the involvement of operators or other personnel in the creation and implementation of Program 3 provisions. Hot work permits are to be issued for all hot work performed on or near a regulated process. \n\nThe purpose of the contractor review is to ensure that all contractors are evaluated in their safety performance and programs and to prepare the contractors against the hazards associated with the regulated substances. \n\nThe hazard analysis performed for the facility also includes a review of its five year accident history. During the past five years, GH/SL has not had an accidental release that met the criteria of 40 CFR 68.42(a). \n\nGH/SL has been actively involved in emergency response planning. They have worked closely with the Ottawa County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) to develop standard operating procedures (SOPs) for offsite response. GH/SL is a Program 3 source and a non-responding facility. \n\nThe GH/SL Emergency Response Plan outlines procedures for internal response to incidental releases and notification and coordination with the local "
