The Miami-Dade Water & Sewer Department (MDWASD) Central District Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) also uses chlorine (for chlorination) for disinfecting treated wastewater to provide safe water discharges to the environment.  Storing and handling large quantities of chlorine can create hazardous situations.  The Central District WWTP takes safety obligations in storing and using chlorine as seriously as it takes care in treating watewater. The Central District WWTP also produces digester gas and stores it for on -site use as fuel.\n\nThe Central District WWTP chlorine and digester gas handling processes are subject to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program Rule.  This rule requires submission of a Risk Management Plan (RMP).  An integral part of the RMP is a summary of policies and procedures followed to safely operate the facility, including a description of the possible consequences in case of an accident and the actions, which will be taken, by the facility in an event of an emergency.\n\nThe following information is specifically required in the RMP Executive Summary: \n\n* Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies.\n\n* General facility and regulated substances information.\n\n* Offsite consequence analysis results.\n\n* Summary of the accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps.\n\n* Five-year accident history summary.\n\n* Emergency response program summary.\n\n* Planned changes to improve safety.\n\nThe above information for the Central District WWTP chlorine and digester gas systems are provided below.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe MDWASD accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates proven technology, trains staff in operation and maintenance practices, and uses tested and proven management system practices.

Central District WWTP has prepared an Emergency Response Plan for the treatment plant to facilitate coordination and emergency planning with offsite response officials and facilities in the event of an emergency.  Central District WWTP has an excellent record in preventing accidents from occurring.\n\nGeneral Facility and Regulated Substance Information\n\nThe MDWASD Central District WWTP is located on Virginia Kay in Miami, Florida.  The Central District WWTP has two separate liquid treatment trains that are referred to as Plant 1 and Plant 2 and are rated at 60 mgd and 83 mgd, respectively.  The facility stores chlorine and digester gas which are regulated toxic substances under RMP rule.  The two chlorine systems (for Plant 1 & 2) supply approximately 7,400 pounds of chlorine per day to the wastewater effluent and the non-potable water system.\n\nAt Plant 1, chlorine is delivered in one-ton containers to the storage area of the Central District WWTP chlorine building.  The chlorine building is divided into a covered chlorine storage area and a chlorinator room.  The one-ton containers contain liquid chlorine under pressure.  The storage area in Plant 1 is equipped to store up to 32 (cylinders) tons of chlorine.  The maximum quantity of chlorine present at the Central District Plant 1 WWTP at any given time exceeds the listed threshold quantity in the EPA rule.  It also exceeds the listed threshold quantity in the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard.\n\nThe pr"

The valve will also close automatically when the chlorine sensor senses a leak.  The liquid chlorine flows through the automatic shut-off valve to the evaporators. At the evaporators the liquid chlorine is heated and converted into chlorine gas.  The gas then flows from the evaporator to the chlorinator.  The chlorinators are used to control the feed rate of the chlorine gas.  The chlorinators are equipped with a gas rotameter and a v-notched orifice for controlling the feed rate.  Injection of the chlorine into the plant water produces the concentrated solution that flows through piping to various injections points in the treatment process.\n\nThe Plant 1 chlorination process of the Central District WWTP is also provided with a number of safety features to protect the employees and the surrounding community.  The two important safety features are (1) automatic shut-off valves and (2) chlorine leak detection and alarm system.  The automatic shut-off valves are located immediately downstream of the chlorine containers.  Therefore, if a leak occurs anywhere in the system the chlorine source can be isolated and the flow of chlorine can be stopped.  The automatic shutoff valves are operated either automatically due to the detection of chlorine leak by the chlorine sensors or manually by pushing a switch.  Emergency shutoff switches are located inside the chlorine storage room and in the chlorinator room.\n\nThe leak detection system consists of chlorine gas sensors located in both the chlorinator room and the storage area.

The first scenario is defined by EPA, which states that \"the owner or operator shall assume that the maximum quantity in the largest vessel is released over 10-minutes,\" due to an unspecified failure.

The distance to the toxic endpoint was estimated using the EPA's RMP*Comp software (version 1.06).  The toxic endpoint selected by EPA rules for chlorine is 3 ppm, which is the Emergency Response Planning Guideline Level 2 (ERPG-2).  The toxic endpoint was conservatively set by EPA to ensure public notification and that local emergency response planning takes into account the greatest possible impacted area surrounding the release point. EPA-mandated meteorological conditions, namely atmospheric Stability Class F, wind speed of 1.5 meter per second, highest daily maximum temperature (77 deg F), and average relative humidity (50%) were used for the worst-case release scenario analysis.  The results of the dispersion analysis indicated that the worst-case release scenario has offsite impacts.\n\nDigester gas containing methane is the only regulated flammable substance stored and handled at the Central District WWTP, which is subject to the RMP rule.  Thus, digester gas was selected for the worst-case release scenario. Only passive or administrative controls are allowed under this scenario to reduce off-site impacts.

The results of the analysis indicated that the worst-case release scenario has offsite impacts.\n\nRMP rules require that a scenario which results in offsite toxic endpoint distance and is more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario should be selected as the alternative release scenario for each regulated toxic and flammable substance, unless no such scenario exists. Unlike the worst-case scenario, the alternative release scenario may consider \"active\" mitigation such as automatic shutoff valves, excess flow valves, and containment with scrubbers.  Active mitigation is defined as requiring mechanical, electrical, or human input.\n\nThe alternative release scenarios must consider the facility accident history and/or failure scenarios identified in the process hazard analysis.  A review of the past five-year accident history data for the chlorination and digester gas facilities pursuant to these rules indicated that there were no chlorine or digester gas releases, which could have resulted in offsite (outside the Central District WWTP boundary) toxic or flammable endpoint distances.  Similarly, no credible accident scenario was identified from the process hazard analysis, which would reach offsite.  Thus, an acceptable/credible alternative release scenario had to be selected based on expert judgement. \n\nThe alternative release scenarios selected for the chlorine and digester gas processes are summarized below:\n\nThe chlorine alternative release scenario selected involves the release of chlorine from a pigtail (1/4\" diameter) rupture that occurs during the connection of the chlorine container to the chlorination process.  The normal response of the operator is to shut-off the container valve.  However, the operator may become incapacitated, leaving the valve open.

The chlorine release rate from the one-ton container was estimated at 150 pounds per minute; thus, the whole container would be emptied in about 13 minutes. No passive mitigation was considered for the estimation of chlorine release rate.  However, human input in closing the shut-off valve was taken into account as an active mitigation, which will reduce the quantity of chlorine release to the atmosphere.\n\nThe chlorine alternative release scenario toxic endpoint distance was also estimated using the RMP*Comp (version 1.06) software.  Toxic endpoint for chlorine is 3 ppm.  EPA suggested typical meteorological conditions used were Stability D, wind speed of 3.0 meter per second, average air temperature of 77 deg F, and average relative humidity of 50 percent. The results of the dispersion analysis indicated that the chlorine alternative release scenario has offsite impacts.\n\nThe digester gas alternative scenario selected represents an event, which actually occurred at the Central District WWTP.  The scenario involves the release of digester gas (consisting of 65% methane) from a pressure relief valve installed on the 80 feet diameter storage sphere. It is assumed that the valve vents to the atmosphere when the pressure in the sphere is 10% above the design value of 40 pound per square inch gauge (psig), at a pressure of 44 psig. The release rate of digester gas was estimated at 1560 pounds per minute (lb/min).  It is assumed that the tank vents for 15 minutes with a methane release rate of 1012 lb/min for a total release of 15,180 lbs of methane.  The alternative release scenario also assumes that a vapor cloud fire (flash fire) may result from the dispersion of the cloud of flammable vapor and ignition of the cloud following dispersion.  Such a fire could flash back and could represent a severe heat radiation hazard to anyone in the area of the cloud.  The flammable endpoint is characterized by t"

This information includes chlorine and digester gas background information and MSDS sheets.\n\nEquipment safety information was meticulously compiled on the chlorine and digester gas processes.  Specifications for chlorine and digester gas processes are collected and provided in one place for easy reference.  Details such as maximum intended inventory; safe upper and lower temperatures; safe upper and lower pressures; and codes and standards used to design, build, and operate the processes are on file at the facility.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis \n\nIn 1997 and 1999, detailed Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) was conducted for the chlorine and digester gas systems equipment and procedures, respectively.  To further assess the integrity of the chlorine and digester gas systems for the preparation of this RMP, checklists were used to assess the overall general condition of the chlorine and digester gas systems operation and maintenance, including human factors that affect personnel performance and system integrity.  The PHA(s) will be updated again within a five-year period or whenever there is major change in the processes.  A list of recommended actions were developed to further improve the chlorine and digester gas safety and staff is currently evaluating these recommendations.  Staff will document the completion of recommended actions.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nMDWASD Central District WWTP has prepared written operating procedures that provide instructions or steps for safely conducting activities relating to the chlorine and digester gas processes.  They are consistent with the chlorine and digester gas Process Safety Information.  Written operating procedures include : initial startup, normal operations, emergency shutdown, normal shutdown, and start up after emergency shutdown.  In addition, Central Dis"

Operating procedures will be developed and put in place prior to any new process equipment coming on line or changes made in the handling of chlorine and digester gas equipment, and reconfiguration of the facilities.\n\nTraining \n\nCentral District WWTP employees presently involved in operating or maintaining the chlorine and digester gas processes are trained in an overview of the processes and the applicable operating and maintenance procedures.  Central District WWTP ensures that each employee newly assigned to the processes, is trained and tested to be competent in the operating procedures listed pertaining to their duties.  Each employee (presently involved in operating the chlorine and digester gas process) has been trained to receive the required knowledge, skills, and abilities to safely carry out the duties and responsibilities, including chlorine and digester gas emergency response, as provided in the operating procedures.  \n\nRefresher training is provided every three years or less to each employee operating the covered process to ensure that the employee understands and adheres to the current operating procedures.  In addition, the Central District WWTP ensures that operators are trained in any updated or new procedures prior to startup of a process after a major change as indicated in their Management of Change procedures.\n\nThe Central District WWTP prepares and retains records of initial and refresher training, provides certification of the records, which includes the identity of the employee, the date of training, and the signature of the person (s) administering the training.\n\nContractors\n\nMDWASD Central District WWTP has procedures and policies in place that specify the information required to be provided to the contractors performing work on the chlor"
