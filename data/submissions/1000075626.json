This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned that highest risk receive immediate attention. Approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained. \r\n\r\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the facility periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operative.

This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release. \r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES \r\n\r\nThe Kenova NGL Extraction Facility processes raw gas from the neighboring Columbia Gas compressor station. The gas enters a cryogenic process where it is cooled and the heavy NGLs are removed. The remaining natural gas is sent back to the compressor station via pipeline, and the NGLs, also known as Y Grade, are processed and piped offsite for fractionation. In the event that the NGL pipeline is out of service for maintenance or repair, the Y-Grade must be transported offsite via tanker truck.\r\n\r\nThe products at the Kenova NGL Extraction Facility contain ethane, propane, butanes, pentanes, and heavier hydrocarbon components. The regulated flammable substances include the same ethane through pentane components. This facility does not handle regulated toxic substances above their threshold quantities and there are no toxic release scenarios to consider.\r\n\r\nWORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS\r\n\r\nThe parameters of the offsite consequence analyses for this MarkWest facility were based on the requirements set forth in the RMP rules outlined in 40 CFR 68.25 (e) for flammable worst-case release scenario, and 40 CFR 68.28 for the alternative release scenario analysis.

Results of the worst-case release scenario indicate that the process is subject to Risk Management Program (RMP) Program Level 3 requirements.  Details of the worst-case release scenario and alternate release scenario are included with the backup documentation associated with this RMP Plan\r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM \r\n\r\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place for the process at the facility. Because the process at the facility that are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) risk management program (RMP) regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program. \r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information \r\n\r\nMarkWest Hydrocarbon, L.L.C., keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. The reference documents are maintained on file at the facility to provide open access.\r\n\r\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in safety data sheets (SDS's).

For the process, the facility has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in key process parameter documents. The facility ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\r\n\r\nThe facility also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised. \r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA) \r\n\r\nMarkWest Hydrocarbon, L.L.C., has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the process are identified and controlled. Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards. \r\n\r\nMarkWest Hydrocarbon, L.L.C., will use one or more of the following techniques to identify hazards: what-if, checklist, what-if/checklist, hazard and operability (HAZOP), failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA), or fault tree analysis (FTA). HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques and will be utilized for each major process change or renovation.

      "SummaryText": "Job plans/written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training. Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels). If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or a management of change team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment. \r\n\r\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance. The Kenova NGL Extraction Facility incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs. This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made. \r\n\r\nManagement of Change \r\n\r\nMarkWest Hydrocarbon, L.L.C., has a comprehensive system to manage changes to the covered processes. This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented. Changes are reviewed to ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage new hazards and to verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change. Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes. In addition, process operators, maintenance personnel, or any other employees whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and are trained on the specifics of the modification.\r\n\r\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs) \r\n\r\nMarkWest Hydrocarbon, L.L.C., conducts a PSSR for a new facility or facility modification that"

Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors: perform their work in a safe manner; have the appropriate knowledge and skills; are aware of the hazards in their workplace; understand what they should do in event of an emergency; understand and follow site safety rules; and inform facility personnel of the hazards that they find during their work. This is accomplished by providing contractors with: a process overview; information about potential fire, explosion, or toxic release hazards; emergency response plan requirements; and safe work practices prior to their beginning work. In addition, the Kenova NGL Extraction Facility will only select contractors who submit certification that employees are trained in specifics and safe work practices associated with their job, and that provide safety performance documentation from the previous three years. Finally, facility personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations. \r\n\r\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS \r\n\r\nThe processes at the Kenova NGL Extraction Facility have hazards that must"

The following is a description of existing safely features applicable to prevention of accidental releases of regulated substances in the facility. \r\n\r\nUniversal Prevention Activities \r\n\r\nThe accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to the RMP-covered process at the Kenova NGL Extraction Facility. Collectively, these prevention program activities prevent or mitigate potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors. \r\n\r\nSpecialized Safety Features\r\n\r\nThe Kenova NGL Extraction Facility has safety features on many units to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release. The following types of safety features are used in the covered process: \r\n\r\nRelease Detection \r\n1) Hand-held hydrocarbon detectors operated by facility personnel. \r\n2) Personnel are on site 24 hours a day, seven days a week. \r\n\r\nRelease Containment/Control \r\n1) Process relief valves that discharge to a flare to capture and incinerate episodic releases. \r\n2) Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual and automated). \r\n3) Automated shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high temperature) \r\n4) Curbing or dykes to contain liquid releases. \r\n5) Redundant equipment and instrumentation (e.g., uninterruptible power supply for process control system). \r\n\r\nRelease Mitigation \r\n1) Trained emergency response personnel. \r\n2) Personal protective equipment (e.g., chemical protective clothing). \r\n\r\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY \r\n\r\nThe Kenova NGL Extraction Facility has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last five years. Due to stringent release prevention policies, there have been no accidental releases during this period. \r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION \r\n\r\nThe Kenova NGL Extraction Facility is a Non-Responding Facility as per 48 CFR 68.90(b).

The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts, determine what error states led to the incident and to develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team consists of the immediate supervisor, one person knowledgeable in the process, and other members with appropriate experience to investigate and analyze the incident. The team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to facility management for resolution. Corrective actions that are identified will be promptly addressed, resolved and tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with facility employees (including contractors) whose job tasks are relevant to the investigation. Incident investigation reports are retained for at least five years so that the reports can be reviewed during PHAs and PHA revalidations. \r\n\r\nEmployee Participation \r\n\r\nMarkWest Hydrocarbon, L.L.C., encourages employees to participate in the facets of process safety management and accident prevention. Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a PHA team.
