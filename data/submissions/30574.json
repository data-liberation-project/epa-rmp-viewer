      "SummaryText": "SECTION 1\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY \n\n\nWe at Boskovich Farms Incorporated are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers such areas as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  This program has been prepared pursuant to Part 68 of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations.\n\nThis RMP has been prepared for the Boskovich Farms Incorporated facility located at 711 Diaz Avenue, Oxnard, California.  The facility is a produce preparation, storage and distribution facility which operates various ammonia refrigeration systems to cool produce prior to distribution.  Boskovich has approximately 47,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia refrigerant on site in several refrigeration systems including portable HydroVac units, the Hydrocooler, two ice machines, and in the main refrigeration systems for the cooler buildings.\n\nIn July 1993 Boskovich prepared a Process Safety Management (PSM) Plan and a Risk Management and Prevention Program (RMPP).  The documents have been updated periodically as required.  These documents are referenced by this RMP because they contain some of the elements required by the EPA for the RMP\n\n1.1 ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE\nTo prevent the accidental release of ammonia, Boskovich has developed the following:\n?    Maintenance and inspection procedures to ensure the equipment is properly maintained and functioning properly\n?    Operating procedures to ensure that equipment is operated in a maner that minimizes the possibility of an ammonia release.\n?    Employee training to ensure that operators know how to properly use the equipment and non-operators are aware of the dangers of ammonia and the necessary steps t take in the event of an ammon"

The facility is secured by fencing around the site and a 24-hour guard to minimize the possibility of a third party damaging equipment or releasing ammonia.\nThe programs are contained in Binder 1, Risk Management and Prevention Program.\n\nBoskovich has prepared an Emergency Response Plan to respond to ammonia releases.  In general the plan includes:\n?    A list of safety equipment available at the Boskovich facility.\n \n?    Response procedures for minor leaks.\n?    Response procedures for major leaks.\n?    Agency notification procedures.\n?    Emergency procedures.\nA copy of the Emergency Response Plan (ERP) can be found in Binder 1, RMPP, Section 10.  Further description of the ERP is contained in Section 6 of the RMP.\n\n1.2 STATIONARY SOURCE AND SUBSTANCE HANDLED\nAs explained above, Boskovich operates various ammonia cooling systems that cool produce prior to storage and shipment.  The systems contain approximately 47,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.\n\n1.3 ACCIDENTAL RELEASE SCENARIOS\nThe Worst Case Scenario is the release of 1,900 pounds of liquid ammonia from one of the ice machine refrigeration accumulators.  This scenario is considered very improbable and would result in offsite impacts.  The Alternate Scenario considers a leaking valve.  This is a scenario that could realistically happen but should not result in offsite consequences.\nIn order to reduce the distance to the toxic endpoint from an accidental release the following administrative controls and mitigation measures are in place at Boskovich:\n?    System operation and emergency response training.\n?    routine maintenance schedule and procedures.\n?    Written operating procedures.\n?    Release detection sensors promote early detection of a release\n?    Security personnel who monitor the facility to ensure that no unauthorized personnel are on site.\nDetails regarding the offsite consequence analysis for the worst case and alternative release scenarios can be found in Section 3 of the RMP.\n\n\n1.4 GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE P"

      "SummaryText": "REVENTION PROGRAM\nThe following components are contained in this RMP:\n?    Registration.\n?    Offsite Consequence Analysis\n?    Five-year Accident History\n?    Program 3 Prevention Program\n \n?    Emergency Response\n?    Certification\n?    Update Procedure\nIn order t further mitigate the effects of an ammonia release, the following risk management components are in place:\n?    Maintenance and standars operating procedures for the ammonia systems.\n?    The site is prevented from being accessed by trespassers with the use of fencing and on-site security personnel.\n?    Emergency response plan.\n?    Training for employees.\n?    Incident investigation documentation and procedures.\n?    Automatic system shutdowns.\n?    Windsocks for direction of wind visible on-site and from neighboring property.\n?    Ammonia sensors at various location at the facility.\n\n1.5 FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nBoskovich has had no incidents in the past five years from the ammonia system that resulted in on site injuries that required medical attention.\n\n1.6 EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\nThe Emergency Response/Action Plan (ERP) for the Boskovich facility has been prepared and contains information for responding to an ammonia release.  The general emergency response policy for the site when ammonia is released is to:\n?    Determine the severity of the release.\n?    Evacuate non-emergency response personnel to a safe area.\n?    Have two trained employees don self contained breathing apparatus (SCBA).\n?    Isolate and/or fix the leak.\n?    Notify the appropriate personnel and authorities.\n\n1.7 PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nSeveral developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of this RMP and the various elements of our accidental release prevention program.  Recommendations from the Hazard Review and Seismic Assessment are expected to being  implemented."
