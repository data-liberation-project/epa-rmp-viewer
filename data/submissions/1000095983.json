      "SummaryText": "RMP Executive Summary Revision - Pasadena \n\n\n\nSouthern Ionics Incorporated (SII) owns and operates an inorganic chemicals (NAICS 325180) manufacturing plant located at 12901 Bay Park Rd. Pasadena, TX.  The plant site encompasses 50 acres of land.  The facility has been under the control of SII since 1983.  The facility manufactures aluminum (aluminum sulfate, sodium aluminate), sulfur (sodium bisulfite, sodium sulfite, sodium thiosulfate), and ammonia (ammonium hydroxide) based solutions at this facility.  The site has developed a risk management program to handle anhydrous ammonia and ammonium hydroxide in excess of RMP thresholds. \n\n\n\nThere are two covered processes - Process 1 and Process 2 as described in b).  Due to the proximity of offsite public receptors both processes are Prevention Program Level 3.  Southern Ionics NAICS codes is 325180 which is Industrial Inorganic Chemicals.  Process 1 has a 0.3 mile toxic end point and Process 2 has a 6.9 mile toxic end point.\n\n\n\na) The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the stationary source;\n\n\n\nSouthern Ionics Incorporated has developed an RMP program including process safety information, mechanical integrity, operational procedures, and emergency response programs for handling both anhydrous ammonia and ammonium hydroxide.  Ammonium hydroxide concentrations will range from 15-32%.  Emergency response procedures detail fire, emergency spills / releases, evacuation, medical emergencies, and notification requirements.  \n\n\n\nb) The stationary source and regulated substances handled; \n\n\n\nProcess 1: Ammonium Hydroxide Toting Operation\n\n\n\nIn 2015 the site became covered under RMP for exceeding threshold quantities of  equal to and greater than 20% ammonium hydroxide onsite.  Process 1 receives truck tankers of 19-29% ammonium hydroxide and transloads into totes, drums, and/or carboys for customer shipment.  \n\n\n\nProcess 2: Anhydrous Ammonia Storage / Ammonium Hydroxide Manufacturing\n\n\n\nIn October"

      "SummaryText": " 2021 the site added an additional covered process when it began receiving and storing anhydrous ammonia in 30,000 pressurized bullet tanks for the manufacturing of 15-32% ammonium hydroxide.  There are 3-30,000 gallon bullet tanks which can hold 150,000 lbs. of anhydrous ammonia but are limited to 85% capacity or 127,500 lbs each.  The anhydrous ammonia storage tanks are designed for 250 psig at 150 Fahrenheit.    Each anhydrous ammonia storage vessel is equipped with PRVs set at 250 psig.  Since anhydrous ammonia can reach 250 psig at 111 Fahrenheit, pressure vessels are painted white and located under roof for minimizing radiant heat absorption.  Anhydrous ammonia will be received in tank trailers from vendors.  A refrigeration system is used to heat and cool anhydrous ammonia vapors.  Anhydrous ammonia will be converted into 32% ammonium hydroxide concentration by mixing with purified DI water.  \n\n\n\nAmmonium hydroxide is stored at 32% concentration in 2-30,000 bullet tanks designed for 250 psig at 150 Fahrenheit.  PRVs are set at 100 psig.  Dilution of ammonium hydroxide from 15-29.5% occurs while loading into truck tankers for shipment.  Tanks are painted white and located under roof to minimize radiant heat absorption.  Blanketing valves maintain minimum 8 psig of nitrogen to maintain conditions outside of flammability envelope.  Tanks are equipped with oxygen analyzers, level transmitters, vacuum relief, and temperature transmitters.  Vapors from truck loading operations are vented to a truck loading scrubber.  \n\n\n\nc) The general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps;\n\n\n\nSouthern Ionics has conducted multiple steps to ensure risk for an accidental release is minimized.  This includes engineering with good engineering practices incorporating ammonia related standards, PHA-HAZOP review, and mechanical integrity inspections and procedures.  For Process 2 a disaster review required by the Texas Commission of Environmental Qu"

      "SummaryText": "ality as part of the air permitting process as conducted.  Process 2 air permit requirements include an audio, visual, and olfactory (AVO) survey every four hours.  Containment structures are in place to mitigate catastrophic releases of anhydrous ammonia and ammonium hydroxide.  \n\n\n\nd) The five-year accident history;\n\n\n\nThere have been no accidental releases from an RMP covered process in the past 5 years.    \n\n\n\ne) The emergency response plan;\n\n\n\nSouthern Ionics Incorporated is part of the LaPorte, TX LEPC community.  The current emergency response plan for notifying the community includes an E-Notify / CAER line procedure using a 911 service for chemical spills / releases.  Shelter in-place and evacuation notification is part of this communication procedure.  The site will maintain designated employees as Hazardous Material Technicians so that responses to accidental releases to stop the release can occur.  The site will also coordinate emergency response procedures with the LEPC and conduct required drills as required under EPA requirements.  \n\n\n\nf) Planned changes to improve safety;\n\n\n\nFor the addition of Process 2 - storage of anhydrous ammonia and manufacturing of ammonium hydroxide, ammonia detectors are being installed around the storage and manufacturing unit in the event of a release.  Per TCEQ air permit; olfactory, visual, and hearing checks of the process area are required every 4 hours.  Emergency response onsite will include Hazardous Material Technician level who can respond in order to stop a leak and to perform rescue services.  The site is part of community response plan with the LaPorte, TX LEPC.  \n\n"
