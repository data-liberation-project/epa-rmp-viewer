THE FACILITY IS DESIGNED AND MAINTAINED WITH STRICT ADHERANCE TO THE LOCAL, STATE AND FEDERAL RULES AND REGULATIONS.  THE KANSAS DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE INSPECTS THE PLANT ON AN ANNUAL BASIS AND WE COMPLY WITH ALL THEIR REQUEST FOR PLANT IMPROVEMENT.\n\nTHE WORST CASE SCENARIO WOULD HAVE A TOXIC GAS RELEASE OF 53,000 POUNDS WITH A DISTANCE TO ENDPOINT OF 1.63  MILES AND HAS THE POTENTIAL TO AFFECT APPROXIMATELY 200 AREA CITIZENS.  AREA RESIDENCES MAKE UP THE BULK OF THE PUBLIC RECEPTORS WITHIN THIS COMMUNITY. THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE RELEASE SCENARIO IS .83 MILES WHICH WOULD EFFECT A POPULATION OF APPROXIMATELY 150 PERSONS.\n\nTHE EMPLOYEES WHO WORK IN THE AMMONIA AREA ARE TRAINED IN SAFETY INFORMATION, HAZARDS, OPERATING PROCEDURES AND MAINENANCE PRACTICES.  THE WORKERS ALWAYS USE GOGGLES AND WEAR THE APPROPRIATE GLOVES WHILE FILLING NURSE TANKS.  CLEAN SAFETY WATER IS ALWAYS PRESENT DURING AMMONIA OPERATIONS.\n\nOUR SAFETY RECORD IS OUTSTANDING AND ALLOWS US TO REPORT THAT NO INJURY ACCIDENTS HAVE OCCURED AT THIS STORAGE FACILITY WITHIN THE LAST FIVE YEARS. IN ADDITON OUR COMPANY HAS RETAINED A SAFETY DIRECTOR TO ASSIST US IN OVERSEEING OUR SAFETY AND COMPLIANCE PROGRAMS. \nEACH YEAR OUR FIRM FILES WITH BOTH THE STATE, LEPC AND LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENT TIER II REPORTS TO ASSIST EMERGENCY RESPONDERS IN CHANGES IN OUR OPERATION.                                       \nTHE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN HAS BEEN SHARED WITH THE LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENT AND TOURS HAVE BEEN PROVIDED TO MAKE FIRST RESPONDERS AWARE OF THE DANGERS ASSOCIATED WITH ANHYDROUS AMMONIA.  THEY'VE AGREED TO ASSIST US IN THE EVENT OF AN EMERGENCY."
