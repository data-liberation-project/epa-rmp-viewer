Federal OSHA 29 CFR 1910 regulates the process.  This is a RMP Program Level 3 facility.\n\nEnterprise Products Operating L.P. recently acquired the facility from Coast Energy Group and is in the process of implementing the Enterprise Process Safety Management Systems.  The Reno Terminal has a commitment to employee and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our process.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases.  However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\nThe prevention program is based on the requirements of the PSM and EPA\u00bfs RMP regulations which require at least:  Employee Participation, Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Contractor Evaluation, Contractor and Visitor Orientation, Pre-Job Start-Up Review, Mechanical Integrity, Code of Safe Work Practices (Hot Work Permit, Confined Space Entry, Control of Hazardous Energy), Management of Change, Incident Investigation, Emergency Planning and Response, and Compliance Audit.\n\nTraining includes employee responsibilities in the process safety management program, National Propane Gas Association \u00bf certified employee training program, hot work permit procedure, code of safe work practices, and operating procedures.  All visitors entering the property must undergo a site safety orientation and check-in prior to each visit.  Planned changes to improve safety have been established based on compliance with the process safety management systems and revalidation of the process hazar"

      "SummaryText": "d analysis.  The last process hazard analysis revalidation was July of 1999 and is presently scheduled for revalidation in June of this year.\n\nThe Terminal receives HD-5 Propane by rail car, stores and distributes to one transport truck loading station and a Bobtail loading station.  There are 3 tanks with a capacity of approximately 30,000 gallons.  The tanks are administratively controlled to hold HD-5 Propane at 85% maximum capacity, which is approximately 25,500 gallons each.\n\nAs previously stated, the facility is equipped with two rail-unloading towers, one bulk transport truck loading station and one Bobtail truck loading station.  The rail-unloading stations are equipped with remote shutoff capability.  This operation is conducted downhill from the storage area.  The storage tank battery consists of the three horizontal pressure vessels (all ASME coded).  Each storage tank is equipped with a local level gauge, temperature gauge and pressure gauge.  The inventory is monitored daily and compared to metered delivery quantity.  There are remote isolation valves as well as manual isolation valves on the liquid outlet and tank vapor lines.  The emergency shutoff valves are pneumatically activated.  The truck loading stations are located immediately south and southeast of the storage tanks.  The loading hoses used are \u00bfSmart Hoses\u00bf that are equipped with integral excess flow check valves that provide protection if the hose breaks or if the driver drives off before disconnecting.  Access to the manual block valve for loading is controlled by lock and key.  \n\nEnterprise Products Operating L.P. maintains an emergency response plan in compliance with local emergency response agencies.\n\nIn the event of an accidental release, the facility operators are trained to sound the alarm, shut off the source from a safe location or activate one of the emergency shutdown devices, contact 9-1-1 and secure the area.  The 9-1-1 system is used to notify the City of Reno Police and Fire"

      "SummaryText": "Departments.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario simulated a failure of the Storage Tank shell.  The specifics of the simulation are available in the specified reporting of the Risk Management Plan.  In addition, although there are numerous controls in place, none were taken into account for mitigating the simulated worst-case scenario.  The alternative release scenario for this process is a hose rupture while pumping HD-5 Propane.  This scenario assumed the pump continued to operate at a rate of 255 gallons per minutes (gpm) for 10 minutes after the hose ruptured.  The simulation calculated that 10,846 pounds of material were released in the assumed time frame.  Mitigation measures were taken into account when selecting the alternative release scenario.  This consisted of reviewing the use of relief valves, check valves, manual shutoff valves, automatic shutoffs, startup and operating procedures, grounding equipment, and excess flow devices.  The facility operator and truck driver are also in attendance during transfer operations.\n\nThe engineering and administrative controls in place have been established to reduce the risk of an accidental release of identified hazards.  Enterprise Products Operating L.P. is committed to operations that are safe for employees and the surrounding community."
