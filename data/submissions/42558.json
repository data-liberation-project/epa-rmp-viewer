THE ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES:\n\nJones Dairy Farm (JDF) utilizes anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant in a closed system refrigeration system.  JDF is committed to protecting its employees, the public and the environment from potential releases of ammonia.  JDF has given utmost consideration to safety in the design and operation of the refrigeration system.  We have conducted a formal Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) study of the refrigeration system and spent over $1,000,000 in improving and upgrading the ammonia refrigeration system.  JDF refrigeration system maintenance and operations personnel receive ongoing training on the safe operation of the system.\n\nJDF has a dedicated emergency response team to handle emergencies involving ammonia.  The team is equipped with special \"Level A\" protection and is specially trained to detect, isolate and mitigate potential releases.  The emergency plan has been coordinated with the Jefferson County Emergency Planning Commission.\n\n2.  FACILITY DESCRIPTION AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCE:\n\nJones Dairy Farm is a meat processor.  We cook, cure, smoke, and package pre-processed meats.  We use a refrigeration system to provide cooling and freezing in processing areas of the plant.  The refrigeration system uses anhydrous ammonia, which is the RMP regulated substance.  The maximum quantity of ammonia in the system is approximately 26,000 pounds.\n\n3.  THE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS:\n\nThis facility complies with OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) rule (29 CFR 1910.119) and the USEPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule (40 CFR 68).  The entire ammonia system has been designed and installed according to guidelines provided by the American Society of Heating Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers, Inc. (ASHRAE) and the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR).  The ammonia refrigeration system is operated and maintained by trained and "

THE FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\n\nJones Dairy Farm has not experienced and RMP reportable release or accident involving ammonia in the last five years.\n\n6.  THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\n\nThe JDF emergency response program is based on and is in compliance with OSHA's HAZWOPER regulation, 29 CFR 1910.120.  We have discussed this program with the local fire department.  We have coordinated with the Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC).  The LEPC has prepared a site specific plan for JDF.\n\n7.  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\n\nJDF makes a continuing effort to improve safety.  We are currently investigating improved ammonia compressor motor linkages."
