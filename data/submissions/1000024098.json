The manufacturing processes include the full spectrum from raw ingredients handling and processing to the shipping of finished products ready for the consumer.  Processing that is done at this facility includes milk receiving, milk pasteurization and evaporation, chocolate processing, chocolate products moulding, packaging, storage, and rail/truck shipping.  The regulated substance for this facility is anhydrous ammonia.  Anhydrous ammonia is used for cooling of fluid in separate utility buildings for the purpose of providing cooling capabilities to various stages of the manufacturing operation.  The current anhydrous ammonia process has a total system capacity of approximately 22,200 pounds. A second separate anhydrous ammonia process is being built in 2011 and has approximately 17,000 pounds\n\n\n\nThe Hershey Company training programs go beyond standard mandated training.  Training programs currently being conducted range from general safety and environmental awareness for all employees to comprehensive, program specific training sessions for target groups based on job requirements.  Training, which is conducted in classrooms and on-the-job is documented and employees are often evaluated through a competency testing program.  Written programs have been implemented which include specific action to be taken by facility employees as well as emergency response personnel in the event of an emergency or accident in the facility.  Written operating procedures for operating and maintenance personnel have been implemented for anhydrous ammonia systems inspection and maintenance.  In addition, adherence to formal preventive maintenance programs and testing parameters for anhydrous ammonia systems is monitored and documented.  A Chemical Review Committee reviews and approves all new chemicals prior to introduction at the facility.  The"

The West Hershey Plant has an Emergency Response Plan that coordinates with the Hershey Plant Integrated Contingency Plan.  The facility has not had any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia from this covered process in the five years prior to the submission of this Risk Management Plan (RMP). \n\n\n\nThis facility also complies with OSHA Process Safety Management standards (28 CFR 1910.119).\n\n\n\nThe facility is situated on 193 acres, located northwest of downtown Hershey, in Derry Township, Dauphin County, PA.  Adjacent properties are typically residential, light commercial and agricultural uses."
