This commitment is demonstrated by continually improving both practices and measures to prevent the release of regulated substances.  In the event of a release, the Hastings facility is prepared to work with the Adams County LEPC and/or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact to people and the environment.\r\n\r\nThe Hastings facility's primary covered process activity is the storage of anhydrous ammonia.  The anhydrous ammonia is used by a third-party company called Blick's Phosphate Conversions, LLC to manufacture liquid fertilizer in a reaction process.  Anhydrous ammonia is received and processed into 10-34-0 non-hazardous liquid fertilizer.  Processing is periodic and usually occurs in the Spring and Fall.  Ammonia mixing with phosphoric acid occurs in a T-reactor owned and operated by Blick's Phosphate Conversions, LLC.  Water is used as both a reaction feed material and product stabilizer.  The emergency procedures for the Hastings facility are coordinated with the Adams County LEPC.\r\n\r\nWinField United - Hastings, NE  have taken the necessary steps to comply with accidental release prevention requirements set forth in 40 CFR Part 68.  The only process that this RMP includes is the storage of anhydrous ammonia. The T-reactor process is done entirely by Blick's Phosphate Conversions, LLC; and their process is also covered by OSHA's Process Safety Management standard. The following briefly describes the prevention program elements in place at this location for the storage of anhydrous ammonia:\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information: The facility maintains information describing the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with the covered process.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis: Studies are conducted to ensure the hazards associated with process operations are identified, understood and controlled.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures: The"
