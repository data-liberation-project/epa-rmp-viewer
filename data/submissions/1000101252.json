Nevertheless, POM Wonderful continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.\r\n\r\nBy utilizing PSMWriter software, all necessary employees have access to every aspect of the RMP-PSM program. This has improved POM Wonderful's ability to communicate hazardous situations to employees and contractors. In addition, PSMWriter tracks all RMP-PSM related events so that POM Wonderful's management team can ensure that the RMP-PSM program is being implemented.\r\n\r\nPOM Wonderful has implemented all aspects of the RMP-PSM program. When a RMP-PSM program requirement is completed (i.e. mechanical integrity inspection, process hazard analysis, compliance audit, etc.) any specific action items related to that event are entered into PSMWriter, assigned a responsible person, and given a due date. Once the action item has been completed, the resolution can be documented using PSMWriter as well. A list of current or past due action items can be accessed at any time by those with access to PSMWriter.\r\n\r\nIn addition to utilizing PSMWriter to create, schedule, track, and document events, POM Wonderful has also entered into a contract with Resource Compliance to obtain help with RMP-PSM program implementation.\r\n\r\nFor the future, POM Wonderful now thinks of the RMP-PSM program as a living document. It is an interactive framework that guides safe action for POM Wonderful employees, but allows for feedback and continual improvement. Through the RMP-PSM program POM Wonderful will continue to maintain"

It is extremely important that this process is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner. Management is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.\r\n\r\nOur refrigeration personnel monitor the ammonia refrigeration process and keep an active logbook of all procedures and transactions that pertain to ammonia.

Operation of a float switch activated solenoid valve raises the pressure in the liquid transfer vessels to the point the liquid can be drained into the high pressure receivers.\r\n\r\nThe system contains numerous safety devices including sensors which stop the compressors if temperatures or pressures exceed or drop below established limits, and pressure relief valves which vent to the atmosphere and diffusion tanks if the pressure in the system exceeds their set point. \r\n\r\nThere is one ammonia detector installed inside each refrigeration machinery room. Each sensor is set at the California OSHA permissible exposure limit of 25 ppm, which will activate an audible alarm. Also, each refrigerated area (e.g. CA Room, CA Hallway, Room 1, etc.) has a standalone ammonia detector that provides continuous monitoring.\r\n\r\nAn emergency control box is installed for both systems and contains three valves. The high and low side of the system each have a valve that would discharge to atmosphere or a diffusion tank.

The Blend and Tank rooms are equipped with DX coils.The refrigeration machinery is contained within or directly adjacent to each machinery room. \r\n \r\nThe Fresh System operates as follows: high pressure liquid from our high pressure receivers is piped through the king solenoid valve.  From there it is piped to each flooded zone of refrigeration, where it passes through a solenoid valve, an expansion valve, and into a low temperature & pressure accumulator vessel. From the accumulators, cold liquid ammonia is circulated through evaporator coils. As heat is absorbed, the liquid ammonia vaporizes to form low temperature & pressure gas which is returned to the accumulator vessels. The ammonia vapor is returned from the accumulator vessels through a suction return line to our main suction accumulator in the engine room.  From there, it passes through the compressors. The high pressure discharge from the compressors is sent to our water cooled evaporative condensers where the high pressure gas ammonia is cooled, liquefied and returned to our high pressure receiver.

As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible and updated as necessary. To accomplish this, POM Wonderful has elected to use PSMWriter, software developed and distributed by Resource Compliance, Inc. This software will assist us with updating, maintaining, scheduling, and tracking RMP-PSM related activities. \r\n\r\n1.1 POM Wonderful, Risk and Process Safety Management Program\r\n\r\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that POM Wonderful has updated/developed their unified RMP-PSM Program.
