(Publix) Jacksonville Warehouse Facility is located at 9800 West Beaver Street, Jacksonville, Duval County, Florida.  Publix requires each facility to develop and maintain accident prevention programs and an emergency response plan appropriate to the site.  Each site is also responsible for regulatory compliance issues that apply to the site.  A site PSM Coordinator is appointed to facilitate compliance.  Publix' corporate and division environmental and safety personnel provide assistance in training for site employees and in budgeting and procurement of safety and training services.\n\n\n\n2. Facility and Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nThe Publix Jacksonville Warehouse Facility is located north of Interstate I-10 and south of West Beaver Street in the western portion of the city of Jacksonville, Duval County, Florida.  The warehouse consists of areas for dry, frozen, and cooler storage of non-perishable and perishable items for distribution to the Publix Super Markets.  The Jacksonville Warehouse has one ammonia refrigeration system which exceeds the 10,000 lb. RMP threshold quantity.  The ammonia refrigeration system's equipment is located in the perishable warehouse and in the machinery room.  The high pressure receiver (HPR) which is the largest capacity vessel is located inside this room.  \n\n\n\n3. Prevention Program\n\n\n\nThis facility exceeds the ammonia threshold quantity for the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard, 1910.119, and is therefore subject to the PSM requirements.  For RMP compliance purposes, this places the Jacksonville Warehouse refrigeration process in the Program 3 level.  The Jacksonville Warehouse facility will use its PSM program as the required Program 3 Prevention Program.  \n\n\n\nThe Jacksonville Warehouse has a program in place to comply with the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard, 29 CFR 1910.119. The PSM Program includes a preventat"

      "SummaryText": "ive maintenance plan which requires all ammonia refrigeration equipment to be periodically inspected and serviced.  This will ensure that the equipment remains in good operating condition and will minimize the probability of accidents due to faulty equipment.  In developing the PSM Program, the Jacksonville Warehouse also developed written operating procedures for the refrigeration process.  These procedures cover all phases of operation and include information on safety devices.  These procedures will be used to train all operators and mechanics who work on the ammonia refrigeration processes to ensure consistency of operation and minimize human error. These measures ensure that all refrigeration operators and mechanics are properly trained.  Safe work practices such as Lockout/Tagout and Hot Work Permit, are in place to ensure that all non-routine work can be performed safely.  Other components of the prevention program include collection and review of all equipment information including Piping & Instrumentation Diagrams (P&IDs), and the correction of any equipment design deficiencies found.  These actions will ensure that the equipment meets all refrigeration industry standards and that accurate equipment information will be available when needed.  A Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) was initially performed in 1994 and has been revalidated at the appropriate intervals since that time.  The refrigeration staff with the assistance of a consultant performs PHA revalidations.  Additional PSM procedures, including Management of Change, Pre-Startup Safety Review, Compliance Audits, and Incident Investigation also help to ensure continued safe operation and prompt correction of deficiencies.  The PSM Program receives full support of plant management and involvement of employees at all levels.\n\n\n\n4. Five-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThe Jacksonville Warehouse facility has had no accidental releases of ammonia that have resulted in an offsite consequence in the past five years.\n\n"

The site also has some internal emergency response capability and has developed a program to comply with paragraph (q) of 29 CFR 1910.120.  The current plan has been coordinated with the City of Jacksonville Fire and Rescue, and the Northeast Florida Regional Local Emergency Planning Committee (District 4).  Notification is made locally by dialing 911, and by notifying Florida State Warning Point at (800) 320-0519 or (904) 413-9911.\n\n\n\n6.  Plans to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nPublix is revising their training programs for ammonia refrigeration and plans to conduct training on the new programs.\n\n"
