      "SummaryText": "Drilling Specialties Company's Alamo Plant is required to prepare a Risk Mangement Plan (RMP) because the facility stores and uses Sulfur Trioxide in excess of the threshold quantity listed in 40 CFR 68. The Alamo Plant uses Sulfur Trioxide (SO3) to manufacture Soltex, a drilling mud additive. The Alamo Plant is subject to Program 3 reporting requirements as defined in 40 CFR Part 68 because the facility is also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard as defined in 29 CFR 1910.\n\nThe RMP was prepared using the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Off-Site Consequence Analysis (OCA) Guidance Document. The Worst-Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario for SO3 both had off-site impacts as defined in the EPA Guidance Document. Process Controls such as emergency vents, relief valves, check valves and other items available at the Alamo Plant were not considered in determining the off-site impact of either scenario. Mitigation systems such as dikes, enclosures and deluge systems available at the Alamo Plant were also not considered in controlling the impact of the two scenarios. Two incidents involving SO3 occurred during the past five years. In July 2001, a small hole in the SO3 scrubber resulted in a fifty pound release of SO3. In August 2000, a Pressure Relief Device on the sulfonation reactor lifted, releasing 25 pounds of SO3 to the atmosphere. \n\nThe Alamo Plant has an Emergency Response Plan for handling releases of hazardous substances. The plan provides the Alamo Plant with a system of readiness which includes procedures for the orderly transition from normal to emergency operations, a design for delegation of emergency authority and responsibility, a method for interfacing with other emergency organizations and a means of controlling the emergency. The Alamo Plant's emergency organization is structured according to the Incident Command System so all aspects of internal and ex"

      "SummaryText": "ternal emergencies are addressed. The Emergency Response Plan also incorporates pre-emergency planning via the use of monthly What-If scenarios and quarterly emergency response drills that include event simulation and actual hands-on training. Employees are also trained to notify outside agencies, such as the Montgomery County Local Emergency Planning Council (LEPC), the Texas Council on Environmental Quality (TCEQ), the National Response Center, and neighboring facilities. \n\nThe Alamo Plant has a proactive Structure Safety Process that utilitizes various techniques for the identification, assessment and control of conditions that may adversely impact employees, company assets, the public or the environment. All employees at the Alamo Plant actively participate in the identification of hazards and risks via the use of Accident Prevention Techniques (APTs), Task Safety Observations (TSOs), Job Safety Analyses (JSAs), What-If Scenarios, quarterly Emergency Response Drills, Safe Behavior Observations, Monthly Inspections and Process Hazard Analysis. All employees at the Alamo Plant are encouraged to identify and recommend corrections to any unsafe work practices, procedures and equipment that they identify. All recommendations are discussed by Alamo Plant management during monthly employee meetings and suggested improvements to enhance plant safety are continuously evaluated and where applicable, adopted and implemented."
