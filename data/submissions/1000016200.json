In keeping with this commitment, the ITP facility has established a comprehensive Safety Management System that strives to identify, control, and eliminate potential release of hazardous chemicals and exposures to employees, community, and the environment.  In addition, this risk Management Program includes accidental release prevention and emergency response plans and procedures. This Safety Management System and philosophy embodies and employs the spirit and intent of the concepts found in the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard, and  other applicable regulatory standards ,including those implemented by a sister company, Millennium Inorganic Chemicals, Inc. \n\nThe major chemical that the ITP Ottawa facility uses to manufacture an inorganic chemical is liquid Titanium Tetrachloride (TiCl4), and the facility itself, as a \u00c2\u00bfBasic Inorganic Chemical Manufacturing\u00c2\u00bf facility,  is included within  NAICS # 325188.  The inventory quantities of Titanium Tetrachloride (TiCl4) retained on site is in excess of the EPA threshold of 2,500 lbs, and if released, would impact the local community.  Based upon these criteria, the ITP Ottawa facility is subject to the requirements of EPA\u00c2\u00bfs RMP Program 3, which imposes OSHA\u00c2\u00bfs Standard 1910.119 for Process Safety Management.\n\n.\nThe goal of the Plant Safety Management System is to control potential exposures that include, but are not limited to, personal injury/illness, property damage, fires, impacts to local community and the environment, and process incidents and breaches of security. \n\nIn support of this goal, the plant design and construction were performed to the most strict industry and code standards (ASME, ASCE, NFPA, NEC, Crist"

The facility\u00c2\u00bfs policies include that safe procedures be used to handle titanium tetrachloride, that adequate safety devices and systems are designed and constructed into the facility and that all pertinent personnel be adequately trained in safe procedures.  Although the ultimate responsibility for safety and loss prevention at this location rests with the Plant Manager, specific safety responsibilities are assigned to all levels of management.  All employees are expected to perform their work safely and to recognize that working safely is a condition of employment.\u00c2\u00bf \n\n\"There is no activity or job at the ITP Ottawa Facility that is so important or urgent that it must be done at the jeopardy of the safety or health of any employee or contractor, the local community, or at the risk of damaging the environment.  An employee has the responsibility to stop any activity or job that they feel may jeopardize the safety or health of any employee or contractor, or that may risk damaging the environment.\"\n\nManagement at the ITP Ottawa facility has authorized specific risk management programs and activities in compliance with EPA's \"Risk Management Program\" requirements (40 CFR Part 68) that: \n\n\u00c2\u00bf\tAssess the hazards of processes which handle or store more than the threshold quantity of substances regulated by the EPA\n\u00c2\u00bf\tPrevent accidental releases of these hazardous substances, and\n\u00c2\u00bf\tEffectively respond to emergencies if a release occurs.\n\nDescription of International Titanium Powder Facility, Ottawa, Illinois and How Regulated Substance Is Handled\n\nThe International Titanium Powder Facility located at 1501 Titanium Drive in Ottawa, Illinois produces pure titanium"

The covered process is the patented \"Armstrong Process (trademarked process),\" for the low-cost production of high-purity titanium and titanium alloy powders. The detailed process design and operating procedures for this process are proprietary.  This process handles one chemical included on the EPA regulated list, namely titanium tetrachloride (CAS Number 7550-45-0).  Titanium Tetrachloride liquid is shipped to ITP in rail cars and/or truck trailers, and is transferred via pump from rail car/truck to a main steel storage tank.  The main storage tank resides within a building with a controlled environment.  All transfer pipe used in Titanium Tetrachloride service is of welded metal construction (except for some pumps and serviceable equipment).  Where bolt-up connections occur, the flanges are wrapped with suitable covers. Titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4) liquid is pumped from the rail car to the main storage tank, and separate pumps transfer liquid from the main storage tank to a vaporizer where the liquid is converted to a vapor.  Then the vapor is pressure transferred forwarded to a reactor area where it is pre-heated and then to the reactor where it is  mixed with a reducing agent to produce pure titanium metal powder (Ti).  Similarly, Titanium Tetrachloride (TiCl4) is reacted with a reducing agent and other metal chlorides to produce pure titanium alloy metal powder (Ti-M1-M2).  Once the reaction has occurred, the Titanium Tetrachloride and other metal chlorides are completely consumed. The powder and intermediates are further processed to remove by-product residuals from the Ti / Ti alloy materials, and prepared for packaging / shipping.  \n\n\n\n\nWorst Case Release Scenario\n\nRMP regulations require performing a consequence analysis for one worst case release scenario, estimated to present the greatest distance in any direction to a toxic endpoint.

The Worst Case scenario for the Ottawa facility is  a ground-level spill of 50,000 lbs. of liquid titanium tetrachloride from a rail car located outside of the buildings (where limited control is available).  The entire contents of the rail care are released from a structural failure of the rail vessel resulting in a release  rate of _700 gpm (10,000 #/min). for a duration of 5_ minutes. In this scenario ITP personnel are prepared to mitigate the release by use of foam suppresion and container temporary repair kits. Based upon the local topography, a ground based spill area was estimated at 1,500 sq. ft. (20 ft x 75 ft).  The release of Titanium Tetrachloride vapor from a liquid pool is via surface evaporation.

The regulations require that a scenario that is more realistic than the worst case scenario is selected as the alternative release.  The Alternative Release Scenarios (ACRS) for titanium tetrachloride are:\n\n1) The release of liquid from a transfer line while moving liquid from a rail car/truck to main storage tank.  Temperature is 105 oF and the release rate is 900 #/min for 5 minutes.\n2) The release of liquid from a transfer line while moving liquid from the main storage tank to the vaporizers.

Temperature is 617 oF and the release rate is 40 #/minute for 5 minutes.\n\n\nAll releases occur within enclosed process buildings, and these buildings are equipped with fugitive fume smoke detectors and pick-up ducts which lead to a fume scrubber.   The RMP Comp Program estimates the toxic endpoint distance from the 4 alternate sources to be 0.1 mile (528 ft).  The detection of a release followed by immediate action by a fume scrubber is major contributors to minimizing off-site impacts.
