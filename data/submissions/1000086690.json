Written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training.  Inspections and tests are performed to help to ensure that equipment function as intended and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels).  If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back in service (if possible), or an engineer will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.  Another part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance. The facility incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs.  This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made. \r\n\r\nManagement of Change\r\n\r\nThe FGTP has a comprehensive system to manage changes to all covered processes.  This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process-operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviews to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage new hazards, and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.\r\n\r\nIncident Inve"

XTO Energy demonstrates this commitment by investing our resources in accident prevention, by continuous safety training, and by placing a high value on safety during design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our goal is to implement reasonable procedures to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  In the event of a release, trained company personnel will respond accordingly to control and contain the release.\r\n\r\nPROCESS DESCRIPTION OF THE FACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nThe FTGP, located in Limestone County, TX, produces a y-grade stabilized  oil/condensate and pipeline natural gas from produced natural gas. The FGTPP has a propane supply tank that stores propane used in the refrigeration process for extracting the stabilized condensate/oil. \r\n\r\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\r\n\r\nThe Worst Case Scenario (WCS) associated with a release of flammable substances in Program Level 1 processes at the FGTP is a Vapor Cloud Explosion (VCE) involving the inventory of the largest storage tank containing 53,000 lbs (10,500 gallons).  The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this WCS is 0.30 miles.  Although numerous controls are in place to prevent such releases and to manage the consequences, no credit for passive mitigation measures was taken into account evaluating this WCS. This scenario was selected because this storage tank is the largest pressurized vessel with the largest WCS radius.\r\n\r\nNo Alternative Release Scenario (ARS) for flammable substances is required since the RMP is Level 1 program.\r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe plant foreman is responsible for all aspects of the prevention program for the Farrar facility. The following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the FGTP. B"

The plant is subject to EPA's risk management program (RMP) Program 1.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\n\r\nThe FGTP encourages participation by employees in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participate as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the gas plant accident prevention program.  In addition, the plant has a number of initiatives under way which address process safety and employee safety issues.  These initiatives include forming teams to promote both process and personal safety.  The teams typically have members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and plant management.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\n\r\nThe FGTP uses a wide range of reference materials to maintain safe operation of each process.  These documents address specific chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.\r\n\r\nChemical specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in MSDS sheets.  The plant ensures that the process is maintained within acceptable limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems.\r\n\r\nThe gas plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.

This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised. \r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\r\n\r\nThe FGTP has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within the program, each process is analyzed to identify potential hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\r\n\r\nThe FGTP primarily uses the checklist technique to perform these evaluations.  This is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process, as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.  \r\n\r\nThe hazardous analysis findings are forwarded to corporate management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to findings is based on relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  The ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to the teamA\u00bfs findings are tracked until they're completed.  The final solution of each finding is documented and retained.
