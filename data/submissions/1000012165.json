Sysco San Diego, Inc.'s safety and environmental policies are administered by the Maintenance Manager, who conducts periodic inspections of the facility to ensure compliance, and oversees the entire safety and environmental programs, including the CalARP Program.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\n\nThe Sysco San Diego, Inc. ammonia refrigeration system startup occurred during the week of June 8, 1998 with Sysco San Diego, Inc. personnel taking full responsibility for operating the entire facility in July 1998.  The first facility expansion was completed in early January 2005.  The second facility expansion was completed in December 2011.  The facility is located at 12180 Kirkham Road, Poway, California 92064.  The facility has been constructed in accordance with the most recently adopted Uniform Fire and Mechanical Codes. \n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system uses 13,000 pounds of ammonia for several cold and freezer storage areas: -5A?F freezer, 28A?F cooler, 50A?F cooler, 34A?F cooler, 55A?F cooler, and the 45A?F dock.  The majority of the system is located in the engine room including most vessels and all the compressors.  The Intercooler is located outdoors, adjacent to the engine room. The condensers are mounted on the engine room roof, the Control Box and Diffusion Tank are located outside the engine room, and all of the evaporators are located in their respective cold storage rooms/areas.\n\n\n\nThe refrigeration cycle begins with the transfer of high pressure liquid ammonia from the Thermosyphon Receiver to the Controlled Pressure Receiver (CPR), where the pressure is reduced from 140 psig to 103 psig.  The CPR serves as the main storage vessel for the sy"

      "SummaryText": "stem.  The CPR supplies liquid ammonia to the High Temperature Recirculator (HTR) and Intercooler.  Pumps associated with the HTR transfer the liquid to evaporators (23) throughout the facility.  The liquid ammonia expands as it enters the various evaporator coils, reducing the temperature.  These evaporators are used to maintain low air temperatures for warehouse/dock storage.  As the air is chilled by the evaporators, the ammonia is vaporized and returned to the HTR, which maintains a liquid/vapor mixture of ammonia at 28 psig.\n\n\n\nThe HTR also routes the liquid from the CPR to the Low Temperature Recirculator (LTR), which further reduces the pressure of the ammonia to 1.3 psig.  The LTR supplies liquid ammonia to the freezer evaporators (10) and collects the resulting vaporized ammonia.  The Booster Compressors (2) pull this low pressure ammonia vapor from the LTR and discharge higher pressure vapor to the Intercooler.  As Booster discharge is bubbled through the Intercooler's liquid ammonia bath, a portion of the bath vaporizes, which decreases the vapor's superheat.  The High Stage Compressors (3) pull booster discharge from the Intecooler and high stage suction from the HTR and further compress the vapor.  The high stage discharge (hot gas) from the High Stage Compressors is piped to the condensers, where the ammonia is converted back to high pressure liquid and recycled to the Thermosyphon Receiver.  The Thermosyphon Receiver also supplies liquid ammonia to compressors for oil cooling.  The Automatic Purger periodically purges the system of non-condensibles collected in the CPR and the condensers.  The system also has a dilution tank (into which the relief header vents), which is kept full of water.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nThe Sysco San Diego, Inc. facility was designed and constructed in accordance with the 1994 Uniform Mechanical Code which specifically outlines requirements for the safe operation of"

In addition, the majority of the ammonia is maintained inside the engine room or on the engine room roof (condenser).  \n\n\n\nIn addition to the Uniform Mechanical Code, the facility operates in accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines.  In particular, the IIAR Bulletin 110, \"Startup, Inspection, and Maintenance of Ammonia Refrigeration Systems.\"\n\n\n\nAlso, the expansion followed the 2001 California Building Code, which adopts the 1997 UBC, 2000 UMC, 2000 UPC, and the 1999 NEC.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nAn investigation into Sysco San Diego, Inc.'s accident history revealed that there have been no reportable ammonia releases over the past five years (October 2004-October 2009) that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 100 pounds or the State requirement mandating immediate reporting of any release of a hazardous material.  In addition, there have been no injuries resulting from an ammonia release, nor any releases or \"near misses\" that warranted an internal incident investigation.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe Sysco San Diego, Inc. facility has an emergency response plan in effect.  The Emergency Response Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of this PSM/RMP document.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n\n\n1.) To save lives.\n\n2.) To prevent and minimize injuries.\n\n3.) To protect the environment.\n\n4.) To prevent and minimize property damage.\n\n\n\nSysco San Diego, Inc. maintains a safety committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.

In addition, the Sysco San Diego, Inc. Safety Committee will implement several action steps, including the recommendations, on an ongoing basis in a continual effort to provide a safe environment for their employees working on site and for the community.  These steps include:\n\n\n\n1. Continue to train all employees in the facility Safety Plan/Programs.\n\n\n\n2. Continue to encourage and ensure employee involvement in Safety Plan Development.\n\n\n\n3. Continue employee involvement through participation in Safety Teams.\n\n\n\n4.
