The following are brief summaries of these scenarios, including information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the exposure distances for each scenario:\n\nWorst Case\n\nLiquid hydrogen sulfide is stored at the KMCLLC facility in a tank trailer.  As required by RMP, the worst case scenario involves a trailer rupture and 28,000 pounds of hydrogen sulfide is released in 10 minutes. The worst case occurs at a time that there is little wind and the atmosphere is very stable.  This means that little dispersion will occur.  The model results show that the hydrogen sulfide cloud will travel approximately 9.3 miles before dispersing to a concentration less than the endpoint concentration in the RMP rule, Appendix A.\n\n\nAlternative Cases \n\nThe hydrogen sulfide alternative case scenario involves a pressure relief valve.  In this scenario, approximately 4,220 pounds of hydrogen sulfide gas is released.  More typical atmospheric conditions are present and the modeling analysis shows the hydrogen sulfide cloud will travel approximately 1.6 miles before the endpoint concentration is reached.\n\nAmmonia is stored at the KMCLLC facility in horizontal tanks.  The ammonia alternative case scenario involves a pressure relief valve.  In this scenario, approximately 8,190 pounds of ammonia is released.
