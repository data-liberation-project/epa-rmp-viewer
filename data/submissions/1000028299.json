The facility manufactures the refrigerant gas 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane (KLEA 134a).  The facility has been in operation since December 1992 and currently employes 75 people (including contract workers).  Although KLEA 134a is the primary product, the facility also produces hydrochloric acid as a process by-product.\n\n\n\nKLEA 134a is the ozone friendly replacement refrigerant for CFC12.  It is used in automotive air conditioners, refrigerators, freezers, appliances (both home and commercial), and has many other consumer uses.  It is also purified to a medical-grade for use as a propellant in inhalers.\n\n\n\nUnder EPA's RMP rule, 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane (KLEA 134a) is not regulated.  However, hydrogen fluoride (a raw material used in the process) and hydrochloric acid (a process by-product) are both regulated under the rule.  Flammable chemicals are not present at the facility in quantities regulated under the RMP rule.\n\n\n\nThis RMP involves predictive filing for hydrochloric acid.  The facility produces 36% nominal strength hydrochloric acid.  However, it has the capability to produce hydrochloric acid at strengths up to 38%.  Since the threshold concentration for hydrochloric acid in the RMP rule is 37% and the facility is capable of producing acid at strengths up to 38%, the predictive filing option is used for 38% hydrochloric acid.\n\n\n\nThe quantities of hydrogen fluoride and hydrochloric acid (conc. 37% or greater) provided in Section 1.17.c.3 include not only the maximum intended quantities found in the manufacturing process, but also the maximum intended quantities found in railcars located on-site.  Only a small fraction of that shown is in the manufacturing process and of that a significant fraction is in storage (i.e., the bulk of the quantities provided are in storage either in storage tanks "

The facility was also awarded the 2009 Louisiana Chemical Association's \"Best in Class\" Serious About Fostering Excellence (SAFE) Award.\n\n\n\nThe facility has not, in the past 5 years, had an accident that meets the criteria for inclusion in the 5-year accident history.\n\n\n\nThe facility employs several measures to prevent a catastrophic release from occurring:\n\n\n\nDesign: design reviews; process hazard analyses; adherence to national, industry, and company design standards; experienced designers; and management of change;\n\n\n\nConstruction: positive material identification; quality assurance inspection; quality assurance testing; and pre-startup safety reviews;\n\n\n\nPreventive Maintenance: inspection and testing programs; full service maintenance programs; root cause analysis; and improvement upgrades;\n\n\n\nControl Systems: alarms; interlocks; monitoring systems; computer monitoring and control systems; and backup and fail-safe systems;\n\n\n\nTraining: rigorous employee selection process; new employee training; and periodic recertification testing;\n\n\n\nAuditing: internal audits and outside/independent evaluations.\n\n\n\nIn the event of a release, the facility has written procedures and a full emergency response plan in place, along with trained personnel to respond to the emergency.  Emergency response drills are held periodically to insure that responders are proficient in the use of mitigation systems and that notification procedures are followed.

Employee participation programs provide employees significant opportunities for input.  Internal reviews and audits provide a means of self-check and identify areas for improvement.
