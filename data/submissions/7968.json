      "SummaryText": "\nCountry Star Co-op Inc. - North Robinson\n\nCountry Star Co-op is a farmer owned business serving Crawford and surrounding counties.  We are committed to the safety and well being of our employees, community and the environment.  Through regular safety training in areas such as hazard awareness, daily operating guidelines, and worker protection Country Star employees have minimized any potential risk of a hazardous release due to human error.  If an accident were to occur, our emergency response policies would take effect to ensure the proper calls were made and emergency response crews would respond in a timely manner.\n\nThe North Robinson facility consists of approximately 60 acres on the west side of North Robinson.  The facility is equiped to handle fertilizer, crop protection products, fuel, and also has a grain faciliy.  Anhydrous Ammonia is a fertilizer used by farmers as the most economical source of nitrogen used to grow crops.  The maximum quantity of Anhydrous stored at the facility is 25,500 gallons or 131,000 pounds in a single 30,000-gallon tank.\n\nThe worst-case scenario would be a total release of the entire tank filled to capacity.  The tank would rupture and the entire contents release in a matter of 10 minutes.  The total impact zone that the cloud could cover to and end point of 200 ppm would be approximately 1.2 miles.  The entire town of North Robinson including Colonel Crawford Junior and Senior High is within this zone.  Approximately 78 households with 221 people are also in the zone.\n\nThe alternative release scenario could be a release of Anhydrous through a transfer hose.  The hose is 1 1/2 inches and the line would release 3,563 per minute.  The release would occur for two minutes before actions could be taken to stop the release.  At this rate 7,126 pounds would be released and it would cover .46 miles to the 200 ppm end point.  This zone would again cover Colonel Crawford Junior High and High School along with 13 households.\n\nCountryStar C"

New hires will receive training as part of their new employee orientation.

Safety improvement is an ongoing process at the facility.  State and local agencies will continue to conduct yearly inspections and repair requirements.  Through regular maintenance, and routine inspections we will continue to run a safe business."
