The information changed included the following:\n     Facility name\n     Parent company name\n     Facility location address (the facility did not relocate, but the address of the administration building where personnel are located changed).\n     The address of the administration building is 2385 Riverport Road, Memphis, TN, 38109\n     The person responsible for the RMP implementation \n     The emergency contact\n     Date of the last safety inspection\n\nSite Information\n\nPremcor operates a variety of processes to produce high quality petroleum products from raw crude oil.  All refinery process units are currently managed under the PSM Standard; therefore, these process units are currently managed as RMP Program Level 3 processes.  The refinery has a thoroughly-trained, experienced, safety-motivated workforce that has achieved an outstanding safety record.  The refinery is in full compliance with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.\n\nPremcor has a longstanding commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the time, money, and effort invested in training personnel and promoting safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. Safety tools include engineering controls, real time process monitoring, level, pressure, and temperature alarms, leak detection systems, and automatic and manual mitigation systems.

The Memphis/Shelby County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) was the lead agency.  Twelve area companies, numerous federal, state, and local regulatory and emergency response agencies participated in the symposium.  Each company or agency prepared a booth with informational literature and displays.  Persons ready and willing to discuss RMP, safety programs, or answer public questions staffed the booths.  Expert speakers, emergency response equipment, and live demonstrations of Shelter-in-Place and HAZMAT response were also featured.  Approximately 600 people attended the symposium.\n\nThe refinery has been working with our Community Advisory Panel (CAP), which meets monthly, to identify effective means for communicating RMP/Safety information to our immediate neighboring community.  CAP members have provided many helpful suggestions, and have offered to distribute our RMP-related printed material at various venues in the community.  Premcor and the CAP members agree that RMP/Safety communication should be an ongoing effort.\n\nHazard Assessment Results - Identification of Scenarios\n\nRelease scenario results were estimated using the RMPlanner software published by JBF Associates.  The software calculates estimated distances to the endpoint based on the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) \"Lookup\" Tables.

The largest inventory of RMP flammables is in the LPG spheres.\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nPremcor has an excellent record of accident prevention over the past five years.  No incident has resulted in offsite effects (deaths, injuries, significant property damage, evacuations, shelter-in-place, or environmental damage) as defined by EPA's RMP guidelines (RMP-covered process and RMP-covered chemicals).  During the past five years, the following minor releases have occurred:\n\n*Two propane releases\n*Three Hydrogen sulfide releases\n*Five Hydrofluoric acid releases (three of these releases also contained flammable mixtures)\n\nEach incident was carefully investigated to determine the cause of the incident and what actions to take to prevent similar incidents from occurring.  All of these releases were detected and contained within the plant with no off site impact.  Information concerning these minor releases have been submitted in the RMP data elements. \n\nIn the accident history data elements for 1999-2006, some of the release amounts are estimates. \n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program Steps\n\nThe following summary describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program at Premcor.  RMP-regulated processes at the refinery are subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.  Therefore, this summary will address each of the OSHA PSM elements.\n\nThe Health, Safety, and Environment (HS&E) Department oversees compliance with 29 CFR 1910.119, the PSM standard.  The department has developed a management system for satisfying the requirements of each of the 14 elements that comprise the PSM standard.  Where appropriate, a time frame is specified for completion of the necessary action.  The program is audited periodically to evaluate its effectiveness.  The management system is intended to accomplish the following:\n\n* Describe the requirements of each paragraph of 1910.119\n* Describe how each requirement will b"

Each analysis is conducted by a cross-functional team and facilitated by someone familiar with both the refinery and HAZOP methodology.  The team typically includes an operator from the covered process, a PSM facilitator, an engineer, maintenance, and instrumentation personnel.  Other technical or supervisory personnel may sit in on the evaluation when their expertise is needed.\n\nBeginning in 2006, an outside consultant has been included during each HAZOP to perform a Level of Protection Analysis (LOPA) as part of the HAZOP team.  This allows the refinery to determine appropriate safety integrity levels (SIL) for the unit on which the HAZOP is being conducted.  This also meets the requirements of ISA S84.01.  By performing a LOPA analysis, the Memphis Refinery is moving ahead of the industry by performing this analysis before it is required by standard.\n\nAs safety concerns are evaluated, they are rated according to probability and consequence.  \nAll concerns are documented as part of the HAZOP process.
