      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\n\n\nCoastal Energy Corporation has been in business for more than 40 years. The company has asphalt plants and fuel terminals, adding a propane terminal in 2017. The company is expanding its propane operation in 2022 with its Yellville Transload Facility. Coastal has on site more than the threshold quantity of propane (10,000 pounds) as part of the transload operations. Therefore, the facility is required to submit a Risk Management Plan (RMP) as defined in 40 CFR Part 68. The propane quantity at the facility is subject to RMP Program Level 3 requirements. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) RMP Rule requires that covered facilities prepare an Executive Summary. The following paragraphs represent the Executive Summary, summarizing the items required as described in 40 CFR Part 68.155 (a) through (f).\n\n\n\nA?68.155(a) Accidental Release and Emergency Response Policies\n\nCoastal has documented emergency response procedures in place, as documented in the facility's Emergency Response Plan. This plan has been endorsed by company staff responsible for the operation and maintenance of the facility. Coastal has procedures in place, including both onsite activities and coordination with offsite responders, which must be followed in the event of a propane release. All personnel involved in handling propane are trained in regard to safety and accident prevention.\n\n\n\nA?68.155(b) Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe stationary source subject to 40 CFR Part 68 is the Coastal Energy Corporation facility. The regulated substance on site is propane.\n\n\n\nA?68.155(c) Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nCoastal has a documented Prevention Program for the propane process that documents release prevention measures. These prevention measures include elements such as Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Mechanical Integrity, Management of Change, "

      "SummaryText": "Pre-Startup Review, Compliance Audits, Incident Investigation, Employee Participation, Hot Work Permit, and Contractor Safety. Coastal  employees who are involved in propane operations and maintenance are trained in specific procedures regarding handling and storage of propane at the facility.\n\n\n\n\n\nA?68.155(d) Five-Year Accident History\n\nBecause this is a new facility, there have not been any reportable incidents since operation commenced.\n\n\n\nA?68.155(e) Emergency Response Program\n\nCoastal is a non-responding facility, as defined by USEPA (29 CFR Part 40 CFR Part 311). Therefore, Coastal has developed an Emergency Response Plan to ensure employee safety instead of an Emergency Response Program, as allowed by 40 CFR Part 68.90(b). The company emergency plan outlines actions required to respond to a propane emergency and has coordinated this plan with Marion County Emergency Management and Yellville Fire Department. Fire Department personnel are the designated first responders in the event of a propane emergency at the facility. Coastal employees are not designated responders to a propane release. As specified in 40 CFR Part 68.90, CEC's Emergency Response Plan meets the exception listed in 40 CFR Part 68.90(b) and therefore, the facility is not required to have the Emergency Response Program of 40 CFR Part 68.95.\n\n\n\nA?68.155(f) Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nAdditional recommendations for safety improvements were not identified in the PHA, with the program based on procedures and processes already in place at other facilities. However, because it is a new facility, safety will be reviewed continuously for the first 90 to 180 days, with revisions and improvements made as needed through the Management of Change process.\n\n "
