The Company endeavors to execute this policy through the daily implementation of its Safety Programs.  The safety programs include, but are not limited to a comprehensive Process Safety Management Program (PSM).  The PSM Program is an integrated approach to the safe operation of processes using Regulated Substances, and forms the Program Level III Prevention Program component of the RMP.  The 6th Street Cooling, LLC PSM Program is specifically designed and intended to prevent accidental releases, and to deal safely with emergencies if and when they do happen.  It is the primary goal of 6th Street Cooling, LLC to protect its employees, visitors and neighbors from harm due to Company operations.  With this in mind, the priorities of protection of life, the environment, and then property have been established.  Only when these goals have been achieved may the focus shift to resumption of business operations.\n \n6th Street Cooling, LLC has adopted a ?non-responding facility? policy.  A Hazardous Material Business Plan (including Emergency Action Plan element) has been developed and submitted to the ?Designated Agency? (Imperial County Health Department, Division of Environmental Health) with a copy provided to the Holtville Fire Department.  The Business Plan includes the Hazardous Material Inventory consistent with EPCRA compliance in California, and the information necessary to be included in the Area Emergency Plan.  An Emergency Coordinator has been established. Emergency response pre-planning is coordinated and kept current through the annual submission of appropriate reports.  The Fire Department has been contacted to make periodic tours of the facility.  Local response capabilities have been verified.  \n\n6th"

The 6th Street Cooling, LLC is responsible for operations at the site.\n\n6th Street Cooling, LLC is a refrigeration plant located in Holtville, CA.  The facility provides refrigeration effect for the removal of field heat from freshly harvested produce; and subsequent short-term refrigerated storage.  The Plant is seasonally operated.  Product harvest periods normally begin in early November and end around the end of June.  The Plant refrigeration system is supported with portable refrigeration equipment during peak periods.  General maintenance is year-round, with major maintenance occurring in the off-season summer months.\n\nThe Regulated Substance in use is anhydrous ammonia (NH3).  Refrigeration equipment consists of Pressure Vessels, HydroVac? Vacuum Tubes, Refrigeration Trailers (Compressor Units), Ice-making equipment, Pressure Cooling Equipment, Cold Storage Room Evaporators and associated valves, instrumentation and piping.  The vacuum tubes are used to pre-cool agricultural product; the refrigerated storage portion of the facility is used for short-term product storage.  Evaporators in the storage section of the facility maintain temperature until product is sold and shipped.  The refrigeration system is configured in a closed-loop system with isolation and overpressure relief valves installed in key areas.   An ammonia-water diffusion system protects against a"

Off-site foliage in the downwind path experienced some minor ?ammonia burn? damage but recovered shortly thereafter.  The facility immediately installed mechanical controls and started installation of a diffusion system to prevent a similar incident from re-occurring.  The Incident was fully re-evaluated in an Incident Investigation that was re-opened 3/20/2003, as the result of a compliance audit by an outside consulting firm.  Additional compliance and preventative measures were executed immediately thereafter. \n \n1.5  The Emergency Response Program\n\nThe Emergency Response Program is divided into two elements, as only properly trained and qualified personnel are authorized to respond to emergencies.  Personnel that are not trained to OSHA 1910.120 (q) standards notify and evacuate.  Only the responding Fire Department(s) and 6th Street Cooling?s 1910.120 (q) trained personnel would respond to an actual emergency.
