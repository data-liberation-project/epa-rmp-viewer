QCCP has expanded it's capacity to produce 35 million gallons of ethanol per year since the beginning.   Accident Release and Prevention and Response.  QCCP has a commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated in the resouces invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel as well as considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of the facility.  QCCP's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However if a release does occur, plant personnel are trained to alert the emergency responders and evacuate residents down wind of the release.  QCCP is located in Ida County located 2 miles south of Galva Iowa.   The facility operates 24 hours a day 7 days per week for the purpose of manufacturing fuel grade ethanol from corn.  The regulated substance under the RMP program is Anhydrous Ammonia.  QCCP has determined the the radius of impact from a worst case release would be about 4.9 miles due to amount of ammonia stored on site.   Off Site Consequence analysis Results:  The worst case scenario at the facility is a release of all 64,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia creating a toxic cloud.  The worst case scenario is  based on the release of all 64,000 pounds being released on site.  The worst case vapor cloud endpoint is approximately 4.9 miles from the center of the plant.  The town of Galva, Iowa with a school, and Rural residence homes are located within this radius.  Since the facility qualifies as a Program 3 due to the close proximity of public receptors Process Safety Management has to be compelted for this facility.  Five year accident history.  The facility has not had a incident release in the past five years.  QCCP has been in operation since March of 2002 and has not had a release.    Emergency Response Program Information."
