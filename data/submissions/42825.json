If an accidential release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Lisbon Fire Department, or other authorities, to mimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage of anhydrous ammonia and loading nurse tanks for delivery \nto the farm for application. \n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application for crop nutrients.\n\nThe maximum quanity stored would be 131,325 lbs. in one 30,000 gallon tank.  The maximun quanity handled would be the unloading of a transport truck vessel containing 53,000 pounds.\n\nThe worst case senerio would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank release over ten minutes.  The maximum quanity would be 131,325 pounds representing 85 percent of the largest tank  capacity, as limited by design standards.   \n\nThe alternate release scenario based on a two minute release is a release from a break in a three inch transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint in this case would be 1.2  miles.\n\nThe facility has implemented the provissions of \"Safety Requirements for the Starage and Handeling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc. and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA),29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia\".\n\nThere was an accidental releases of Anhydrous Ammonia on May 5, 1998 and May 6, 1998  at this site.\nAs a result, we trainined the manufacturer and employees next door on anhydrous ammonia safety.  We held a training with the local fire department and our employees.  We notified the transporter of the safety precautions at our site including trainin"

The second incident was a valve failure corrected by replacing the valve.  We also learned how important it is to communicate with the Fire Department.\n\nFarmers Union Oil Company has a written action plan, in accordance with OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.38; provided state and local authorities with emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPRCA).\n\nFarmers Union Oil Company will coordinate this plan with the local emergency responders.\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to access the maintenance of safety conditions.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementations at this time."
