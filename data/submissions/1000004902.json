      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION POLICIES\nThe Ventura Water Reclamation Facility has a long standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the Chlorination and Dechlorination Systems.  The Ventura Water Reclamation Facility\u00c2\u00bfs policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\nChlorine is injected into the water in order to disinfect it and to prevent bacterial growth while the water travels through pipelines. VWRF employs a chlorination system for final effluent disinfection using chlorine gas and a dechlorination process utilizing sulfur dioxide. \nChlorine - One-ton cylinders of liquid chlorine are imported to the facility by truck from a local supplier. A maximum of 15 one-ton chlorine cylinders are stored onsite in a building equipped with an emergency scrubber.\nSulfur Dioxide - One-ton cylinders of liquid sulfur dioxide are imported to the facility by truck from a local supplier. A maximum of 4 one-ton cylinders are stored onsite in a building equipped with an emergency scrubber.\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY/OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\nWorst-Case Release Scenario Results Summary\nScenario Description: Per the EPA Regulations, one worst-case release scenario has been defined for each of the two systems.  The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment documentation.\n  \nAlternative Release Scenario Results Summary\nScenario Description: Per the EPA Regulations, one alternative-case release scenario has been defined for each of the two systems.  The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment documentation.  \n\nRisk Considerations\nAlthough the storage and use of chlorine and sulfur dioxide has inherent potential risks and the release scenarios can potentially reach sensitive populations within th"

      "SummaryText": "e community, the Ventura Water Reclamation Facility has recognized these potential risks and structured its safety programs to make the worst case type of event non-credible.  In addition to the safety practices of the facility and personnel to make the worst-case event non-credible, it should also be recognized that there are inherent analysis assumptions that make the results of the atmospheric dispersion analysis appear worse than what would actually be expected during such an event.\n\nIn addition to the use of conservative analysis assumptions that over-predict the effects of a potential release, other characteristics of the facility and site serve to minimize the potential risks associated with a chlorine or sulfur dioxide release.  The facility also has safety systems in place to protect personnel such as scrubbers, safety showers, respiratory equipment, and chlorine and sulfur dioxide gas detection.\n\n\nPREVENTION PROGRAM\nAs part of the implementation of RMP, key Prevention Program elements were documented and implemented by the Ventura Water Reclamation Facility to manage process safety issues associated with the use of chlorine and sulfur dioxide. Prevention Program 3 elements include:\n\n\u00c2\u00a768.65\tProcess Safety Information (PSI) \n\u00c2\u00a768.67\tProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\u00c2\u00a768.69 \tOperating Procedures (OP)\n\u00c2\u00a768.71\tTraining (TRN)\n\u00c2\u00a768.73\tMechanical Integrity (MI)\n\u00c2\u00a768.75\tManagement of Change (MOC)\n\u00c2\u00a768.77\tPre-Startup Review (PSSR)\n\u00c2\u00a768.79\tCompliance Audits (CA)\n\u00c2\u00a768.81\tIncident Investigation (II)\n\u00c2\u00a768.83\tEmployee Participation (EP)\n\u00c2\u00a768.85\tHot Work Permit (HWP)\n\u00c2\u00a768.87\tContractors (CO)\n\u00c2\u00a768.90\tEmergency Planning & Response (EP&R)\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThere have been no RMP-applicable releases of chlorine or sulfur dioxide at the facility in at least the past five (5) years.  \n \nFLAMMABLES: WORST CASE\nThe use of flammable materials at the Ventura Water Reclamation Facility is not encompassed by the federal RMP requirements.
