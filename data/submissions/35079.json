The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the facility:\nThe Linde Gas, LLC facility located in Canton, Michigan complies with NFPA requirements for LP-Gas storage, and it is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  If an emergency accidental release were to occur involving our propane, propylene, or acetylene storage/handling systems, it is our policy to immediately notify the Canton Fire Department and the Linde Gas emergency response team, who would respond to the emergency.  In addition, each employee is trained monthly on safety policies and procedures.  Hazards identified during quarterly \"safety walks\" are corrected as soon as possible.  \n\n2.  A description of the facility and the regulated substances handled:\nThe Linde Gas facility manufactures acetylene and stores propane and propylene in above ground storage tanks (ASTs).  All three gases are put into storage cylinders of various sizes before they are sold and shipped from the facility.   The propane storage/handling process consists of one 18,000-gallon propane AST, propane cylinder filling equipment, filled propane cylinders of various sizes, and associated piping, valves, and other miscellaneous equipment.  The propylene storage/handling process consists of one 3,500-gallon propylene AST, propylene cylinder filling equipment, filled propylene cylinders of various sizes, and associated piping, valves, and other miscellaneous equipment.  The acetylene manufacturing/handling/storage process consists of a low pressure acetylene generator and a high pressure cylinder filling area.  The low pressure acetylene generator uses calcium carbide to generate acetylene gas that is purified and stored in a \"gas holder\".  The acetylene that is generated in the low pressure generator is piped to the high pressure cylinder fill area where it is compressed and routed through manifolds that are used to fill multiple cylinders.  \n\n3.
