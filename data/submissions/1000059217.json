The plan is designed to meet the following objectives:\r\nTo save lives\r\nTo protect the environment\r\nTo minimize property damage\r\n\r\nSnoTemp's Emergency Response Team are the designated emergency coordinators.  The Plan provides response organization, ammonia health hazards, evacuation routes and mitigation procedures to respond to emergency situations at the facility.  The Plan is reviewed once a year or as needed to ensure compliance with PSM and RMP regulations or for facility changes.\r\n\r\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\r\nSnoTemp maintains thermal environments for food item storage.  The system consists of an ammonia refrigeration system which includes compressors, condensers, evaporators, vessels and piping.  Controls consist of a secure computerized system which follows user defined set points and provides alarms if any safety parameters are breached.  Ammonia the refrigerant is changed from liquid to vapor as it absorbs heat then changed back to a liquid through pressure increases and heat dissipation.  This process of changing the state of ammonia removes heat from insulated rooms and expels the heat outside the system.  Typical operating pressures range from 0 psig to 140 psig across this process.\r\n\r\nAnyrdrous ammonia (CAS 7664-41-7) is the refrigerant used in this system.\r\n\r\nThe total ammonia quantity of this system is above the 10,000 pound threshold quantity for reporting.\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\nThe SnoTemp facility operates in accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia (IIAR) guidelines and standa"

Team members have all had 40 hour or 24 hour HAZWOPER training with annual 8 hour refresher training.  We only respond to levels below 300 ppm.  We have much capability to respond remotely through our refrigeration control system.\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\nDuring development of PSM and RMP for this facility we found we needed improvements in training of emergency procedures.  Additional enunciators and sensors were installed and are regularly calibrated by an outside contractor.  Scheduled evacuation drills have been added to our job tracker scheduling program."
