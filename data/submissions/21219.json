Our commitment to protect our employees and the communities that are home to our operations is an integral part of Cytec's way of doing business.  Cytec has established safety, health, emergency response and environmental policies and standards to meet or exceed all regulatory requirements.  As a member of the Chemical Manufacturers' Association (CMA), Cytec subscribes to the codes established for Responsible Care ?.\n\n(b) THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nOur facility has 3 processes that involve regulated substances.\n\nThe Methylated Resins process makes products that are raw materials for the manufacture of coatings for the automotive and other industries; and, adhesives for rubber tire manufacturing.  The regulated substance involved with this process is formaldehyde.\n\nThe Polyamines process makes products that are used to manufacture water treatment chemicals for the paper, mining and food processing industry.  The regulated substances involved with this process are epichlorohydrin and a flammable mixture of dimethylamine in water.\n\nThe Quaternized PAM Emulsions process makes products that are used to separate sludge and solids from water in water recovery facilities before the water is returned to rivers and lakes.  The regulated substances involved with this process are methyl chloride, formaldehyde, and a flammable mixture of dimethylamine in water. \n\n(c) WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nThe toxic worst-case scenario is the failure of a storage tank and the release of 220,000 pounds of methyl chloride.  The effect of written operating procedures and a high level alarm that prevents the storage tank from being filled to more than 91% of its capacity was included in the evaluation of the possible con"

The effect of written operating procedures and a high level alarm that prevents the storage tank from being filled to more than 93% of its capacity was included in the evaluation of the possible consequences.  The overpressure from the ignition of the vapor could reach off-site endpoints and nearby public receptors.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for epichlorohydrin is a leak in a transfer line during unloading and a release of 160,000 pounds of material.  The mitigating effects of a dike and a sump were included in the evaluation of the possible consequences. The evaporating epichlorohydrin could reach offsite endpoints and nearby public receptors.\n \nThe alternative release scenario for formaldehyde is a leak in a storage tank recirculating line and the release of 38,000 pounds of material.  The mitigating effects of a dike and a sump were included in the evaluation of the possible consequences.  The evaporating formaldehyde could reach offsite endpoints and nearby public receptors.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for methyl chloride is a leak in a transfer pipe and the release of 15,000 pounds of material.  The mitigating effect of an excess flow valve was included in the evaluation of the possible consequences. The evaporating methyl chloride could reach offsite endpoints and nearby public receptors.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for the flammable mixture (60% aqueous dimethylamine) is a leak in the transfer pipe from the storage tank and the release of 46,000 pounds of material.
