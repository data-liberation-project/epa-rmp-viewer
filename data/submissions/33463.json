Should an accidental release occur, the facility has orientated the local fire department Lee County LEPC, and/or other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the people and the environment.. \n\n2) Facility Information:  The primary activity at the facility is the storage for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.  Anhydrous ammonia is stored in tanks designed for this purpose.                                 \n\n3)  The worst-case release scenario and alternate release scenario:\n     An analysis of the potential off-ste consequences of hypothetical worst-case and alternative-case accidental releases have been addressed in our Hazard Assessment and information is in our Risk Management Program.\n\n\n4) The accidental release program:  This facility is in compliance with the provisions of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia\" and our state regulations covering anhydrous ammonia.  The OSHA standard is referenced in this RMP Registration For; see Section 8.3(b).\n\n5)  The Five-Year Accident History:  There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia for the covered process in the past five years that have caused any deaths,  injuries, or significant property damage on site; nor to our knowledge, have any accidental releases resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage. \n\n6)  The Emergency Response Program:  The facility has a written emergency action plan in acco"
