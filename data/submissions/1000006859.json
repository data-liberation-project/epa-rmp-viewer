Anhydrous Ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a \ncrop production nutrient. The maximum quantity stored would be 130050 pounds in the \nfacility's storage tank.\n3.\tThe worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of the storage tank \nrelease as a gas over 10 minutes. The maximum quantity released would be 130050 pounds, \nwhich represents the volume of the storage tank at 85% capacity as limited by design \nstandards and company procedures. The distance to the endpoint of dispersion based on the \nmodel used is 1.16 miles.\n\t\t        The Alternative-case release scenario is assumed to be a release from the \t   \t      \t\n\t\t       rupture of a 2 inch line, with 12000 pounds released over 2 minutes.  The \t        \t      \t\n\t\t       distance to the endpoint of dispersion is .56 miles.\n4.\tTHE ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PROGRAM:  The facility complies with the \t       \nrules and Regulations relating to the handling of Anhydrous Ammonia and Low Pressure \nNitrogen Solution, Equipment, Containers and Storage Facilities.
