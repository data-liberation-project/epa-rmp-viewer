The systems are checked on a regular basis to ensure they are functioning properly and in good repair.\n\n\n\nThe facility has an emergency evacuation plan that includes ammonia leaks.  If an ammonia leak or an alarm indicating an ammonia leak is observed by facility personnel, the decision to evacuate the building is made by management.  Professional emergency responders are called to assist with the ammonia leak as necessary. \n\n\n\nThe management at Eckert Cold Storage is committed to safety.  The emergency action plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration systems at 905 Clough Road in Escalon, California were constructed in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations including the Uniform Fire and Mechanical Codes at the time of construction.  \n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration systems are closed systems that cycle the refrigerant from liquid to gas and back again.  The facility's two independent refrigeration systems, consisting of vessels, piping, valves, and process equipment, cycle ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for dock operations, cooler and freezer storage.  The Production System and West System each use 23,850 pounds and 18,512 pounds of ammonia, respectively. The majority of the systems are located in the engine rooms including vessels and compressors.  The condensers are mounted on the roof, and the evaporators are located "

Much of the safety of the systems is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system.  For example, the facility operates in accordance with Cal/OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation.  The facility conducts maintenance and any necessary repairs in house.\n\n\n\nThe facility, including the ammonia systems, was designed and constructed in accordance with the Uniform Mechanical Code, which specifically outlines requirements for the safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system.  These safety features include ammonia sensors in the engine rooms as well as sensors near the evaporators, and automatic shut down systems.  In addition, the majority of the ammonia is maintained inside the engine room and just outside of the engine room (condensers).  All pressure vessels are equipped with pressure relief valves that are commonly piped.  These pressure relief valves in the West System and Production System vent to a water tank, while the relief valves in the Cooler Storage System vent to the atmosphere. In addition to the Uniform Mechanical Code, Eckert Cold Storage has developed a preventive maintenance program to complete regularly scheduled inspections and tests of the ammonia refrigeration systems as well as repairs as needed to process equipment.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nEPA's RMP regulation defines \"accident\" as the following: \n\n\n\n\"The release must be from a covered process and involve a regulated substance held above its threshold quantity in the process. The release must have caused at least one of the following: \n\n\n\n?    On-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage (?68.42(a)); or\n\n?    Known offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place (?68.42(a)).\" \n\n\n\nAn in"

      "SummaryText": "vestigation into the facility's accident history during the PHA Revalidation study performed on April 14, 2014, revealed that there have been no releases of ammonia over the past five years (April 2009 - April 2014) that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 100 pounds in 24 hours or that meet the EPA reporting criteria for the Five-Year Accident History. In addition, there have been no injuries resulting from a release of ammonia, nor any releases or \"near misses\" that warranted an internal incident investigation.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY ACTION PLAN\n\n\n\nThe Eckert Cold Storage facility has an emergency action plan in effect.  The Emergency Action Plan (Plan) has been developed by Eckert Cold Storage and is included in the PSM/RMP/CalARP document which is maintained at the facility.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n\n\n  1.) To save lives.\n\n  2.) To minimize and avoid injuries.\n\n  3.) To protect the environment.\n\n  4.) To minimize property damage.\n\n\n\nThe Eckert Cold Storage facility maintains a safety committee whose members include the designated incident commander for the facility and the maintenance department at a minimum.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures, which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This Plan is reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM, RMP, and CalARP regulations, as well as to incorporate facility changes.\n\n\n\nEckert Cold Storage is non-responding and the facility plans to coordinate emergency response efforts with the fire department on a periodic and ongoing basis.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nThe Process Hazards Analysis study (performed on July 1996, and revalidated on July 2004, April 29, 2009, and on April 14, 2014), including a Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) study and "

The Eckert Cold Storage safety committee is planning to complete several items over the next year, as a continual effort to provide a safe work environment for their employees.  These changes include the following items:\n\n\n\n1. Continue to train all employees in the facility safety plan/programs.\n\n\n\n2. Continue to have employee involvement in safety plan development.\n\n\n\n3. Continue employee involvement through safety team participation.\n\n\n\n4. Continue internal and external safety audits/inspections and implement changes as needed. "
