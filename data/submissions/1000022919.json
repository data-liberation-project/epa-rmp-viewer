      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\nA. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nInter-Pac, Inc. (Inter-Pac) is a specialty foam manufacturing facility which produces polyethylene (PE) foam, and structural polystyrene (SPS) Foam located in Tupelo, Mississippi. The PE foam manufacturing process also includes a laminated PE foam process. A Title V Permit Application renewal was submitted to Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality in January 2011.\n\nPolyethylene foam or \"PE\" foam is a plastic product made of polyethylene resin mixed with reclaimed product and additives, extrusion of the mixed resin through a highly specialized extruder; adding a liquid blowing agent (Isobutane), then cooling the material and forcing it through a die. The finished product is produced in variety of colors, thicknesses, and densities. The Isobutane is stored at the tank storage area in one (1) 7,000 gallon and two (2) 6,000 gallon storage tanks with a combined storage capacity of 19,000 gallons which equates to 89,177 pounds of Isobutane.\n\nThe EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) is part of the Clean Air Act and applies to processes storing a specified chemical above a threshold quantity. The chemicals and threshold quantities are specified in Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 68. One such chemical is isobutane in excess of 10,000 pounds which is used as a blowing agent in the manufacturing process.\n\nAfter reviewing the facility operations and the RMP regulations, it was determined that the entire facility is considered one process. Based on the facility processes and applicable regulations, it was determined that the facility is subject to Program Level 3 of the RMP regulations.\n\nB.  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nInter-Pac is committed to protecting facility personnel, the public, and the environment from any workplace and accidental release hazards. An appropriate response to releases of Isobutane is in the written Risk Management Prog"

      "SummaryText": "ram. Safety, environmental, and risk management programs are fully implemented and coordinated with community emergency responders for emergency planning and response. \n\nC. Hazard Assessment\n\nThe RMP requires Inter-Pac to evaluate the maximum potentially affected area for accidents involving Isobutane for worst case release scenario and an alternative scenario.\n\nThe worst case release is highly improbable since it involves the combination of a certain set of conditions for a large release of the chemical without any employee intervention. The assumptions for the worst-case analysis are very conservative. The endpoints specified for regulated flammable substances are intended to be protective of the general public. The distance to the endpoint estimated under worst-case conditions should not be considered an area in which the public would likely be in danger; instead, it is intended to provide an estimate of the maximum possible area that might be affected in the unlikely event of catastrophic accident. EPA intends the estimated distances to provide a basis for discussion among the regulated community, emergency responders, and the public, rather a basis for any specific actions.\n\nA release from the 7,000 gallon storage tank has been identified as the worst-case release and was considered in the hazard assessment. The 7,000 gallons of Isobutane equates to approximately 32,833 lbs of Isobutane. The tanks are surrounded by secondary containment which would fully contain a spill from a single tank. Thereby reducing the evaporation rate of the spill.\n\nThe impact distance from the worst-case scenario has been estimated using EPA's RMPcomp Model. The impact distance from the RMPcomp Model results in an impact distance of 0.3 miles. The impact distance extends beyond the facility property.\n\nThe alternative scenario is an event more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario and is a more realistic accident scenario. Inter-Pac has determined that appropriate alternative sc"

The leak would release approximately 1,599 lbs of Isobutane. The RMPcomp Method estimates a distance to the endpoint of 0.05 mile for the alternative release scenario.\n\nD. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nProcess Safety Information: Inter-Pac will complete a compilation of written safety information to be used in conducting the process hazard analysis (PHA). The PHA will be conducted using the process safety information gathered in order to identify and understand the hazards posed by the Isobutane System. The PHA will be conducted using the process safety information in order to identify and understand the hazards posed by the Isobutane system.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis: Inter-Pac will update and re-validate the PHA as necessary and at least every five (5) years. The PHA was conducted using  the \"What IF\" methodology, which is one of the methodologies specified in 40 CFR 68.67, and was performed by a team with expertise in engineering and process operations, including one member who has expertise in the Isobutane system and a member knowledgeable in the specified PHA methodology. A system was established to promptly address the team's findings and recommendations; assure that the recommendations are resolved in a timely manner and that the resolution is documented; develop a written schedule of when these actions are to be completed; and communicate the actions to operation, maintenance and other employees who may be affected by the recommendations or actions.\n\nOperating Procedures: Inter-Pac has developed written operating procedures to provide clear instructions for safely conducting activities at each operation where Isobutane is utilized. These written operating procedures will be consistent with the process safety information for each operating phase, operating limitations, safety and h"

These operating procedures will be reviewed as often as necessary to assure that they reflect current operating practice. Inter-Pac will certify annually that these operating procedures are current and accurate. Inter-Pac will develop and implement safe work practices to provide for the control of hazards during operations such as lockout/tagout; opening process equipment or piping; and control entrance into the Inter-Pac facility.\n\nTraining: Inter-Pac will provide training for each employee associated with the Isobutane system. This training will include an overview of the process and operating procedures as outlined in 40 CFR 68.67. Refresher training is provided every three (3) years or more often as necessary. Inter-Pac documents and maintains records of employee training, and the means used to verify that the employee understood the training.\n\nMechanical Integrity: Inter-Pac will develop a written preventive maintenance program to maintain the on-going integrity of the equipment used in the Isobutane system (i.e., storage tanks, pumps, piping systems, etc); additionally, inspections, testing, equipment deficiencies, and quality assurance are addressed.\n\nEach person who has responsibilities to perform maintenance on the Isobutane system components receives training at least every three (3) years or more often if necessary.\nManagement of Change: Inter-Pac will establish and implement written procedures to manage changes to process chemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures and changes to Inter-Pac that effect the Isobutane system. These procedures assure that appropriate considerations are addressed prior to any change.
