The facility is staffed year-round and also employs a large seasonal workforce during the spring and summer months.  The plant produces fresh and frozen seafood products, using anhydrous ammonia in a closed system as a refrigerant in freezers.  Ammonia is the safest refrigerant available and has excellent warning properties; it is extremely pungent at levels far below dangerous concentrations.  In calculating worst-case and alternative scenarios, efforts were made in all cases to overestimate rather than underestimate the effects of a release.  The plant has been operating safely since 1968.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program \n\nTrident Seafoods has a prevention program in place to comply with the requirements of the Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29 CFR 1910.119), which is designed to prevent accidental releases of ammonia.  The PSM program addresses all required elements including employee participation, process safety information and system drawings, operating procedures, hot work permits, management of change, mechanical integrity, training, pre-startup review, compliance audits, process hazard analysis, contractor safety, incident investigation and emergency response.  The system has many safety features built in including high and low level controls and alarms, safety relief valves, automatic and manually controlled valves and shutoffs, and check valves. The plant has a network of electrochemical sensors to detect leaks, initiate automatic area shutdowns and sound alarms.  The facility has a dedicated ammonia alarm system including pull stations for activation. \n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nPer the require"

There have been no incidents meeting these criteria in the past five years.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response\n\nTrident Seafoods maintains a written emergency response plan per 29 CFR 1910.38 and 29 CFR 1910.120 to facilitate safe response to potentially uncontrolled ammonia releases.  The plan identifies personnel designated and trained to conduct the necessary duties during an emergency.  Responsibilities include notification of and communication with local responders and authorities, and orderly evacuation of the facility. \n\n\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to  Improve Safety\n\nSafety at the facility is improved continuously through the process hazard analysis process, safety meetings, employee suggestions, accident, incident and near-miss investigations, and as the result of internal and external audits and inspections. Upgrades are planned on an ongoing basis as needed to keep the system in safe working order.\n\n"
