      "SummaryText": "PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nAs a vital element of the facility?s prevention program, Smithfield has inaugurated a Process Safety Management Program as mandated by OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.119 (Process Safety Management). Smithfield has implemented strict preventive maintenance procedures and an Emergency Action and Response Plan (EARP).  Release of ammonia is specially covered in the Emergency Action and Response Plan and contains all required actions in the event of release of ammonia.  As part of the facility's accidental release prevention, training is conducted for employees and new hires.  Accidental release prevention, training and awareness are reinforced annually and as operations at the facility dictates.\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n- Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nSmithfield is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety. This commitment is inherent to our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with our regulated processes. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible accidental releases of regulated substances. However, if such an accidental release does occur, we are coordinated with the local Fire Department, Local Emergency Planning Committee, and County Emergency Management Agency for emergency response support.\n\n\n- The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nPresently ammonia  (Anhydrous) is the only RMP regulated substance present at this Smithfield in a threshold quantity, for which is utilized as the primary cooling media in our closed-loop refrigeration system. The system?s purpose is to provide refrigeration and cold storage capabilities for the Smithfield operations.  Due to the size and characteristics of our ammonia refrigeration system, as well as Process Safety Management (PSM) applicability, Smithfield is covered under Program 3 of th"

The RMP Comp (Revision 1.07)) model is referenced in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance as an acceptable model for the mathematical approximation process.\n\nAs specified in the RMP Guidance, the worst case and alternate case release scenarios have been calculated and the results of the calculations are on file at the Smithfield (Utilities Supervisor office) facility.  Public and environmental receptors that could possibly be affected by the scenarios were determined through the use of LANDVIEW VI mapping system software, and US Census Bureau 2000 data. \n\n\n- The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nSmithfield has taken all necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set forth in 40 CFR Part 68.  Smithfield is also subject to the OSHA PSM Standard under 29 CFR 1910.119, as well as the EPCRA Section 302 and 311/312 notification/reporting requirements.\n\n\n- Emergency Action and Response Plan\n\nSmithfield?s current Emergency Action and Response Plan?s main focus is on evacuation of the facility in the event of an ammonia emergency.  The facility maintains a written Emergency Action and Response Plan to document specific procedures to be implemented in the event of various emergencies, including ammonia release. The Plan includes procedures for facility evacuation, as well as for notification to the local emergency response agencies, which are responsible for notifying the public.  The Plan also allows Smithfield?s personnel trained in emergency response operations to respond to an"

The plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within the facility that would require modified procedures.\n\nTo plan for an ammonia release with off-site effects, Smithfield Emergency Action and Response Plan includes procedures/equipment to mitigate the release, procedures to inform local response agencies, transportation maps for response agencies, evacuation route maps, and procedures for public communication.\n\nIn the event of an anhydrous ammonia release with off site effects, the general public will be notified by on site staff and off-site governmental officials.\n\n\n- Planned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\nSmithfield?s aim is to provide a professional service as efficiently as possible while minimizing the use of toxic materials wherever and whenever prudent.  In this effort our highest priority will be the proactive pursuit of cost-effective process changes that reduce or eliminate the use and/or generation of hazardous toxics at the endpoint of service.  Where hazardous toxics cannot be eliminated, improving controls to handle these substances will be explored and implemented wherever possible."
