      "SummaryText": "c receptor is affected.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario (ARS)\nMSFC has developed an ARS based on the requirements of 40 CFR 68.28 for liquid hydrogen that is a more realistic worst-case scenario, based on actual operating experience.  This scenario is more likely to occur and can reach an endpoint offsite.  The scenario involves the release of liquid hydrogen through the insulation surrounding the bellows connected to the liquid hydrogen tank.  It is assumed that 900 gallons of liquid hydrogen will leak out in 60 seconds.  The release rate is 241 kilograms per minute (531 pounds per minute).  Normally, the release is vented to a flare.  However, in this case, the leakage rate is assumed to exceed the vent system capability.  \n\nDistance to Endpoint\nThe distance to 1.0 psi overpressure is estimated using Look-up Table 18 of the EPA's RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance Document (1996).  The distance to 1.0 psi overpressure is estimated to be 0.20 mile, beyond which there will not be enough overpressure to pose a hazard to the public.\n\nPublic Receptors\nThe total working population at MSFC affected by this ARS is estimated to be 280 people, based on a work force of 6,400 MSFC and contractor personnel on duty every day.  No offsite residential population is affected.  \n\nEnvironmental Receptors\nThe alternative release also would affect the Wheeler National Wildlife Refuge, which is an environmental receptor.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-specific Prevention Steps\nMSFC is in compliance with the RMP Rule, 40 CFR 68.  The facility has conducted a comprehensive review of all systems, as well as of administrative, technical, and operating and maintenance procedures, in addition to the other required program elements of the RMP Rule.  \n\nSafety Information\nDetailed chemical safety and equipment safety information is compiled and readily available to operators and personnel involved in the operation and maintenance of the liquid hydrogen, liquid natura"

The propane system consists of pressure/vacuum relief valves, bypass relief valves, excess flow valves, and pressure and temperature indicators.  National Fire Protection Agency (NFPA) 58 standards are followed for the design and operation of propane systems.\n\nFlammable Substance Worst-case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nWorst-case Release Scenario (WRS)\nThe EPA-defined worst-case scenario (40 CFR 68.25 (2)) is the failure of the largest hydrogen container, resulting in a release of 132,750 pounds of hydrogen in 10 minutes.  The liquid hydrogen spheres are stored in an open diked area.  Therefore, passive mitigation is not considered.  \n\nDistance to Endpoint\nThe distance to 1.0 psi overpressure is estimated using the vapor cloud explosion equation in EPA's RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance Document (1996).  The distance to 1.0 psi overpressure is calculated to be 0.57 mile, beyond which there will not be enough overpressure to pose a hazard to the public and buildings.  \n\nPublic Receptors\nThe total working population at MSFC affected by this hypothetical worst-case release is estimated to be 2,240 people, based on a work force of 6,400 MSFC and contractor personnel on duty every day.  No offsite residential population is affected.  \n\nEnvironmental Receptors\nThe worst-case release would affect the Wheeler National Wildlife Refuge.  Realistically, MSFC does not anticipate that the worst-case scenario could actually happen.  In the event of a total rupture of the liquid hydrogen storage sphere, much of the liquid hydrogen will freeze and dissipate over a period of several hours.  The worst-case scenario assumes that the total quantity forms a vapor cloud and that the total quantity in the cloud at the flammability limit is unrealistic.  \n\nAdditional Worst-case Release Scenarios\nNo additional worst-case scenarios are developed because no offsite publi"

      "SummaryText": "Policy Statement\nIt is the George C. Marshall Space Flight Center's (MSFC) and National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) policy to conduct operations involving toxic and flammable substances safely, reducing to the greatest extent possible any hazards associated with the processes; and reducing any subsequent risk to the surrounding community, personnel, and the environment.  The policy includes working with the surrounding community and local emergency response agencies to promote a spirit of cooperation and teamwork, and to orchestrate an effective contingency plan in the unlikely event of a process incident occurring at MSFC.\n\nDescription of Facility and Regulated Substance Handled\nMSFC is one of the largest and most complex of NASA's nine centers.  MSFC is NASA's principal propulsion development center and plays a major role in the National Space Transportation System, managing the Space Shuttle's main engines, solid rocket boosters, and external tank.  In addition, MSFC will be a significant contributor to several of NASA's future programs, including the development of advanced propulsion systems and planetary observatories and research on a variety of space science applications.  \nLiquid hydrogen and liquid natural gas, both flammable, are stored at MSFC and used in rocket engine testing and research activities.  Liquid propane, a flammable substance, also is stored at MSFC and used for process heating and welding.  In addition, acetylene is stored at MSFC, but the storage quantity does not exceed the RMP threshold quantity (TQ).  None of the toxic substances stored at MSFC exceed the RMP TQs.  \n\nProgram 3 Substance\nLiquid hydrogen is subject to Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standards.  The maximum quantity of liquid hydrogen that can be stored at the facility is 431,644 pounds.  The liquid hydrogen storage details are as follows:\n7 Building 4517-One mothballed (inactive) storage tank with a c"

Detailed engineering drawings of all the systems are readily available.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nA process hazard analysis was performed for the liquid hydrogen process (Program 3 process) at this facility using a checklist and by following the Guidelines of Organizational Work Instruction (NASA Document number S&MA-CR20-IS-N-015).  A hazard analysis also was conducted for the liquid natural gas and propane systems (Program 2 processes) using a checklist extracted from the Guidelines for Hazard Evaluation Procedures (written by JBF Associates, Inc., for American Institute of Chemical Engineers [AIChE]/Center for Chemical Process Safety [CCPS]).  \n\nOperating Procedures\nWritten standard operating procedures (SOPs) that define how tasks related to the operation of the liquid hydrogen, liquid natural gas storage systems and the burnstack propane system are followed.  The SOPs are written based on NASA guidelines for pressure systems, and go through an approval process before implementation.  The SOPs cover all phases of operation, including initial startup, normal operations, normal shutdown, emergency shutdown, startup following an emergency shutdown, and temporary operations.\n\nTraining\nPersonnel whose job tasks are related to the operation and maintenance of the liquid hydrogen, liquid natural gas and the burnstack propane systems are given class room and on-the-job training.  The training program includes both initial and refresher training.  The training program is approved by NASA and is revised when process or equipment changes occur.  Written tests, oral tests, demonstration and observation are used to verify that the personnel understand the training material before they can resume work on the systems.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nNASA guidelines are followed for maintaining the mechanical integrity of process equipment to help prevent equipment failures that could endanger personnel, public and the environment.
