              "Description": "This prevention program applies to the storage and handling of liquid hydrogen in two storage spheres in Building 4672 of capacity 225,000 gallons each.\n\nThe prevention programs applicable for the liquid hydrogen storage tanks in Building 4657 (3 storage tanks with capacities of 35,000 gallons, 12,000 gallons, and 4,000 gallons) and in Building 4696 (28,000 gallons) are provided separately. \n \nGeorge C. Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) stores hydrogen in 2 spheres (Building 4672) each with a capacity of 225,000 gallons (132,750 pounds each); 3 storage tanks (Building 4657) with capacities of 35,000 gallons (20,650 pounds), 12,000 gallons (7,080 pounds), and 4,000 gallons (2,360 pounds); 1 storage tank (Building 4696) with a capacity of 28,000 gallons (16,520 pounds).  In addition, two storage tanks  with capacities 75,000 gallons (Building 4517) and 100,000 gallons (Building 4527) are mothballed (completely inactive).  The facility also has three portable liquid hydrogen trailers ( 1 trailer of capacity 12,000 gallons [7,080 pounds] and 2 trailers of capacity 7,800 gallons each [4,602 pounds each]) and several gaseous hydrogen trailers with capacities less than 700 cubic feet (59 pounds). \n\nThe portable trailers used for liquid and gaseous hydrogen are covered in the three prevention programs described, because they are an integral part of the liquid hydrogen storage and supply system.  The hazard analysis, safety, operation, training, maintenance, management of change, pre-startup review, compliance audits, employee participation, hot work permits, and other applicable RMP elements are conducted for the storage and supply system (including the trailers) as a whole.\n\nIf a mothballed system is to be activated all elements such as the hazard analysis, safety, operation, training, maintenance, management of change, pre-startup review, compliance audits, employee participation, hot work permits, and other applicable RMP elements will be reviewed for the storage and supply system per NASA guidelines.\n\nAn incident investigation was started on 3/14/97 following a liquid hydrogen release from a run tank in the Test Stand in Building 4522.  The run tank is used only during a test activity and the liquid hydrogen is supplied by trailers.  Following changes were identifed during the investigation and they were incorporated.  The seal ring was coated with teflon and different seal design was used.  In addtion, the vent system was enlarged to one-inch diameter.\n\nThe general standards that apply for the liquid hydrogen system are as follows:\nGeneral Requirements:  CFR 49.170 through 189.\nGuidelines: ACGIH, API, National Board Inspection Code, \"A Manual for Boiler and Pressure Vessel Inspectors,\" 1972, published by the National Board of Boiler and Pressure Vessel Inspectors.\nSources of Information:  U.S. Air Force (USAF) Technical Manual (T.O.) 00-25-233, Integrated Pressure Systems and Components (Portable and Installed); Fracture Control of Metallic Pressure Vessels, NASA SP-8040; Design Development Testing, NASA SP-8043; Qualification Testing, NASA SP-8044; Acceptance Testing, NASA SP-8045; Pressure Regulators, Valves, Burst Dikes, etc., NASA SP-8080; Discontinuity Stresses in Metallic Pressure Vessels, NASA SP-8083; Rocket Metal Tanks and Tank Components, NASA SP-8088.\n\nOther codes that were among those followed or that are pertinent in designing, building, and operating the liquid and gaseous hydrogen storage and transfer systems as indicated in the document \"Safety Standard for Hydrogen and Hydrogen Systems,\" NASA-STD1740.XX, April 20, 1995, are given below.\nTesting Standards and Safety Groups: NFPA, National Safety Council (NSC), Underwriter's Laboratories (UL).\nProfessional Societies: American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE); 7 Instrument Society of America; American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers; Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers; American Industrial Hygiene Association.\nTechnical and Trade Groups: Compressed Gas Association; American Gas Association; National Electrical Manufacturer's Association; Manufacturer's Standardization Society ; American Association of Railroads; Manufacturing Chemists Association; Manufacturer's Standardization Society of the Valve and Fittings Industry.\nInsuring Associations: American Insurance Association; Factory Mutual Organization ; Industrial Risk Insurers.\nOther Organization Standards: NASA; National Bureau of Standards; Bureau of Mines; Los Alamos National Laboratories; Chemical Propulsion Information Agency; Battelle Columbus Laboratories; Arthur D.

              "Description": "This prevention program applies to the storage and handling of liquid hydrogen in 3 storage tanks in Building 4657 with capacities of 35,000 gallons (20,650 pounds), 12,000 gallons (7,080 pounds), and 4,000 gallons (2,360 pounds).\nThe date of the most recent review or revision of operating procedures and the date of the most recent change that triggered management of change procedures for the 35,000 gallon tank is 7/3/95; for the 12,000 gallon tank is 3/23/95; for the 4,000 gallon tank is 8/12/94; and for the trailers is 7/3/95.\n\nThe prevention programs applicable for the liquid hydrogen storage tanks in Buildings 4672 (2 storage spheres of capacity 225,000 gallons each) and in Building 4696 (one storage tank opf capacity 28,000 gallons) are provided separately.\n\nGeorge C. Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) stores hydrogen in 2 storage spheres (Building 4672) each with a capacity of 225,000 gallons (132,750 pounds each); 3 storage tanks (Building 4657) with capacities of 35,000 gallons (20,650 pounds), 12,000 gallons (7,080 pounds), and 4,000 gallons (2,360 pounds); 1 storage tank (Building 4696) with a capacity of 28,000 gallons (16,520 pounds).  In addition, two storage tanks  with capacities 75,000 gallons (Building 4517) and 100,000 gallons (Building 4527) are mothballed (completely inactive).  The facility also has three portable liquid hydrogen trailers ( 1 trailer of capacity 12,000 gallons [7,080 pounds] and 2 trailers of capacity 7,800 gallons each [4,602 pounds each]) and several gaseous hydrogen trailers with capacities less than 700 cubic feet (59 pounds). \n\nThe portable trailers used for liquid and gaseous hydrogen are covered in the three prevention programs described, because they are an integral part of the liquid hydrogen storage and supply system.  The hazard analysis, safety, operation, training, maintenance, management of change, pre-startup review, compliance audits, employee participation, hot work permits, and other applicable RMP elements are conducted for the storage and supply system (including the trailers) as a whole.\n\nIf a mothballed system is to be activated all elements such as the hazard analysis, safety, operation, training, maintenance, management of change, pre-startup review, compliance audits, employee participation, hot work permits, and other applicable RMP elements will be reviewed for the storage and supply system per NASA guidelines.\n\nAn incident investigation was started on 3/14/97 following a liquid hydrogen release from a run tank in the Test Stand in Building 4522.  The run tank is used only during a test activity and the liquid hydrogen is supplied by trailers.  Following changes were identifed during the investigation and they were incorporated.  The seal ring was coated with teflon and different seal design was used.  In addtion, the vent system was enlarged to one-inch diameter.\n\nThe general standards that apply for the liquid hydrogen system are as follows:\nGeneral Requirements:  CFR 49.170 through 189.\nGuidelines: ACGIH, API, National Board Inspection Code, \"A Manual for Boiler and Pressure Vessel Inspectors,\" 1972, published by the National Board of Boiler and Pressure Vessel Inspectors.\nSources of Information:  U.S. Air Force (USAF) Technical Manual (T.O.) 00-25-233, Integrated Pressure Systems and Components (Portable and Installed); Fracture Control of Metallic Pressure Vessels, NASA SP-8040; Design Development Testing, NASA SP-8043; Qualification Testing, NASA SP-8044; Acceptance Testing, NASA SP-8045; Pressure Regulators, Valves, Burst Dikes, etc., NASA SP-8080; Discontinuity Stresses in Metallic Pressure Vessels, NASA SP-8083; Rocket Metal Tanks and Tank Components, NASA SP-8088.\n\nOther codes that were among those followed or that are pertinent in designing, building, and operating the liquid and gaseous hydrogen storage and transfer systems as indicated in the document \"Safety Standard for Hydrogen and Hydrogen Systems,\" NASA-STD1740.XX, April 20, 1995, are given below.\nTesting Standards and Safety Groups: NFPA, National Safety Council (NSC), Underwriter's Laboratories (UL).\nProfessional Societies: American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE); 7 Instrument Society of America; American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers; Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers; American Industrial Hygiene Association.\nTechnical and Trade Groups: Compressed Gas Association; American Gas Association; National Electrical Manufacturer's Association; Manufacturer's Standardization Society ; American Association of Railroads; Manufacturing Chemists Association; Manufacturer's Standardization Society of the Valve and Fittings Industry.\nInsuring Associations: American Insurance Association; Factory Mutual Organization ; Industrial Risk Insurers.\nOther Organization Standards: NASA; National Bureau of Standards; Bureau of Mines; Los Alamos National Laboratories; Chemical Propulsion Information Agency; Battelle Columbus Laboratories; Arthur D.

      "SummaryText": "Policy Statement\nIt is the George C. Marshall Space Flight Center's (MSFC) and National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) policy to conduct operations involving toxic and flammable substances safely, reducing to the greatest extent possible any hazards associated with the processes; and reducing any subsequent risk to the surrounding community, personnel, and the environment.  The policy includes working with the surrounding community and local emergency response agencies to promote a spirit of cooperation and teamwork, and to orchestrate an effective contingency plan in the unlikely event of a process incident occurring at MSFC.\n\nDescription of Facility and Regulated Substance Handled\nMSFC is one of the largest and most complex of NASA's nine centers.  MSFC is NASA's principal propulsion development center and plays a major role in the National Space Transportation System, managing the Space Shuttle's main engines, solid rocket boosters, and external tank.  In addition, MSFC will be a significant contributor to several of NASA's future programs, including the development of advanced propulsion systems and planetary observatories and research on a variety of space science applications.  \nLiquid hydrogen and liquid natural gas, both flammable, are stored at MSFC and used in rocket engine testing and research activities.  Liquid propane, a flammable substance, also is stored at MSFC and used for process heating and welding.  In addition, acetylene is stored at MSFC, but the storage quantity does not exceed the RMP threshold quantity (TQ).  None of the toxic substances stored at MSFC exceed the RMP TQs.  \n\nProgram 3 Substance\nLiquid hydrogen is subject to Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standards.  The maximum quantity of liquid hydrogen that can be stored at the facility is 431,644 pounds.

The propane system consists of pressure/vacuum relief valves, bypass relief valves, excess flow valves, and pressure and temperature indicators.  National Fire Protection Agency (NFPA) 58 standards are followed for the design and operation of propane systems.\n\nFlammable Substance Worst-case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nWorst-case Release Scenario (WRS)\nThe EPA-defined worst-case scenario (40 CFR 68.25 (2)) is the failure of the largest hydrogen container, resulting in a release of 132,750 pounds of hydrogen in 10 minutes.  The liquid hydrogen spheres are stored in an open diked area.  Therefore, passive mitigation is not considered.  \n\nDistance to Endpoint\nThe distance to 1.0 psi overpressure is estimated using the vapor cloud explosion equation in EPA's RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance Document (1996).  The distance to 1.0 psi overpressure is calculated to be 0.57 mile, beyond which there will not be enough overpressure to pose a hazard to the public and buildings.  \n\nPublic Receptors\nThe total working population at MSFC affected by this hypothetical worst-case release is estimated to be 2,240 people, based on a work force of 6,400 MSFC and contractor personnel on duty every day.  No offsite residential population is affected.  \n\nEnvironmental Receptors\nThe worst-case release would affect the Wheeler National Wildlife Refuge.  Realistically, MSFC does not anticipate that the worst-case scenario could actually happen.  In the event of a total rupture of the liquid hydrogen storage sphere, much of the liquid hydrogen will freeze and dissipate over a period of several hours.  The worst-case scenario assumes that the total quantity forms a vapor cloud and that the total quantity in the cloud at the flammability limit is unrealistic.  \n\nAdditional Worst-case Release Scenarios\nNo additional worst-case scenarios are developed because no offsite publi"

This scenario is more likely to occur and can reach an endpoint offsite.  The scenario involves the release of liquid hydrogen through the insulation surrounding the bellows connected to the liquid hydrogen tank.  It is assumed that 900 gallons of liquid hydrogen will leak out in 60 seconds.  The release rate is 241 kilograms per minute (531 pounds per minute).  Normally, the release is vented to a flare.  However, in this case, the leakage rate is assumed to exceed the vent system capability.  \n\nDistance to Endpoint\nThe distance to 1.0 psi overpressure is estimated using Look-up Table 18 of the EPA's RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance Document (1996).  The distance to 1.0 psi overpressure is estimated to be 0.20 mile, beyond which there will not be enough overpressure to pose a hazard to the public.\n\nPublic Receptors\nThe total working population at MSFC affected by this ARS is estimated to be 280 people, based on a work force of 6,400 MSFC and contractor personnel on duty every day.  No offsite residential population is affected.  \n\nEnvironmental Receptors\nThe alternative release also would affect the Wheeler National Wildlife Refuge, which is an environmental receptor.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-specific Prevention Steps\nMSFC is in compliance with the RMP Rule, 40 CFR 68.  The facility has conducted a comprehensive review of all systems, as well as of administrative, technical, and operating and maintenance procedures, in addition to the other required program elements of the RMP Rule.  \n\nSafety Information\nDetailed chemical safety and equipment safety information is compiled and readily available to operators and personnel involved in the operation and maintenance of the liquid hydrogen, liquid natura"

A hazard analysis also was conducted for the liquid natural gas and propane systems (Program 2 processes) using a checklist extracted from the Guidelines for Hazard Evaluation Procedures (written by JBF Associates, Inc., for American Institute of Chemical Engineers [AIChE]/Center for Chemical Process Safety [CCPS]).  \n\nOperating Procedures\nWritten standard operating procedures (SOPs) that define how tasks related to the operation of the liquid hydrogen, liquid natural gas storage systems and the burnstack propane system are followed.  The SOPs are written based on NASA guidelines for pressure systems, and go through an approval process before implementation.  The SOPs cover all phases of operation, including initial startup, normal operations, normal shutdown, emergency shutdown, startup following an emergency shutdown, and temporary operations.\n\nTraining\nPersonnel whose job tasks are related to the operation and maintenance of the liquid hydrogen, liquid natural gas and the burnstack propane systems are given class room and on-the-job training.  The training program includes both initial and refresher training.  The training program is approved by NASA and is revised when process or equipment changes occur.  Written tests, oral tests, demonstration and observation are used to verify that the personnel understand the training material before they can resume work on the systems.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nNASA guidelines are followed for maintaining the mechanical integrity of process equipment to help prevent equipment failures that could endanger personnel, public and the environment.

      "SummaryText": "gram includes an inspection, testing and recertification of the storage systems and equipment to help identify equipment deterioration, malfunction and damage.   The mechanical integrity program also includes a quality assurance program to ensure that the liquid hydrogen and liquid natural gas meet the NASA quality specifications, and new and replacement equipment meet the design standards.\n\nManagement of Change\nAll proposed changes to the equipment and SOPs are evaluated and approved following NASA guidelines to ensure that the change does not adversely affect the safety of operations.\n\nPre-startup Review\nA safety review of a new or modified process is performed following NASA guidelines before the system is brought into service.  This review confirms that the design and construction of the equipment is in accordance with the design specifications; safety, operating, maintenance and emergency procedures are in place; employee training has been completed; and a process hazard analysis has been completed. \n\nCompliance Audit\nCompliance audit of all liquid hydrogen, liquid natural gas and the burnstack propane systems are conducted per schedule to ensure that the prevention program effectively addresses the safety of the storage systems.  The audit is conducted by people knowledgeable in the process and reviewed by NASA personnel.  The results of the audit are documented, recommendations are resolved following a schedule developed, and appropriate enhancements to the prevention program are implemented.\n\nIncident Investigation\nMSFC investigates all incidents that could have resulted in a serious injury to personnel, the public or the environment so that similar accidents can be prevented.  An investigation team initiates the investigation within 48 hours of the incident.  The incidents are documented in the Incident Reporting and Information System (IRIS) and the incident investigation results are documented in the Lessons Learned System (LLIS).\n\nEmployee Participation\n"

      "SummaryText": "MSFC has guidelines to ensure employee participation in pressure system operations.  All employee concerns are addressed promptly.  The pressure systems contractor responsible for the liquid hydrogen and liquid natural gas storage and supply systems, and burnstack propane system implements employee participation procedures to ensure the safety concerns of personnel.  MSFC and the contractor encourage active participation of personnel in the prevention program activities of the liquid hydrogen, liquid natural gas, and the burnstack propane systems.\n\nHot Work Permits\nFollowing the MSFC guidelines, the pressure systems contractor follows an established hot work permit, and lockout-tagout procedure to control spark- or flame- producing activities that could result in fires or explosion in any of the pressure systems.  Non-sparking tools are used at the facility during maintenance activities.  Hot work permit and lockout-tagout forms must be filled out and approved by the supervisor before any maintenance activity is commenced.\n\nContractors\nMSFC has a program with procedures to ensure that contractor activities are performed in a safe manner.  The safety record of contractors is reviewed annually.\n\nChemical-specific Prevention Steps\nIn addition to the Program Level 3 elements required for liquid hydrogen and Program Level 2 elements required for liquid natural gas and propane, MSFC has implemented safety features specific to the flammable substance handled according to NASA guidelines.  The burnstack serves to burn off liquid hydrogen, when necessary, in a safe way.  Leak detectors and flame detectors are provided to ensure safety of the process and personnel.\n\nFive-year Accident History\nSince June 1994, MSFC has not had a release of liquid hydrogen, liquid natural gas, or propane that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage onsite, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\nEmergen"

      "SummaryText": "cy Response Program\nMSFC has an Emergency Response Program (MM 1040.3F, MSFC Emergency Plan) that coordinates response efforts with the Redstone Arsenal Fire Department (RSA FD), the Protective Services Office, the medical center, and the Eggerton, Germishausen and Greer (EG&G) Incident/Spill Response Team.  Response activities also have been discussed with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and with state and local governments.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nMSFC has already installed the necessary equipment and the operating and training procedures required for the safe operation of the liquid hydrogen (Program Level 3 process) and of the liquid natural gas and propane (Program Level 2 processes) systems.  The process hazard analysis and the certification surveillance found minor discrepancies of pressure system components such as corrosion, calibration, labeling, and undersizing.  The expected date of correction of discrepancies is December 1999."
