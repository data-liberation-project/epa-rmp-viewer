All facilities with ammonia refrigeration systems covered by this rule maintain 3-shift coverage of emergency responders trained at the 24-hour technician level.\n\nThis facility manufactures frozen convenience foods.  The refrigeration system uses anhydrous ammonia, with a system inventory of 76,150 pounds.  A Management of Change is implemented if new refriegeration equipment is added and the ammonia inventory significantly increases.  \n\nWorst and alternate release scenarios are calculated using RMP*comp and urban conditions.\n\nThe refrigeration system is covered by OSHA PSM rule, 29 CFR 1910.119.\n\nThe last Management of Change was triggered on August 26, 2008, when a windstorm blew over piping supports on the building's roof.  There was no damage identified on the actual pipes and no ammonia release occurred.  The Management of Change addressed the mechanical integrity of the piping supports and additional piping support was constructed."
