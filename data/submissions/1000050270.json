This philosophy is more than just a slogan; it is built into every aspect of Cyanco's operations.  As the first liquid sodium cyanide facility in the U.S., Cyanco has strived to set the standard for safe operation and delivery of product to its customers.  OSHA's Process Safety Management and NDEP CAPP programs have been implemented by Cyanco and adds another level of protection for the operation.  In addition Cyanco is a signatory to, and certified under the guidelines of the International Cyanide Management Code (ICMC), a voluntary set of safe standards and practices for cyanide production, transportation, and use.  Cyanco's goal is to provide a quality product to its customers in a safe and efficient manner.\n\nThe production facility, located in Winnemucca, Nevada produces sodium cyanide, which is used by the gold mining industry.  Cyanco is required to submit a report on its Risk Management Program due of the use of anhydrous ammonia at the facility.\n\nThe Risk Management Program is just another building block in Cyanco's safe operations.  As a participant in OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) program, Cyanco already has a solid foundation for safe operations.  The PSM program requires the formal evaluation of specific design and operational hazards before the startup of any new process.  Cyanco has performed extensive Process Hazard Analysis on each area of the facility.  These exercises allowed the scrutiny of every operation performed at the plant.  Areas where hazards were identified have been promptly addressed.  The PSM program requires written operating procedures on each critical or hazardous task.  Operation and maintenance personnel are properly trained on their jobs and the hazards involved with the process.  Cyanco has a program to insure that each piece of equipment is designed and functioning according to its design.  The Mechanical Integrity program inclu"

The distributed control system maintains the operation within safe parameters automatically.  In the event that the process deviates from design conditions, the entire operation is designed to shut down within seconds without endangering personnel or releasing hazardous chemicals to the environment.  Process instrumentation and control equipment has been designed to protect both personnel and the public in the event of a process upset.  Cyanco has also made use of Intranet technology to improve the availability and accuracy of plant policies and procedures.  Computers at the facility have access to the most current documents at the plant through this electronic document control system.  Every effort has been made to insure the continued safe operation of every aspect of Cyanco's facility.\n\nCyanco has an excellent safety record.  No releases of anhydrous ammonia resulting in serious onsite or offsite consequences have occurred in the 25 year history of the plant.  This safe record is a credit to the design of the facility and the training and dedication of plant personnel.\n\nPersonnel have been trained to recognize and respond to any potential accident at the facility.  Cyanco's Emergency Response program uses simple step-by-step forms to guide personnel through the appropriate response to such incidents such as a chemical release, natural disaster, fire or explosion. Cyanco has a well trained Emergency Response Team with each member trained in Confined Space Rescue, medical first responder, and HAZWOPER technician responder level. In the event of an emergency, personnel are trained to alert the entire staff to the problem using the plant alarm and paging system.  All onsite personnel, including contractors, will be accounted for and given directions for evacua"

Employees have been trained on the proper evaluation of each emergency situation and are able to mount an appropriate response.  \n\nOperations personnel have been empowered to shut down process operations if deemed necessary to the situation.  Safety equipment at the plant allows for a safe response to each emergency.  This safety equipment includes: response trailer containing first aid kits, chemical detection devices, chemical respirators, chemical resistant clothing, supplied air and self contained breathing apparatus.  Continuous training and drills insure that each employee can comfortably make decisions and help to reduce the hazards posed by operation of a chemical manufacturing facility.\n\nCyanco is continually evaluating policies and training materials to insure that the best possible programs are in place.  New technology and techniques are examined and implemented if found to be valuable.  \n\n        \n\n"
