As part of this commitment, the Milton Plant has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility.  One part of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the Milton Plant and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule). One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMP) describing the risk management program at the Milton Plant.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMP requirements of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at Air Products Performance Manufacturing's Milton Plant.\n\n\n\nThe purpose of the Risk Management Program is two-fold. First of all, it evaluates the consequences of incidents that could occur or the quantity of a release required to have an off-site impact.  Secondly, it has a systematic prevention program which is designed to prevent these potential incidents from occurring. \n\n\n\n1    Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nAir Products Performance Manufacturing - Milton Plant adheres to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.  Air Products Performance Manufacturing manages the safety of the regulated processes by means of operating procedures, equipment testing and inspections, safety devices (eg., alarms, shutdowns, instrumentation, relief devices) inherent in the design of this facility and other controls and systems designed to prevent accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  Safe work practices and training of our "

The emergency response plan includes procedures for the notification of the local fire authority and hazardous materials unit so that appropriate measures can be takens by local emergency responders to control accidental releases. The plan also has a system to notify our workers and/or the community.\n\n\n\nThis document has been prepared in accordance with the EPA Risk Management Plan regulation (40CFR, Part 68).  THe substances and processes considered during the preparation of this RMP and the scenarious described were selected based on criteria established in the regulation.\n\n\n\n2 The Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nAir Products Performance Manufacturing - Milton Plant manufactures specialty chemicals and handles seven substances regulated by the RMP rule in sufficient quantities to be covered by the RMP rule.  THese specialty chemicals are used by our customers in a variety of applications.  Raw materialls are received at our plant by railcar, truck and drums and used as feedstock.  THe products are stored in tanks on site and drums and shipped to customers via rail car, bulk tank truck, tote bins or drums.\n\n    \n\nAcrylonitrile is used to prepare intermediate products that are then converted to finished amine products.  It is one of the basic building blocks which is incorporated into nearly all of our finished products.\n\nEthylene Oxide (EO) and Propylene Oxide (PO) are used to produce specialty products called alkoxylated amines or tertiary amines.  These alkoxylated amines are used in industrial, institutional and agricultural products.\n\nMethyl chloride is used to prepare other specialty surfactants.  Methyl chloride quaternizes the alkoxylated products (it makes the products carry a positive charge).  These materials are used as emulsifiers and cleaning agents.\n\nAmmonia is used in the production of amines to minimize"

It is subsequently recovered in the ammonia recovery system, which forms ammonia water and ammonium phosphate. \n\nAmmonia water is formed when we recover the ammonia used in the process.\n\nHydrogen is used to hydrogenate nitriles to amines that are used in iron mining, fuel additives and further reacted to other surfactants.\n\n\n\n3. The general accidental release prevention program and specific prevention steps:\n\nThe facility developed prevention program elements based on the Federal EPA Accidental Release Prevention Plan, and OSHA PRocess Safety Management (PSM) Regulation.  The facility was designed and constructed to comply with applicable state and industry codes.\n\n\n\n4.  Five Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidents involving releases of toxics or flammable gas that resulted in any deaths, injuries or significant property damage on site, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\n\n\n5.  Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\nAir Products Performance Manufacturing - Milton Plant has established a written emergency response plan based upon the OSHA HAZWOPER Standard.All employees are trained to recognize emergencies and initiate emergency response from outside agencies.  All employees are trained to the First Responder Awareeness Level and receive annual refresher training in their role in the emergency plan.  Additionally the site has designated emergency coordinators that will execure the site emergency plan while providing general plant operations information to community responders.  This plan has been communicated to local emergency response officials through the Local Emergency Preparedness Committee (LEPC) and the Milton Fire Department.  Regular dialogue is maintained between the Milton Plant and the LEPC.  \n\nThe Air Products Performance Manufacturing - Milton Plant has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organi"

Also, the emergency warning sirens provide a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.  In addition to periodic LEPC meetings, the Air Products Performance Manufacturing - Milton Plant conducts periodic emergency drills that involve the LEPC and emergency response organizations. \n\n\n\n6.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nThe Air Products Performance Manufacturing - Products Milton Plant constantly strives to improve the safety of the Milton Plant processes through periodic safety reviews, the incident investigation program, and a program soliciting safety suggestions from the workers.  The Air Products Performance Manufacturing - Milton Plant resolves all findings from Process Hazard Analyses (PHAs), some of which result in modifications to the process.  In the spirit of continuous improvement, the following types of changes are planned during the next 5 years:\n\n\n\n    Revised process instrumentation and/or controls in the process area\n\n    Revisions to personnel training programs\n\n    Revised written operating procedures \n\nAdditional monitoring devices for early detection of releases"
