The facility operates two production shifts and a maintenance/cleaning crew on third shift.  The facility just completed a recent Combo Cooler and Export Cooler expansion that increase the plant square footage to 775,000 sqft on a 59 acre plot. The Plant is refrigerated with 220,000 pound anhydrous ammonia system.  This is operated 24/7 by experienced, licensed refrigeration management and operators. \r\n\r\nOver one half of the plant is protected by an automatic sprinkler system where flammables and combusible materials are either used or stored.  The balance of the facility is of concrete and metal construction. Triumph Foods' fire protection system includes pull stations, smoke & heat detection, and sprinkler flow alarms. All are monitored by a remote off site alarm company 24/7 as well as the on site security personnel. The Alarm System is tested annually and Fire Suppression System is tested semi-annually by outside companies.   \r\n\r\nEmergency declaration is done via radio and/or telephone to designated Emergency Coordinators, who will then direct activation of the plant alarm system which utilizes a combinations strobes/ chimes/air horns to alert employees of the type of hazards. \r\n\r\nThe plant has a Plant Emergency Response Team of made up of refrigeration and maintenance personnel as well as a designated HAZMAT Building for response to any chemical spills or releases beyond the normal scope of work.   Plant Emergency Response Team members are trained to a 24Hr HAZWOPER Technician level and some management members are trained to Incident Commander. The plant has a certified trainer for HAZMAT Technician.    \r\n\r\nTriumph Foods does not have a Fire Brigade on site, but the Saint Joseph Fire Department's Station #2 is within one-half mile from the plant, and Station #1"

Storm water runoff is managed by the use of detention ponds on the site. There is a valve located at the outfall to isolate storm water discharge. \r\n\r\nAll employees are trained per OSHA, EPA regulations and other mandated industrial standards, including Hazards Communications which instructs employees on the particular hazards and proper handling of the cleaning and sanitizing chemicals used in the plant.  Particular emphasis is placed on the reporting of spills and releases or any other unusual events.\r\n\r\nTriumph Foods has written emergency action and response plans which identify potential emergencies and the steps to be taken to safetly remove all employees from harms way in the event incidents should arise.  A Health Services Department is staffed by nurses on both production shifts. On non-production shifts/days, maintenance supervisors/superintendents have been trained in Basic First Aid/CPR/AED.\r\n\r\nThe plants Emergency Action and Response Plans are shared with the Saint Joseph Fire Department, Northwest Missouri Region H Hazardous Materials Response Team, and the St. Joseph/ Buchanan Co. Local Emergency Planning Committee.  Triumph Foods will host any emergency response agency wishing to tour the facility.\r\n\r\nThe Director of Safety and Environmental Affairs attends LEPC meetings and at least annually meets with the LEPC Chairman/Region H Coordinator.\r\n\r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\r\n\r\nTriumph Foods had a release of 18,400lbs due to piping failure from a hydraulic event on September 11, 2021. In the response actions to isolate the control valve group, the ammonia liquid (LTRL) dip switch was place in \"hand\" instead of \"off\" allowing the liquid solenoid to remain open. The response team had to isolate further back to the LTRL header. Notifications were made to National Response Center,"

The Director of Refrigeration is working with an outside LMS group to enhance the Refrigeration/Maintenance technicians continual training."
