This regulation is published in 40 CFR Part 68. We have assessed and continue to assess how accidental releases may occur, and how the public and environment might be impacted. After reading this program, you may consider making recommendations for improvements to the Health, Safety, and Environmental Manager.\nIndChem, Inc. is a distributor of industrial chemicals. We store two substances that are regulated by the above Act at or above the threshold quantities; chlorine and hydrofluoric acid. Chlorine is a pungent greenish yellow gas or amber color in liquid form. The material is irritating to the skin and eyes, and is a toxic inhalation hazard. Chlorine is heavier than air and tends to settle in low areas. Chlorine is not flammable, but may support combustion. Hydrofluoric acid is a colorless corrosive liquid. It is a skin, eye, and inhalation hazard. The material is not flammable.\nWORST-CASE CHLORINE SCENARIO, ERPG 2_ Based on modeling, a complete failure and release of our largest container (150 pounds) may impact the surrounding area within 0.4 miles. There are no residential populations and no sensitive environmental receptors within the toxic end-point of the release. \nALTERNATIVE RELEASE CHLORINE SCENARIO, ERPG 2_ Based on modeling, the most probable release of 10 pounds of chlorine may impact the surrounding area within 0.1 miles.\nWORST-CASE HYDROFLUORIC ACID SCENARIO, ERPG 2_ Based on modeling, the failure of our largest container (500 pounds) may impact the surrounding area within 0.3 miles. There are no residential populations and no sensitive environmental receptors within the toxic end-point of the release.\nALTERNATIVE RELEASE HYDROFLUORIC ACID SCENARIO, ERPG 2_ Based on modeling,  the"

The plant alarm is sounded; 2. Facility Emergency Coordinator is called to assess the release; 3. Savannah Fire Dept. Hazmat Team is called if needed and facility is evacuated; 4. Chatham Emergency Management Agency is notified; 5. Spill is controlled by the Savannah Fire Department, or plant personnel. We have had no reportable accidents in the last five years."
