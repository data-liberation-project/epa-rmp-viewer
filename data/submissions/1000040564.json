The gas plant, located in the Whitney Canyon / Carter Creek gas field (approx. 35 miles North and East of Evanston Wyoming), was designed to process 60 mmscfd of natural occurring hydrocarbon gas and natural gas liquids.\n\n \n\nHilcorp has approximately 28 employees, and contractors working for the Asset consisting of Operations, Maintenance and support staff. \n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n\n\nIt is the policy of Hilcorp Energy to conduct its business in a socially responsible and ethical manner that protects safety, health and the environment. The CCGP Emergency Preparedness and Response Policy involves assessing the hazards and risks of an unplanned incident; developing a plan for managing those hazards and risks; communicating relevant information to employees, contractors and appropriate agencies; and conducting emergency exercises.\n\n\n\nPRIMARY ACTIVITIES\n\n\n\nProcess 1- Well Stream separation and stabilization\n\n\n\nThe well stream separation area is designed to handle Inlet field gas. The well stream enters the plant as a three-phase stream: gas, hydrocarbon condensate, and free water. The gas and liquid is separated in the V-1101 (Slug Catcher). The gas is then filtered and treated. The hydrocarbon condensate is depressured, stripped of H2S, and stabilized. The free water is degassed of H2S and sent to sour liquids blowdown.\n\n\n\nProcess 2- NGL and moisture extraction\n\n\n\nThe treated high pressure gas that meets pipeline H2S specification is sent to Process 2 for NGL extraction and dew point control before being routed into the N.G.L. sales pipeline.\n\n\n\nTreated high pressure gas is chilled to a controlled operating temperature which is controlled to ensure that the sales gas hydrocarbon dew point requirement specifications are met, and also to maximize liquids production to be sold as stabilized N.G.L. product. \n\n\n\nHydrocarbons condensed and"

Sales pipeline. \n\n\n\nProcess 3- H2S removal and Sulfur recovery\n\n\n\nThe H2S Removal system is designed to remove H2S from the naturally occurring hydrocarbon gases from the Plant inlet. The gas streams are treated with DEA (Dietheanol amine) solution. H2S is absorbed into the DEA.\n\n\n\nThe DEA is regenerated to produce a gas stream containing H2S and water vapor (steam), which is further processed for conversion to elemental sulfur. The regenerated DEA is recirculated to the DEA system.\n\n\n\nThe H2S liberated from the DEA is reacted and converted to elemental sulfur utilizing the Claus Sulfur Recovery process (SRU) and the Flexsorb Tail Gas Unit.\n\n\n\nThe tail gas from the Plant is then heated and lofted to the atmosphere at or below Wyoming State DEQ permitted levels for emission components.\n\n\n\n\n\nREGULATED SUBSTANCES ABOVE THRESHOLD QUANTITIES AT CCGP\n\n\n\nThere are three RMP defined processes with threshold quantities of regulated substances at CCGP including:\n\n\n\nProcess 1:\n\n\n\nInlet flows and quantities of flammable, naturally occurring hydrocarbon mixtures of methane, ethane, propane, butane and pentane.\n\n\n\nProcess 2:\n\n\n\nFlammable hydrocarbon mixtures of methane, ethane, propane, butane, pentane associated with NGL removal from the sales gas stream \n\n\n\nProcess 3:\n\n\n\nHydrogen Sulfide (H2S) associated with the naturally occurring hydrocarbon mixture of natural gas entering the Gas Plant and the associated SRU systems used to remove the H2S from the gas and convert the H2S to elemental Sulfur. \n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nHilcorp encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.
