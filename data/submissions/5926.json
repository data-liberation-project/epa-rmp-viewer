      "SummaryText": "The Hammond Water Filtration Plant is located in Hammond, Indiana.  The covered process on-site is the chlorination of municipal drinking water.  This is performed with chlorine gas, as a liquid under pressure, fed off of a one ton chlorine tank.  All scenarios were completed using RMP Comp.  In its worst case scenario nine thousand people were effected.  In the alternate case scenario four thousand people were effected.  The chlorine process is located indoors in it's own room with a fan leading outdoors which turns on in case of an accidental release.  There is a chlorine lead detector located along the process which alerts the operator, an operator is on duty at all times, to shut down the system to minimize releases.  There is a large residential area nearby, two schools, a marina, a public beach and a gambling boat.\n\nHammond Water Filtration Plant is covered by OSHA PSM.  This program was designed and implemented at the time of writing the RMP.  The facility has all applicable OSHA documents on site; such as confined space entry, PPE, Lockout/tagout, and fire prevention procedures, in writing.  The chlorine process is inspected daily and is only dealt with by trained employees.  There is personal protective equipment on site for which the employees are trained to use.  All employees are also trained in evacuation procedures that begin with the sound of the chlorine alarm.  The Hammond Fire Department handles all accidental releases.  They are the responders and handle all evacuations of the surrounding neighborhoods.  The facility has an emergency action plan on file at the fire department."
