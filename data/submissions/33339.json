The Clifton Water District (CWD) utilizes liquefied chlorine in the treatment of water for use by the public.  Chlorine is on the list of hazardous chemicals covered by the threshold limits within the CAA.  The requirements presented in the CAA regarding processes that utilize hazardous chemicals identify specific safety precautions regarding handling and storage of the listed hazardous chemicals.  The Clifton Water District has specific release prevention and emergency response procedures in place to help prevent chemical exposure to water treatment personnel as well as the general public, given the life, health and safety hazards associated with liquefied chlorine.  It is the policy of the CWD to strictly adhere to all applicable Federal and State rules, regulations, and safety precautions.\n\nIt is the opinion of the Clifton Water District\u00bfs Board of Directors and Management that the emergency action response plan utilized by the CWD is in compliance with OSHA\u00bfs Employee Emergency and Fire Prevention Plan, 29 CFR Part 1910.38.  The emergency action plan includes procedures for notifying the Clifton Fire District and the Grand Junction Fire Department\u00bfs Hazardous Materials Team (HAZMAT) to respond to hazardous chemical releases at the water treatment plant, and to notify all potentially affected neighbors.\n\nFacility Description and Activities\n\nThe Clifton Water District provides domestic potable water to approximately 35,000 customers located in the unincorporated portion of Mesa County, generally referred to as `Clifton\u00bf (roughly the area encompassed from I-70 to the Colorado River and 30 Road t"

The water treatment plant, along with the main business office is located at 510 34 Road, Clifton, CO.  The CWD processes water from the Colorado River through conventional water treatment practices as well as additional finish water treatment through a process utilizing membrane technology.\n\nLiquefied chlorine is delivered in one-ton bulk containers by certified chemical transportation companies to the water treatment plant where it is off-loaded into the enclosed chlorine storage/feed room where the containers are connected to an automatic vacuum manifold system.  The chlorine is fed to the treated water as a part of the final disinfection process prior to delivery to the end user.  The feed system utilizes two one-ton containers that are automatically switched from empty to full via the vacuum manifold system.  The system is on a routine monitoring regimen by treatment plant personnel as well as continuous monitoring by leak sensors that are connected to both visual and audio alarm mechanisms both inside and outside the plant.  During off-normal hours, the alarm system is connected to a remote dialer that notifies on-call personnel if a leak occurs so that appropriate response can be initiated.\n\nAccess to the water treatment plant facility is controlled via locked automatic gates and security fencing surrounding the facility.  The chlorine room is locked at all times to prevent unauthorized access.  All treatment plant personnel are thoroughly trained regarding the hazards and risks associated with liquefied chlorine for both themselves and the general public.  Specific regulatory operational and maintenance procedures are in place and strictly followed by all plant personnel.  Procedural and personnel audits are performed on an annual basis to identify hazards or risks that may have been overlooked or not previously identified.\n\nWorst Case Release Scenario\n\nNot required for this"

The original water treatment plant, and chlorine handling area, was constructed in 1979 to all applicable codes and building requirements in force at that time.  The plant underwent expansion in 1981 and again in 1997.  Each time the plant was expanded, all applicable codes and requirements were followed and recommended chlorine handling modifications were implemented.  In 1999, the District identified the need for a revamped chlorine handling and feed facility.  This new facility is currently under construction and is scheduled to be placed in service by October 2004.  The current system equipment and components related to receiving, feed process and final discharge of chlorine are inspected daily by trained plant personnel and maintained and serviced according to equipment manufacturer\u00bfs recommendations.  The water treatment personnel have been trained to follow specific operational and maintenance procedures while utilizing the chlorine process.\n\nSince January 1999, the treatment plant personnel have performed their own testing and maintenance of chlorine feed components.  The District\u00bfs treatment plant staff has purchased the necessary equipment to build and maintain their own chlorine testing apparatus.  The testing apparatus is fully functional and is used to test individual components of the chlorine feed and monitoring process.\n\nPlant personnel perform daily checks and inspections of the chlorine handling/storage/feed system and a scheduled maintenance system is in place.

During off-normal hours, the detector sensors also alarm an automatic phone dialer that notifies key on-call personnel that a release has occurred.  Specific activity procedures are in place for off-normal hour emergency notifications.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nThe Clifton Water District has not ever had any accidental releases since the plant was constructed in 1979.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nIt is the opinion of the Clifton Water District\u00bfs Board of Directors and Management that the Clifton Water District\u00bfs emergency response plan is currently in compliance with the EPA\u00bfs Accidental Release Prevention rule and all applicable State of Colorado Codes and regulations.  The response plan is supported by the Mesa County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), the Clifton Fire District, and the Grand Junction Fire Department\u00bfs HAZMAT Team.  The Clifton Fire District and the Grand Junction Fire Department\u00bfs HAZMAT Team have toured the water treatment plant and are prepared for and are ready to respond to releases at this facility.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe Clifton Water District continually reviews processes and practices regarding the operation of the water treatment plant and its specific components (eg. the chlorine handling/storage/feed system component).  If hazards and risks are identified, that were previously overlooked or not identified, changes to practice and procedure are implemented as needed.  As a part of the District\u00bfs five-year capital improvement plan, the chlorine handling/storage/feed facility is being upgraded and is in construction at this time.  A new facility will be on-line in October 2004.  The new facility will reflect current State of Colorado and Chlorine Institute requirements as well as new security upgrades.
