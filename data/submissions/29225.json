Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nWe at Delta Producers Coop in Delta, Colorado are strongly committed to employee, public, and\n\nenvironmental safety.  This commitment is an inherent part of our comprehensive accidental release\n\nprevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance,\n\nand employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement\n\nappropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  We coordinate our\n\nresponse efforts with the Delta Fire Department, which provides additional emergency response\n\nexpertise.\n\n\n\n  2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nOur facility's primary activities include support services for crop production.  We have anhydrous\n\nammonia stored in two 12,000-gallon tanks, one 18,000-gallon tank, thirty 1,000-gallon nurse tanks\n\nand ten 500-gallon nurse tanks at our facility in Delta, Colorado (Figure 1).  The maximum amount\n\nstored is 77,000 gallons ( 336,805.7 pounds) including the capacity of the on-site nurse tanks.   The\n\nlargest single storage vessel at our facility contains 78,733.8 pounds at  85% standard maximum\n\nstorage capacity.\n\n\n\n  3. Worst Case Release and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nWe utilized RMP Comp for the worst case and alternate case scenarios of the required offsite\n\nconsequence analysis for our facility.  The following details these scenarios.\n\n\n\nThe worst case release scenario involves a catastrophic release of the entire contents of one of the \n\nlargest single anhydrous ammonia storage tanks (78,733.8 pounds) in gaseous form over a 10-minute\n\nperiod.  We anticipated that administrative controls or mi"

Radius2 x 3.14 = area of circle. 4.2\n\nmiles2 x 3.14 x 75 people = approximately 4,155 people within 4.2 mile radius of the site. \n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario involves a release from vehicular collision with the tank resulting\n\nin a pipe break and the release of anhydrous ammonia through a 1\" dia. hole in the anhydrous\n\nammonia product line.  Vehicular collision (RMP Hazard Review, Section 8.4) was selected as the\n\nmost probable causal agent for an alternative release scenario.  The scenario involves the release of \n\n5,000 pounds of ammonia in a gaseous form over a period of two minutes.  Active mitigation\n\n(emergency shutoff) limited the release to two minutes.  Under neutral weather conditions, the\n\nmaximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L of ammonia is 1.2 miles (Figure 3).

General Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the EPA's accidental release prevention\n\nrequirements as set forth in 40 CFR part 68.  The following sections briefly describe the elements\n\nof the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nDelta Producers Coop maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical\n\nhazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associated with all processes (Appendix D).\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that"

Any findings from the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely\n\nmanner.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nDelta Producers Coop maintains written operating procedures to ensure that activities within our\n\ncovered processes are conducted safely.  These procedures address various modes of operation; the\n\ninformation is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes\n\n(Appendix B).\n\n\n\nTraining\n\nDelta Producers Coop has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who\n\nare operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nDelta Producers Coop conducts documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure\n\nproper operation.  Maintenance checks are conducted by qualified personnel with previous training\n\nin maintenance practices.  Examples of process equipment that would receive maintenance checks\n\ninclude:  pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency\n\nshutdown systems, controls, and pumps.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance\n\nchecks are corrected in a safe and timely manner (Appendix C).\n\n\n\nManagement of Change\n\nWritten procedures are in place at Delta Producers Coop to manage changes in process chemicals,\n\ntechnology, equipment, and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or other\n\nemployees whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly notified\n\nof the modification and offered training to deal with it.\n\n\n\nPre-startup Reviews\n\nDelta Producers Coop routinely conducts pre-startup safety reviews related to new processes and\n\nmodifications in established processes.
