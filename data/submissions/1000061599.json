The facility is regulated under RMP due to on-site chlorine storage in excess of 10,000 pounds.\r\n\r\nThe management structure and oversight to ensure safety at the facility is documented in the facility's RMP and includes compliance with the applicable regulations, codes, and standards.  The facility redesigned the chlorine system approximately 5 years ago to greatly reduce the chlorine on-site and to improve and enhance the safety features associated with the system.\r\n\r\nFive Year Accident History\r\nThe facility has had no RMP reportable accidents/releases within the previous five years.\r\n\r\nPrevention Program\r\nThe facility has implemented Program Level 3 Prevention Programs for chlorine, as required by RMP and PSM regulation.  These prevention program provisions are specifically intended to minimize the probability and/or consequences of any accidental releases.  Prevention items include: process hazard analysis, operating procedures, training, mechanical integrity, preventative maintenance, contractor training, pre-start-up reviews, management of change, hot work permits, etc.  The facility's prevention program is an on-going system based on periodic training, procedure review and revision, and internal audits.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\nThe facility has a coordinated response with the Jackson County LEPC to ensure prompt response to large chlorine releases.\r\n\r\nSummary\r\nThe facility is committed to ensuring its operations are safe and operated in accordance with all RMP/PSM requirements.  Senior management is involved in the implementation of these programs and is responsible for RMP development, implementation, and compliance.
