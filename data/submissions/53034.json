      "SummaryText": "The California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program and Federal EPA Risk Management Program requirements apply to California facilities that have quantities of hazardous materials over threshold values that were gauged to have a potential for off-site hazard. These facilities may be required to develop and submit a Risk Management Plan (RMP). The RMP must include the following key elements.\n\n(1)Hazard Assessment\n(2)Prevention Program\n(3)Emergency Response\n(4)External Events\n\nAlthough in many ways an extension of the California Risk Management and Prevention Program (RMPP) and Process Safety Management (PSM) requirements, there are many more Facilities encompassed by CalARP/RMP, and there are numerous differences that covered facilities must be sensitive to.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\nIn reviewing the potentially covered processes at California Dairies Tipton facility, the only RMP-covered processes are the Ammonia Refrigeration System and the Cgen emission control injection system.\n\nCalifornia Dairies uses the ammonia refrigeration system to chill and hold product.\nThe ammonia system utilized by California Dairies includes a liquid ammonia receiver. High-pressure liquid ammonia flows from the high-pressure receiver to the pump recirculator and then to the evaporators and silos where the pressure is reduced by allowing the ammonia to expand through expansion valves. The resulting low-pressure liquid ammonia is evaporated to provide refrigeration. Ammonia vapor exiting the evaporators is returned to the engine room. The resultant dry vapor is drawn to the compressor where it is compressed. The compressed vapor is then condensed to its liquid from in the evaporative condensers and returned to the high-pressure receiver.                                                                    \n\nIn addition process 2 injects ammonia into the Cogen gas burners to reduce emissions.

The first section (CalARP & Supplemental US EPA RMP Information) links the US EPA RMP Submittal (copy provided in Appendix A) with CalARP-specific information.\n\nThe following paragraphs are reproduced from California Dairies Tipton facility US EPA RMP Submittal Executive Summary for the convenience of the reader.\n\nCalifornia Dairies - Tipton is located at 11894 Avenue 120, Tipton, CA. The surrounding rural area consists of some residential development. The facility maintains approximately 90 full time employees. The facility produces and stores dairy products. The ammonia refrigeration system is defined as a closed loop \"Direct\" type system.\n\nThe California Dairies Tipton facility has developed a risk management program to address California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program requirements (California Health & Safety Code, Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4, EPA Title 40 CFR Part 68 and OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119) and to enhance an already existing safety and emergency action programs.

This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the Ammonia Refrigeration System and Cogen systems. Their policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe ammonia systems are composed of the following key components:\n\n5 Compressors\n4 Condensers\n1 Thermosyphon Vessel\n2 High Pressure Receivers\n1 Recirculation Pump Reveiver with pumps\n1Shell and Tube Chiller with Accumulator\n3 Oil Pots\n1 Plate and Frame Chiller with Accumulator\n8 Butter Cooler Evaporators\n25 Product Silos\n\nSystem Operation cycle begins at the high-pressure receiver where liquid ammonia is fed from the receiver to the flooded accumulator. At this point the ammonia flashes down to saturation temperature, then flows down to the heat exchanger where it absorbs heat from the glycol. The gas is then drawn to the compressor where it is compressed and the pressure is increased to condensing pressure. The superheated compressor discharge travels through the evaporative condenser where the ammoina gas gives up its heat and is condensed to a liquid and returned to the high-pressure receiver to begin the cycle over again.\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY/OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\n\nAs stipulated in EPA guidelines, 40 CFR Part 68.25, the worst-case and alternate case release scenarios were calculated for the covered process at the California Dairies facility and the written results of the off-site consequence scenarios are help on file at the facility.\n\nRisk Considerations\n\nAlthough the storage and use of anhydrous ammonia has inherent potential risks, and worst-case release scenarios "

In addition to the safety practices of the company and plant personnel to make this worst-case event non-credible, it should also be recognized that there are inherent analysis assumptions that make the results of the atmospheric dispersion analysis appear worse than what would actually be expected during such an event (e.g., in the event of a release, sudden rupture and flashing of ammonia would be highly turbulent. Turbulence causes entertainment of air and the released vapor dilutes much more quickly than in the model).\n\nIn addition to the use of conservative analysis assumptions that over-predict the effects of a potential release, other characteristics of the facility and site serve to minimize the potential risks associated with an ammonia release:\n-There are process valves to permit isolation of any leaks in place.\n-Floor drains in the Engine Room would provide containment for liquid release and therefore minimize the potential for offsite impact.\n-Although most of the ammonia is located in the Engine Room. Conservatively, no credit for enclosure mitigation was taken.\n-Plant personnel, as necessary, use Personal Protective Equipment (PPE).\n-The history of the Facility (i.e., no CalARP-applicable ammonia releases) reflects the adequacy of the design and diligence of the plant staff in safely operating the Ammonia Refrigeration System.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nAs part of the implementation of this CalARP, key Prevention Program elements were implemented by California Dairies to manage process safety issues associated with the use of ammonia for refrigeration. In addition, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are currently utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed. The CalARP Prevention Program elements include:\n\n-Hazard"
