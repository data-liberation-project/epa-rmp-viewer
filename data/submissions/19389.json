Calpine King City Cogeneration Facility closely coordinated with the Monterey County Department of Public Health to ensure that appropriate technical standards were applied in the implementation of these regulations.\n\n1.1  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nIt is the policy at Calpine King City Cogeneration Facility to minimize hazards to employees, the public, and the environment. The overall responsibility for the developement, implementation, and integration of the RMP rests with the Plant Manager of the Calpine Kng City Cogeneration Facility, Rick Colgan.\n\n1.2  FACILITY INFORMATION\n\nThe Calpine King City Cogeneration Facility (Calpine) is a combined-cycle plant designed to produce both process steam for use in the adjacent Basic Vegetable Products (BVP) Facility, and electricity for sale to Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E).\n\n1.3  AMMONIA SYSTEMS\n\nThe only regulated substance present at Calpine above the threshold planning quantity is anhydrous ammonia. The maximum amount on site at any one time would be equivalent to the maximum working capacity of the ammonia storage tank (9,386 gallons).\n\nThe ammonia systems are comprised of the ammonia supply system and the ammonia injection system. The ammonia supply system stores anhydrous ammonia, vaporizes the ammonia, and supplies the ammonia vapor to the ammonia injection system. The ammonia injection system receives ammonia vapor from the ammonia supply system, regulates the ammonia flow rate, dilutes the ammonia with air, and injects the dilute ammonia/air mixture into the gas side of each train of the Heat Recovery Steam Generator (HRSG) within the superheater module.\n\n1.4  RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\n1.4.1 Worst-case release scenario\n\nAs per regulations, the worst-case release scenario is the capacity of the ammonia storage t"

The distance to the toxic endpoint is 4.4 miles in a rural setting and 2.8 miles in an urban setting (if the wind is blowing toward King City). The affected population is approximately 10,500. Administrative controls and control measures include:\n\na. Facility Hazardous Material Management Plan\nb. Facility Business Response Plan\nc. Operating Procedures\nd. Personnel Training\ne.

NOx Monitor\n\n1.4.2 Altenative release scenario\n\nAs per consensus with the County, the alternative release scenario is a leak during filling operations in the connecting hose between the tanker truck and the storage tank. It is presumed that the release rate is less than the flow that would actuate the truck's automatic shut-off valve, and would continue for up to ten (10) minutes. The distance to the toxic endpoint is 0.4 miles in a rural setting and 0.2 miles in an urban setting (if the wind is blowing toward King City). The affected population is less than 100. Administrative controls and control measures include the above and:\n\na. Inspection of Delivery Truck Prior to Transfer\nb. Safety Session Between Transfer Operator and Delivery Driver Prior to Transfer\nc. Transfer Operator Carries Self-Contained-Breathing-Apparatus\nd. Maintenance of Radio Communications Between Transfer Operator and Control Room\ne. Visual Communication Between Transfer Operator and Delivery Driver\nf. Emergency Showers and Eye-Washing Facilities\n\n1.5 ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nACPM 7.1, \"Hazardous Material Management Plan\" and ACPM 7.6, \"Business Response Plan\" provide a detailed description of the accidental release prevention and emergency response programs in place at Calpine.\n\n1.6 FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nCalpine has"
