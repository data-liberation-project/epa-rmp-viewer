      "SummaryText": "INTRODUCTION\n\nThe Accidental Release Prevention Risk Management Program rule (40 CFR Part 68) is similar to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's Process Safety Management Program, which is designed to protect workers from accidental releases of hazardous substances.  The Risk Management Program rule addresses over 100 chemical substances-77 of which are acutely toxic and 63 of which are flammable gases-and the accidental release of these substances. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) estimates that over 100,000 sources are covered by the rule, including chemical manufacturers and wholesalers, certain retailers, potable water treatment systems, wastewater treatment plants, ammonia refrigeration systems, and federal facilities.\n\nThe East Side Water Treatment Plant (WTP) falls under this regulation because of the on-site storage of chlorine.  The amount of chlorine stored is well above the threshold limit specified by the USEPA thereby making the facility subject to compliance with the regulation.  The East Side WTP personnel have complied with the USEPA Risk Management Program rule and have completed an Accidental Release Prevention Program (ARPP) Plan that contains the following required information:\n\n7 Management System\n\n7 A hazard assessment that establishes the worst-case and alternate release scenarios and their impact on the population and the environment (40 CFR Part 68 Subpart B).\n\n7 A prevention program that includes safety information, a hazard review, operating procedures, training, maintenance, compliance audits, and incident investigations. (40 CFR Part 68 Subpart C)\n\n7 An emergency response plan (40 CFR Part 68 Subpart E)\n\nThe following subsections discuss details of the plan that has been implemented at the East Side WTP.\n\nRELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe East Side WTP facility in Sunnyvale, Texas has an excellent record in preventing and minimizing releases of chlorine.

      "SummaryText": "ementing a program for on-site emergency responders.\n\nThe emergency response policies at this facility ensure that there is emergency response coverage 24 hours per day, 7 days per week.  There are also adequate provisions for coordination with outside agencies, such as the City of Dallas HAZMAT team, in the event of an emergency.   In the event of a release, plant staff is receiving training to enable an on-site staff response prior to the arrival of the HAZMAT team.  \n\nREGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe East Side WTP uses chlorine as a disinfectant in the water treatment process.  The East Side WTP regularly has a storage maximum quantity of 180 tons of chlorine at its facility that is stored in DOT certified 90-ton rail cars.  This is above the threshold limit (2,500 pounds) set by the USEPA. \n\nPROCESS DESCRIPTION\n\nThe East Side WTP receives raw water from the City of Dallas' East Texas water supply, Lake Tawakoni and Lake Ray Hubbard into the treatment plant located at 405 Long Creek Road, in Sunnyvale, Texas.  Water is treated at the plant and subsequently pumped to the distribution network of pipelines, pump stations, and storage tanks.  \n\nThe existing chlorine feed facility at the East Side WTP consists of  (1) two 90-ton rail cars, (2) liquid feed piping and miscellaneous valves, (3) three evaporators, (4) gas piping and miscellaneous valves, (5) three pre chlorinators, and (6) three post chlorinators.  On treatment plant grounds, the two areas in which chlorine has a potential to generate a gaseous release are the chlorine storage area (items 1 and 2 above) and the chlorine process areas (items 3 through 6 above). \n\nChlorine is delivered to the East Side WTP by railroad on rail spurs and stored in two 90-ton railroad tank cars, located north of the Chemical Building. Chlorine is removed as a liquid under pressure of the rail car.  Chlorine is withdrawn from one tank car at a time through a flexible metal connection.  As the supply in one rail car empties, the supply "

      "SummaryText": "is manually switched to the full tank car. \n\nThe chlorine is pumped through a flexible reinforced Monel hose and hard-piped to three chlorine evaporators located in the chlorine evaporator room. The chlorine gas generated by the evaporators is then transferred to the three pre chlorinators and fed either to the forebay or the raw water junction.   Additionally, chlorine gas can be transferred to the three post chlorinators and fed to the transfer pump station suction flumes.\n\nWORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nThe chlorine storage and process areas have associated hazards that can potentially affect on-site employees and the off-site population and environment.  The U.S. EPA requires that one worst-case scenario and one alternate release scenario is reported for each regulated chemical. \n\nWorst-Case Scenario\n\nThe largest potential release of chlorine would occur through an angle valve failure on the 90-ton rail car located on the north side of the plant.  This valve failure could potentially release all 90 tons of the chlorine as a gas.  Under Section 68.25(c)(1), the release time for a chemical such as chlorine is 10 minutes.  Passive mitigation controls were not applicable to the worst-case release at this plant.\n \nThe EPA-approved modeling program DEGADIS+ was used to characterize the effects of the worst case scenario at the East Side facility.  The distance to the toxic endpoint of 3 ppm was determined to be 8.58 miles.  The estimated affected residential population is 230,000 people.  Commercial/industrial areas and residential areas would be affected in the worst-case release scenario.\n \nAlternate Scenario\n\nTwo alternate scenarios were modeled for the East Side WTP, neither of which had any active or passive mitigation.  The first release could occur because of damage to the flex hose that directs the chlorine to the hard pipes.  A release of chlorine through a 1-inch diameter hole would occur for 10 minutes. The release rate of chlorine caused by "

The distance to the USEPA defined toxic endpoint of 3 ppm was determined to be 5.53 miles.  The estimated affected residential population is 70,000 people.  \n\nThe second and most likely scenario involves a release through 1/8-inch hole created by a leak in a packing valve.  It was assumed that this leak could occur for 120 minutes, the time between operator rounds, creating a release rate of 30 lb/min. DEGADIS+ was used to characterize the effects of the alternative case scenario at the East Side WTP.  The distance to the toxic endpoint of 3 ppm was determined to be 0.44 miles.  The estimated affected residential population is 140 people.  \n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PRECAUTION PROGRAM\n\nThe East Side WTP carries out consistent operation and maintenance of its chlorine equipment utilizing only fully trained personnel in this area.  East Side WTP management enforces consistent operation through discipline for operational deviations.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe East Side WTP's accident history was reviewed for a period from June 1994, through June 1999.  During this period of time, no accidental releases of chlorine had occurred.  \n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nAs mentioned earlier, this facility has developed an Emergency Response Program in which plant employees are divided into various management and response teams.  There are five in-plant contacts for an emergency, the Operations Supervisor, and the Shift Supervisors.  There are also back-up personnel in the event that the primary response personnel cannot be contacted.  \n\nThe Emergency Response Plan includes: (1) procedures to follow in the event of a chlorine emergency, (2) information about the frequency of employee emergency response training, and (3) a detailed description of the emergency response training underway.\n\nThe City of Dallas"

      "SummaryText": " HAZMAT team has been designated to provide back-up emergency responders and equipment, and will assume Incident Command upon arrival to the plan's emergency call. \n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nBased on the hazard review and prevention evaluation completed for chlorine a list of action items was developed and is being considered by East Side WTP management to determine if implementation is to be accomplished.  The most notable planned changes include the following:\n\n7 The evaluation of the need to develop a tank inspection program.   Usually the railroad company will leave a new rail car on site away from the chlorine tower until notified by East Side personnel to move it to the tower.  If a SOP was implemented requiring inspection once the car is spotted on site the uncertainty that a leak on a rail car stored away from the tower would go undetected would be alleviated.\n\n7 A copy of the SOP for tank hook-up and disconnection could be posted, in Plexiglas, by the chlorine tree.  This would eliminate any confusion about disconnection and hook-up that the operators might have.\n\n7 The identification of security improvement.  The security system at East Side should be upgraded to restrict access through a remotely operated gate system or card system. \n\n7 The evaluation of the need for an automatic kill switch on the tanks.  This would be useful in the case of an emergency when the tanks have to be shut off immediately. A remote switch would eliminate the danger of plant personnel having to shut the chlorine rail cars off manually.\n\n7 The implementation of remote leak detection for the rail cars.  For at least the next three years, the railcars will continue to be stored without containment.  Leak detection located between the two railcars at ground level would provide an audio / visual immediate detection of a leak from the rail car area.  \n\n7 The East Side WTP is currently under design for improvement to the chemical handling system.  These improvements include "
