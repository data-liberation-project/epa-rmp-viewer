      "SummaryText": "August 16, 2012\r\nRe: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY, RMP Echo Lake Foods, Franksville.\r\n\r\n\r\nElement One- accidental release prevention and emergency response policies.\r\n\r\nSenior management has established a Compliance Team.  This team monitors all of the facilities process safety management programs and has utilized employee awareness and the process hazard analysis portion to prevent accidental releases.  An example of this would be installing spring to close oil pot drain valves so that the valve can't be left open.  The Compliance Team requires and monitors all the facilities emergency response plans.  This has been the motivating force to get, keep, and improve our facility plans.\r\n\r\n\r\nElement Two- facility and regulated substances handled.\r\n\r\nEcho Lake Foods, Franksville facility is a food processing plant producing a variety of breakfast style foods.  The plant operates seven days per week two shifts per day.\r\nThe main chemical of concern is Ammonia.  It is used in the cooling and freezing of food products. The refrigeration plant utilizes both low and high stage compression. The plant runs chillers, process blast freezers, room coolers, and storage freezers.  Other chemicals located at the plant but in small quantities are chlorine, soaps, and boiler and evaporator water treatment chemicals.\r\n\r\n\r\nElement Three- worst-case and alternative release scenarios.\r\n\r\nI used industry- specific guidance from the IIAR to do the modeling.  RMP program guidance for ammonia refrigeration.  For the worst-case I used the liquid receiver located just outside and north of the Processing Plant.  The receiver holds 5000 pounds of ammonia.  The release duration is 10.0 minutes, wind speed 1.5 meters per second, atmospheric stability class (F), and topography rural.  The charts indicate distance to endpoint as 1.80 Miles.  There are only homes or farms located in this area.  I estimate 1143 people could be influenced by this event with no public receptors or environmental receptors.  No passiv"

      "SummaryText": "e mitigation exists.\r\nFor an alternative release scenario I used the intermediate pressure vessel where maintenance activities could potentially break off a \u00bc\" diameter service line causing a release of chemicals. The quantity released was estimated to be 6,000 pounds, with a release rate 600 pounds per minute for a release duration of 10.0 minutes, wind speed 1.5 meters per second, atmospheric stability class (f), topography rural, and distance to endpoint 0.6 miles (from chart).\r\nI estimate 250 people influenced by this event.  Again there are only homes and farms located in this area.  No public or environmental receptors are affected. No passive mitigation exists.  Existing active mitigation in use are excess flow valves (PRV's), and emergency shutdown systems.\r\n\r\n\r\nElement four- general accident release prevention and chemical-specific prevention steps.  \r\n\r\nWe are in compliance with OSHA process safety management rule for Ammonia.  Getting the operators, supervisors and managers all involved in process hazard analysis was important in finding and correcting potential problems.  Checking safety systems and the mechanical integrity inspection and documenting these things raises the competency of the system and the operator's confidence and pride.  And training, not only is this good for the operator, but supervisors and managers better understand the needs of the operators.  Logs and preventive maintenance programs are required for all equipment and system monitoring.\r\n\r\n\r\nElement five- five year accident history.\r\n\r\nWe have had some small releases of ammonia, (less than 100 pounds) in the last five years.\r\nNo residences had to be evacuated.  Of all the releases we have had to only evacuate the affected areas of the plant and utilized no local response personnel, and have had no injuries to date associated with on-site chemical releases.\r\n\r\n\r\nElement six-emergency response program.\r\n\r\nFirst response is too our employees whether it is fire, weather, or chemical r"

      "SummaryText": "elease alarm.  Next we call the local fire department (Union Grove Fire Dept.).  If hazardous chemicals are involved then the local fire department would call in the Racine Emergency Response HAZMAT team.  Union Grove is very familiar with our plant and process.  They have been receiving are tier two reports.  In the future we plan to develop our relationship further with the local responders and provide visual layouts of our facility and response binders detailing the location and operation of our emergency systems. We would like to also conduct a practice drill in the near future.  \r\nAll personal receive ammonia awareness training as part of our process safety management program.  Further training is given in-house by our trainers to our operators, supervisors and managers in ammonia refrigeration as per our PSM program. \r\n\r\n\r\nElement seven- planned changes to improve safety.\r\n\r\nWe plan to increase the number of employees trained as 8 and 24 hour Emergency Responders to further enhance our training program and the effectiveness of our operators in the event of an emergency situation.  In the future we plan to include outside responders in our drills.  Familiarity with our equipment and facility are keys to any successful response. We have training sessions in planning stages to over standard operating procedures of our ammonia refrigeration plant. After this training a refresher training program will be scheduled.\r\nThe Compliance Team started last year and have been big drivers for improving safety for personnel and food products company wide.  Their support has given the plant managers the means to get the job done. Mechanical improvements to the ammonia refrigeration system will be made when equipment is replaced for age or wear, when processes are changed, or when required for plant safety.\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n\r\nAbraham R. Belew\r\nEnvironmental & Safety Manager"
