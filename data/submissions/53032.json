The only RMP regulated substance at this facility is anhydrous ammonia which is classified as a toxic substance, liquefied under pressure.  The definitions and parameters for the following release scenarios are based on the \u00bfRisk Management Program guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration\u00bf as described in Chapter 4: Off-site Consequence Analysis.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario (OCA-1) used in this assessment identifies the low temperature re-circulator (V-3) as the vessel with the potential to hold the largest quantity of ammonia.  This is based on the system design that uses this vessel as a pump-down holding receiver.  The worst case release is based on over-filling the vessel causing a release of the vapor and liquid in the vessel with no piping volume included.  The worst-case scenario is estimated to be 8869 pounds of ammonia over a ten minute period.\n\nThe alternative release scenario evaluated in this hazard assessment is the direct release of ammonia vapor from the largest pressure relief valve with a duration of sixty minutes.  This is considered to be the most likely scenario capable of having off-site consequences.  The size of the release is based on the rated capacity of the pressure relief valve (66.9 pounds/minute) with a release duration of sixty (60) minutes.\n\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\nThis facility follows the OSHA Process Safety Management Program.  Various special elements have been incorporated into this program to meet the additional EPA requirements for the RMP.  Following is an overview. \n\nParticipation \u00bf The Participation Program is an asset to both employees at the site and to the community as a whole.\nAs a general rule, employees who are fully involved have a greater sense of responsibility; they are more likely to catch the problems that can cause accidents.  Employee awareness is for employees not directly involved with the process, this includes knowing the hazards, the safety rules,"

Permits indicate the appropriate dates and the work to be done.  The permits are kept on file until workers have completed the hot work operations.\n\nManagement of Change \u00bf The Management of Change (MOC) procedure requires that all changes (even \u00bfreplacement in kind\u00bf) be reviewed to see if there is a possible negative effect.  The MOC review addresses the technical basis for the change, the impact on safety and health, modifications to operating procedures, and authorization requirements for the proposed change.  Employees affected by the change are informed of the change before startup and trained in the proper procedures.\n\nIncident Investigation \u00bf An incident Investigation shall be performed any time there is an incident which resulted in, or which could reasonably have resulted in, a catastrophic release of ammonia.  The purpose is to gain information that could prevent further accidents and to identify weaknesses in the emergency response plan that need to be addressed.  Investigations are initiated promptly using a trained team.  The findings and recommendations will be studied and appropriate corrective action taken.\n\nEmergency Response Plan \u00bf This facility has a comprehensive emergency response plan that meets established criteria.  This plan will be provided to the local fire department and the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).\n\nCompliance Audits and RMP Revisions \u00bf To insure that all areas of the Process Safety Program are followed, the company requires compliance audits.  At a minimum, these must be every three years.\n\nResubmission of the RMP shall be done to meet the OCA requirements according to RMP Section 6.2 in Volume 14.\n\nACCIDENT HISTORY \u00bf LAST FIVE YEARS\nThere have been no RMP reportable accidents within the past five years.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\t\nNone at this time."

      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nThis Risk Management Program is designed to comply with the Environmental Protection Agency regulations detailed in 40 CFR Part 68.  This is a relatively new stationary source.  The only RMP regulated substance at this facility is anhydrous ammonia \u00bf which is classified as a toxic substance, liquefied under pressure.\n\nThis is a relatively new process that falls under the RMP regulations due to its ammonia inventory being above the threshold level.\n\nThe refrigeration system in this facility has an ammonia inventory of approximately 28,500 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.\n\nThis process does not meet the requirements of Program 1.  It is subject to OSHA\u00bfs PSM standard.  Therefore, this RMP is written to meet the EPA Program 3 level of compliance.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION POLICY\nThe facility follows a rigorous thirteen volume Ammonia Safety Program to prevent the accidental release of ammonia.  This program is also in compliance with Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA),  Process Safety Management (PSM) of 29 CFR 1910.119.  Employees and management participate and cooperate in the PSM program to maintain a work environment that is safe to employees, the community, and the environment.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICY\nThe facility has a comprehensive emergency response plan that meets established criteria.  The plan has been submitted to the local LEPC.\n\nPROCESS OVERVIEW\nThis food distribution facility operates a two temperature, single stage, anhydrous ammonia (R-717) refrigeration system with a maximum engine room capacity of 838.4 TR @ +30\u00b0F high-temperature suction and 967.0 TR @ +15\u00b0F low-temperature suction.  The refrigeration system is a liquid recirculation system and is designed to operate at an over-feed ratio of approximately 3:1 for all evaporators.  Anhydrous ammonia (R-717) refrigerant is a Group II refrigerant.  Rotary screw compressors are used in the refrigeration system.  Engine room electrical classification is\nNEMA-1.\n\nTh"

Although there are doors and windows, the overall enclosure acts as a dike creating liquid pooling and limiting the liquid run-off.  Ammonia leak detection is installed in this area that sounds alarms and starts emergency ventilation.  The emergency ventilation is automatically controlled and discharges the engine room air outside which creates a lower level of concentration in the engine room for responders. It also starts air dispersion at lower concentration levels and disperses the ammonia with greater air turbulence.\n\nSUMMARY OF HAZARD ASSESSMENT \nThis hazard assessment was conducted to meet the RMP Off-site Consequence Analy"
