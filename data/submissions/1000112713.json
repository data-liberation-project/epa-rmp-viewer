This system is comprised of a group of corporate procedures and standards under the life safety program. Procedures in place include: energy control, safe work, hot work, confined space entry and process line break. Facility personnel are trained on these safe work practices to ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\nContractors\nAir Liquide uses outside contractors to support maintenance activities. Contractors are made aware of the potential dangers involved with a system covered by PSM/RMP. Procedures are in place to make sure that contractors: (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, and (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency prior to their beginning work. Periodically contractors are evaluated to ensure that both their safety performance and training required for work on the hydrogen purification process.\n\nCHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\nAir Liquide's accidental release prevention program activities helps prevent potential accident\nscenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors. The following are examples of the types of safety features in place:\nAutomated process control shutdowns\nAutomatic and manual valves that provide for isolation of the process\nManual Emergency process shutdowns located in the control room and process area\nPressure Safety Relief Valves and Flare system\nDeluge system, fire water monitor, and hydrant system\nSpecial personal protective equipment (e.g., FRC protective clothing,)\nPersonal/portable ambient air monitors\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThe La"

PSSRs are intended to ensure safety through confirmation that: (1) construction and equipment are in accordance with design specifications; (2) safety, operating, maintenance and emergency\nprocedures are in place and adequate; (3) PHAs have been performed and recommendations\nresolved before startup of new plants or processes; (4) MOC requirements have been satisfied for modified facilities; and (5) training has been completed for affected employees.\n\nCompliance Audits\nTo help ensure the accident prevention program is functioning properly, Air Liquide conducts an\naudit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accidental release\nprevention program are being implemented. Compliance audits are conducted at least every three years. Resolutions to the recommendations are documented, tracked and closed.\nIncident Investigation Air Liquide defines management systems and establishes the requirements for communicating, investigating and reporting of incidents at all facilities through the use of an Incident Investigation and reporting procedure. Air Liquide documents incident and subsequent investigation, follow up actions, and closure. Results of findings and corrective actions are shared with employees who could be affected by the findings.\n\nEmployee Participation\nAt the North Vegas LH2 facility, employees are expected to participate in accidental release prevention program (PSM/RMP).

In addition, all operators are required to attend refresher training at least every three years. Training is documented and tracked in the electronic learning management system.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nAir Liquide has established mechanical integrity (MI) practices and procedures, based on\npreventative philosophy, to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, and relief valves and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition. The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests; (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures. In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process equipment.\nThe MI program assists with the verification and suitability of new and existing process equipment and, as well as quality control of spare parts and modifications to existing process equipment.\n\nManagement of Change\nAir Liquide's management of change (MOC) procedure has established the requirements for\nensuring that proposed process or equipment changes or changes indirectly affecting processes are evaluated, approved, and documented prior to implementation through the use of a management of change process.

The Air Liquide commitment to safety and environmental protection for the Air Liquide North Las Vegas Liquid Hydrogen Facility extends beyond the plant. As part of the community, Air Liquide has a responsibility to our customer, near neighbors and the community at large to help provide a safe working and living environment. Through safety, concern for the environment, and community involvement, we can develop a true partnership with our customer and community.\n\nRegulated Chemical and Covered Process\nThe Las Vegas LH2 facility consists of a hydrogen steam methane reformer (SMR) and hydrogen liquefier including a 475,510-gallon liquid hydrogen storage sphere and a dispenser system for trailer loading and unloading.  The volume of liquid hydrogen stored onsite makes this site a \u0093covered process as defined under the Federal and state accidental release prevention regulations, as a flammable mixture process having an inventory in excess of 10,000 pounds.\n\nThe Hydrogen Facility steam methane reforming process is designed to provide an efficient\nproduction of high purity hydrogen using a natural gas feedstock. The hydrogen reforming and purification is performed at elevated pressure. High pressure purified hydrogen is then liquified. The North Las Vegas LH2 Facility is designed for continuous safe operation.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\nAir Liquide North Vegas LH2 is covered by EPA's accidental release prevention program regulations and is subject to OSHA's process safety management (PSM) standard.
