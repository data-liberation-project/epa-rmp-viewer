      "SummaryText": "Carpenter Co., Conover was initially built to produce flexible polyurethane foam for the furniture industry.\nThe pouring line has been expanded and modified several times over the ensuing years in order to\nimprove the process, both with respect to equipment and with respect to chemistry, to conform to new\nstate and federal regulations, and to meet ever increasing and changing demands by our customers. \nBonded, and un-bonded polyester fiber batting is also manufactured at this facility.  \n\nThis RMP re-submission has been triggered by the Process Hazard Analysis required prior to start-up of\na new, state-of-the-art, pouring line that does not use any toxic or flammable auxiliary blowing agents\n(ABA).  The pre-existing line remains to produce specialty foams that cannot, at this time, be produced\nusing the CO2 ABA utilized by  the new line.  Both lines are operated by the same crew and they cannot\noperate simultaneously.  Except for ABA used, the chemistry of manufacturing foam on these lines is\nidentical.  For these reasons, the two lines are being treated as one process.\n\nTwo RMP regulated substances are used at this facility.  Both pouring lines use TDI (toluene-2,-4\ndiisocyanate and toluene-2,-6 diisocyanate) as a reactant, and the old line uses pentane as a blowing\nagent.  Pentane is flammable but nontoxic. No other RMP-regulated substances are used at this facility.\n\n1. Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies.\n\nCarpenter Co. is committed to comply fully with all federal, state, and local rules and regulations\nregarding the proper handling, use, storage, and emergency response preparedness to prevent\naccidental release of chemicals, toxic or otherwise.  Furthermore, Carpenter Co. is committed to\nprotecting the health and welfare of its employees and community residents - as well as protecting the\nenvironment.\n\nAn Emergency Response procedure for Carpenter Co., Conover has been developed and is located in\nthe Contingency Plan.

The stationary source and regulated substances handled.\n\nCarpenter Co., Conover is located at 2009 Keisler Dairy Road and manufactures polyurethane foam\nproducts for use in furniture, bedding and other applications.  The manufacturing process incorporates\nthe use of TDI as a reactant to produce the foam product. TDI is received primarily via railcars which\nhold approximately 190,000 lbs although tank trucks may be used if conditions warrant.  When required,\nthe rail carrier moves the railcar from an outside holding area to the indoor unloading area.  Transfer\nhoses and associated equipment are connected and the unloading process is initiated.  TDI is\ntransferred from the railcar to three 12,000 gallon storage tanks located in the interior tank farm near the\npouring station for the old pouring line or to a new 30,000 gallon tank located between the two lines.  All\n4 TDI tanks are located in concrete secondary containment.  TDI is pumped from the storage tanks to\nthe pouring lines through a strainer (or strainer & filter) and heat exchanger prior to entry into the mix\nhead.  In the mix head, TDI is combined with polyol, either CO2 or pentane, and other minor raw\nmaterials to initiate the foam production reaction.\n\nPentane is used as an auxiliary blowing agent on the old pouring line.  It is received by the facility in\nrailcars which are off-loaded into an outdoor 30,000 gallon storage tank placed within a concrete\ncontainment. Pentane is held under a nitrogen blanket. Pentane is pumped directly from the storage\ntank to the pouring line where it enters the mix head.  There are monitors in the process areas to insure\nthe accumulation of pentane"

Carpenter, Conover?s Risk\nManagement Program has been the subject of two dedicated inspections by the North Carolina\nDepartment of Environment and Natural Resources - Division of Air Quality, the last in December of\n2005, and found to be in complete compliance with this rule.  Personnel training with protective\nequipment and practice drills for emergencies and spill response are an important part of our safety and\npreventive measures.\n\n4. Five Year Accident History.\n\nCarpenter Co., Conover has not had any TDI or pentane releases in the past five years. \n\n5. The Emergency Response Program.\n\nAn Emergency Response procedure for Carpenter Co. Conover has been developed and is located in\nthe Contingency Plan.  This plan includes the procedures for informing the public and emergency\nresponse agencies when an accidental release occurs, documentation of proper first-aid and emergency\nmedical treatment necessary to treat accidental human exposure, and procedures and measures for\nemergency response after an accidental release of a regulated substance.\n\n6. Planned Changes to Improve Safety.\n\nEmployees are regularly scheduled for Hazardous Materials Handling training as well as spill drills.\nEmergency response training for the employees identified as responders is conducted regularly.  Also,\nnumerous safety topics are addressed and discussed which promotes and emphasizes the importance\nof safety awareness at the Conover Division."
