Describe Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Policies\nThe Drescher Corporation is committed to all federal, state and local laws on safety and health in the workplace.  To assist in providing a safe and healthful work environment for Associates, customers, and visitors, Drescher has established a workplace safety program.  This program is a top priority for Drescher.  The Safety Department has the responsibility for implementing, administering, monitoring, and evaluating the safety program.  Its success depends on the alertness and personal commitment of all.\n\nDrescher provides information to Associates about workplace safety and health issues through regular internal communication channels such as Supervisor-Associate meetings, bulletin board postings, memos, or other written communications.  A safety advisory group has been established to assist in these activities and to facilitate effective communications between Associates and management about workplace safety and health issues.\n\nAssociates and supervisors receive periodic workplace safety training.  The training covers potential safety and health hazards and safe work practices and procedures to eliminate or minimize hazards.\n\nEach Associate is expected to obey safety rules and to exercise caution in all work activities.  Associates must immediately report any unsafe condition to the appropriate supervisor.  Associates who violate safety standards, who cause hazardous or dangerous situations, or who fail to report or, where appropriate, remedy such situations, may be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.\n\nIn the case of accidents that result in injury, regardless of how insignificant the injury may appear, Associates should immediately notify the Safety Director or the appropriate supervisor.  Such reports are necessary to comply with laws and initiate insurance and worker+s compensation benefits procedures.\nAccidental Release Prevention and"

Overall, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.\n\nB.    Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThis company operates a freezing and storage warehouse for the perishable food industry.  This facility operates an ammonia refrigeration system to provide cooling and freezing capabilities.  The amount of anhydrous ammonia (CAS #7662-41-7) contained in this system is in excess of 10,000 pounds.  The ammonia inventory of this system is approximately 16,000 lbs.  Since ammonia releases from this system could pose a risk of offsite public impact and is regulated under the OSHA PSM standard (29 CFR 1910.119), the system is subject to the Program 3 requirements of the EPA+s RM program.\n\nThe closed loop ammonia refrigeration system at The Drescher Corporation, North Las Vegas, Nevada, facility provides (2) major suction pressures (temperatures) for use in the preservation of perishable food products. This provides refrigerant temperatures of -20F. with the use of low suction compressors and provides temperatures of +20f. intermediate suction compressors.\n\nThe higher pressure portions of the system include the condenser, located on the roof, along with refrigerant vent lines where any leaks can dissipate to the air, joining ammonia produced by lightning where it can be consumed as it goes through a natural biodegrading process.

The system provides cooling for the storage freezer, dock, two coolers, and the 75F. dry storage area.  \n\nThe system is controlled via microprocessors with hot gas defrost control, compressor sequencing, and evaporative condenser fan and pump control.  The system is also capable of remote operation via modem and is capable of temperature monitoring and control.\n\nAn ammonia detection system is installed as part of the central control system and will monitor locations where ammonia refrigerant is present.  The system in the engine room will bring on emergency ventilation fans.\n\nC.    Summary of Worst-Case and Alternative  Release Scenarios\n\nThe Worst Case Release Scenario is determined to be a catastrophic release from the high pressure receiver V-1.  This vessel operates at ambient temperature and above atmospheric pressure.\n\nThe V-1 receiver is a vertical vessel and is 7 feet in diameter and 16 feet in length.  When 69% filled, vessel capacity is approximately 16,000 pounds of ammonia.\n\nAssumed is that the release occurs through a circular hole located at the bottom of the vessel.  For this Worst Case Release Scenario, the distance from source to toxic endpoint is 1.4 miles or 7,392 feet.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario is unlikely for the following reasons:\n\nThe worst-case weather conditions which were used for this scenario are uncommon;\n\nIndustry standards were followed for the manufacture and quality control of these vessels;\n\nAmmonia is not corrosive in this service;\n\nPressure safety valves limit operating pressures in these vessels and vessels have design margins of safety of about 4 to 1.\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenario Analysis\n\nAn Alternative "

The potential for a pipe failure is significant given the extensive ammonia piping system extending throughout the Facility.\n\nAssumed is the failure of a 1-inch pipe connected to the V-1 receiver.  Using EPA-suggested meteorological parameters for alternative scenarios and following a one-hour release, the distance from release point to the toxic endpoint is 195 yards or 585 feet.  \n\nThe Alternative Release Scenario is unlikely for the following reasons:\n\nThe high pressure liquid lines are located in enclosed areas that could help to contain such a release;\n\nIndustry standards were followed for the manufacture and quality control of these lines;\n\nAmmonia is not corrosive in this service.\n\nVessel design uses a factor of approximately 4 to 1 margin for safety.\n\nActive mitigation considered would be the Emergency Shutdown System which permits system to equalize to 50-60 psig.\n\nD.
