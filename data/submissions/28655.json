In addition to the Management Programs, there are chlorine leak detectors situated in all rooms that contain chlorine.  In the event of a chlorine gas leak reaching 1 ppm, the detectors relay a signal that activates a horn and a light outside the room where chlorine has been detected.  In addition, the alarm is displayed on the SCADA monitors. At 3 ppm, the alarm signal actuates the emergency scrubber system for the chlorination building.\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nThe five-year accident history (January 1998 through January 2003) for the Temecula Valley RWRF reveals that there were no incidents that involved a release of chlorine leading to an injury on site or offsite or requiring evacuation of the plant or neighboring structures.\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSeveral process and administrative improvements were recommended as a result of the process hazard analysis and other technical studies and program implementation audits."

      "SummaryText": "RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN - TEMECULA VALLEY REGIONAL WATER RECLAMATION FACILITY\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nEastern Municipal Water District (EMWD) has established a Risk Management Plan according to EPA's regulations (40 CFR Part 68) to enhance already existing safety and emergency response programs.  EMWD is extremely cautious in the handling of all chemicals and is very diligent about safety for its employees and its communities. EMWD staff is highly trained and utilizes modern equipment to monitor its facilities to provide safeguards, while effectively employing these useful chemicals. These chemicals play an important role in water treatment and water reclamation, enabling everyone to lead healthier lives.\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nEastern Municipal Water District has an emergency response plan in effect to handle potential emergency situations at the Temecula Valley Regional Water Reclamation Facility (RWRF).  This Emergency Response Plan is designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n1.) To save lives.\n2.) To minimize and avoid injuries.\n3.) To protect the environment.\n4.) To minimize property damage.\n\nThe District maintains an on-call Emergency Response Team.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, chlorine health hazards and mitigation procedures that are implemented when responding to an emergency situation.\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\nChlorine, in bulk storage, is used at Temecula Valley RWRF for disinfecting wastewater treated by the plant.  There is a single chlorination building located at the facility housing two chlorine containers.  These containers are maintained and filled per Department of Transportation regulations and Chlorine Institute standards.\n\nChlorine gas is supplied from the bulk tanks to four chlorinators that regulate the chlorine feed rate via pressure regulating valves that shut off upon loss of vacuum downstream.  A vacuum is created at t"

The chlorine container is located in a building, therefore, this passive mitigation measure was incorporated in the calculations.  The most pessimistic meteorological conditions were used: 1.5 meters/second wind speed, and F stability (a measure for turbulence in the air).  Although the chlorination building is equipped with an automatically actuated scrubber system, it was considered to be inoperable for the purposes of this worst-case scenario.  The reference chart included in EPA's RMP Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants was used to determine the maximum downwind distance to 3 ppm concentration in the air.  With these assumptions in place, the toxic plume extends offsite.\n\nAlternative Release Result Summary\nScenario Description: Two alternate scenarios were considered.  The first consisted of a liquid release inside the chlorination building from a failure of a hose connecting a liquid carrying valve to system piping with a release rate of 150 pounds per minute from a \u00bc inch hole.  In the second scenario it is assumed that the hose connecting a delivery truck to the system develops a leak and releases liquid chlorine outside the building also with a release rate of 150 pounds per minute from a \u00bc inch hole..  In both alternate release scenarios, the downwind distances are substantially less than that of the worst case.  However, they extend offsite as well.\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe Eastern Municipal Water District has a Process Safety Management program in place to manage the handling of chlorine.  In addition, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are utilized to ens"
