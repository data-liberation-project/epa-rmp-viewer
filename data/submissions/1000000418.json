      "SummaryText": "1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe Publix Super Markets, Inc. (Publix) Dacula Distribution and Manufacturing Facility is located at 445 Hurricane Trail, Dacula, Gwinnett County, Georgia.  Publix requires each facility to develop and maintain accident prevention programs and an emergency response plan appropriate to the site.  Each site is also responsible for regulatory compliance issues that apply to the site.  Publix 's corporate and division environmental and safety personnel provide assistance in training for site employees and in budgeting and procurement of safety and training services.\n\n2. Facility and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe Dacula Distribution and Manufacturing Facility (Dacula Facility) is located on the north side of State Road 316 just east of the boundary between Lawerenceville and Dacula, Georgia.  The ASRS warehouse consists of areas for dry, frozen, and cooler storage of non-perishable and perishable items for distribution to the Publix Super Markets.  The manufacturing facility produces milk, ice cream, and other dairy products which are then stored in the perishable warehouse until they are shipped.  The manufacturing/distribution facility is currently undergoing an expansion to provide additional cooled distribution space.  This expansion was considered in this RMP Submittal and was addressed in the most recent Process Hazard Analysis.\n\nThese two ammonia refrigeration systems exceed the 10,000 lb. RMP threshold quantity.  The manufacturing facility's equipment is located in the perishable warehouse and in the compressor room.  The control pressure receiver (CPR) is located inside this room.  The CPR in this process is the largest capacity vessel onsite and is capable of holding approximately 43,058 lbs. of ammonia at 100% capacity.  At the ASRS Warehouse, the largest vessel is the High Pressure Receiver (HPR) which will hold approximately 42,730 lbs of ammonia at 100% capacity; at a maximum fill level o"

      "SummaryText": "f 80% the ASRS HPR contains 34,184 lbs.  Because the ASRS HPR is located outside the machinery room, a catastrophic release from this vessel will result in a longer endpoint distance than the larger CPR at the dairy.\n\n3. Prevention Program\n\nThis Dacula Facility exceeds the ammonia threshold quantity for the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard, 1910.119, and  the processes are therefore subject to the PSM requirements.  For RMP compliance purposes, this places the refrigeration processes in the Program 3 level.  The Dacula Facility will use its PSM program as the required Program 3 Prevention Program.  In 2001, Publix appointed an individual dedicated solely to the position of PSM Coordinator for the PSM programs at each of their facilities.\n\nThe Dacula Facility has a program in place to comply with the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard, 29 CFR 1910.119.  The PSM Program for the manufacturing facility was established in 1995 and was first audited in December 1997.  It includes a preventative maintenance plan which requires all ammonia refrigeration equipment to be periodically inspected and serviced.  This will ensure that the equipment remains in good operating condition and will minimize the probability of accidents due to faulty equipment.  The ASRS Warehouse program mirrors the program in place at the manufacturing facility.\n\nIn developing the PSM Program, the Dacula Facility also developed written operating procedures for the refrigeration process.  These procedures cover all phases of operation and include information on safety devices.  These procedures are used to train all operators and mechanics who work on the ammonia refrigeration processes to ensure consistency of operation and minimize human error. These measures ensure that all refrigeration operators and mechanics are properly trained.  Existing safe work practices such as Lockout/Tagout and Hot Work Permit, were reviewed and updated to ensure that all non-routine work can be performed"

      "SummaryText": "safely.\n\nOther components of the prevention program include collection and periodic review of all equipment information, including Piping & Instrumentation Diagrams (P&IDs).  The staff ensures that if equipment design deficiencies are identified that they are corrected.  These actions will ensure that the equipment meets all refrigeration industry standards and that accurate equipment information will be available when needed.\n\nTo ensure that the  Dacula Facility's refrigeration staff has the skills necessary to identify unsafe conditions, they are included in a refrigeration training program.  The training program includes Process Hazards Analyses, Operating Procedures, Maintenance Procedures, Emergency Response, and Safe Work Practices.  The Ammonia Refrigeration Staff, with the assistance of a consultant, performed a PHA of the dairy process in 1995, 1999, and 2004 and 2009.    PHAs of the ASRS process were performed in 2004 and 2009.  Additional PSM procedures, including Management of Change, Pre-Startup Safety Review, Compliance Audits, and Incident Investigation also  ensure the continued safe operation and prompt correction of deficiencies.  The PSM Program receives full support of plant management and involvement of employees at all levels.  \n\n4. Five-year Accident History\n\nThe Dacula Facility has had no accidental releases of ammonia that have resulted in offsite consequences in the past five years.\n\n5. Emergency Response Program\n\nThe Dacula Facility has written Emergency Procedures in place.  The program complies with 29 CFR 1910.38.  The site also has some internal emergency response capability and has developed a program to comply with paragraph (q) of 29 CFR 1910.120.  The current plan has been coordinated with the Gwinnett County Fire and Emergency Services.  Notification is made locally by dialing 911 or contacting the State Notification point at 1-800-241-4113.\n\n6.  Plans to Improve Safety\n\nThe facility plans to continue to utilize the newly appoint"
