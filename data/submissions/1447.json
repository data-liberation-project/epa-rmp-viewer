      "SummaryText": "Policy Statement\nThe Jackson Mill is committed to the safety of workers and the public, and to the preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  Boise Cascade implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances.  These controls include training programs for personnel; programs to help ensure safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of processes at Boise Cascade; and programs to evaluate the hazards at Boise Cascade.\nIn the event of an accidental release, Boise Cascade controls and contains the release in a manner that will be safe for workers and will help prevent injury to the public or the environment.  Boise Cascade provides response training to Boise Cascade personnel, designates an emergency response coordinator to oversee response activities, and coordinates response efforts with the local fire department, police department, and hospital.  Response activities have also been discussed with the Clarke County Emergency Management Agency.\nIn order to effectively implement these policies, Boise Cascade has established a management system headed by the RMP Manager to oversee risk management-related activities.\n\nFacility Information and Regulated Substances\nThe Jackson Mill is an integrated bleached kraft pulp and paper mill located in Jackson, Alabama.  The mill produces approximately 800 tons per day of bleached kraft pulp.  The mill currently operates one paper machine with capacity of 475 tons per day and a second paper machine with a capacity of 1,400 tons per day.  The facility stores 180,000 pounds of chlorine in a rail car.  Chlorine is fed to a vaporizer for use in the kraft pulp bleaching process.  Chlorine dioxide solution (containing approximately 1 percent by weight chlorine dioxide) is stored in two tanks of capacity 112,000 gallons each.  Assuming a specific gravity of 1.0, chlorine dioxide contained in each full tank is 9,341 pounds.  Ch"

      "SummaryText": "lorine dioxide solution is used as a bleaching agent in the pulping process.\nA Hazard Assessment was conducted as an initial screening procedure to determine the Program Level (1, 2, or 3) into which the Jackson Mill processes fall.  The mill currently stores quantities of two regulated toxic substances that exceed their threshold amounts listed in the RMP rule.  These materials are chlorine and chlorine dioxide.\nBecause the mill processes associated with these two materials are covered by OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) rule and because nearby residents (public receptors) lie within the toxic endpoint concentrations of the mill's worst-case release, both processes are subject to Program 3 requirements of the RMP. \n\nWorst-case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nChlorine\nThe worst case scenario is the rupture of a chlorine rail car and release of 180,000 pounds (17,400 gallons) of chlorine over a 10 minute duration, or 300 lb/sec. The released liquid is assumed to quickly volatilize and begin to disperse as a vapor cloud.  The release rate of 300 lb/sec is modeled with DEGADIS 2.1 using the worst case weather conditions prescribed by the RMP Rule.  The estimated maximum distance to the toxic endpoint concentration (3 ppm) is 10.7 miles, beyond which there will be enough dispersion that the hazard to the public will no longer exist.  The total population within the toxic endpoint circle is estimated to be 7,300 persons based on 1990 Census Data.  The worst-case release scenario would affect two environmental receptors, the Upper State Wildlife Sanctuary and the Stimpson State Game Sanctuary.\nThe chlorine alternative release scenario is the rupture of a pressure relief valve on a >-inch diameter process line leading from the rail car to the vaporizers.  The amount of liquid released is approximated by a relationship relating the liquid height above the rupture and a flow coefficient for the ruptured valve.  The amount released based on this scenario and emission"

Under realistic weather conditions of 3.0 m/s wind speed and a wind stability class of \"D,\" the DEGADIS 2.1 estimated distance to the toxic endpoint concentration (3 ppm) is 2.4 miles. The total population within the alternative release toxic endpoint circle is estimated to be 7,000 persons based on 1990 Census Data.  The alternative release scenario affects no environmental receptors.\n\nChlorine Dioxide\nThe chlorine dioxide alternative release scenario is the rupture of a 4-inch diameter transfer line leading from the storage tank to the bleach plant.  The 1 percent chlorine dioxide solution is pumped through the line via a 500 gpm pump. Because of the high vapor pressure of chlorine dioxide in the solution and the turbulent action of the spill, the entire chlorine dioxide in the solution is assumed to volatilize as soon as spill occurs.  Using 500 gpm solution spill rate the chlorine dioxide emission rate is 41.7 lb/min.  The release duration is assumed to be 30 minutes during which time the pump is shut off.  Under realistic weather conditions of 3.0 m/s wind speed and a wind stability class of \"D,\" the DEGADIS 2.1 estimated distance to the toxic endpoint concentration (3 ppm) is 1.4 miles.  The total population within the alternative release toxic endpoint circle is estimated to be 2,400 persons based on 1990 Census Data.

The Jackson Mill Environmental Manager serves as the RMP Manager and has the overall responsibility to oversee and implement the Risk Management Program.\n\n2.  Process / Chemical Safety Information\nComprehensive chemical data has been assembled to include regulatory reporting and action thresholds, health hazard and chemical exposure limitations, as well as detailed physical properties of each regulated substance. This information was compiled from numerous sources, and is intended to be a one-stop source for the reader seeking data on these substances. \nProcess Safety Information was meticulously compiled on both the chlorine and chlorine dioxide processes. Hard-to-find specifications on each process are collocated in one place for easy reference. Details such as Maximum Intended Inventory, Safe Upper and Lower Temperatures, Safe Upper and Lower Pressures, and codes and standards used to design, build and operate the processes are on file at the mill. \n\n3.  Process Hazard Analysis\nA Hazard Review was conducted for each regulated process. The team consisted of plant management, process operating and maintenance experts, process design engineers, and Boise Cascade employees knowledgeable in the Hazard Review process itself. The Hazard Review technique used was a Hazard and Operability Study (HAZOP), supplemented by completion of design checklists.\n\n4.  Operating Procedures\nStandard Operating Procedures have been developed, and stringently reviewed by Jackson Mill employees. They provide system descriptions, specifications, and operating procedures for the chlorine and chlorine dioxide systems. Procedures include Startup, Shutdown, Normal, Abnormal, and Emergency Operation. Also included are Maintenance and Troubleshooting Procedures.\n\n5.

Pre-startup Review\nBoise Cascade performs a safety review of a new or modified process before the process is placed into service to help ensure that the process has been prepared to operate safely.  A pre-startup review checklist is completed to document the review and to ensure that appropriate issues have been addressed.\n\n9.  Internal Compliance Audits\nInternal Compliance Audits are conducted every three years to verify compliance with the programs and procedures contained in the Accident Prevention Program. Boise Cascade assembles an audit team that includes personnel knowledgeable in the RMP rule and in the process, and this team evaluates whether the prevention program satisfies the requirements of the RMP rule and whether the prevention program is sufficient to help ensure safe operation of the process.  The results of the audit are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate enhancements to the prevention program are implemented.\n\n10.  Incident Investigation\nThe Jackson Mill investigates all incidents that could reasonably have resulted in a serious injury to personnel, the public, or the environment so that similar accidents can be prevented.  Boise Cascade trains employees to identify and report any incident requiring investigation.  An investigation team is assembled, and the investigation is initiated within 48 hours of the incident.  The results of the investigation are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate process enhancements are implemented.\n\n11.  Employee Participation\nBoise Cascade has developed a written employee participation program for covered processes to help ensure that the safety concerns of Boise Cascade workers are addressed.  The Jackson Mill encourages active participation of personnel in the prevention program activities of all processes at the facility.

Hot Work Permits\nBoise Cascade has established a hot work permit program to control spark or flame producing activities that could result in fires or explosions in covered processes at the facility.  Personnel who are to perform hot work are required to fill out the Hot Work Permit Form.  The Shift Supervisor reviews the completed form before work can begin.  Training in the use of the Hot Work Permit Form is included in the Jackson Mill safe work practices orientation.\n\n13.  Contractors\nBoise Cascade has established a program to help ensure that contractor activities at the mill are performed in a safe manner.  The Jackson Mill provides training to contractor supervisors on the hazards of the process on which they and their employees will work, and also informs the contractor supervisors of safe work practices and emergency response procedures.  The Jackson Mill requires that the contractor supervisors train each of their employees who will work in the mill before that worker begins work on site.  The Jackson Mill periodically reviews contractors' training documents and work performance to help ensure that safe work practices are followed.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\nThe Jackson Mill's five-year accident history includes one release of chlorine dioxide solution that occurred on August 14, 1997.   The release occurred while an employee was installing a patch on a leaking valve weephole.  A small amount of solution dripped down his arm inside his protective clothing.  The employee did not follow the proper procedures for reporting the incident to the mill medical department.  Six days after the exposure, the employee received medical treatment for chemical burns from the local hospital.
