Issues identified from the last PHA are addressed in the EcoElectrica Prevention Program.  Recommendations from the most recent PHA in December 2023 include the evaluation of further risk minimization options.  A Compliance Audit was conducted in December 2021 to verify the effectiveness of the program."

The zone of vulnerability for the alternative release scenario is determined to extend 0.2 miles from the anhydrous ammonia storage area.  No residents are located within a 0.2 miles radius of the anhydrous ammonia storage area.  \n\n1.4\tGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM \n\nEcoElectrica has implemented a Prevention Program for the safe use of anhydrous ammonia.  Operators, maintenance staff, and contractors are informed of anhydrous ammonia hazards, and hazard signs are posted in the anhydrous ammonia storage area.  Standard operating and maintenance procedures have been developed and employees who work with Anhydrous Ammonia are provided training.  \n\n1.5\tEMERGENCY RESPONSE \n\nEcoElectrica has an emergency plan to protect workers, the public, and the environment in the event of a major Anhydrous ammonia release.  EcoElectrica periodically conducts various training programs, including emergency action training.  EcoElectrica uses Process Hazards Analyses (PHAs) to identify and recommend changes to ensure a high level of safety.  Issues identified from PHA are then addressed in the EcoElectrica Prevention Program.  As part of the Emergency Action Plan, anhydrous ammonia gas detectors are located within the storage area for early detection and warning of any leak.  The emergency action plan includes response by EcoElectrica and local authorities.\n\nIn 2023, EcoEl\u00e9ctrica initiated the RMP Exercises Program. This program involves coordinating a Notification Exercise annually, Tabletop Exercises every 3 years, and Field Exercises every 5 years in collaboration with emergency response agencies. In October 2023, a Anhydrous ammonia Public Awareness was conducted, with the participation of the local and state response agencies.\n\n1.6"

      "SummaryText": "1.1      GENERAL INFORMATION\n\nEcoElectrica, L.P. owns and operates a Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) marine unloading and storage terminal and a 545 MW combined cycle power plant.  The facility is located in the Municipality of Penuelas, Puerto Rico.  The facility produces and sell electric power to the Puerto Rico electrical grid operator and supply natural gas to the Costa Sur Power Plant.\n\nEcoElectrica uses anhydrous ammonia for the control of NOx emissions generated during the combustion process for power generation.  Anhydrous ammonia is stored within EcoElectrica premises.  EcoElectrica is subject to the Program 3 requirements of the rule and for that, it has developed a Risk Management Program for anhydrous ammonia in order to comply with the requirements of the OSHA rule (29 CFR 1910.119) and the RMP rule (40 CFR Part 68).  This determination was made through an off-site consequence analysis.\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia is delivered to EcoElectrica through tank trucks with an average capacity of 25,000 pounds per delivery. The material is transferred into a 15,000-gallon pressurized storage tank. A maximum of 75,158 pounds of anhydrous ammonia can be stored at all times.\n\n1.2\tACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY ACTION POLICIES\n\nIt is EcoElectrica's policy to comply with all applicable Federal and State regulations and to protect the environment, human health, wildlife, natural and historical resources that could be impacted by the company's operations. All personnel, suppliers, contractors, visitors and other stakeholders must abide this policy while conducting activities at the facility. \n\n1.3\tWORST CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nThe worst-case release scenario  for anhydrous ammonia is assumed to be the release of the entire contents of the storage tank over a period of 10 minutes due to a tank rupture.  The largest amount of anhydrous ammonia in the tank at any given time is 75,158 pounds.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for anhydrous ammonia is"
