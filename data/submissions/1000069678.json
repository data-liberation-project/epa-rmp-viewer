      "SummaryText": "hills create many obstacles for air movement.  Wind from the east would stay at a much higher elevation and allow any release of ammonia to rise and dissipate into the atmosphere.  Wind from the west would move any ammonia released up the steep hillside and into the atmosphere.  Winds from the north or south would move ammonia into the rolling hills and upward into the atmosphere.  There is a small risk of ammonia entering the river.  However, if ammonia did reach the river it would be diluted and swept away quickly.  The level of the river is controlled by Wells Dam to the north, and Rocky Reach Dam to the south.  The quantity of water moving past the facility will never be low enough that any released ammonia would be detectable or a danger to the public or the environment.  In this are the water is flowing at 82,200 cuft/sec.\r\n\r\nThis facility uses other hazardous substances on-site, however they do not meet or exceed the threshold limits established in 40 CFR 68.130.  \r\n\r\nThere have been no accidents involving ammonia in the last five years. \r\n\r\nTraining on ammonia safety and detailed mechanical integrity are a major ongoing process at Chelan Fruit Cooperative Beebe Plant.  Review and update of the emergency plan is done annually.  Drills and emergency evacuation practices are executed semi-annually.  Training will be required for all employees who work around the ammonia system, including forklift personnel.  \r\n\r\nT"

Chelan Fruit Cooperative complies with OSHA and WA State process safety management rules and regulations, WA state safety regulations, and IIAR standards for good work practices.  \r\n\r\nThe ammonia refrigeration system was installed to standards and local codes at the time of installation.  Piping and equipment are secured and protected, engine room doors are tight fitting and open outwards. Other safety systems used include:\r\n* Computerized controls, which can be operated remotely\r\n* Suction trap hi-level float\r\n* High discharge pressure shut down\r\n* Low suction pressure shut down\r\n* High discharge temperature shut down\r\n* Oil pressure failure shut down\r\n* High amperes shut down\r\n* Automatic timer to prevent short cycling via computer controls\r\n* Oil filters plugged shut down\r\n* 250 psi relief valves on high pressure side, to prevent overpressure situations\r\n* 150 psi relief valves on low pressure side, to prevent overpressure situations\r\n\r\nAnhydrous Ammonia is used on-site in a closed system as a refrigerant. Ammonia is considered hazardous by EPA and is listed on the Extremely Hazardous Substance list. There is approximately 24,400 pounds of anhydrous ammonia in the plant. Chemical properties of ammonia make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling ammonia in order to:\r\n* Prevent unnecessary human exposure\r\n* Reduce the threat to our personnel\r\n* Reduce the threat to the community\r\n* Reduce the threat to the environment\r\n\r\nThe facility is bordered on the west side by McNeil Canyon Road with the Columbia River running adjacent.  On the east side a steep hillside runs the full length of the plant.  On the north and south, rolling"
