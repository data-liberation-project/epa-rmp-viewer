      "SummaryText": "The Worthington Cylinders Kansas, LLC (Worthington) facility is located at 5605 North 119th Street; Maize, Kansas. There are three propane tanks, each with a maximum capacity of 30,000 gallons, located on site. Propane is listed as a flammable substances under the Risk Management Plan regulations found at 40 CFR 68 and is managed as a Program Level 3 facility. The storage quantities of propane is in excess of the threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds. It is necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling propane to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to the personal health of Worthington employees as well as to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community. It is Worthington's policy to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.  Worthington handles propane in a safe manner utilizing:\n\n  - Facility design\n\n  - Safety equipment and devices\n\n  - Safe handling procedures, and\n\n  - Personnel training\n\n\n\nIn the previous five years, there have been no propane releases that have resulted in any on-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage; or that resulted in any offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or shelterings in place.  \n\n\n\nAn Emergency Response and Contingency Plan has been developed for this facility.  The plan includes procedures for notification of the local fire authority and evacuation of facility employees.  Worthington relies on the local emergency planning committee (LEPC) and fire department (FD) to respond to an accidental release of propane.  This response effort has been coordinated and verified by the LEPC.  The FD also coordinates emergency response and fire fighting measures with the facility. \n\n\n\nThe facility practices a program of continued improvement for safety and environmental compliance. These practices and procedures are reviewed, and recommended changes are implemented to improve safety and environmental compliance."
