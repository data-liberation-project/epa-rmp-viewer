This natural gas liquid extraction processing and liquified petroleum gas handling and storage facility is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with NFPA-58 and state law utilizing ASME, ANSI, and API codes and guidance.  This facility has in place an active SPCC plan developed in accordance with 40 CFR 112.7.\n\nFive year accident history:  In the past five years County Line Gas Plant has not experienced an incident involving LP-Gas mixture and liquified petroleum gas that caused deaths, injury, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place.\n\nThe emergency response program:  In the event of an emergency involving our natural gas liquid extraction LP-Gas handling and storage facility system, it is our policy to notify the Excel Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.  We have discussed this policy with the Conecuh County Emergency Response manager and he has inspected our facility.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety:  None"

Employees who enter this unmanned facility and are responsible for storage and handling of regulated materials are required by company policy to complete extensive training, both classroom and on-the-job, before being allowed to perform sensitive operations.  This involves operational, emergency operational, and release prevention training.  Employees also receive periodic refresher training to maintain skills and awareness.  If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the Excel Fire Department (334-765-2810) first followed by notification to the Range Fire Department (334-248-2560) and request that they respond to the emergency.\n\nA facility description and the regulated products handled:  County Line Gas Plant is an unmanned natural gas liquid extraction LP-Gas processing facility with LP-Gas mixture and LP-Gas storage and sales to wholesale markets.  25,000 gallon and 12,000 gallon LP-Gas mixture storage tanks and a 1,000 gallon propane storage tank with their associated piping, valves, etc. are on site.  Propane and the NFPA-4 LP-Gas mixture are the regulated substances handled as part of the LP-Gas storage and sales process.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario(s) and the alternative release scenario(s):  Our worst-case scenario is failure of a 25,000 gallon LP-Gas mixture storage tank when filled with the greatest amount allowed (88 % at 60 degrees F), resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  There will be off-site consequences.  This incident carries a very low degree of probability compared to other more probable incidents.\n\nOur alternative release scenario involves a pipe on the discharge of the pump breaking during the loading process resulting in 11,000 lbs of NFPA-4 LP-Gas mix"
