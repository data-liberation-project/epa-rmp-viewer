This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, operation and maintenance of the facility's processes.\n\nThis facility uses anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant.  Anhydrous ammonia is considered hazardous by the EPA.  It is Club Chef LLC policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State rules and regulations regarding hazardous materials, particularly anhydrous ammonia.  We have implemented reasonable controls to prevent a foreseeable release of ammonia.\n\nIf an accidental release should occur, Club Chef LLC has trained personnel that will respond to control and contain the release.  We have also coordinated with the Hamilton County Local Emergency Planning Committee and Cincinnati Fire Department through annual filing of Sara Title III.  The Emergency Response Plan has provisions to notify these agencies should an incident occur that may affect the public.\n\nStationary Sources and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nClub Chef LLC is a food processing plant for fresh cut produce.  Our process requires us to maintain an average plant temperature of 34 to38 degrees Fahrenheit. Anhydrous ammonia is the refrigerant used to maintain these low temperatures.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is only used as a refrigerant.  Ammonia is the refrigerant of choice due to its low cost, efficiency and environmentally friendly make up.  The ammonia is housed within a closed loop system that removes heat from the interior of the facility at low temperatures and pressures.  Heat is then dispersed at high pressures and temperatures to the outside atmosphere.\n\nThe refrigeration system at Club Chef LLC contains approximately 16,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  The refrigeration operation is a closed system with no pu"

There has been no accidental release of ammonia in the past five years that have resulted in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\nRelease prevention program and Prevention Steps\n\nThe accidental release program established by Club Chef LLC is in compliance with The EPA, RMP, EPCRA and OSHA PSM.  Our program includes detection alarms, ventilation systems, trained technicians who perform routine equipment checks, and a trained Emergency Response Team.  The ERT has safety equipment readily accessible to respond to an accidental release.  The safety equipment includes air monitoring units (specifically for ammonia) personal protective equipment and self contained breathing apparatus.  The Hamilton County LEPC and Cincinnati Fire Department are aware that our facility houses anhydrous ammonia.  In the event of a catastrophic release of ammonia, plans with the Hamilton County LEPC and the Cincinnati Fire Department have been implemented for evacuation of any affected area.\n\nEmergency Response Plan\n\nClub Chef LLC has an emergency response plan to deal with emergencies that occur on site.  We have our own Emergency Response Team to handle an ammonia release.  Everyone on the team has been trained at a minimum;  24 hour HAZMAT Technician level or 40 hour HAZMAT Incident Command level.  The Emergency Response Team is re-certified every year per OSHA regulations.  The team also conducts drills to maintain effectiveness.  We have coordinated with the Hamilton County LEPC and Cincinnati Fire Department through EPCRA and SARA Title III reporting requirements."
