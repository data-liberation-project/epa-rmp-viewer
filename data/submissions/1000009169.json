      "SummaryText": "\nThe Airgas facility in Theodore, Alabama is owned and operated by Airgas South. The Facility is a chemical distribution plant, which stores, sells, and repackages industrial gases.  \n\nThe Airgas facility operates from 4:00am to 8:30pm, Monday through Friday.  The facility is secured with chain link fencing and yard lights and is staffed with 66 full time employees.  \n\nIn accordance with the EPA's RMP regulations (40 CFR Part 68), the facilityA?s inventory of chemicals was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances were found to be stored in quantities above the EPA threshold quantities .  Based on the facility inventory, the following listed flammable substances are stored by the Facility in quantities above the substance's EPA threshold quantity: \n\nAcetylene gas (CAS # 74-86-2)\nPropane gas (CAS # 74-98-6)\n\nAcetylene is stored at the facility in pressurized cylinders of various sizes, the largest being the 24-pound cylinders.  The maximum amount of acetylene on site at any one time is 60,000 pounds. Propane is stored at the facility in two 1,000-gallon vessels (4,230 pounds of propane gas per vessel) and in various smaller cylinders.  The maximum amount of propane on site at any one time is 12,000 pounds.  The two 1,000-gallon tanks are used to fill smaller propane cylinders for sale/distribution to customers.\n\nThe EPA requires that the facility identify, analyze and report one-worst case scenario and one alternative-case scenario representing all flammable substances held above the applicable threshold quantities.  The worst-case scenario is defined as the release of a substance which results in the greatest release to endpoint (i.e. the release of the entire contents of the largest vessel in the process, followed by a vapor cloud explosion).  For the alternative case scenario, a more realistic and generally lower amount of the substance can be assumed to be released than that considered for the worst-case scenario.  EPA-approved dispers"

      "SummaryText": "ion model, RMP*Comp, was used to estimate the end point distances for both scenarios.\n\nA worst-case release, as defined in the RMP regulations, is a release of the entire contents of the largest vessel in the process, followed by a vapor cloud explosion.  The worst-case release amount for the Theodore plant is therefore, 4,230 lbs of propane, which is the amount of flammable substance in the largest vessel.  EPAA?s RMP*Comp was used to calculate the distance to 1 psi overpressure for a vapor cloud explosion involving 4,230 lbs of propane.  This scenario represents all flammable substances on site, as described above.  \n\nIn consultation with Theodore plant personnel and AirgasA? Safety Director, a leak in a 33-pound propane cylinder resulting from the age and fatigue of the valve apparatus was chosen as the most likely alternative-case scenario.  For determination of the endpoint distance, it was assumed that the released propane would detonate in a vapor cloud explosion.  Similar to the worst-case scenario, EPAA?s RMP*Comp was used to determine the release rate based on vessel parameters, and the release duration was assumed to be approximately one (1) minute.  This scenario also represents all flammable substances on site.\n\nAirgas South has developed and implemented a Program 3 Risk Management Plan for the above identified processes, as described in this Submittal.  All documents pertaining to the RMP are kept on-site and updated as required.   \n\n\n  \n"
