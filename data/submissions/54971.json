Facility accidental release and emergency response policy.\n\nThe management and employees of Stephenson Service Company are committed to the \nprevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental \nrelease should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Stockton Fire Department, JoDaviess County Local Emergency Planning Committeet, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact \nof the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. The stationary source and the regulated substances handled.\n\nThe primary activity at this facility, which is located at 1859 IL Rt 78 North, is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.  The storage and handling system consists of two 18,000 gallon storage tanks, loading risers, associated plumbing and nurse tanks.  Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.\n\nThe maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia that can be stored would be \n530,000  pounds. this includes the amount of anhydrous ammonia that could be stored in nurse tanks.\n\n3. The worst-case release scenario and the alternate release scenario. \n\nThis facility has developed a worst-case and alternative-case scenario, however, since this is\nsecurity-sensitive information it has been withheld from this Executive Summary as required by\nEPA regulations.\n\n\n4. The accidental release prevention program.\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all \napplicable state codes and regulations.  This facility has implemented the provisions \nof Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-\n61.1, published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc. as adopted \nby state regulation and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health \nAdminis"

Compliance with these regulations and on-going training of our employees make up our accident release prevention program.  \n\n5. Five year accident history.  \n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years \nthat:\n- have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the \nfacility; nor\n- to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, shelter \nin place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6. The emergency response program.\n\nThe facility has:\n- a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR \n1910.38;\n- provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).                                                                \nIn the event of an emergency involving anhydrous ammonia, it is our policy to notify the Stockton Fire Department and JoDaviess County LEPC and request that they respond to the emergency.  Our emergency action plans have been coordinated with both the fire department and LEPC.\n                                                                                                                                                                                           7.
