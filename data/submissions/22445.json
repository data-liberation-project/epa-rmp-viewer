This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, we are completely coordinated with Jacksonville FIRE DEPARTMENT which provides highly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\n\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Distribution of chemical products.  We have 3 regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include Chlorine, Aqua Ammonia and Sulfur Dioxide (anhydrous). The Sulfur Dioxide, Aqua Ammonia and Chlorine are received prepackaged in different size containers.  Chlorine, Aqua Ammonia and Sulfur Dioxide are used only for resell to our customers.\n\nThe maximum inventory of Chlorine at our facility is 57,400 lbs. while Sulfur dioxide (anhydrous) is 28,700 lbs and Aqua Ammonia is 21,375lbs.\n\n\n3.\tThe Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\nTo evaluate the worst case scenarios and alternative release scenarios, we have used the look-up tables and equations provided by the EPA in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance as well as SAFER/TRACE.
