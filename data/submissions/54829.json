These programs include both Dow's Responsible Care requirements and governmental requirements, such as EPA?s RMP rule and the CalARP RMP requirements.\nDESCRIPTION OF THE FACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES \nDow?s UES facility, located in Torrance, California, operates a latex emulsion manufacturing facility that produces more than 100 million pounds of latex per year.  The water-borne latex produced at this site is utilized by the coatings industry to make latex-based paints, caulks, adhesives, and sealants.  The facility is recognized as a covered source under the RMP rule as the facility maintains quantities of regulated substances listed in the RMP rule above the applicable thresholds.  The UES facility does not maintain specified quantities of any RMP regulated flammable substances, but does utilize the following RMP regulated toxic substances at levels above threshold limits: \n* Vinyl Acetate monomer (VAM) (acetic acid ethenyl ester, CAS 107-13-1)\nThe facility no long uses acrylonitrile (2-propenenitrile, CAS 108-05-4).  The former acrylonitrile storage tank is used for the storage of vinyl versate, a substance not regulated RMP in the program.  The revisions to the RMP addressed in this 5-year update address the elimination of acrylonitrile as a regulated substance at the facility.\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT\nRMP regulations require that each facility identify worst-case and alternative release scenarios.  EPA has defined a worst-case release as the release of the entire contents of the largest vessel that contains a regulated substance in a 10-minute period.  EPA defines alternative release scenarios as scenarios that are more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario, and that reach an endpoint offsite, unless no such scenario exists.  One or more alternative release scenarios are evaluated to define the distance to the specified endpoint.  Unless otherwise specified, no credit was taken for administrative controls or active miti"

(Version 1.07) released by EPA.  RMP*Comp? is an electronic tool to make the same calculations performed manually by following the procedures described in EPA?s guidance document, RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance (April, 1999).  \nWorst-Case Release Scenarios\nVAM is not stored at the UES facility but rather is fed by pipeline on an as-needed basis for batch processing during the manufacturing of latex.  Monomer mix tank number 4 (MMT-4) can hold the largest quantity of VAM, 4,500 gallons.  The monomer mixing area is surrounded by a small dike sufficient to contain the contents of a spill of the maximum amount of VAM on-site in a monomer mixing tank.  The dike dimensions are approximately 50 feet by 50 feet by 4 inches deep.   \nThe worst-case release of VAM assumes the catastrophic failure of MMT-4.  The worst-case meteorological conditions defined by EPA for the worst-case release are a wind speed of 1.5 meters per second (m/s) and a stability class of F (very stable).  For VAM, the worst-case distance to the threshold concentration of 0.26 mg/l is 0.7 miles (1,100 meters).\nAlternative-Release Scenarios\nTwo alternative release scenarios for VAM were assessed.  VAM alternative scenario #1 consists of an unconfined release from the three-inch pipeline from the Dow Torrance Distribution Terminal to the monomer mix tank area.  The distance to the threshold concentration of 0.26 mg/l is 0.2 miles (300 meters) for VAM alternative scenario #1.  VAM alternative scenario #2 assumes an open ?-inch drain valve on the discharge side of a pump while transferring VAM to an intermediate mix tank.  The distance to the threshold for VAM alternative scenario 2 is approximately 0.2 miles (300 meters).\nA total of 7,100 persons in 2,650 households reside within the VAM worst-case impact distance, "

Other potential receptors include industrial facilities and major commercial facilities.  For the alternative impact distance of 0.2 miles, there are no sensitive receptors.  The estimated population potentially effected by the alternative release scenario is an estimated 100 persons.  \nMitigation\nThe specific systems to prevent the worst-case and alternative release scenarios of VAM from occurring, as well as mitigate their effects should they occur, include: \n* Emergency Shutdown Systems: A manual emergency shutdown system is designed to shutdown the pumps and put the transfer valves in a fail-safe position. \n* Surveillance: Operations personnel routinely monitor the process and facility perimeters two times per shift.  The facility operates four 12-hour shifts per day, seven days per week. \nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM \nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at Dow?s UES facility in Torrance, California.  Dow?s general accident prevention program consists of compliance with the EPA and CalARP regulations as well as implementation of Dow's Loss Prevention Principles and Episodic Risk Management System.  UES?s general accident prevention program consists of compliance with the following rules:\n* California Code of Regulations, Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5, Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program\n* 40 CFR Part 68, Accidental Release Prevention (RMP rule)\n* 40 CFR Part 112, Oil Pollution Prevention (Spill Prevention, Control and Countermeasure)\n* 40 CFR Part 264, Hazardous Waste Contingency Plan\n* 40 CFR Part 355, Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA)\nThe following is a brief outline of the general accident prevention program in place at UES portion of the facility.\nCompliance Audits\nIn accordance with Section 2760.8 of the CalARP regulations,"

      "SummaryText": " a three-year compliance audit was conducted by an outside environmental contractor, AECOM Environment, using a modified EPA RMP audit protocol.  The audit findings noted the following deficiency:\n* The OCA required revision because the facility eliminated the use and storage of acrylonitrile. \nThis deficiency has been addressed in this RMP Update.  To help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, Dow periodically conducts corporate and plant-led audits to ensure that process operations comply with governmental and Dow requirements.\nContractor Safety Program \nDow uses contractors to supplement its? work force during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities. During procurement of contractor services, the purchasing procedures require the verification of training and if applicable, certifications and licenses. Prior to initiating work at the facility, contractors are required to attend a safety briefing, which is documented and retained. Some contractors are required to work on or near process equipment; therefore, the facility has established procedures to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform facility personnel of any hazards that are found during their work. At least one Dow employee is assigned to each contractor. The Dow employee is responsible for checking the work of each contractor to ensure Dow procedures are followed. \nEmployee Participation \nDow encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Dow engages its employees through formal and informal means.

At the beginning of each shift, a Shift Concerns Meeting is conducted to discuss issues and concerns covering all aspects of the employee?s work. Employees have access either through Dow?s intranet site or on-site library to information created as part of the facility accident prevention program. Employees are encouraged to participate in the accident prevention program. The plan is documented and maintained on Dow?s intranet site and on-site library. In addition, employees are involved in other aspects of the operation including, but not limited to, periodic inspections, operating procedure creation, and incident investigations.\nEpisodic Risk Management System \nPeriodic reviews are conducted to identify hazards that could have significant community impact and to recommend corrective action(s) needed to prevent their occurrence.  These reviews utilize advanced quantitative risk assessment techniques. \nEquipment Design \nVessels (including shipping containers) and other process equipment are designed according to recognized industry standards and/or governmental requirements. \nIncident Investigation \nDow promptly investigates all incidents that result in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury. The goal of each investigation is to determine the root cause of the incident by reviewing facts and developing corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The production leader is responsible for incident investigations at the facility.

This is an electronic workflow process located on Dow?s Intranet site. The management of change requests are controlled and tracked to completion. This process requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before implementation. Specifically, the change is only initiated after each employee (reviewer or Acknowledger) has acknowledged his/her review and approval on the proposed change. At this point, the facility is authorized to move forward with implementation of the change. \nMechanical Integrity \nDow has well-established practices and procedures to maintain tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps, transfer hoses, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition. The basic aspects of this program include: (1) developing written procedures, (2) conducting training, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures.  A preventative maintenance system (GEMTS) is used to track work orders, calibration schedules, testing and certification schedules, and completion of all the above. In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the facility?s process equipment. \nOperating Procedures \nDow maintains written procedures that provide detail on how to safely operate a process, including various modes of process operations, such as unit startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, normal shutdown, and initial startup of a new process.

The procedures are maintained up-to-date by revising them as necessary. \nOperational Safety Program \nDow has a comprehensive program to ensure that all the elements listed within this accidental release prevention program are implemented at every Dow location.  This program includes accountabilities for timely and proper implementation of the program elements. \nLoss Prevention Principles \nDesign requirements for active and passive mitigation controls used to prevent major process hazards are documented in Loss Prevention Principles (LPP). \nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs) \nDow conducts reviews just prior to startup to ensure that new and modified facilities and processes are safe for operation.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves as a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented. \nProcess Hazard Analysis\nDow conducted an internal audit of UES on March 24 and 25, 2009.  A PHA was conducted during the audit using Dow?s proprietary ?Reactive Chemical Process Hazard Analysis? (RCPHA).  The principal staff performing the RCPHA was Marco Barrueta (Production Leader), Erwin Morfe (Run Plant Engineer), Ronald Weber (Plant EHS/Training), and Yin Ko (Plant Improvement/Projects).  This RCPHA audit is an update to the PHA/Hazard Operability Study (HazOp) performed for the original Risk Management Prevention Program (RMPP) plan and the RMP.  \nThe RCPHA methodology consists of a checklist designed by Dow for use in internal reactive chemical and PHA audits.  For each question in the checklist, there are columns for a yes/no/not applicable response, a response column, columns to check the work discipline affected, and an action item column.  In addition to the RCPHA questionnaire, there is a second questionnaire that is used for field validation to be used in conjunction with the RCPHA.\nThere have been no significant changes to the VAM proce"

The acrylonitrile process was removed and no acrylonitrile is stored on the property.\nAs part of the RMP Update, the RCPHA developed during the March 2009 audit was reviewed by AECOM for completeness and applicability. There were no significant findings identified during the RCPHA or during AECOM?s review of the RCPHA.  All RCPHA audit action items were entered into Dow?s Event and Action Tool (i.e., database) and each item was assigned for follow-up.\n\nExternal Events Analysis\nThe 1999 RMPP seismic assessment of the facility estimated the seismic vulnerability of vessels, piping, and associated equipment and structures containing regulated substances (i.e. acrylonitrile and VAM).  In addition, vessels not containing regulated substances but which could impact vessels or piping containing regulated substances during a large earthquake were also evaluated.  The 1999 RMPP seismic review was performed according to the requirements in the 1998 Guidance for CalARP Seismic Assessment.  [The 1998 guidance is the current version of the guidance.]  AECOM reviewed the seismic assessment portion of the RMPP seismic assessment conducted in December 1995, the October 1999 seismic update for the facility, and ENSR?s Review of CalARP Seismic Assessment and Walkthrough Findings for UES conducted in December 2003.  After the review, AECOM conducted a walkthrough at UES to confirm whether recommended modifications had been completed.\nBased on AECOM?s review of the recommendations provided in the 1999 seismic assessment, the 2003 seismic update, and a walkthrough of the facility, it appears that the modifications recommended in those assessments have been adequately implemented.  No additional areas of concern were identified during AECOM's walkthrough.  \nProcess Safety Information \nDow keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the process.

For specific process areas, the facility has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, pressure and level control) in the LPP documents.  The facility ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, automated operating systems, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems). \nThe facility maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a means for establishing inspection and maintenance activities. \nSafe Work Practices \nDow has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.  Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous materials before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a hot work permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities, and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.  These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely. \nTraining/Certification Programs \nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, Dow has implemented a comprehensive training and certification program for all employees involved in operating a process.

In addition, trained technical staff is available 24 hours a day to support operations. \nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY \nIn the last five years there has not been an accident or incident involving a release of VAM from affected systems at the facility that resulted in an on-site death, injury, or property damage; or a known off-site death, injury, evacuation, shelter-in-place, property damage or environmental damage. \nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION \nThe UES facility maintains a written emergency response program to protect worker and public safety, as well as the environment.  The program consists of procedures for responding to releases of hazardous substances, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including: \n* Proper first-aid and medical treatment for exposures, \n* Evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation,\n* Notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, \n* Post-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements (if a release occurs), and \n* Inspecting, testing, maintaining, and using emergency response equipment. \nThe emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to facility processes.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties. \nThe overall emergency response program for Dow in Torrance is coordinated with the Torrance Fire Department and the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  Dow conducts periodic emergency drills that involve the appropriate emergency response organizations. \nIn addition, Dow's Hazardous Emergency Leaks Prevention (HELP) team located in Torrance responds to accidental releases from trans"
