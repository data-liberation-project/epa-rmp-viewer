The SBWWT plant continuously operates a SCADA system, which includes gas sensors for both chlorine and sulfur dioxide, automatic gas shutoffs and an alarm system.\n2.    The SCADA system is tested daily and calibrated (at a minimum) biannually.\n3.    Operating procedures for the chlorine and sulfur dioxide systems are contained in their entirety in an appendix to the Process Safety Management (PSM) plan.  These procedures (which have been implemented to preclude the accidental release of gas) include, but are not limited to, the following:\nA?    Incoming inspection procedures\nA?    Requirement that gas containers may only be moved with valve outlet caps and bonnet covers\nA?    A minimum of two employees must be present when working with chlorine or sulfur dioxide\nA?    Tank changing procedures\nA?    Shutdown procedures\n\nNOTE:  No chemical-specific prevention steps are in place for Chlorine nor for Sulfur Dioxide.  Release prevention steps are identical for both gases.\n\nThe SBWWT plant is in compliance with the OSHA PSM rule and 40 CFR 68.\n\nFive-year accident history:  the SBWWT plant has had no accidents in the last five years.\n\nEmergency response program:  the SBWWT plant has a current program expressed in its EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROCEDURES, last modified January, 2010.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety:  there are no changes proposed as of June, 2010.\n"
