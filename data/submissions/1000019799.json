Copies of these documents are maintained by Kim Thompson, Environmental Compliance Manager.\n\nPrimary activity and substances regulated under 40 CFR 68 are:\nA?    The primary activity at the SBWWT is treatment of municipal waste water.\nA?    Substances used at SBWWT which are listed at 40 CFR 68.130 are chlorine and sulfur dioxide, which are used in the treatment of waste water\nA?    The quantity of chlorine handled is (maximum) 4,000 pounds, with 20,000 pounds stored.  The quantity of sulfur dioxide handled is 4,000 pounds, with 20,000 pounds stored.\n\nRELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nWorst-case Release Scenario:  Chlorine\n1.    Physical State:  Gas\n2.    Scenario Result is based on EPA's RMP Guidance for Waste Water Treatment Plants Reference Tables or Equations.\n3.    Scenario is \"Vessel Leak\"\n4.    Quantity Released:  2,000 pounds\n5.    Release Rate:  200 pounds per minute\n\nAlternative Release Scenario:  Chlorine\n1.    Physical State:  Gas\n2.

      "SummaryText": "ention program:\n\n1.    The SBWWT plant continuously operates a SCADA system, which includes gas sensors for both chlorine and sulfur dioxide, automatic gas shutoffs and an alarm system.\n2.    The SCADA system is tested daily and calibrated (at a minimum) biannually.\n3.    Operating procedures for the chlorine and sulfur dioxide systems are contained in their entirety in an appendix to the Process Safety Management (PSM) plan.  These procedures (which have been implemented to preclude the accidental release of gas) include, but are not limited to, the following:\nA?    Incoming inspection procedures\nA?    Requirement that gas containers may only be moved with valve outlet caps and bonnet covers\nA?    A minimum of two employees must be present when working with chlorine or sulfur dioxide\nA?    Tank changing procedures\nA?    Shutdown procedures\n\nNOTE:  No chemical-specific prevention steps are in place for Chlorine nor for Sulfur Dioxide.  Release prevention steps are identical for both gases.\n\nThe SBWWT plant is in compliance with the OSHA PSM rule and 40 CFR 68.\n\nFive-year accident history:  the SBWWT plant has had no accidents in the last five years.\n\nEmergency response program:  the SBWWT plant has a current program expressed in its EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROCEDURES, last modified January, 2010.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety:  there are no changes proposed as of June, 2010.\n"
