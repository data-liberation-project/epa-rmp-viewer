The plant\n\nconsists of raw water intake pumps, settling basins, duel\n\nmedia filters, a chlorination system for disinfection, a\n\nclearwell and distribution pumps.  The plant began\n\noperations in 1948 and was expanded in 1973.  The facility\n\nis leased by Newton County and operated by the City of\n\nCovington.\n\n\n\nChemical Safety\n\nThe City of Covington complies with the Hazardous\n\nCommunications standard set forth by the Occupational Safety\n\nand Health Administration, Compliance is accomplished by\n\ncompiling a hazardous chemical list, using Material Safety\n\nData Sheets (MSDS's), ensuring that containers are labeled,\n\nand providing employee training.  The purpose of the program\n\nis to alert and educate employees about chemicals in the\n\nworkplace by giving them greater access to information on\n\nthe physical and health hazards of chemicals, safe handling\n\nand storage precautions and emergency first aid procedures.\n\nIt applies to all employees who may be exposed to hazardous\n\nsubstances during the scope of their employment.\n\n\n\nThe Safety/Risk Manager has overall responsibility for the\n\nprogram and provides reviews and updates as needed.  Copies\n\nof the written program can be obtained from the Safety/Risk\n\nManager.  Each department head maintains a list of all\n\nhazardous chemicals used by their departments.  These lists\n\nare updated as necessary.  Each foreman or employee in\n\ncharge has available a list of chemicals.\n\nMaterial Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) provide specific\n\ninformation on chemicals used.  Each department head\n\nmaintains a binder containing all MSDS for every chemical\n\nsubstance used by employees in their department.  A binder\n\ncontaining all MSDS on every chemical substance purchased\n\nand used by the City is available to all employees.  Aside\n\nfrom the main MSDS binder, department heads make their MSDS\n\nbinder available and accessi"

It should be noted that LandView III uses 1990 census\n\ndata and the current population will most likely be greater\n\nthan indicated. Current, population data provided on the\n\nCensus Bureau website was used to verify the estimated\n\npopulation from the 1999 report was sufficient for this\n\nreport and represented the current population estimates.\n\n\n\nThe worst case release scenario is the failure of a one-ton\n\ncylinder, yielding a release of 2,000 lbs of chlorine to the\n\natmosphere over a period of 10 minutes.  Using the EPA\n\ntables, the distance to the endpoint for urban conditions is\n\n1.3 miles.\n\n\n\nThe alternative or more likely release scenario is a leak in\n\none of the ton vessels.  For this analysis it has been\n\nassumed chlorine will be released through a ? in. diameter\n\nhole.  Exhibit 4-13 in the EPA Guidance Document indicates a\n\nrelease rate of 150lbs/min and a distance to the endpoint of\n\n0.2 miles for urban conditions.\n\n\n\nAccident Release Prevention Program\n\nActive environmental, health and safety programs with\n\nregards to the safe handling of chlorine and chlorination\n\nequipment are in place at the plant.  The following are\n\nexcerpts from the City of Covington's Safety Policies and\n\nProcedures Manual Handling:\n\nu    All operators are trained in safe handling of chlorine.\n\nu    A self-contained breathing apparatus must be used, when\n\nconnecting or disconnecting chlorine cylinders.  Self-\n\ncontained breathing equipment is available wherever gas or\n\nliquid chlorine is in use.  These units are approved by the\n\nNational Institute of Occupational Safety and Health\n\n(NIOSH).\n\nu    The two-man rule is used for all connecting and\n\ndisconnecting of chlorine cylinders"
