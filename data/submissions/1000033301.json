      "SummaryText": "The objective of this Risk Management Plan (RMP) is to help to prevent accidental releases of hazardous substances that can cause harm to the public and the environment and to mitigate the severity of such a release, should that occur. This RMP is intended to work in synergy with the facility's Emergency Response Plan prepared for this operation, and maintain a liaison with the local emergency responders.\r\n\r\nThe Tyler County Gas Plant (TGP) is located 1681 County Road 3000, Woodville, Tyler County, Texas.  This facility is located at the global position of 30.81005\u00ba N and -94.4087\u00ba W, WGD84 datum.  Enterprise Products purchased the facility from Marlin Midstream, LLC and assumed control of the Tyler County Gas Plant on May 1, 2017, the facility was out of service at the time of the purchase.\r\n\r\nThe plant processes natural gas from various oil and gas production facilities in the vicinity.  The acid gas components (carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide) are removed from the gas using an amine unit. The sweetened gas is then dried using a glycol dehydrator.  The gas is further dried in molecular sieve dehydrators.  The dried gas is then routed to a cryogenic skid, in which the gas is expanded from higher pressure to  lower pressure causing the natural gas liquids (NGL) to separate from the gas stream.  The NGLs are pumped into the NGL product pipeline. \r\n \r\nThe cryogenic skid contains a 14,687 gal pressurized steel tank for product (NGL) storage.  The components of NGL (ethane, propane, butane, iso-butane and pentane) are classified as regulated flammable substances and are present in the product in an amount greater than the threshold quantity of 10,000 lbs.  Less than 10,000 lbs of hydrogen sulfide is present in the inlet gas, and thus not included in this RMP review.\r\n\r\nThe TGP is qualified in the Level 3 Program for risk management.  The worst-case scenario for plant release is identified as a gas vapor cloud explosion (VCE), and is projected to reach offsite recept"

The alternate release scenario is determined to be a BLEVE (Boiling Liquid, Expanding Vapor Explosion) with an end point at 0.2 miles from the source.  Other alternate release scenario's include; Relief Valve failure, Pump Seal failure and/or Piping and Valve component failures.\r\n\r\nThe processes at the plant are regulated by the EPA's Risk Management Program regulations as well as OSHA's PSM Standards. The plant's Process Hazard Analysis team has conducted a process hazard analysis using the WHAT IF/CHECKLIST method.  This RMP and the PSM programs ensure safe operations at the TGP."
