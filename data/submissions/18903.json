The facility Policy\n    \n    The owners, management, and employees of Bellaire Elevator are committed to the\nprevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  if an accidental release\nshould occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire company, or other\nauthorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and\nthe environment.\n\n2.  Facility Information\n\n    -The primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale\nto farmers.\n\n    -Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for both direct\napplication and for blending into mixed-grade fertilizers for crop production.\n\n    -The maximum quantity stored would be 144458 pounds in our\nthree - 11000 gallon storage tanks.  The maximum quantity handled\nwould be the unloading of a tractor trailer holding 48,000 pounds.\n\n3.  The worst - case release scenario and the alternative release scenario.\n  \n    a.  The worst - case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of\nstorage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be\n484153 pounds, which represents the volume of the storage tank at 85 percent\ncapacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion\nto 200 ppm) is 4.0 miles.\n\n    b.  The alternative release scenario based on the five-year accident history (or the\nmost likely potential incident) is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to\nthe endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 0.2 miles.\n\n4.  The accidental release prevention program.\n\n    The facility has implemented the provisions of Safety Requirements for the\nStorage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1, published by The American\nNational Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and"

The Five - Year Accident History\n\n    -There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five\nyears         that:    \n            -have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage\n             at the facility; nor\n\n            -to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries,     \n             evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or     \n             environmental damage.\n\n6.  The emergency response program\n\n    -The facility has:\n\n    a.  a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR\n                1910.38;\n\n    b.  provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community      \n         right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\n    c.  a written emergency response program, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29\n        CFR 1910.120, including pre-emergency planning and employee training.\n\n7.  Planned changes to improve safety\n\n    improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are\nperformed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific\nanhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
