Schreiber Foods operates several cheese processing facilities across the US.  One of these facilities, located in Gainesville Georgia, uses anhydrous ammonia  for refrigeration of the product in manufacturing.  Anhydrous ammonia is subject to EPA regulation under 40 CFR 68, Accidental Release Risk Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals. owned and operated by Schreiber Foods, Inc.,  \n\n2. Description of Stationary Source\n\nThe Gainesville facility is located at 2255 White Sulpher Road, Gainesville, Georgia.  The facility consists of areas for manufacturing and packaging of cheese products.  On site cooler storage is provided for perishable items prior to distribution.\n\nSchreiber Foods, Inc. has one ammonia refrigeration system that exceeds the 10,000 lb. RMP threshold quantity.  The compressors and some ammonia refrigeration vessels are located in the compressor room located at the westside of the building.  All the refrigeration equipment including  the high pressure receiver (HPR) is located inside the building, except some piping and the condensers.  The high pressure receiver (HPR) is the largest capacity vessel in the ammonia refrigeration system.  This vessel is capable of holding approximately 4,800 lbs. of ammonia. This is the vessel used for the worst-case scenario analysis.\n\n3. Description of the Worst Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nThe Worst Case release scenario for ammonia is the rupture of the HPR, releasing 4,800 lbs. of ammonia gas over a ten minute period.  Under worst case weather conditions, considering passive mitigation credit, the ammonia gas could travel 0.6 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public or environment (reaching a concentration less than .14 mg/L), using the Ammonia Guidance.\n\nThe alternative-case release scenario was characterized by a mitigated le"

Under normally expected weather conditions, taking into consideration the passive mitigation credit, the ammonia gas could travel 0.10 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public or environment (reaching a concentration less than .14 mg/L), using the Ammonia Guidance.\n\n\n4. Prevention Program\n\nThis facility exceeds the ammonia threshold quantity in the ammonia refrigeration system for the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard, 1910.119, and is therefore subject to the PSM requirements.  For RMP compliance purposes, this places the Gainesville facility\u00bfs refrigeration process in the Program 3 level. The Gainesville facility will use its PSM program as the required Program 3 Prevention Program for ammonia.  \n\nProgram 3 Prevention Progam\n\nThe Gainesville facility has a program in place to comply with the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard, 29 CFR 1910.119.  The PSM Program was re-engineered in 1998 and covers the ammonia process.  The PSM Program includes a preventative maintenance plan which requires all ammonia refrigeration equipment to be periodically inspected and serviced.  This will ensure that the equipment remains in good operating condition and will minimize the probability of accidents due to faulty equipment.  In developing the PSM Program, the Gainesville facility also developed written operating procedures for the refrigeration processes.  These procedures cover all phases of operation and include information on safety devices.  These procedures will be used to train all operators and mechanics who work on the ammonia refrigeration processes to ensure consistency of operation and minimize human error.  In addition, all refrigeration mechanics receive training through the Refrigeration Engineers and Technicians Association (RETA) training course.  These measures ensure that all"

      "SummaryText": "refrigeration operators and mechanics are properly trained.  Existing safe work practices such as Confined Spaces, Lockout/Tagout, Hot Work Permitting, Line Breaking, and Access Control were reviewed and updated to ensure that all non-routine work can be performed safely.\n\nOther components of the PSM program include collection and review of all equipment information, the development of updated Piping & Instrumentation Diagrams (P&IDs), and the correction of any equipment design deficiencies found.  These actions will ensure that the equipment meets all refrigeration industry standards and that accurate equipment information will be available when needed.\n\nTo ensure that the Gainesville refrigeration staff has the skills necessary to identify unsafe conditions, Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) training was conducted.  The staff then participated in a PHA of this process.  Other PSM procedures, including Employee Participation, Contractors Program, Management of Change, Pre-Startup Safety Review, Compliance Audits, and Incident Investigation are also part of the program to ensure continued safe operation and prompt correction of deficiencies.  The PSM Program receives full support of plant management and involvement of employees at all levels.\n\n5. Accident History\n\nThe Gainesville facility has had no accidental releases of ammonia in the past five years.\n\n6. Emergency Response Program\n\nThe Gainesville facility has an Emergency Response Program in place.  The program complies with 29 CFR 1910.38.  The site also has some internal emergency response capability and is developing a program to comply with paragraph (q) of 29 CFR 1910.120.  The current plan has been coordinated with the local Fire Department.  Notification is made locally by dialing 911."
