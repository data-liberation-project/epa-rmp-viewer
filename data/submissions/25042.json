      "SummaryText": "The Praxair Distribution facility at Bethlehem, Pennsylvania is an industrial and specialty gas plant that handles and/or stores 41,000 lbs of Trichlorosilane that is regulated by the EPA's Risk Management Program rule.\n\nThe Bethlehem facility receives the trichlorosilane in bulk form, stores it in a storage tank, and then transfills it into smaller containers (cylinders) for distribution to customers.  The cylinders are distributed by truck.  Trichlorosilane is listed as a regulated flammable substance under the rule.  Therefore, Praxair is required to report one Worst Case Scenario and one Alternate Case Scenario for trichlorosilane.  \n\nThe Worst Case Scenario for flammable substances is defined by the EPA as the release of the entire contents of the largest vessel in the process, with essentially none of the safety systems and devices that are in place to prevent such an occurrence functioning as designed.  The released liquid vaporizes and the gas is assumed to ignite, causing a vapor cloud explosion.  Given these conditions, we are then required to estimate the distance to an EPA-specified flammable endpoint, which is defined to be an overpressurization effect of 1 pound per square inch.  At the Bethlehem facility, the Worst Case Scenario would involve the trichlorosilane storage tank which contains about 41,000 pounds.  Using the criteria listed above, the Worst Case Scenario would result in a maximum impact distance of about 0.11 miles to the EPA-specified endpoint.  To determine this distance, we used the EPA's \"RMP Off-Site Consequence Analysis Guidance.\"\n\nWe are also required to report one Alternative Release Scenario, or planning scenario, for the flammable processes.  While an Alternative Release may never occur at a facility, it is generally accepted to be more likely, or more credible, than the Worst Case Scenario, and can be used by the facility and local response organizations to plan community emergency response activities.  The RMP rule assumes mor"

When selecting an Alternative Release Scenario, EPA suggests a facility consider scenarios such as transfer hose releases, valve and flange leaks, pump seal leaks, and shipping container mishaps, among others.\n\nFor the flammable processes at Bethlehem, a credible release would be a process piping failure resulting in a trichlorosilane gas release at grade.  An accidental release of this type may occur due to mechanical failure, corrosion, failure of a piping component (such as a joint or valve), impact by a vehicle, or other cause.  At the Bethlehem facility, a release of this type could result in the released gas igniting, causing a vapor cloud explosion.  The distance to the EPA-specified endpoint of 1 pound per square inch overpressure is about 0.05 miles, or about 265 feet.  To determine this distance, we used the EPA's \"RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.\"\n\nIn accordance with OSHA's Process Safety Management standard and EPA's Risk Management Program rule, the Bethlehem facility has a comprehensive accident prevention program in place to ensure the safety of our employees, our neighbors and the community around us.  On a local level, this prevention program is built around process safety concepts such as:\n\n? Documented process safety information to ensure the process design is understood and maintained throughout its life;\n? Process hazard analysis to identify and control all of the hazards associated with handling flammable substances;\n? Trained operators, using written operating procedures, to safely operate the process as intended; and\n?
