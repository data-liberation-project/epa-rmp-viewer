      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nCascade Pacific Pulp, Halsey Pulp Mill\n\n\nCascade Pacific Pulp, Halsey Pulp Mill is a Kraft pulp mill which produces market pulp.  The Halsey Pulp Mill is located in Halsey, Oregon.  The company is committed to operating in a manner that is safe for workers, the public, and the environment.  As part of this commitment, the company has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at the Halsey mill.  One component of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the Halsey Pulp Mill and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) regulation 40 CFR 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMPlan) describing the risk management program at the mill.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMPlan requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at the Halsey Pulp Mill.\n\nThe risk management program consists of three elements:\n\n1. A hazard assessment to help understand (a) the potential offsite consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and (b) accidents that have occurred during the last five years associated with the use of substances regulated by the RMP rule.\n\n2. A prevention program to help maintain and safely operate the processes containing more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance (covered processes).\n\n3. An emergency response program to help respond to accidental releases of regulated substances from covered processes \n\nInformation further describing these elements is provided in this RMPlan.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nCascade Pacific Pulp is committed to the safety of workers and the public, and the preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental release of hazardous substances.

These controls include training programs for personnel, programs to help ensure safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of processes, and programs to evaluate the hazards.\n\nIn the event of an accidental release, the facility controls and contains the release in a manner that will be safe for workers and will help prevent injury to the public or the environment.  The Halsey Pulp Mill provides response training to personnel, designates an emergency response coordinator to oversee response activities, and coordinates response efforts with the local fire department.  \n\nIn order to implement these policies, the Halsey Pulp Mill established a management system directed by the Human Resource Manager to oversee safety-related activities.\n\nREGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nCascade Pacific Pulp is a pulp mill primarily involved in the manufacture of bleached and semi-bleached pulp.  As part of this manufacturing process, the facility handles several regulated substances in sufficient quantities to be covered by the RMP rule, as shown in the following list of RMP-covered processes.\n\nProcess    Program Level    Regulated Substance    Process Quantity\nlbs\nFilter Plant    3    Chlorine    10,000\nChlorine Dioxide Plant    3    Chlorine Dioxide    19,000 \n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nSince the mill was constructed in 1969, a prevention program has been in place to help prevent accidental releases of hazardous substances.  Beginning in 1992, Halsey Pulp Mill formalized this prevention program for the filter plant to comply with the 14 elements of the OSHA process safety management (PSM) prevention program.  In 1998, prior to the building of the chlorine dioxide generator, Halsey Pulp Mill began implementing OSHA process safety management.  In 1996, the EPA RMP rule established two levels of prevention program requirements:\n\nProgram 3 - essentially the same as OSHA PSM, except "

The facility maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to help ensure safe operation of the processes.  These documents address (1) physical properties of chlorine and chlorine dioxide, (2) operating parameters of the equipment, and (3) design basis and configuration of the equipment. These documents are also used (1) to train employees, (2) to perform process hazards analyses, and (3) to help maintain the equipment.  The process safety information is available to all employees, the local emergency personnel, and the fire department.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis.  The facility performs and periodically updates process hazard analyses (PHA's) of the covered processes to help identify process hazards and generate recommendations that might improve the safe operation of the process.  A team composed of operating and engineering personnel with process operating experience and a leader with process hazard analyses experience is assembled to analyze the hazards of the process.  The Halsey Pulp Mill uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) technique supplemented with checklists, to perform this analysis.  The team prepares a written report describing the results of the analyses, including a list of recommendations.  Responsibility to resolve the recommendations is assigned to the approriate personnel and, when necessary, changes to enhance the safety of the process are implemented.\n\nOperating Procedures.  Halsey Pulp Mill personnel develop and maintain operating procedures that cover all phases of operations, including startup, normal operations, normal shutdown, and emergency shutdow"

The management of change program evaluates and approves all proposed changes to chemicals, equipment and procedures for a covered process to help ensure that the change does not negatively affect safe operations.  Process changes that are determined to be a replacement in kind (e.g., replacing a valve with an identical valve) are allowed without completing a full management of change program.  All other changes must be confirmed through the full management of change program to help ensure that inadvertent consequences of process changes are prevented, safety consequences of changes are addressed, affected process safety information and procedures are updated, and affected employees are notified of the changes.\n\nPre-Startup Review.  The company performs a safety review of a new or modified process before the process is placed into service to help ensure that the process has been prepared to operate safely.  This review confirms that:\n\nA? Construction and equipment are in accordance with design specifications\nA? Safety, operating, maintenance and emergency procedures are in place\nA? Employee training has been completed\nA? A process hazard analysis has been performed if the process is new or management of change requirements have been completed if an existing process has been modified\n\nCompliance Audit.  The Halsey Pulp Mill audits covered processes to be certain that the prevention program is effectively addressing the safety issues.  The facility assembles an audit team that includes personnel knowledgeable in OSHA's Process Safety Management, RMP rule and in the process.  This team evaluates whether the prevention program satisfies the requirements of the OSHA rule and the RMP rule and whether the prevention program is sufficient to help ensure safe operation of the process.  The results of the audit are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate enhancements to the prevention program are implemented.\n\nIncident Investigation.  The facility inve"

The employees are trained to identify and report any incident requiring investigation.  An investigation team is assembled, and the investigation is initiated within 48 hours of the incident.  The results of the investigation are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate process enhancements are implemented.\n\nEmployee Participation.  The Halsey Pulp Mill has a written employee participation program for covered processes to help ensure that the safety concerns of workers are addressed.  The mill encourages active participation of personnel in the prevention program activities of all processes at the facility.  Employees are consulted on and informed about all aspects of the prevention program, including process hazard analyses and operating procedures.\n\nHot Work Permits.  The Halsey Pulp Mill has a hot work permit program to control spark or flame producing activities that could result in fires or explosions in covered processes at the Halsey mill.  The mill reviewed OSHA's fire prevention and protection requirements in 29 CFR 1910.252(a) and created a Hot Work Permit Form to comply with these requirements. Personnel who are to perform hot work are required to fill out the Hot Work Permit form.  The Shift Supervisor reviews the completed form before work can begin.  Training in the use of the Hot Work Permit Form is included in the mill's safe work practices orientation.\n\nContractors.  The Halsey Pulp Mill has a program to help ensure that contractor activities at the Halsey mill are performed in a safe manner.

Cascade Pacific Pulp requires that all contract employees have safety training prior to working at the Halsey Pulp Mill.  Annually contractors' training documents and work performance are reviewed to help ensure that safe work practices are followed.\n\n\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nIn addition to the required prevention program elements, the mill has implemented safety features specific to the hazardous substances used at the facility.  The following paragraphs describe some of these safety features.\n\nChlorine.  Chlorine is supplied in DOT-approved 1-ton cylinders.  Chlorine is used for water treatment at the filter plant.  For the water treatment, chlorine is fed through piping to an eductor, where it is absorbed into process water for use in the water treatment unit.  The length of piping containing chlorine is kept to a minimum to reduce the likelihood of a release.  There is an area sensor that will close the valve to the 1-ton cylinder if high chlorine leaks are detected. \n\nChlorine Dioxide.  Chlorine dioxide is generated on site.  The chlorine dioxide generator was designed as a fail-safe design.  In emergency situations, the chemicals supplied to the generator are stopped.  The reaction is quenched with chilled water.  In a power failure situation, the valves for the tank with the chilled water fail open so that the reaction will immediately be quenched.  Chlorine dioxide is stored at a stable temperature of 45 A?F in refrigerated tanks that are continually swept with air to remove any residual chlorine dioxide.  The residual chlorine dioxide is sent back into the generator system.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nCascade Pacific Pulp has completed a five-year accident history for chlorine and chlorine dioxide.  There has not been any accidents in the past five years.  Chlorine dioxide is a chemical that started being used on site in October 2000.\n\nYear    Number of Reported Accidents    \nSubstance Releas"
