Seneca Foods employees are not first responders in the event of an uncontrolled release of ammonia.  Wayne County Fire will notify the Xerox Hazardous Material Team to respond to the uncontrolled release of ammonia. \n\nIn the event that the surrounding community must be evacuated per this Risk Management Plan, this will be handled by the Fire Department with assistance from the County Fire Control."

      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nI.OVERVIEW\nSeneca Foods Corporation, Marion Processing Plant is located at 3732 South Main Street, Marion, New York.  This Risk Management Plan is prepared to comply with 40 CFR Part 68 as issued by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia, CAS No. 7664-41-7, is stored at this facility.  Anhydrous ammonia is listed as a regulated toxic substance under 40 CFR 68.130 with a threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds.  Our system has the capacity to hold up to 15,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  It is difficult to determine exactly the amount we currently have, as ammonia is flowing throughout the system.  The last delivery of anhydrous ammonia to the facility was on 8/28/96 and totaled 5,993 pounds.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia (CAS No. 7664-41-7) carries a NFPA Health hazard category rating of 3 (4 is maximum) and a Flammability hazard category of 1 (4 is maximum).  Release of an entire system inventory is not a credible scenario since each piece of equipment can be individually isolated with block valves.  Liquid ammonia, if released to the atmosphere boils at -28: F resulting in a large-scale generation of vapor which can reach harmful concentrations.  Vapors are lighter than air (0.6) and therefore have a tendency to rise, assisting in dispersal.  In addition, ammonia vapor is flammable in concentrations between 16 - 25% by volume in air.  Although, ignition is not common.\n\nThe anhydrous ammonia is used at this facility as a refrigerant for individually quick freezing of fresh vegetables.  The primary frozen products are 1 cut green and wax beans and whole kernel corn.  The frozen product is packed into bulk totes and shipped to an outside-refrigerated warehouse.  The ammonia system is a conventional commercial/industrial refrigeration design using anhydrous ammonia as the working fluid.  High Pressure liquid ammonia at approximately 150 psi. is fed through a distribution system in a Frigoscandia IQF freezer where heat is removed"

OTHER PREVENTION MEASURES\nWe maintain a log of each relief valve installed on the ammonia system.  Relief valves are replaces every five years or after a discharge.  Which ever occurs first.\n\nThe Marion Fire Department will be the first responders in the event of an \tuncontrolled release.  The Wayne County Fire Coordinator will notify the Xerox Hazardous Materials Team.  The Marion Fire Department and Xerox Hazardous Materials Team are each invited to tour this facility annually.\nThe Marion Fire Department toured this facility last on April 27, 1999.  The Xerox Hazardous Material Team is tentatively scheduled to tour in the fall of 1999 during the months of October or November. \n\nOutside contractors who work on the ammonia system are experienced with working on ammonia systems.\n\nC.  EMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION\nAll employees annually or upon hire, are informed of the ammonia on site and its' location.  Employees are also informed of the hazards involved with ammonia.  They are informed of the PSM Program and are able to review the program at any time through a written request to their supervisor.\n\nD.  PROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS (PHA)\nThe original PHA for the facility was conducted on May 15, 1995.  A PHA update was conducted on April 8, 1999.  The PHA's from 5/15/95 were reviewed and a new PHA was conducted with the main emphasis on new equipment and recent changes.  The entire ammonia system was covered to bring forward any concerns, which may have been missed, from the 1995 PHA's.\n\nIn the plan, section 7.4H, it is stated installation of process controls and installation of process detection systems have been installed since the last PHA.  This is referring to the PHA on May 15, 1995."

It is identified with a sign stating HIGH PRESSURE \tRECEIVER.  It measures 20.0 feet long by 5.0 feet high.

At 50% liquid and 50% vapors, this will carry an inventory of 7,332 pounds.  7,202 pounds liquid and 130 pounds vapors. \n\nWithin the compressor room, we have three 13,000 cfm each exhaust fans which will exhaust the vapors from the compressor room to the atmosphere.\n \nTables and equations used to determine the distant end point were from the EPA CEPPO Model titled Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration dated November 1998.
