We store and distribute a wide variety of pesticides and fertilizers including anhydrous ammonia.  Anhydrous ammonia is received by truck, handled and stored on-site.  Ammonia is a substance regulated by the EPA requiring us to comply with the Risk Management Program.  We sell anhydrous ammonia to grower customers in either 1,000 gallon or 1,500 gallon nurse tanks.  The customer applies the ammonia into the soil as a source of nitrogen fertilizer for growing agricultural crops.\n\nThis facility maintains twenty-eight (28) 1,000-gallon nurse tanks and seven (7) 1,500-gallon nurse tanks for customer delivery.  Our combined storage capacity in nurse tanks is 170,000 pounds.  Anhydrous ammonia is stored in 1 stationary storage tank (1 @ 18,000 gallons) on site.  The maximum storage capacity of the stationary storage tank is 79,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  Therefore, the toal facility anhydrous ammonia storage capacity for our facility is 250,000.  The largest single storage vessel at our facility contains79,000 pounds.\n\nTHE WORST CASE SCENARIO:\n\nOur worst case scenario is the loss of the total contents of the 18,000 gallon storage tank, when filed to the greatest amount allowed (85% of capacity), released as a gas over 10 minutes, resulting total vaporization.  The maximum quantity released would be 79,000 pounds.  According to DEGADIS modeling, this release (distance form point of dispersion to 200 PPM) would have off-site impact.  It should be noted that Terragro has never had a release of an entire stationary storage tank from any facility.\n\nALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO:\n\nThe most common alternative release scenario from our facility would not reach an end-point off-site.  The alternative release scenario modeled for the purposes of this plan is a 2-minut"

The total amount of anhydrous ammonia, released in the scenario would be 12,000 pounds.  This release scenario (distance from point of dispersion to 200 PPM) would have off-site impact.  It should be noted that Terrago has never had a release of this type from any distribution facility.\n\nTHE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS:\n\nThe ammonia system is designed, installed and is maintained in accordance with ASTM standards and the ASME codes.  This facility complies with the ANSI K 61.1 standards (1989), OSHA (29 CFR 1910.111), EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule as well as all applicable federal, state and local codes and regulations.\n\nOur ammonia system is protected from major releases by internal excess flow valves, check valves, relief valves, manual shuoffs and emergency shutoff valves.  The load-out risers used for the purpose of filling the nurse tanks are protected by excess flow valves and fill line breakaways to immediately stop the flow of ammonia if a line or hose fails.  All main storage tank valves and the riser load valves are locked when not in use.  The entire storage system is protected with 6\" steel pipe, spaced 6' apart, 4' in the ground, 4' above ground, filled and surrounded with concrete.\n\nOur ammonia system is inspected on a regular basis with maintenance and preventive maintenance sheduled and documented.  Liquid and vapor valves, hoses, excess flow valves, gauges and relief valves are replaced when necessary and/or according to the guidelines in th ANSI standards.\n\nTraining is provided to all employees at least annually, whenever there is a change in the process or whenever competency with the regulations is questioned.  The training consists of classroom lecture, current videos, testing and certification and on the job training.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\n\nThere have been no acc"

In preparation for this, we have coordinated with all of the local response agencies by providing information and facility tours to ensure that they are familiar with and properly prepared for an incident at our facility.  This will help to ensure that our community has the strategy for responding to and mitigating the threat posed by an ammonia release.  This complies with the requirement for our facility to be included in the community emergency response plan prepared under EPCRA and coordinated with our LEPC.\n\nIn addition, Terragro has an employee Emergency and Fire Prevention Plan that complies with the requirements of OSHA (29 CFR 1910.38) The plan includes public notification, evacuations, and LEPC coordination.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\n\nWe do not plan to make any changes to the physical site.  We will continue to provide our employees with ongoing annual training to ensure that they are current with all of the safe ammonia transfer and handling procedures, and provide regular inspection and maintenance on all of the ammonia equipment."
