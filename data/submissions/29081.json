In addition, Bayer's site emergency plans have been integrated with the emergency plans of the county and local fire departments.  Bayer has participated in every disaster drill held annually by the LEPC.\n\nCompliance and Commitment to Safety\n\nAt Bayer Corporation, we are committed to changing the world with great care.  As part of this commitment, we work with the citizens of our community to help protect and improve the quality of life we all enjoy. Protection of our employees and neighbors is our highest priority, and that is why we have installed multiple safeguards to ensure that all chemicals are handled safely.  We also work closely with our suppliers, other companies, local officials and the public to maintain stringent safety and environmental programs and to minimize risks.  \n\nIn keeping with our commitment, Bayer has developed a risk management plan in compliance with guidelines established by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  Under EPA guidelines, facilities that handle certain quantities of regulated chemicals must submit plans that show the consequences of hypothetical chemical releases.  Facilities must also outline their measures to reduce the risk of releases and minimize their effects.\n\nSeveral processes at the site are regulated by the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) requirements listed in 29 CFR Part 1910.119.  PSM and RMP complement each other in that PSM is concerned about the employee and RMP is concerned about the public and the environment.  The Bayer Bushy Park site is in full compliance with the PSM requirements.  \n\nIII.

Ammonia and methyl chloride are liquefied gases under pressure and cyclohexylamine is a liquid.  Each is regulated as a toxic substance.  The Bayer site does not have any flammables that require inclusion in the Risk Management Plan.\n\nBayer uses anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant in the plant-wide refrigeration system.  Ammonia is a colorless gas with a strong pungent odor.  Exposure to ammonia can irritate the eyes, nose and throat.  Exposure to extremely high levels can result in a buildup of fluid in the lungs and can be life threatening.\n\nBayer uses cyclohexylamine primarily to manufacture an additive used in the rubber industry.  A small amount is also used for water treatment in the plant boilers.  Cyclohexylamine is a colorless liquid with an ammonia-like odor.  Exposure to cyclohexylamine can cause irritation of the respiratory system.  Exposure to extremely high levels can result in a buildup of fluid in the lungs and can be life threatening.\n\nBayer uses methyl chloride to make an intermediate product in the manufacture of paint pigments.  Methyl chloride is a colorless gas with a faint sweet odor.  Exposure to methyl chloride can cause headache, giddiness, drowsiness, and muscular incoordination.  Exposure to extremely high levels can result in respiratory failure and can be life threatening.\n\nIV. RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nA worst case scenario is included in the plan for ammonia and alternative case scenarios (or more likely scenarios) are included in the plan for each of the three regulated substances.  \n\nThe ammonia worst-case scenario is based on the complete failure of the largest process vessel containing 36,200 pound of liquid ammonia.

The release impact distance is the distance down wind to the ERPG2-LOC concentration.  The ERPG2-LOC for ammonia is 200 parts per  million (ppm).  The ERPG2-LOC for methyl chloride is 400 parts per million (ppm).\n\nThe Extremely Hazardous Substance Level Of Concern (EHS-LOC) is the airborne concentration 10 times safer than the concentration (estimated from toxicity data) that is immediately dangerous to life and health.  The release impact distance is the distance down wind to the EHS-LOC concentration.  The EHS-LOC for cyclohexylamine is 39 parts per million (ppm).\n\nAll scenarios evaluated used EPA's published model, RMPComp, to provide toxic end-point determinations based on an EPA published level of concern (LOC).

      "SummaryText": "lease to the outside air.\n+ Ammonia detectors are installed at key locations to provide early warning of potential problems.\n+ Methyl chloride detectors are installed at key locations to provide early warning of potential problems.\n+ Operating personnel monitor each system regularly to identify any potential problems.\n+ Relief devices prevent overpressure of the each system and will safely discharge the regulated substance should an upset occur. \n\nVIII. IMPROVING SAFETY PERFORMANCE\n\nBayer has a continuing commitment to improving safety performance in all areas of concern.  Several planned improvements include:\n+ Installation of a ten meter weather monitoring tower to be able to predict in real time off-site consequences if a release should occur.  Completion expected by the first quarter of 2000.\n+ A new streamlined safety training program to improve the overall quality of the site's training programs.  The new program will further assure that the right people get the right training with high comprehension when required.  Expected completion and implementation by the third quarter of 2000.\n+ A review is underway of the Methyl chloride storage and handling system to change the way it is handled and to possibly reduce the quantity on site.  Expect recommendations by the end of the third quarter of 1999, with a follow-on project to implement the changes completed by the third quarter of 2000."
