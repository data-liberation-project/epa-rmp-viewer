(CPCPRC) is committed to protecting the health and safety of its employees, the public and the environment.  CPCPRC takes seriously the obligation to provide information to the community, as well as to actively participate in community emergency planning and community right-to-know.  This includes public access to information on chemicals manufactured, handled and stored within the facility.  \r\n\tCPCPRC's policy is to implement controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances through engineering design, installation, operation and maintenance of the processes in the facility.  However, if a release does occur, CPCPRC trained employees shall respond to control and contain the release.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCE HANDLED\r\n\r\nCPCPRC is a petrochemical plant located on the southeast coast of the island of Puerto Rico.  The facility is situated approximately 2.5 miles southwest of the town of Guayama, in Jobos  Ward, adyacent to State Road Number 710 and approximately 0.25 miles from the Caribbean Sea.\r\nThe operating facilities include a series of petrochemical units designed to produce a select, high purity group of aromatic hydrocarbons.  Motor fuel gasoline and diesel, belonging to CITGO is stored in several of the facility's tanks and sold and distributed through the Truck Loading Terminal located at the facility.\r\nFeedstock\r\nMixed-xylenes - 7,500 bbls per day \r\n\r\nProducts\r\nParaxylene - 6,000 bbls per day \r\nBenzene    -    700 bbls per day\r\n\r\nGeneral Process Flow\r\na) Mixed Xylenes are charged to the Parex Unit where paraxylene is adsorbed on mol sieves \r\nand then desorbed to produce high purity paraxylene.

This dealkylation requires hydrogen that is produced in a steam reformer using gas from the isomerization unit as feed or butane as startup feed.\r\n\r\nAll feedstocks and most product shipments are via tankers through the marine dock facility located on the south coast of the region, specifically Las Mareas Harbor.  All of the gasoline and diesel is loaded via tank trucks at the truck loading rack for use on the island.  Excess hydrogen produced during our process is also sold via tank trucks for use in Puerto Rico.\r\nParaxylene and Benzene produced at CPCPRC serve as building blocks for many chemicals produced by our customers.  Paraxylene is used as a feedstock for producing polyester (poly/ cotton blend fabrics) and PET resins (soft drink bottles, X-ray film such as Mylar).  Benzene is used to make cyclohexane, which is used to produce nylon; and styrene, an intermediate for plastics. \r\nIn these processes, CPCPRC has identified one flammable product that exceeds the threshold levels established by the List Rule of the Clean Water Act.  The flammable identified is butane.  The butane is stored in 2 spheres, each containing 1,891,512 pounds.  \r\n\r\nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS (WCS & ARS)\r\n\r\nWorst Case Release Scenarios (WCS) and Alternate Release Scenarios (ARS) were developed for the flammable identified in the facility using the EPA's RMP Guidance for Propane Storage Facilities.  The covered process was examined for the determination of the Flammable WCS and ARS for the facility.   Populations affected were based on census data.\r\nThe Flammables WCS was determined by modeling each of the two sphere in EPA's RMP Guidance.  Again, for the Flammables WCS, no secondary containment was considered and the vessel contents were modeled as an instantaneous release of the total contents of the vessel.  \r\nThe Flammable WCS selected was determined to be a Butane sphere releasing all 1,900,000 pound"

The modeling was done using a 3 inch release for 30 minutes from the bottom of one of the butane spheres.  \r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PROGRAM\r\n\r\n\tCPCPRC utilizes several Environmental, Health and Safety policies to identify improvement opportunities in the areas of employee involvement, productivity, quality and loss prevention.  Through the use of Responsible Care, the Tenets of Operations, Corporate EHS policy and the plant's own EHS policy, CPCPRC identifies areas in which people, systems and assets can be managed to maximize operating reliability and reduce the potential for releases in the facility.  Following are some of the areas in which the general accident release program is supported by the _______________________________________.                           .\r\nEmployee Participation\r\n\tCPCPRC encourages employees from all levels to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention in the facility.  Examples of employee participation range from active participation in developing, reviewing and revising safety standards, up to participating as members of a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA).  In addition, CPCPRC supports employees by providing roles and responsibilities, training in safety and loss prevention, encouraging employee involvement through key performance measures and participation in a Citizens Advisory Panel )CAP) in which risks and rewards of the local chemical industry are discussed.\r\nSystems\r\n\tCPCPRC uses systems to enhance the release prevention program in specific ways.

This includes the evaluation of system designs and areas for improvement.  In addition, CPCPRC ensures all employees understand the impact of their actions on pollution.  CPCPRC also uses risk management to lessen identified risks to acceptable levels through the use of a risk identification, assessment and management system.\r\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\tCPCPRC (and/or Phillips Puerto Rico Core Inc.) has an excellent record of accident prevention over the last five years.  No incidents resulted in off-site impacts.\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\r\n\tCPCPRC maintains a comprehensive emergency response plan to prepare for and manage all emergencies affecting the facility or the community.  The plan includes: the Emergency Action Plan, Incident Command System - Management, Incident Command System - Unit Leader Guidelines, Emergency Response Team Manual, Emergency Equipment Inventory, Emergency Response Standard Operating Guidelines, Fire Preplans, Mutual Aid, Emergency Equipment Operating and Training Manual, Facility Response Plan, Training Lesson Plans, Fire Pump Maintenance and Inspection, and Storage Tank Fire Preplans.\r\n\tEmployees in the facility are organized into the Initial Response Team, Fire Brigade, Specialty Teams and Incident Command System.
