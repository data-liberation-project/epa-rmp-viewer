Through the use of outside contractors, we have developed a comprehensive Mechanical Integrity and training program to ensure our ongoing goal of safety and reliability.\r\n\r\nThe only registered substance held at this facility is anhydrous ammonia.  It is used in both our cold storage and hydro-cooler unit.   We maintain specific operating procedures for each, along with a detailed Mechanical Integrity program to ensure their safety.  Our operators are trained in the specifics of each system, with all maintenance being handled by a recognized ammonia refrigeration contractor.\r\n\r\nIn order to better understand the hazards associated with our processes, we\u00bfve developed several release scenarios to assist local agencies with emergency planning issues.  Each of the scenarios is based on wind-speed of three meters per second with an atmospheric stability class of \u00bfD\u00bf, and a temperature reading of 77 degrees Fahrenheit.  Our Worst-Case scenario involves the loss of the entire anhydrous ammonia charge.  The first Alternative Scenario involves a pipe rupture that leaks high pressure gas.  Our second Alternative Scenario involves a slow leak from a pressure vessel that leaks liquid at low pressure.\r\n\r\nWe\u00bfve also undertaken a Compliance Audit to determine where our system might be lacking.  We\u00bfve instituted a plan and timeline to correct any items found to be deficient.\r\n\r\nWe\u00bfve taken measures to secure process safety information for both of our systems that include: Manufacturer\u00bfs recommendations; Equipment design (including operating parameters); Standard Operating Procedures, and a detailed maintenance inspection schedule based in industry standards. \r\n\r\nA Process Hazard Analysis was conducted June 11, 2009 to determine if any shortcomings were identified.

A Compliance Audit Resolution system was created to deal with shortcomings identified during the audit.  We expect to have these items completed no later than September 11, 2009.\r\n\r\nTop Hat Produce, Inc. has instituted a new training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating the refrigeration system process are competent in the operating procedures associated with the process.  Refresher training will be provided at least every three years and more frequently as needed.\r\n\r\nThis facility has never suffered an accidental release, although we maintain an Emergency Response Plan to deal with one should one occur.  This plan details employee evacuations, procedures to stop the release, and whom to contact in case of an emergency."
