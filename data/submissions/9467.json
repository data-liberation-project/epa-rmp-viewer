The investigation is promptly conducted, commencing within 48 hours of any incident.  To perform the investigation, Huntsman O&O has established a procedure to appoint an incident investigation team consisting of persons with the appropriate knowledge and experience to thoroughly investigate and analyze the incident.  A report is prepared at the conclusion of the incident investigation that addresses the incident, the factors that contributed to it, and recommendations resulting from the incident investigation.

The O&O Site utilizes the HAZOP methodology, a recognized and generally accepted method, for identifying and evaluating hazards in the process.  The O&O Site assigns employees to the HAZOP team who are knowledgeable in the HAZOP methodology and the specific process.  The HAZOP team develops recommendations to reduce the potential hazards which, if approved, are implemented within a reasonable period of time.  Hurricanes and inclement weather are not investigated in the PHAs; however, Huntsman does have a Hurricane Procedure and implements this procedure under the threat of a hurricane and inclement weather.\n \n7 Operating Procedures\n \t\tHuntsman O&O maintains written operating procedures that were developed in consultation with operators to provide clear instructions for safely conducting activities associated with a covered process.
