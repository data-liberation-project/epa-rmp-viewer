If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department and the local emergency planning committee to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the people and the enviroment.\n\n2.  Facility Information\n\n     The primary activity at the facility is the storage of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a nutrient for crop production.  The maximum quanity stored would be 342,100 pounds in a storage tank, a rail car, and nurse tanks.\n\n3.  Worst-Case Scenario and Alternate Release Scenario\n\n a   The worst-case scenario would be the release of the total contents of a rail car tank released as gas over a period of 10 minutes.  The maximum quanity released would be 160,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards and administrative controls.  The distance to the end point (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.22 miles.\n\n B.  The alternate release scenario, a three inch transfer hose is used as an alternate release scenario followed by release of ammonia for 2 minutes before an automatic excess flow shut-down valve/valves intervenes and stops the flow of ammonia.  The maximum quanity released would be 28000 pounds.  The distance to the endpoint is .6 miles.  The most likely potential incident would be a release of ammonia for 2 minutes before an automatic excess flow valve/valves intervenes and stops the flow of ammonia.  The maximum quanity released with this scenario would be 2,901 pounds.  The distance to the endpoint is .22 miles.\n\n4.   Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n     The facility is in compliance with the provisions of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Sto"

The OSHA standard is referenced in this RMP Registration Form, see section 8.3.\n\n5.   Five-Year Accident History\n\n     There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge has there been any accidental releases resulting in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, property damage, or environmental damage.  \n\n6.   Emergency Action Plan\n\n     The facility has\n\n  a. A written action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38\n  b. Provided state and local authorities with the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under  \n      SARA Title III (EPCRA)\n  c. If a large release of anhydrous ammonia takes place at the facility, the required response action is to evacuate the area of      the spill and call 911 and all applicable emergency response numbers.\n         1.  within 15 minutes of determining the amount of the release would be over 100 pounds, the emergency coodinator will\n              notify The National Emergency Response Center @ 800/424-8802\n         \n7.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n     Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the conditions of the \nfacility.  There are no additional specific safety recommendations regarding storage or use of anhydrous ammonia for implementation at this time."
