Facility Accidental Release Policy\n\nThe owners, management, and employees of John Taylor Fertilizers Company, Rio Linda facility (herein referred to as the Facility) at 841 West Elkhorn Blvd., Rio Linda, California, 95673 are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia and aqua ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.  A detailed emergency response plan has been developed and will be implemented in the event of an accidental release.\n\n2.  Facility Information\n\nThe primary activity at the Facility is the storage, blending, and sale of fertilizers, in addition to, the sale of pre-packaged agricultural chemicals to farmers.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for both direct application and for blending into mixed grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients.  Anhydrous Ammonia is also used in the production of ammonium polyphosphate fertilizer and aqua ammonia.  \n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received by truck and stored in three 98-ton storage tanks (bullets) or two thirty-ton bullets at the site.  The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia handled in this process is 612,420 pounds.\n\nAqua ammonia (25% of ammonia by weight) is produced at the site using an aqua ammonia convertor and stored in four 168,000 gallon above ground tanks at the site. The storage tanks are located within a secondary containment structure.  The maximum quantity of aqua ammonia handled is 5,107,200 pounds.  The total quantity of ammonia present in the aqua ammonia, based on 25% active ingredient by weight, is  1,276,800 pounds.  \n\nAmmonium polyphosphate is produced at the site using anhydrous ammonia  and a 10-34-0 reactor. The end product, ammonium polyphosphate, is not a regulated substance. \n\n3.  The Worst-Case Rel"

Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia and Aqua Ammonia:  The Facility has implemented the provisions of the \"Safety Requirements for Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc.; California Code of Regulations, Title 8, Subchapter 1, \"Unfired Pressure Vessel Safety Orders\"; and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.\"\n\n5.  Five-year Accident History\n\na. There have been no accidental releases or near misses of anhydrous ammonia or aqua ammonia in the past five years that:\n\n1.  Have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor\n\n2.  Have resulted in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property  damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6. The Emergency Response Program\n\nThe facility's emergency response program was written in accordance with the following regulations:\n\nOSHA 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\nOSHA 29 CFR 1910.120; and\n\nSection 25503, Division 6.95 of the California Health and Safety Code\n\n7.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  Specific planned changes to the anhydrous ammonia and aqua ammonia processes at the facility are listed in the Facility PHAs.\n\n8. Notification Update\n\nThe RMP 2004 update requirements (40 CFR 68.190) require that an emergency contact e-mail address be listed for this facility.  The emergency contact e-mail address is:  Eric Jenks at JenksEB@jtfco.com    \n\nAs part of the new requirements, contractor/consultants contact information must be "
