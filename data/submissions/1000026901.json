The Facility Policy\n\n\n\nThe owners, management, and employees of Walker Products are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire company, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.  To accomplish these objectives, the Risk Management Plan incorporates programs for hazard review, hazard assessment, information on the facility and equipment, operating procedures, training, maintenance, audit for compliance, and investigation of incidents involving any damage or injuries on, or off-site.  Individual programs are reviewed and revised as needed and dependent on the conclusions of any incident investigation.  Individual programs are reviewed and revised as needed and depending on the conclusions of any incident investigation.  Should the facility undergo significant change in products or services or physical plant, programs are reviewed as to their content for the changes at the facility.\n\n\n\n2.  Facility Information - ammonia storage tank is located West of Lincoln, Kansas, 1 mile West of town on U.S. Highway 18 and then 1/2 mile South.  Tank is located on the West side of the road, just South of the Farmway Coop ammonia storage tank.\n\n\n\n The primary activity at the facility is the storage of fertilizers for sale to farmers.\n\n\n\n Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application.\n\n\n\n Our storage is comprised of a bulk storage tank and trailers.\n\n\n\n3.  The accidental release prevention program.\n\n\n\nThe facility has implemented most of the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National"

The governing regulations are put forth by the Kansas Department of Agriculture and the facility is inspected on a regular basis by company personnel, inspectors from the Kansas Department of Agriculture, and representatives of the Company's insurance carrier.  Important differences between ANSI standards and KDA regulations involve color coding of valves, installation of a bulkhead at the truck unloading point, and remote shut-offs for the storage tank(s).  The Company has adopted a plan to bring all facilities and equipment into compliance with the full ANSI standards by the end of 2012.\n\n\n\n4.  The Five-year Accident History \n\n\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that: have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor  to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.  \n\n\n\n5.  Security\n\n\n\nA security assessment and Security Plan has been developed for the location which identifies risks to site security and personnel.  In accordance with the security assessment, the Security Plan includes policies and actions to be taken.  These elements are included in the Risk Management Plan for the facility.    \n\n\n\n6.
