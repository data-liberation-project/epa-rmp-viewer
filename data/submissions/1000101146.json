Because it is Veolia's business to receive the chemicals as wastes for safe management, elimination and substitution are not applicable.\n\nTo minimize the risk of an accidental release using engineering controls, Veolia designed the process to utilize top loading with a stinger to fill the railcars, which reduce the risk posed by a release from the bottom valve of the railcar. Secondary containment is in place for the tank truck, pump, hoses, and under the railcar bottom valve. The buildup of static electricity is prevented by using conductive hoses and the electrical bonding of tank trucks, pumps, and railcars. To minimize vapor releases, vapors are balanced between the tanker and railcar. High-level alarms are present on the railcars (activate at 90% full), to prevent overfilling.\n\nAdministrative controls implemented to minimize the risk of an accidental release include:\n\nStandard Operating Procedures with job safety analysis for each part of the process.\n\nInspection programs covering equipment, materials, and processes to identify and correct deficiencies.\n\nHazardous Materials Management Plan that includes fire prevention and control requirements.\n\nComprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures.

The facility receives waste materials, primarily organic solvent wastes, from various manufacturers.  Once on-site, the waste materials are separated into various waste and product categories depending on how the material will be processed.  Certain types of wastes are treated and processed to recover products that may be reused/recycled by industrial customers.  Other wastes are prepared for shipment to other Veolia or non-Veolia facilities for additional treatment or disposal.\n\nThere will be one process at the facility that can store a regulated chemical (piperidine) in quantity sufficient to require the preparation and implementation of this Risk Management Plan (RMP). The process will be performed on an event basis for one year, and Veolia will terminate this RMP plan at the end of the year.\n\nThe RMP-regulated process involves the transloading of  N, N-Dimethylformamide (DMF) containing up to 20% piperidine from tank trucks delivered to the facility into railcars, with the heaviest car weighing 206,500 lbs. Once complete, Veolia will ship railcars off-site.\n\n\nAt most, 16,000 pounds of piperidine may be present on-site in the DMF transloading process. There are no other processes at the facility currently storing, handling, using, or processing chemicals in quantities sufficient to require their inclusion in this RMP.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:\n\nVeolia is committed to protecting its employees, the public, and the environment.
