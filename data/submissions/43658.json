The major safety systems in place at the facility include process safety equipment and administrative safety procedures.  The Year 2000 (Y2K) plan was implemented.\r\n\r\nProcess safety equipment means that the facility is designed and built according to accepted safety codes and standards for electrical, mechanical, and structural integrity.  AE LLC?s process safety equipment includes a number of redundant systems, made up of local and remote indicators, sensors, and alarms that monitor operating levels, pressures and temperatures, and relay information to the facility Control Room Operator through an automated Distribution Control System. \r\n\r\nThe ammonia handling process includes relief, isolation and vent valves that can provide a margin of safety in the event of deviations from normal conditions, by allowing the operator to identify and isolate the problem and either return the system to normal conditions, or safely shut down the process.  The ammonia storage tank has a deluge system, which, in the event of a major leak or release, will activate high pressure water nozzles around the tank to quench the ammonia that is released.\r\n\r\nA number of administrative safety procedures complement the process safety equipment at the AE LLC facility.  These include written standard operating procedures (SOP) for all processes; twice-daily shift walkdown inspections of all major equipment, valves and alarms; extensive use of procedures checklists, such as for ammonia tank loading; and an automated preventative mainte"

One accidental release was not of a reportable quantity.  The other accidental release was a reportable quantity of approximately 570 pounds.  No one offsite was injured. The Federal Fire Department (FFD), as a precautionary measure, initiated evacuation of the facility.  Two FFD responders underwent medical treatment as a precautionary measure.\r\n\r\n1.5 Planned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nSince the 1999 RMP effort, as part of the process safety features, solenoid-actuated valves were installed.  Installation of these valves and updates of operating procedures were completed by April 2003.

The cogeneration facility provides steam to the Navy and electricity to the electric utility company, San Diego Gas & Electric (SDG&E).  The major system components are a gas turbine generator, a heat recovery steam generator (HRSG), a steam turbine generator, and associated equipment and control systems.  The facility began commercial operations in 1989.\n\nAE LLC uses anhydrous ammonia (NH3) to control emissions of oxides of nitrogen (NOx) from the gas turbine exhaust at the cogeneration facility.  Anhydrous ammonia is stored in a vertically mounted tank.  The maximum capacity of the tank is 4,000 gallons. The tank contents are limited to a maximum of 3,400 gallons.  Annual consumption of ammonia is approximately 19,200 gallons.\n\n1.3\tAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nAs a facility constructed and operated to provide steam to the U.S. government and electricity to SDG&E, AE LLC\u00bfs cogeneration facility is vital to national security and must be operated safely and efficiently. \n\nThe facility maintains, as required by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), its Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, which provides for the identification, prevention and minimization of chemical releases that could result from failures in processes, procedures and equipment.

AE LLC\u00bfs process safety equipment includes a number of redundant systems, made up of local and remote indicators, sensors, and alarms that monitor operating levels, pressures and temperatures, and relay information to the facility Control Room Operator through an automated Distribution Control System. \n\nThe ammonia handling process includes relief, isolation and vent valves that can provide a margin of safety in the event of deviations from normal conditions, by allowing the operator to identify and isolate the problem and either return the system to normal conditions, or safely shut down the process.  The ammonia storage tank has a deluge system, which, in the event of a major leak or release, will activate high pressure water nozzles around the tank to quench the ammonia that is released.\n\nA number of administrative safety procedures complement the process safety equipment at the AE LLC facility.  These include written standard operating procedures (SOP) for all processes; twice-daily shift walkdown inspections of all major equipment, valves and alarms; extensive use of procedures checklists, such as for ammonia tank loading; and an automated preventative maintenance system for tracking daily repair work orders and scheduled maintenance operations. \n\nAn operator training program encompassing operating procedures, safety and health, and emergency response with a biennial re-qualification requirement, helps ensure that employees think, act, and work safely while on the job.\n\nIn addition to the OSHA PSM, the AE LLC facility holds federal and state emergency response and safety plans, including the Hazardous Substance Contingency Plan (HSCP), Emergency Action Plan (EAP), Fire Prevention Plan (FPP), Exposure Control Plan (ECP), Injury and Illness Prevention Plan (IIPP), Spill Prevention, Control and Countermeasures Plan (SPCC), H"
