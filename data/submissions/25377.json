Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies\n\nConAgra Poultry Company - Gainesville is committed to both the safety of our employees and that of the surrounding public, including both human health and the environment.  Safety is ensure through careful prevention measures and emergency planning.  The intent of our Prevention Program is the minimiation of all risks that could possibley lead to an accidental release.  This program focuses primarily on the mechanical integrity of the process equipment and the training of its operators.  The EmergencyAction Plan focuses on minimizing the potential impacts of an accidental release.  This is done by coordinating emergency actions with the Gainesville Fire Department and ensureing that employees are trained on the proper repsonse to and emergency situation.\n\n2. The stationary source and regulated substances handled\n\nConAgra Poultry Company - Gainesville is a poultry processing plant.  The regulated substance handled at this plant is ammonia.  Ammonia is used as a regrigerant in the plant cooler and freezer system.  The mazimum quantity of ammonia stored at this facility is 42,500 pounds.\n\n3. The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario, including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\n\nWorst-Case Scenario - Faliure of the high pressure receiver for the old side (south) engine room when filled to the greatest amount allowed would release 8,300 pounds of ammonia.  Company policy limits the maximum filling capacity of this vessel to 60%.  It is assumed that the entire contents are released as vapor over a ten minute time span and are subjected to a wind speed of 1.5 m/s with a stability class of F.  The distance to the toxic endpoint for the worst-case is 1.1 miles.\nAlternative Scenario - The lifting of a pressure relief valve on the ammonia storage vessel for the new side (north) engine room.  Relief valves allow the escape "
