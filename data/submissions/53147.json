      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nChesapeake Energy Marketing, Inc. owns and operates a natural gas compressor station, the Johnson State Compressor Facility, in Reeves County, Texas. The station is designed to process natural gas, during which liquid products are recovered from natural gas. Both petroleum condensates and natural gas liquids are recovered from the inlet pipeline gas in this process for offsite sales.\n\nThe Johnson State Compressor Facility has a long-standing commitment to workers and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by our efforts in accident prevention, such as training personnel, quality assurance, and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our process. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will evaluate the situation, take actions within the capabilities of the facility, and notify the necessary outside agencies.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe Johnson State Compressor Facility is located near Balmorhea, Texas and operates a variety of processes to produce the following petroleum products:\n\n1. Y grade mixture from natural gas\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with a release of flammable substances at Johnson State Compressor Facility is a vapor cloud explosion involving 137,126 pounds (30,000 gallons) of a flammable mixture contained in the product tank. Using the EPA OCA Guidance Equations, the entire inventory is assumed to release and ignite, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion that reaches the 1 psi overpressure point at 0.42 miles. The WCS will affect no public receptors. A consideration of the 0.42 mile radius has been incorporated into our notification and emergency response planning. \n\nChesapeake's management is committed to the following:\n-Preventing accidents;\n-Tra"

      "SummaryText": "ining our employees in correct response procedures in the event of an accident;\n-Participating in community emergency preparedness;\n-Addressing any citizen concerns by fully explaining potential hazards associated with Chesapeake operations and all steps being taken to prevent and mitigate accidents; and\n-Being a good corporate citizen of Reeves County.\n\nWith these objectives in mind, this Risk Management Plan has been developed to provide information about our management of the risks associated with the natural gas treatment and liquids recovery process. Most importantly, we stress our commitment to ensuring a safe operation for our employees, our visitors, and our community. \n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nJohnson State Compressor Facility has had no RMP-regulated substance release during the past five years.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\n\nJohnson State Compressor Facility is a Non-Responding Facility as per 48 CFR 68.90(b). The station maintains a written emergency action plan, which is in place to help protect employees and public safety as well as the environment. The plan identifies steps to be taken in case of an accidental release including: proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs.\n\nEmployees receive training in the procedures to be followed by employees who remain to operate critical station operations before they evacuate. Chesapeake has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate emergency response organizations (Fire Department, Police and Sheriff?s Office). This interface provides the means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident. In addition, Chesapeake conducts periodic emergency drills and annual refresher training for station personnel."
