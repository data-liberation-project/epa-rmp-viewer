As a requirement of the \r\nClean Air Act Amendments 112(r) Accidental Release of Hazardous Air \r\nSubstances program, Global Ethanol Services completed a risk management plan \r\n(RMP) for any chemical stored on-site that will be above the reporting \r\nthreshold of 10,000 pounds.  This information is considered to be public \r\nknowledge and can be accessed through the Environmental Protection Agency \r\nwebsite at  http://www.epa.gov/enviro/index_java.html.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nGlobal Ethanol Services is committed to the protection of its employees, the \r\ngreater community and the environment from hazardous substances used in the \r\nethanol fuel production process, specifically aqueous ammonia. The aqueous \r\nammonia is used for pH control directly in the process feed mixture to \r\nfermentation.   It is the policy of Global Ethanol Services to comply with \r\nall applicable federal, state, and local laws.  In the event of an emergency, \r\nincluding an accidental release of aqueous ammonia, it is the policy of \r\nGlobal Ethanol Services to notify the Blissfield Police & Fire Department \r\nand/or Riga Township Police & Fire Department and/or Lenawee County Sheriff \r\nDepartment and evacuate all employees at the facility.  \r\n\r\nRegulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nThe facility produces fuel grade ethanol from corn and a process by-product \r\nknown as dry distillers' grain with solubles, which is used as a livestock \r\nfeed.  Aqueous ammonia (30% NH3) is stored on-site and used in the ethanol \r\nproduction process for pH control.  The maximum aqueous ammonia stored will \r\nbe 263,829 pounds (35,107 gallons).  \r\n\r\nWorst-Case Scena"

      "SummaryText": "rios\r\n\r\nThe worst-case scenario defined by RMP Guidance is a release of the full \r\ncontents of the tank instantaneously during the most stable atmospheric \r\nconditions, which would be a very unrealistic scenario.  This scenario would \r\nbe a puncture of the aqueous ammonia tank, draining into a diked area inside \r\na building.  According to RMP*Comp, a software tool developed by the U.S. \r\nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration for use in performing off-\r\nsite consequence analysis, the maximum estimated distance from the facility's \r\ncenter to the endpoint is 0.1 mile.  There are 0 estimated human receptors \r\nwithin the 0.1-mile radius of the plant.  The analysis assumed a release of \r\n263,829 pounds of aqueous ammonia (the entire contents of the tank), a wind \r\nspeed of 3.4 miles per hour and an air temperature of 77 degrees F.  This \r\nassumed there are mitigating measures in place.  This facility is in \r\noperation 24 hours per day, 7 days per week and employees would notice the \r\nfirst sign of any small release.    \r\n\r\nAlternative Case Releases\r\n\r\nNo alternative case scenarios were evaluated as this is a Program Level 1 \r\nfacility.\r\n\r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\r\n\r\nThrough completion of this RMP, Global Ethanol Services has complied with the \r\nEPA requirements under 40 CFR Part 68.  Process safety information and \r\noperations/maintenance procedures are documented on-site.  Periodic functions \r\nsuch as process hazard analysis, training, change management and incident \r\ninvestigation are conducted on a regular basis.  Audits of the overall RMP \r\nwill be conducted on a regular basis to assure compliance with EPA \r\nregulations.\r\n\r\nFive Year Accident History\r\n\r\nGlobal Ethanol Services is a new facility and does not have a history of \r\naccidents which may have caused death, injuries, environmental or property \r\ndamage, evacuations or in-place sheltering in the last five years."
