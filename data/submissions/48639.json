All liquid MTS was contained inside the containment bunker.\n\nTraining programs at Trex Hawaii include site-specific instruction and operational technique drills directly related to CVD processing.  8-hour HAZWOPER 1st Responder and SCBA equipment training is on-going, along with monthly drills to keep the response team sharp and proficient in the use response equipment.  New employees receive a comprehensive 2-hour classroom training session in addition to site-specific on the job safety awareness instruction from both management and their peers.

In general, clean up of spills of MTS will be handled by the Trex Hawaii Spill Response Team, however if large releases of MTS product are identified, then the County Hazmat emergency response team will be called in to respond.\n\nA fully integrated gas detection system provides direct support to our ERP by monitoring air quality in all MTS processing areas, providing both a low-level and high-level alarm response.  This system automatically alerts key members of management by cell phone whenever alarms are activated.  Both audible and visual alarms placed strategically throughout the facility alert all employees of any released gases, or conditions that pose a threat to their safety.  The gas detection system central console relays data to the plant Program Logic Control (PLC) system, providing the precise location and severity of any released gases or unsafe conditions.

      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\nTrex Hawaii LLC is a manufacturing and research company that specializes in the development of advanced ceramic and other structured materials.  At this time, the primary product involves the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) of silicon carbide onto graphite substrates to produce an extremely rigid and durable material with many commercial uses.  The CVD process uses Methyltrichlorosilane (MTS) as a feedstock and smaller quantities of inorganic acids and bases, organic solvents, and oils in the process.  The primary hazard with MTS is the evolution of hydrochloric acid (HCl) vapors when exposed to water or humid air.\n\nPlant production and storage containment facilities are located in a small industrial park within the city limits of Lihue, Hawaii. The production plant is a two-story warehouse of approximately 3,600 square feet in size.  The MTS storage containment unit consists of two separate concrete bunkers specifically designed for this purpose.  Each bunker is approximately 780 square feet in size and are located immediately adjacent to the Production Plant.  Included in this containment unit are HCl and combustible gas detection sensors, along with emergency foam suppression and HCl vapor scrubber systems.  The quantity of MTS stored on location will range from 5,000 - 50,000 pounds, depending on production requirements.  MTS is contained and dispensed from 120-gallon pressure-rated portable tanks.  \n\nThe Trex Hawaii LLC Emergency Response Plan (ERP) establishes functions and responsibilities for all employees with respect to detailed response procedures.  This includes early notification to our immediate neighbors, as well as our local emergency response network, including the fire department, the local Civil Defense Agency and the State of Hawaii Department of Health.  It is the objective of Trex Hawaii to handle all possible situations where the safety of its employees, the community, or the environment may be at risk due to the hazards tha"
