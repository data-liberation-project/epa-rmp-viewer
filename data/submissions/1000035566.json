It is the policy of CFC to adhere to all applicable federal and state safety and environmental regulations.\n\n\n\nCFC refrigeration personnel do respond to ammonia releases and have received training in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.120, in addition to training specifically for ammonia.  An emergency plan has been developed covering notification to public safety agencies and the public.  An evacuation plan for the plant has also been developed and all employees receive training on this plan.\n\n\n\nAt CFC anhydrous ammonia is used on-site. Ammonia is considered hazardous by EPA and is listed on the Extremely Hazardous Substance list.  Chemical properties of ammonia make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling ammonia in order to:\n\n* Prevent unnecessary human exposure\n\n* Reduce the threat to our personnel\n\n* Reduce the threat to the community\n\n\n\n\n\nFacility and Regulated Substance Handled\n\nCFC's, Brewster Facility is a fruit processing and cold storage facility located in the city of Brewster, county of Okanogan, state of Washington.\n\n\n\nThe regulated substance used at CFC is anhydrous ammonia (CAS # 7664-41-7).\n\nThe anhydrous ammonia is used as a refrigerant. There is approximately 18,079 \n\npounds of anhydrous ammonia in the Brewster system. The largest vessel could potentially \n\nrelease 4,467 pounds of product.\n\n\n\nWorst-Case and Alternative Scenarios\n\nThe off-site consequence analysis considers two ammonia release scenarios identified as worst case and alternative scenarios.  The worst case scenario is defined by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which states that the owner or operator shall assume that the maximum quantity in the largest vessel is released.  The alternative scenario is defined as more likely to occur than the worst c"

      "SummaryText": "ase scenario.\n\n\n\nWorst-Case Scenario - Failure of the largest vessel would release 4,467 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  The release would occur inside a compressor room, its walls are in direct contact with the outside.  The distance to the toxic end-point of 0.14 mg/L is 0.6 miles.  The risk radius extends past the boundaries of the plant, into public receptor areas. Distance was determined by use of RMP-COMP. \n\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenario - Several alternative scenarios were modeled, using ALOHA, version 5.2.1, a release from a crack, or hole, in an ammonia line under normal operating conditions, was chosen.  This alternative scenario provided the greatest toxic endpoint of 0.2 mi.  Building mitigation was used for this scenario, and it would be located inside the warehouse walls.  \n\n\n\nAll of the above scenarios are unlikely due to the safeties on the system such as temperature and pressure cutouts, computer controls and detectors, as well as pressure relief valves to prevent an overpressure situation.\n\n\n\nA more realistic scenario would be that of a pressure relief valve lifting, discharging ammonia vapor from vents on top of the building, approximately 40 feet above the ground. \n\n\n\nCFC's accidental release prevention program is based on the following key elements:\n\n* Initial and continued training of personnel\n\n* Preventative maintenance programs as described in the PSM\n\n* Use of safety equipment and procedures\n\n* Use of accurate and effective written operating procedures\n\n\n\nCFC complies with:\n\n* OSHA's and Washington State's process safety management rules\n\n* Washington State's safety regulations\n\n* IIAR (International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration) standards for good work practices\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system was installed to standards and local codes at the time of installation.  Piping and equipment is secured and protected; compressor (engine) room doors are generally closed, tight fitting and open outwards.  Other safety systems CFC utilizes "

These procedures are part of the ongoing training.  CFC coordinates its response efforts with Okanogan Co Fire Dist #15, Okanogan Co Sheriff and Okanogan Co Emergency Management.\n\n  \n\nCFC ensures that each employee, who is presently operating the refrigeration process, and each employee who is newly assigned to the refrigeration process, are trained in the operating procedures that pertain to their duties.

Inspection procedures follow recognized and generally accepted good engineering practices.  The frequency of inspections of the process equipment is consistent with the applicable manufacturers recommendations, industry standards or codes, good engineering practices, and prior operating experience.\n\n\n\nCFC has a hot work permit program, complying with PSM of highly hazardous chemicals.  The Refrigeration Supervisor ensures that all hot work done on, or around, the covered process meets the standards of the program. CFC has identified personnel who can authorize the hot work permit, perform the hot work, and personnel who are qualified for fire watch.  These personnel are identified in the Hot Work procedures.
