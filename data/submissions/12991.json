The program provides training for hazardous incident recognition, personnel protection equipment selection and use, characteristics of hazardous chemicals and the methods for response, cleanup and decontamination.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nPlans are continually updated to improve management of chemicals and reduce the risks associated with handling chemical products.\n\nPlan updates are the result of coordination with local responders, inspections by regulatory agencies, training sessions, process changes and new risk management programs and regulations enacted by the government.\n\nPresently all areas are being studied to identify technically, procedurally and economically"

A release occurring during the loading or unloading of packages can be contained to this area.\n\nMaterials stored within buildings are located in areas specific to their hazard class to prevent one group of hazard class from impacting another during an incident.\n\nAll buildings are constructed of poured concrete floors to minimize the possibility of a release contacting the ground and impacting the environment. Equipment used in the areas to move containers is designed for their intended use.\n\nStorage areas are routinely inspected according to a schedule to minimize risks associated with improper material storage.\n\nBuildings are equipped with 24 hour monitoring systems to alert authorities of excessive heat, smoke and fire conditions. Emergency responders are dispatched to the scene by a monitoring service. Intrusion is monitored after hours to prevent unauthorized access to the property.

The product is delivered to the facility on trailers specifically designed to transport the containers.\n\nThe chemical is liquefied under pressure and release from the container is in the form of a gas. The cylinders are equipped with safety mechanisms to minimize the possibility of an accidental release and pressure relief devices are installed should the container be exposed to excessive heat from elevated temperature conditions such as that associated with a fire.\n\nChlorine is shipped off site in small quantities to water treatment facilities using the gas to treat water for the public's use.\n\nThe 150 pound containers are stored in secured racks to prevent accidental damage. The 2000 pound cylinders are stored in an area away from equipment traffic and chemicals that may, during an incident, contribute to a release from these containers.\n\nDuring the summer months when Chlorine use is at its peak there may be up to 2 cylinders of 2000 pound capacity and 40 cylinders of 150 pound capacity.\n\nOnly authorized and trained personnel are permitted to handle the containers.\n\nHydrofluoric Acid 70% Solution\n\nThis liquid arrives at the facility in 55 gallon drums of 500 and 550 pound capacity.
