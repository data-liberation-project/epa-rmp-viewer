The WTP treats river water for the city and rural water customers (12,500) population, at a rate of 1.8 MGD avg. daily flow. The WTP uses Chlorine to disinfect the water, at a feed rate of <7.0 mg/L, applied in two locations.\n\n   The WTP uses Chlorine from one-ton cylinders and maintains a maximum storage of three (3) cylinders on site at any one time. Only one cylinder is connected to the distribution system at a time.  The second cylinder is full and in \"stand-by\" mode until the first cylinder is empty. A thrid cylinder is generally ordered and receivced just before the active cylinder is empty. During the past five years, the only accidental release of Chlorine occurred during the cylinder change-out process when workers did not detect that the seal washer slipped out during the line connection process. The few-second release was stopped by the works, however the incident resulted in reportable injuries.  The facility has changed the process to include confirmation by two workers that the connection is correct.\n\n   The normal cylinder pressure feeds Chlorine to a Wallece and Tiernan 731 Chlorinator machine and then a solution of water and chlorine is piped to one of two points and appiled to the water to kill the pathogenic bacteria. \n\n   The system is engineered to meet industry standards and regulatory requirements.  The City's WTP staff inspects and maintains the system at regular intervals.  Gas sensors have been added to the cylinder area and the Chlorine Injection Room to sound an audible tone alarms in the event of a possible leaks. The Chlorine Injection Room is equipped with two exhaust fans that draw air off the floor area as Cl2 gas is 2.6 times heavier than air. Also both doors have a 2 x 3 foot glass windows for to allow for safe observations of the Chlorine Rooms interior without entry.  At the first indication of a "
