Executive Summary\n\nThis program is intended to meet the spirit and intent of the following regulations:\n- California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program \u0096 Title 19 CCR, Chapter 4.5\n- Federal EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) \u0096 Title 40 CFR \u00a768\n- California Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 8 CCR \u00a75189\n- Federal Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 29 CFR \u00a71910.119\n\nHereafter this program will be referred to as the RMP-PSM program.\n\nThis program is intended to be a \u0093living document\u0094. As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible and updated as necessary. To accomplish this, Swift Cold Storage, LLC has elected to use PSMWriter, software developed and distributed by Resource Compliance, Inc. This software will assist us with updating, maintaining, scheduling, and tracking RMP-PSM related activities. \n\n1.1 Swift Cold Storage, LLC, Risk and Process Safety Management Program\n\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that Swift Cold Storage, LLC has updated their unified RMP-PSM Program. This program has been prepared to address the risks involved in operating and maintaining the following processes which have the presence of hazardous chemicals above threshold quantities: \n\nProcess Name                       Process Chemical                  Process Quantity(lbs.)\nProcess 1 (East)                    Anhydrous Ammonia           26,000\nProcess 2 (West)                   Anhydrous Ammonia           28,000\n\nOur RMP-PSM program promotes overall plant, worker, and public safety. The program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of hazardous chemicals.

Organized the program so that it meshes closely with general business practices\n3. Utilized PSMWriter software to ensure that all necessary employees have access to relevant information (SOPs, PHAs, audits, etc.)\n\nThe RMP-PSM program sets forth rules, procedures, and practices that will help our employees and neighbors protect themselves.\n\n1.2 Process Descriptions\n\n1.2.1 Facility Overview\n\nSwift Cold Storage, LLC operates a commercial cold storage for bread and various other goods in Fresno, CA. The facility has two ammonia refrigeration systems that provide refrigeration capacity to the following:\nP1 - East System\n(14) Cold Storage Rooms\n(1) Tray Pack Room\n\nP2 - West System\n(1) Loading Dock\n(2) Freezers\n(1) Receiving Dock\n(1) Blast Cell Corridor\n(12) Blast Cells\n(1) Deslatting Room\n\n1.2.2 Facility Location\nSwift Cold Storage, LLC is located at 2950 East California Avenue, Fresno, CA 93721. The latitude and longitude of the largest high pressure receiver is 36.720673, -119.774579. The facility is located approximately 1/2 mile east of state highway 41 in an industrial area surrounded primarily by various businesses.\n\nAccording to FEMA Flood Map Service, the facility is partly located in \u0093an area of minimal flood hazard\u0094 and partly located in a \u0093special flood hazard area\u0094. The elevation of the machinery rooms were designed with the flood hazards in mind.\n\nSwift Cold Storage, LLC is not located in an Alquist-Priolo Fault Zone as defined by the California Department of Conservation. In addition, a review of United States Geological Survey (USGS) fault maps revealed that there are no faults in close proximity to the site. The USGS 2018 One-Year Model revealed that Swift Cold Storage, LLC has a 1-2% chance of experiencing \u0093potentially minor-damage\u0094 due to ground shaking in 2018.\n\n1.2.3 Description of Covered Processes\nThe refrigerated areas are equipped with air-cool"

During these meetings we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\n\nSwift Cold Storage, LLC has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the ammonia refrigeration processes. These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release. The results of the analyses are reported in PSMWriter and hard copy binders. \n\n1.3.2 Anhydrous Ammonia\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration processes at the Swift Cold Storage, LLC facility is an integral part of the overall business and operates most of the year. The ammonia processes contain a total charge of approximately 54,000 LBS. It is extremely important that each process is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner. Management is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.\n\nOur refrigeration personnel monitor the ammonia refrigeration processes and keep active records of all procedures and transactions that pertain to ammo"

      "SummaryText": "By utilizing PSMWriter software, all necessary employees have access to every aspect of the RMP-PSM program. This has improved Swift Cold Storage, LLC\u0092s ability to communicate hazardous situations to employees and contractors. In addition, PSMWriter tracks all RMP-PSM related events so that Swift Cold Storage, LLC\u0092s management team can ensure that the RMP-PSM program is being implemented.\n\nSwift Cold Storage, LLC has implemented all aspects of the RMP-PSM program. When a RMP-PSM program requirement is completed (i.e. mechanical integrity inspection, process hazard analysis, compliance audit, etc.) any specific action items related to that event are entered into PSMWriter, assigned a responsible person, and given a due date. Once the action item has been completed, the resolution can be documented using PSMWriter as well. A list of current or past due action items can be accessed at any time by those with access to PSMWriter.\n\nIn addition to utilizing PSMWriter to create, schedule, track, and document events, Swift Cold Storage, LLC has also entered into a contract with Resource Compliance to obtain help with RMP-PSM program implementation.\n\nFor the future, Swift Cold Storage, LLC now thinks of the RMP-PSM program as a \u0093living document\u0094. It is an interactive framework that guides safe action for Swift Cold Storage, LLC employees, but allows for feedback and continual improvement. Through the RMP-PSM program Swift Cold Storage, LLC will continue to maintain overall plant worker and public safety."
