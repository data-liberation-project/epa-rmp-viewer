Facility Policy\n\nThe owners, management and employees of Western Iowa Coop are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia or propane.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.    Facility Information\n\nThe primary activity at our anhydrous ammonia facilities is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  The primary activity of our propane facilities is the storage and resale of propane to our member patrons.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for both direct application and for blending into mixed grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients.  Propane is stored and delivered to member patrons for use in heating and grain drying.\n\n\n\n    \n\n \n\nThe maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia stored (85% of capacity) varies by location:\n\nTank Size (gallons)    Pounds\n\nBlencoe, IA        30,000            131,325                \nCorrectionville, IA     25,000            109,438            \nHornick, IA        11,000             48,152\n11,000             48,152\n12,000             52,530\nTotal        34,000            148,834\n\n  8,000             35,020\n\nPierson, IA        12,000             52,350\n30,000            131,325    \nTotal        42,000            183,675\n\nSloan            25,000            109,438\n\nWashta        18,000             78,795\n\nThe maximum quantity of propane stored (85% of capacity) varies by location:\n\nTank Size (gallons)    Pounds\n\nBlencoe, IA        28,000             99,996                \nCorrectionville, IA     26,000             92,820            \nHornick, IA        18,000             64,260\n\nPierson, IA        18,000             64,260\n18,000             64,260\nTotal        36,000            128,520\n\n Washta        12,000             42,840\n\nMoville        18,000            64,260\n3.

The Five Year Accident History\n\nWestern Iowa Coop has had one accidental release of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years.\n\n- 12-24-98: 118,450 pounds were released; the town of Blencoe was evacuated. This incident occurred when a railroad car derailed, hitting the anhydrous ammonia tank, shearing off the piping, including the excess flow valve.  No deaths, injuries, environmental damage or property damage occurred, except to our storage tank and the railroad car.\n\nWestern Iowa Coop has had no accidental releases of propane in the last five years that: have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage; not to our knowledge have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\n6.    The Emergency Response Program.    \n\nWestern Iowa Coop has:\na.    a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\nb.    provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and Community Right to Know information as required under SARA Title II (EPCRA).\n\nc.
