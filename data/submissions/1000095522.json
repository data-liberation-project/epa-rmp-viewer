The Facility Policy:\r\n\r\nThe owners, management, and employees of Equity Exchange - Turpin East, Turpin, OK are committed to the\r\nprevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the\r\nfacility is prepared to work with the local fire department, and other authorities, to mitigate any release and\r\nminimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\r\n\r\n2. Facility Information:\r\n\r\n\u00b7 The primary activity at the facility is the storage of fertilizers for sale to farmers.\r\n\u00b7 Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for the direct application of fertilizers for crop\r\nproduction nutrients.\r\n\u00b7 The maximum quantity stored would be 130,000 pounds in our one 30,000 gallon storage tank.\r\n\r\n3. The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario:\r\n\r\na. The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank \r\nreleased as a gas over 10 minutes. The maximum quantity released would be 130,000 pounds, which\r\nrepresents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards. The\r\ndistance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 6.9 miles.\r\n\r\nb. The alternative release scenario based on the five-year accident history (or the most likely potential\r\nincident) is a release from a break in a transfer hose. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200\r\nppm) is 1.30 miles.\r\n\r\n4. The accidental release prevention program:\r\nThe facility has referred to the provisions of Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous\r\nAmmonia, Kk-611.1, published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the\r\nU.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, Storage and ha"
