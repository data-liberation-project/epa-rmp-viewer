No Program 1 or 2 processes containing regulated substances were identified at the refinery. Our accidental release prevention programs and emergency planning and response programs help us effectively manage the hazards posed by our regulated substances to our employees, the public, and the environment. \n\nB. GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION MEASURES\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention programs in place at Eagle Point Refinery.  The covered process at the refinery is regulated by the EPA RMP regulation 40 CFR Part 68, as well as NJDEP Toxic Catastrophe Prevention Act program N.J.A.C. 7:31 (1-6) and the OSHA Process Safety Management standard 29CFR 1910.119.  The following summary addresses the combined elements of these three programs and describes the activities surrounding the implementation of each element. These programs constitute the framework by which process safety and accident prevention are managed in the refinery.  \n\n1. Employee Participation\n\nThe Eagle Point Refinery involves employees in the programs developed to support process safety management and accident prevention.  Employees are included in every element of the program, from development, to active participation, to program updates.  They are members of the process hazard analysis (PHA) team, the compliance audit team and make up the safety and emergency response teams. They implement the mechanical integrity, operator training and contractor safety programs.  Employees have access to information created as part of this accident prevention program.   \n\n2."

      "SummaryText": " Process Safety Information\n\nProcess Safety Information (PSI) is compiled for each process unit and is made available to all personnel involved with or affected by that process unit.  PSI includes information pertaining to the hazards of the highly hazardous chemicals used or produced by the process, information pertaining to the technology of the process, and information pertaining to the equipment in the process.  This information is essential for supporting all of the other elements of our accidental release prevention programs. \n\n3. Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) with Risk Assessments\n\nProcess Hazards Analyses (PHAs) are performed by experienced employee teams for each covered process unit. Our PHA teams are composed of personnel with engineering and process operating experience and a trained PHA team leader. Studies are conducted according to an established schedule, and each study is updated/revalidated at least every five years (or more often if necessary because of process changes). These comprehensive studies systematically review each unit to identify and assess hazards in the design or operation of the units.  Additional controls are recommended for any unmitigated hazards that are identified. Results of the PHAs are documented in reports that are made available to personnel. \n\n4. Standard Operating Procedures\n\nWritten standard operating procedures are developed and implemented for all refinery process units.  The procedures describe the detailed steps to carry out the principal modes of operation and are designed and implemented for a safe, reliable and environmentally sound operation. Procedures are used to (1) train our personnel before they perform tasks in the field, (2) serve as reference guides for personnel performing tasks, (3) specify what to do if a process upset or operating emergency occurs and (4) provide reference guides in the startup and shutdown of equipment. These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and"

When an emergency call is received by telephone or radio, the dispatcher at Security Headquarters has the ability to activate alarms that signal various refinery personnel to take action.  The level of response to the emergency is then adjusted as appropriate to the incident.  The dispatcher at Security Headquarters has the ability to telephone the local Fire Department to request assistance or advise on the status of an emergency in progress. The Fire Department and the Police Department would use this information to make decisions on advising the public to evacuate or shelter in place.\n\nA vitally important part of the plant emergency organization is the Emergency Response Team (ERT).  The ERT is made up of full-time emergency response employees, as well as employee volunteers from various refinery departments.  The ERT provides the personnel resources for a rapid and effective emergency response.  While most refinery employees receive an \"incipient responder\" level of emergency response training, ERT members train and drill on a monthly basis.  Training and drill sessions include instruction and hands-on practice in the use of fire extinguishers, advanced interior and exterior fire fighting techniques, hazardous material response, confined space and high angle rescue, emergency medical response, the Emergency Response Programs and implementation of the Incident Command System.  \n\nThe refinery also maintains its own dedicated emergency response equipment.
