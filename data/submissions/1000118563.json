The facility recognizes that quick response to an incident is instrumental in assuring protection of the environment, community, and employees. To assist with this, the facility utilizes numerous engineering and administrative controls for early detection, communication, and response to incidents.\n\nEmergency Response Programs and Measures:\n\nThe facility employs numerous engineering and administrative controls to ensure the chance of a hazardous material release is minimized. Engineering controls which aid in the identification and/or communication of such incidents including atmospheric leak detection systems, portable atmospheric detection equipment, facility alarm and siren systems, public address systems, two-way radios, phones, and computers.\n\nAdministrative controls include an Emergency Response plan, Spill Prevention plan, Emergency Notification procedures, and Emergency Shutdown procedures. An exercise testing the response plan and the communication procedures is conducted annually and a critique is held following the event.\n\nThe site has an emergency response team which consists of employees who have been trained in the areas of fire fighting, hazardous materials response, rescue, and injury treatment. Larger emergency response activities are coordinated under the Shift Safety Coordinator.\n\nEmergency preplanning and response coordination with external agencies and responders is accomplished via membership and/or participation in organizations such as the Baton Rouge Area Mutual Aid Society and the North Baton Rouge Chemical Industry Task Force.\n\nThe facility is part of an emergency hotline network, through which a system is in place to notify our immediate industrial neig"

Additionally, there are fire hose houses which contain fire hose, fire water nozzles, and various wrenches and adapters that provide mobile fire fighting capability. The site also has a fire truck and foam trailer which can be utilized by the emergency response team members. Additional fire water capacity can be accessed through a neighboring industry's fire water system if required.\n\nFor hazardous materials incidents, a supply of emergency equipment is kept on-hand, such as but not limited to, protective clothing, fresh air systems, capping kits, absorbent pads, leak dams, etc. The facility can also utilize the services of contract leak mitigation services as required.\n\nFive Year Accident History:\n\nThe facility has had no releases in the last 5 years which require RMP reporting within the criteria specified by the Risk Management rule.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\nThe facility operates under a credo of continuous improvement and planned changes include such things as program enhancements, procedural evaluations, and other items as identified through various internal mechanisms, as warranted.\n\nFacility RMP-Covered Process Unit Descriptions:\n\nVinyl Chloride Monomer (VCM) Unit Process Description\n\nThe VCM Unit produces VCM from 1,2-dichloroethane (EDC) and chlorine. EDC is fed to furnaces where it is converted to VCM and hydrochloric acid (HCI). A series of columns, heat exchangers, and vessels, interconnected by piping and ancillary transfer equipment, are used to purify the VCM to required specifications for use as a produced feedstock. Several by-products, such as HCl and unreacted EDC, are recycled for reuse in the process, with a small portion o"

Feedstocks and finished products are stored in tanks. Raw materials may be received via barge, truck, and rail. Rail cars and tank trucks are used to deliver finished products to customers from the facility. The VCM Unit also maintains necessary utilities equipment to aid in process operations, such as cooling towers and control and recovery devices. Incinerators at the FPC Baton Rouge Facility receive vent streams from reactors, columns, and tanks as well as vents from decontamination of equipment in the VCM Unit and other parts of the facility. As part of the incinerator systems, there are also hydrochloric acid (HCI) absorber towers and caustic scrubber columns used to recover and remove HCI and chlorine.\n\nIn May 2024 the VCM unit started up a new HAPF project that utilizes VCM distillation bottoms to provide acid and energy recovery. The HAPF consists of a combustion chamber, a waste heat boiler, an acid absorber system, a packed bed scrubber, an induced draft (ID) fan, an exhaust stack, and also includes a distillation process to concentrate the acid to nearly 100 percent HCl.\n\nPolyvinyl Chloride (PVC) Unit Process Description\n\nThe PVC Unit produces PVC using suspension polymerization. The plant currently produces several grades of suspension PVC.\n\nPolymerization occurs in batch reactors to convert the VCM charged in each batch to PVC in a water slurry. The unreacted VCM gas is recovered from the reactors for recycle. The PVC slurry is pumped to blowdown tanks, where additional unreacted VCM flashes overhead to be reclaimed by condensation. The blowdown tanks also serve as holding tanks for continuous feed of the slurry stripping columns Residual VCM is steam stripped from the PVC slurry in slurry stripping columns.

The stripped PVC slurry is then pumped through heat exchangers to dryer feed holding tanks and centrifuges, where the slurry is dewatered and the PVC wet cake is produced. Water is pumped to the biotreatment plant. PVC wet cake is dried in either cyclone or fluidized bed dryers. Air vented from the cyclone dryers is passed through a water scrubber and PVC resin is screened by sieves and pneumatically conveyed to storage silos. Each silo vent is controlled with a bag or cartridge filter dust collector. Rail cars and trucks are used to deliver finished products to customers from the facility.  The PVC Unit also maintains necessary utilities equipment to aid in process operations, such as cooling towers and recovery devices.\n\nIn August of 2024, the PVC unit initiated start-up of an expansion project that will result in an increase in PVC production capacity.   The project involved the addition of reactors, a dryer, columns, tanks, a cooling tower, chillers, and associated ancillary equipment."
