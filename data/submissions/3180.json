Facility accidental release and emergency response policy.\n     The management and employees of Corn Belt FS, Inc. - Wapella Plant are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n2.  The stationary source and the regulated substances handled.\n     The premary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.  Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.\n     The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia that can be stored would be 250,000 pounds, this would include the nurse tanks normally stored there.\n3.  The worst case release scenario and the alternative release scenario.\n     The worst case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 140,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank as limited by design standards.\n     The distance to the endpoint of .14 mg/L for the worst-case scenario is 1.1 mile.\n     The alternative release scenario based on the most likely potential incident is a release from a break in a transfer hose.\n     The distance to the endpoint of .14 mg/L for the alternative dscenario is .19 mile.  This release has the possibility  of extending beyond the facility boundary.\n4.  The accidental release prevention program.\n     This facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.

Five-year accident history\n     The following is a list of accidental releases in the past five years that have occurred at the facility in which injury on site did occur:\n          We had an accidental release of 2.65 pounds of anhydrous ammonia on April 12, 1996.  One employee was contacted by the small amount and received emergency room treatment only.  \n           We had an accidental release of 2.65 pounds of anhydrous ammonia on October 5, 1998.  One employee had contact with the released product and received emergency room treatment only.\n6.  The emergency response program.\n     The facility has:\n          -  a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38;\n          -  provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know\n             information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA);\n          -  a written emergency response plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.120,\n             including pre-emergency planning and employee training.\n7.  Planned changes to improve safety.\n     Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to access the mainmentance of safe conditions.  There are no specific safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
