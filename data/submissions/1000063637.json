      "SummaryText": "ITW Pro Brands (fka LPS Laboratories) is located at 4647 Hugh Howell Road in Tucker, Georgia. This is a manufacturing facility that packages aerosol cleaners, lubricants, and corrosion inhibitors used in industrial applications. There is one 12,000-gallon tank and one 6,800-gal tank on the property that store two LPG blends used as aerosol propellants. The aerosol filling process that uses these hydrocarbon blends is conducted in an enclosed gas house that is equipped with leak detection, explosion suppression and emergency shutdown system. It is ITW Pro Brands' policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws to prevent an accidental release. Our worst case scenario would affect the surrounding industrial area within a 0.30 mile radius. There are no schools, hospitals, or residences within that distance and no environmental receptors would be affected. The alternate case scenario would affect the surrounding industrial area within a 0.03 mile radius. ITW Pro Brands has never had an accident involving LPG propellant that caused death, injury, or property or environmental damage. The facility was designed to comply with the NFPA 30B, 1994 edition, \"Code for the Manufacture and Storage of Aerosol Products\" and NFPA 58, 2014 edition, \"Liquefied Petroleum Gas Code\". The aerosol filling process is compliant with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations. If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the Dekalb County Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency. We have discussed this policy with the fire department and members of the fire department have inspected our LPG system and toured our facility. The fire department is prepared with the equipment and trained personnel to respond effectively to an emergency involving a release of LPG propellant. We have no plans at this time to change our safety processes and procedures."
