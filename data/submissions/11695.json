      "SummaryText": "\nSchwan's has historically placed a high priority on chemical \nsafety. The corporate environmental compliance manager has been \nassigned overall responsibility for chemical safety in general and \nfor ammonia refrigeration safety in particular since 1991. \nSchwan's maintains 3 - shift coverage of emergency responders \ntrained to the 24-hour technician level at all facilities with \nammonia refrigeration systems covered by this rule.\n\nThe Florence, KY facility manufactures frozen pizza. Anhydrous \nammonia is used in the refrigeration system at this facility. \nAmmonia is the most efficient and environmentally compatible \nrefrigerant available. Although it is toxic at high concentration \nand is an irritating gas, it is not a cumulative metabolic poison, \ndoes not cause cancer or other dread diseases and does not cause \nlasting environmental damage. The refrigeration system at this \nfacility contains about 145,000 pounds of ammonia.\n\nSchwan's calculates ammonia worst case release scenarios using the \nModel RMP for Ammonia Refrigeration, May 1996. All Schwan's \nmanufacturing facilities are located in areas that meet the \ndefinition of \"urban\". Schwan's has chosen to calculate worst case \nrelease poundage for the largest high-pressure receiver in the \nsystem, filled to full calculated hydraulic capacity. Reduced \nvolume for administrative controls was not used, since the \ndescribed scenario would probably occur only as a result of a \ncatastrophic vessel rupture caused by a total filling of the \nvessel, closure of all vessel block valves, failure of all \npressure relief valves, with a simultaneous increase in liquid \ntemperature sufficient to overpressure the vessel to the point of \nfailure.\n\nIt is the professional judgement of Schwans Environmental Health \nand Safety Department that a release rate of 400 lb./min. should \nbe used as an alternate case scenario in lieu of the 100 lb./min. \nrate suggested in the Model RMP. \n\nThe \"urban\" site condition will be used.\n\nBased on t"

      "SummaryText": "he above, the worst-case ammonia release scenario for \nthe Florence, KY facility will be 42,000 pounds released over a \n10-minute period. The alternate case will be a release rate of 400 \npounds per minute. Both scenarios have off-site impacts.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is covered by the OSHA Process \nSafety Management (PSM) rule, 29 CFR 1910.119.\n\nThe Florence, KY facility maintains a 3-shift emergency response \nteam, trained at the 24-hour technician level. The team numbers 27 \nmembers. The training is conducted by the Corporate Environmental \nCompliance Manager. The training is designed with a heavy emphasis \non ammonia safety, mechanical isolation, personal protective \nequipment up to use of Level `A' suits and interaction with an \nincident command system (ICS). Copies of emergency plans are filed \nwith the Fire Department and annual facility walkthroughs are \nconducted with Fire Officers. Preplanned command posts and staging \nareas have been designated and Incident Command transfer and \nliaison functions have been established. A post-incident \ndebriefing is conducted after each incident. The Plant is fenced, \na 24 hour/day, 7 days/week outside security contractor is on-site. \nThe facility refrigeration team is on-duty 24 hours/day, 7 \ndays/week. System inventory is kept at the minimum level \nconsistent with maintaining safe operations. Vessel inventory \nlevels are maintained as low as possible consistent with safe \noperating practice.\n\nSince a continuous improvement philosophy is deeply imbedded in \nthe Schwan's corporate culture, improvements in system safety are \nimplemented as a result of employee-based Total Quality Management \n(TQM) teams, a designated PSM team and as a result of system \nengineering modifications and extensions. Post incident \ndebriefings and incident investigations are used to identify \nadditional improvements to system safety.\n"
