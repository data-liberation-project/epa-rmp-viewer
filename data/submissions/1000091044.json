Executive Summary\n\n\n\n- Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nFresh Express, Harrisburg, PA Facility is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety. This commitment is inherent to our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance and employee training associated with our regulated process. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible accidental releases of regulated substances. However, if such an accidental release does occur, we are coordinated with off-site emergency response support.\n\n\n\n- The stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nPresently Anhydrous Ammonia is the only RMP regulated substance present at this facility in a threshold quantity. It is utilized as the primary cooling media in out closed loop refrigeration system. The system's purpose is to provide refrigeration for the process, cold storage and distribution operations. Due to the characteristics of our ammonia refrigeration system, as well as the Process Safety Management (PSM) applicability, Fresh Express is covered under Program 3 of the RMP Regulations.\n\n\n\n- The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nFresh Express has taken all necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set forth in 40 CFR Part 68. Fresh Express is also subject to the OSHA PSM Standard under 29 CFR 1910.119, as well as the EPCRA Section 302 and 311/312 notification and reporting requirements.\n\n\n\n- Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\nFresh Express is included in the written community emergency response plan.  The facility has its own emergency action plan.  The emergency action plan includes procedures for informing the public and local response agencies of a chemical release.  The emergency action plan also includes information on emergency health care.\n\n\n\nFresh Expres"
