The toxicity of chlorine at high concentrations make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions to prevent unnecessary human exposure, and to reduce the threat to the personal health of our employees as well as nearby members of the community. It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State rules and regulations. Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle chlorine. Safety devices are incorporated in the design of the facility.  In addition, we train of our personnel in the safe operation of our facility and we follow safe handling procedures. \r\n\r\nEagle's emergency response program is designed to effectively respond to an accidental release of chlorine. The emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of the Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC), the Washington Department of Ecology, and the National Response Center. \r\n\r\n2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances \r\nThe regulated substance handled at the Longview facility is chlorine. The facility produces chlorine by passing an electrical current through a salt-water brine, liberating chlorine and hydrogen from the water. The chlorine is then cooled, dried, and compressed.  Some of the compressed chlorine is used to produce hydrochloric acid in the HCl Synthesis Units and the remainder is liquefied. The liquefied chlorine is loaded into rail cars and shipped by rail. There is no fixed chlorine storage on site. \r\n\r\nAccess to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors. \r\n\r\n3. Accidental Release Prevention Program\r\nEagle US 2 LLC complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations. This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with all applicable chlorine storage and handlin"

Emergency Response Program\r\nEagle's emergency response program is based upon an accidental release of chlorine. This program has been discussed with the Cowlitz County Emergency Management and the local Fire Department."
