The facility is complying with OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, and EPA's Risk Management Program rule. The purpose of these regulations is to ensure that the covered process (aerosol packaging) is designed, operated and maintained safely. Compliance with these regulations helps to prevent releases from this process. Additionally, these regulations require development of procedures to minimize releases in the event that they do occur, and to outline appropriate emergency response steps to take in the event of a release.\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES:  Accra Pac Inc., located at 2730 Middlebury Street, Elkhart, Indiana, offers full service custom packaging for various consumer product industries, such as pharmaceutical, household, cosmetic, personal care, and automotive care. The products packaged for these industries consist of liquids, semi-liquid creams, lotions, and aerosols. Some of the types of products that Accra Pac packages include: hair mousse, cooking sprays, household cleaners, tire cleaners, air fresheners, breath spray, etc. Many of these products are aerosols and use a flammable gas like propane to pressurize the containers so that the desired product can be sprayed from the aerosol cans. The regulated chemicals used as propellants in the aerosol packaging process are:\n\n   Butane (CAS No. 106-97-8);\n   Difluoroethane (CAS No. 75-37-6):\n   Dimethylether (Methyl ether) (CAS No. 115-10-6);\n   Isobutane (CAS No. 75-28-5);\n   Propane (CAS No. 74-98-6);\n\nAdditionally, the following chemicals are not normally present at the facility, but may be utilized as propellants should product specifications require:\n\n   Pentane (CAS No. 109-66-0); and\n   Isopentane (CAS No. 78-78-4).\n\nProcess equipment includes propellant storage tanks, a tank"

This Risk Management Plan includes all processes performed at the North and Main Plant (properties on the north side of Middllebury Street) and aerosol packaging performed at the HCI facility (properties on the south side of Middlebury Street.) The HCI process contains more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance ONLY when a tanker of propellant is used to feed directly to the aerosol packaging process. Due to the nature of the operations, involving variable types and quantities of regulated substances, this Risk Management Plan involves Predictive Filing.\n\nRELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM:  Accra Pac maintains a Process Safety Management program for its aerosol packaging process operation and maintenance. The PSM program has been incorporated as both policy, and most importantly, procedure in everyday operations and maintenance of the aerosol packaging process. Some of the safety measures that are in place to ensure the safety of Accra Pac employees and the surrounding community include:\n\n   Gas dectection systems are installed in  areas where there is a potential for hazardous levels of flammable gas to accumulate.\n   State of the art explosion suppression systems have been installed in all areas where flammable gas is transferred to aerosol containers. These systems are designed to detect and extinguish an ignition before a catastrophic explosion can occur.\n   All storage tanks that store hazardous materials are inspected on a periodic basis.\n   Periodic inspections are performed to ensure that all process equipment is adequately grounded. This  reduces the chance of hazardous static electricity discharge that could ignite flammable vapors.\n   Tankers are equipped with emergency shutdown capability, adding to the safety of the unloading process.\n   Pressure relief valves are installed on the storage tanks and piping systems.\n   Standardized operating procedures are utilized for unloading and"

Contingency Plan and Emergency Procedures has been developed in concert with the Elkhart Fire Department and Elkhart County Local Emergency Planning Committee. The plan addresses fire, explosion, spills and releases of chemicals, severe weather, and other criteria. The plan details actions to be taken by Accra Pac for such emergencies, safety equipment, communication responsibilities, and coordination with off-site responders. The Accra Pac emergency response program is based on the OSHA requirements for Emergency Action Plans (29 CFR 1910.38 and 1910.119), RCRA Contingency Plan (40 CFR 265.5) and HAZWOPER (29 CFR 1910.120). We have trained our employees for emergency response action and maintain a written response plan. The plan has been coordinated with the Elkhart Fire Department and Elkhart County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY: The facility is continually working to improve safety in all areas.  The facility encourages input from operation and maintenance personnel, as well as vendor and agency inspectors, and responds to address potential improvements. The facility places a high emphasis upon training of personel in the areas of safety and environmental awareness, compliance, and response."
