      "SummaryText": "Coors Ceramics Company - Chattanooga Operations has a unique process involving anhydrous ammonia.  Ammonia storage consists of a storage facility to keep the ammonia on site for its continuous use as a fuel for the firing of the furnaces and the kilns.  The ammonia is first piped to a preheater to warm the liquid and then to a unit where it is converted into elemental hydrogen and nitrogen.  The hydrogen is piped into the kiln for use as a fuel, while the nitrogen is used as a purge gas to prevent oxygen from entering the system.  This process has been operated in its current configeration for 17 years.\n\nAmmonia is stored and used on site by Coors Ceramics Company at the Chattanooga, TN facility in quantities that exceed the threshold quanity for ammonia as defined by the Risk Management Program regulations.  Coors Ceramics Company has diligently developed and implemented a comprehensive Risk Management Program, assessing the hazards associated with the process, as well as implementing procedures which minimize the the probability and severity of an ammonia release.\n\nWe have not had an accident in the past five years involving ammonia that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or shelterings in place.  An OSHA Process Safety Management Program is currently implemented for the ammonia process.  Furthermore, the facility complies with the EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.\n\nOur worst-case scenario is the unlikely failure of the ammonia storage tank during a time in which the maximum amount of ammonia is stored in it.  The resulting distance to the endpoint extends offsite, and public receptors are within the distance to the endpoint.  Our alternative release scenario is a valve leak.  The resulting distance to the endpoint extends offsite, and public receptors are withihn the distance to the endpoint.  \n\nIn the event of an emergency involving the ammonia process, it is our policy t"
