      "SummaryText": "Tampa Bay Fisheries, Inc. continues to upgrade the operator engineer training, ammonia refrigeration equipment, and the safety leadership to ensure safe and efficient operation of the facility in compliance with E.P.A. and OSHA REGULATIONS. Our goal continues to be zero accidents, zero spills and releases.                                   \n\nOur RMP and Process Safety Management program is constantly being reviewed as our facility is undergoing many improvements and personnel changes in our ammonia refrigeration department. Along with the physical changes to our facility, our personnel are being trained on the new as well as existing processes. The installation of more sophisticated control points to the ammonia refrigeration system will help us reach and keep our goal at zero.\n\nThe Process Hazard Analysis is also one of the corner stones to a safe operating facility. As our processes change each will trigger a change in the PHA which will carry through to the PSM program and the RMP. We are pleased to use the tools as outlined above to keep Tampa Bay Fisheries, Inc mitigating the risks associated with ammonia.\n \n We have also improved the freezer dedicated engine room, along with improvements to the existing main engine room. Monitoring lights and high-level indicators as well as high level cut outs and automatic ammonia shut off to king valves installed.  Area lighting has been upgraded.\n\n On 12/14/2024 our facility was audited by our state compliance team. The outcome was very informative and provided an opportunity to improve our Risk Management Program. We continue to look at our procedures and training in the event \"what if\" happens.\n\n\nNick Adams, Manager"
