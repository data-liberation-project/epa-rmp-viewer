Disabled individuals will be rendered assistance.  The City Police will blockade the affected areas and re-direct traffic accordingly.  The area Red Cross will be contacted to aid in caring for the misplaced persons.  Shelter facilities will be provided at the Center High School gym, Moffitt Primary School campus, Hillcrest Baptist Church, and/or Shelbyville High School as necessary.  News media will be contacted to give details as to  evacuation and shelters.  When the emergency is over, the same officials will aid the returning evacuees to their homes and businesses.

It is the policy of the City of Center to provide a safe environment for its employees and the members of the surrounding community.  The chlorine system utilized at this facility is managed and maintained in such a manner as to minimize any release of harmful chemicals.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. FACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES - The regulated chemical in use that this wastewater treatment plant is chlorine.  This chemical is utilized to disinfect the facility's treated effluent prior to discharge to Cedar Creek (as required by its discharge permit issued by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality).  Chlorine is purchased for use at this facility in one ton (2,000 lb) cylinders.  The facility will have no more than three of these cylinders (6,000 lbs total) on site during the normal course of operation.  \r\n\r\nPlease note that Sulfur Dioxide was also utilized at this facility in the past but has been phased out for this facility.  Sulfur dioxide is no longer used or stored at this facility.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. GENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM - Supervisors and employees routinely walk over the plant site and discuss the potential hazards in the work place.  New employees are taken on a tour of the plant site as part of their orientation at which time they are shown the potential hazards that exist.  In addition, OSHA approved material safety data sheets are utilized in employee training and are kept on hand at the facility for quick reference in the event of an emergency.  \r\n\r\nPersonnel are required to attend regularly scheduled training sessions.  These sessions are conducted by supervisors, fire department, police department, local emergency planning personnel, insurance experts, or other people who are well informed in responding to emergency chemical releases.  Records of these meetings are documented and kept on file.\r\n\r\nEquipment"

Written procedures and schedules (as well as any agreements with contractors) are kept on file at the facility.  In addition, reports are generated on the date of the most recent review or revision of the maintenance procedures and the most recent equipment inspection or test.\r\n\r\nAt three year intervals an inspection will be conducted to review potential hazards associated with the chemicals stored for use by the facility.  Plant personnel familiar with the processes involved will conduct the audit.  Opportunities for equipment malfunction or human error that could cause a release will be noted.  Safeguards to control the potential hazards or prevent the malfunction will be developed and implemented as a result of the audits.  Furthermore, steps will be taken to detect or monitor releases.  A written report will be made to document that all problems have been addressed.  The compliance audit checklist and procedures will be modified whenever there is a change in process.  Any problems associated with the modified process will be corrected before the process occurs.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY - There have been no accidents or release incidents at the facility in the last five years.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM - Should a chlorine incident occur at the facility, the employees will immediately put on their breathing apparatus during and Emergency 911 will be called to standby.  After assessing the situation, if the event is determined to be minor in the judgment of the operator, repairs will proceed immediately.  \r\n\r\nHAZMAT teams will be contacted in the event of a worst-case scenario or similarly serious event.  However, since the closest such team is over an hour away, it is most likely that the material will be allowed to escape to the atmosphere prior to their arrival on scene.  In the interim"
