Within this program, each process is\nsystematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to\nmanage these hazards.\n\nThe gas plant primarily uses the Checklist technique to perform these evaluations.  The\nanalyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience\nas well as engineering expertise.  The team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well\nas accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional\nprevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nThe PHA team findings are sent to local and corporate management for resolution. \nImplementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is guided by a relative risk\nranking assigned by the PHA team.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team\nfindings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented\nand retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate\nsignificantly from the original design safety features, the plant periodically updates and\nrevalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five\nyears and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.

Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that\nadequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls\nhave not been compromised by the change.  Chemical hazard information, process operating\nlimits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these\nchanges.

These procedures are\nreadily available in the process unit for operators and other personnel to use as necessary to\nsafely perform their job task.\n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Trinidad Gas Plant has\nimplemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a\nprocess.  New employees receive basic training in gas plant operations if they are not already\nfamiliar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is\npaired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators\ndemonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the\nduties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all\noperators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their\nskills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted\nat least every three years.  This training is documented for each operator, including the means\nused to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nContractors\n\nThe Trinidad Gas Plant uses contractors to supplement its work force during periods of increased\nmaintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process\nequipment, the gas plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work\nin a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge an"

This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview,\n(2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and\n(4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.  In addition, the Trinidad Gas Plant\nevaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.  Gas\nplant personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are\nfulfilling their safety obligations.\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\nThe Trinidad Gas Plant conducts a PSSR for any new facility or process modification that\nrequires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that\nsafety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior\nto placing the equipment into service.  This review provides an additional check to make sure\nconstruction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are\noperationally ready.  The PSSR team uses checklist(s) to verify startup readiness.  A PSSR\ninvolves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by\nrequiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe Trinidad Gas Plant has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure\nvessels, piping systems, relief valves, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency\nshutdown systems in a safe operating condition.  The basic aspects of this program include:  (1)\nconducting training, (2) scheduled preventive maintenance, (3) performing inspections and tests,\n(4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance m"

Compliance audits are conducted at\nleast every three years.  Both hourly and staff personnel may participate as audit team members. \nThe audit team findings are forwarded to plant management for resolution.  Corrective actions\ntaken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until completion.  The final resolution\nof each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.\n\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe processes at the Trinidad Gas Plant have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued\nsafe operation.  The following is a description of existing safety features applicable to prevention\nof accidental releases of regulated substances in the facility.\n\nUniversal Prevention Activities\n\nThe accident prevention program summarized above is applied to all RMP covered processes at\nthe Trinidad Gas Plant.  Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential\naccidents that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\n\nSpecialized Safety Features\n\nThe Trinidad Gas Plant has safety features to help (1) contain/control a release and (2) reduce the\nconsequences of (mitigate) a release.  The following types of safety features are used in the\ncovered processes:\n\nRelease Containment/Control\n\n\u00b7 Process relief valves that discharge to a vent stack\n\u00b7 Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated)\n\u00b7 Automated shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high temperature)\n\u00b7 Curbing or diking to contain liquid releases\n\u00b7 Redundant equipment and instrumentation (e.g., reserve pneumatic supply for process control\nsystem, backup pumps)\n\u00b7 Atmospheric relief devices\n\nRelease Mitigation\n\n\u00b7 Fire extinguishers\n\u00b7 Trained personnel\n\u00b7 Personal protective equipment\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe Trinidad Gas Plant has an excellent record of accident p"
