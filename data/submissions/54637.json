Additional safeties have been added to the process, such as an audible and visual alarm system which will warn if pump or cooling tower fan malfunctions.  Fisher N-550 ESV's are installed at discharge of source and at ammonia pump, and pneumatically held open during use, and they are capable of remote closure.  The ammonia hose used between source and pump, as well as that used for bypass, is FMH-22 double-braided, corrugated 316L SS to avoid potential rupture between these critical connections.  A standard Fisher ammonia regulator is used at the pump, pressure controlled, to bypass any excess ammonia to the suction side of the pump.  A standard ammonia backcheck valve is used on the input line at the Mix Unit.  Pressure relief valves for the ammonia system are recertified annually by an outside vendor.  These added safeties have proven effective in avoiding potential releases as evidenced by MFI's safety record.",

The Facility Policy:  The owners, management, and employees of Mears Fertilizer, Inc., (MFI) are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  Employees receive regular training in, and have access to, our written Process Safety and Risk Management Plan (PSM/RMP) which includes, but is not limited to, process safety information, emergency action and operating and maintenance procedures.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Butler County HazMat Team, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.  Facility Information:  The primary activity at MFI is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to Cooperatives and Retail Agriculture Dealers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and used for blending into mixed-grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients.  The maximum quantity stored would be 127,500 pounds in a 30,000 gallon storage tank.  The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a rail tank car holding 156,000 pounds, however, Mears receives few railcars of ammonia.\n\n3.   The worst case and the alternate release scenarios have been evaluated and shared with our local first responders as part of an on-going training program.  More importantly, our employees have been trained in their respective emergency actions, including the emergency meeting place and each of their individual responsibilities regarding an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.\n\n4.  The accidental release prevention program:  MFI has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia,\" and OSHA's PSM rule.

The Five-year Accident History:  We have had no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\n     - have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor\n     - to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in \n       place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6.  The emergency response program:  MFI has a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38, and has provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).
