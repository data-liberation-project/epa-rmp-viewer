This executive summary provides an overview of the site Risk Management Program.\n\n\n\nPOLICY\n\n\n\nEuticals is committed to operating our facilities safely and in compliance with all applicable regulations.   Euticals considers responsible management of Environmental, Safety and Health considerations as an integral component of our business.  All employees must assume responsibility for process safety consistent with their function and level of authority. \n\n\n\nFACILITY OVERVIEW AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nEuticals Inc. produces materials for use in pharmaceuticals and fine chemicals.  These materials include both active pharmaceutical ingredients and chemicals used as pharmaceutical intermediates and fine chemicals.  The facility is located on 66 acres and employs approximately 80 people including more than 25 chemists and engineers.  The facility operations are regulated by the FDA, OSHA, DEA, EPA, MDNR and Federal, State and local agencies.  The facility manufacturing operations are conducted 24 hours/day, 7 days/week and Euticals employees staff the facility 365 days per year.  \n\n\n\nThe RMP regulated substance at Euticals is Acrylyl Chloride (ACC) which is used in the manufacture of an intermediate specialty chemical.  The facility purchases ACC in drums with net weight of 441 lbs.  Only one drum is connected to the manufacturing process at a time.  ACC is consumed in a chemical reaction very rapidly as it is charged to the process so 441 pounds is the manufacturing process maximum inventory.  No more than three full drums are staged in the process area at one time.\n\n\n\nAcrylyl Chloride is used in only one manufacturing process at Euticals.  ACC is stored in a segregated area and no flammable materials are stored in this compartment.  The storage area is segregated from all processing facilities, offices, and high-population areas.  \n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAMS \n\n\n\nThis facility has been"

Euticals has developed prevention programs for all regulated chemicals.  The success of these prevention programs is reflected in Euticals' excellent safety performance.  Euticals' prevention programs are comprised of technology-, personnel-, and facilities-related elements.\n\n\n\nTechnology-related elements include safety systems in the processes (control systems, alarms, interlocks, etc), process hazards analysis (PHA), operating procedures and safe practices, and management of change (MOC).  These elements are utilized to manage all physical, procedural, and technical changes made on this site.  A plant-wide database is used for tracking MOCs and PHAs.  \n\n\n\nFacilities-related elements that significantly contribute to the success of the prevention program include the mechanical integrity program and the pre-startup safety reviews (PSSR). The mechanical integrity program is a comprehensive maintenance program that to assure proper equipment preventative maintenance and equipment quality assurance.  \n\n\n\nPersonnel-related elements include formal training and incident investigation.  Both of these programs utilize database systems to maintain and organize records so that site personnel are able to track plant performance in these areas.\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nIn accordance with RMP reporting requirements, Euticals is pleased to report that there have been no RMP accidents at Euticals that have resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site.  There have also been no offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS\n\n\n\nEuticals Inc. has established an integrated contingency response plan to define the procedures and activities necessary to manage chemical incidents.
