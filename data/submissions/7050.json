For this scenario, however, the very conservative assumption was made that it takes 30 min to isolate the release.  The toxic cloud formed by such an event may reach nearby public receptors.\n\nThe alternative scenario for aqueous ammonia is a failure of a 2-in. diameter fitting on the process feed storage tank.  If this release should occur, it would be terminated well before the 30 min allowed in the scenario.  The toxic cloud formed by such an event would extend  beyond the facility boundary but would not affect any public or environmental receptors.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the Westinghouse facility.  Because some processes at the plant that are regulated by the EPA risk management program (RMP) rule are also subject to the OSHA process safety management (PSM) regulation, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements that are part of the RMP Prevention Program and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nThe Westinghouse facility encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the facility accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the facility and that addresses each accident prevention program element.  In addition, the facility has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and employee safety issues.  These"

      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\n \nThe Westinghouse Electric Company, Commercial Nuclear Fuel Facility in Columbia, South Carolina, has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel (i.e., operators, emergency response teams)  and our emphasis on safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release and mitigate the hazards.\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Westinghouse facility, located on the outskirts of Columbia, South Carolina, operates a variety of processes to fabricate nuclear fuel assemblies.  The facility has two regulated toxic substances (anhydrous ammonia and aqueous ammonia at a solution concentration greater than 20 wt%).  The plant is located in a semirural area on a site of approximately 1,155 acres.  \n\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT RESULTS\n\nThe worst-case scenario associated with toxic substances at the facility is a catastrophic failure of a 30,000-gal anhydrous ammonia storage tank, resulting in a release of 128,000 lb of anhydrous ammonia over a 10-min period.  Although there are numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for administrative controls (except the control to limit the maximum tank inventory to 85% of its capacity) or passive mitigation measures is taken into account in evaluating this scenario.  Because the plant is located in a populated area, the toxic cloud formed by such an event would reach offsite public receptors.  \n\nThe alternative scenario for anhydrous ammonia is a failure of a 2-in. diameter fitting on the storage tank.  If this scenario were to occur, our trained operators would shu"

The teams typically have members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and plant management.\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe Westinghouse facility keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain and document safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Specific departments within the facility are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).  This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  The facility has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in the operating procedures for each process.  The facility ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).  \n\nThe facility also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n\nProc"

      "SummaryText": "ess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nThe Westinghouse facility has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe Westinghouse facility primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team that has operating, maintenance, and engineering experience and are supplemented by persons with appropriate regulatory expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.  \n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to management for resolution. Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the Westinghouse facility periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration"

The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to facility processes or other plant systems.  The emergency response program changes are administered through the MOC process, which includes informing and/or training affected personnel in the changes.  \n\nThe overall emergency response program for the Westinghouse facility is coordinated with the Richland County Local Emergency Preparedness Committee (LEPC), local fire and police departments, and state and federal agencies through the Incident Command System. The Westinghouse facility has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate community officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., the fire department).  This capability provides a means of facilitating quick response to an incident, as well as notifying the public of an incident if necessary.  The Westinghouse facility conducts periodic emergency response exercises that involve facility personnel, contractors, and emergency response organizations. The facility provides periodic refresher training to emergency responders regarding their responsibilities during an emergency. \n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nWestinghouse personnel are committed to the safe operation of the plant and are continually looking for ways to improve safety.  Westinghouse is currently implementing an environmental management program that will use a systematic approach to ensure that continual improvement philosophy becomes the key driver in achieving overall improved environmental performance.  This new program will be used to demonstrate equivalency with the ISO 14001 program."

These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The procedures are maintained current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.  \n\nIn addition, the operating procedures at the Westinghouse facility provide guidance on how to respond to upper or lower limit exceedances for specific process or equipment parameters. This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.  These procedures are required to be read and acknowledged as understood by all operators in the affected area.\n\n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Westinghouse facility has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in facility operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and kno"

This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility systems be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nThe Westinghouse facility promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire, explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.

Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years. Formal audits are generally done by professionals and management with independent professional auditors who are not associated with the facility.  An internal audit team may consist of facility hourly, professional, and management personnel.  The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to facility management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until completion.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained. \n\n\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe processes at the Westinghouse facility have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.  The accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all EPA RMP-covered processes at the plant.  Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by (1) faulty design and installation, (2) operational errors, (3) poor maintenance, (4) equipment failures, and (5) human errors.\n\nIn addition to the accident prevention program activities, the Westinghouse facility has safety features on many units to help (1) contain and control a release and (2) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release.

All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\n\nContractors\n\nThe Westinghouse facility uses contractors to supplement its workforce. Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the facility has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) relevant process information, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.  In addition, the Westinghouse facility evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.  Plant personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\nThe Westinghouse facility conducts a PSSR for any facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.
