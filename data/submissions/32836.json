Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies.\nThe Woodbridge Corporation as part of the Woodbridge Group of companies, believes that the health and safety of its employees and the protection of the natural environment, should be of the utmost concern in the operation of its business.  We are committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes in a safe and responsible manner.\n\nIt is our policy to:\n*Comply with all applicable laws, regulations, and standards.\n*Review and assess our operations for the purpose of making health, safety, and environmental improvements.\n\nOur complete Health, Safety, and Environmental policy statement, signed by our plant manager, is posted in prominent sites throughout the facility.  \n\nWe use a combination of prevention programs and emergency resposne planning, which are described later in this document, to help ensure the safety of our employees, the public, as well as protection of the environment.  Our Plant Manager has the overall responsibility for ensuring that our facility operates in a safe and reliable manner.  This includes overseeing implementation of the elements of our Risk Management Program.  To ensure that our program is appropriately developed and implemented, our Plant Manager has assigned the role of RMP Coordinator to a staff member with the authority delegated directly from the Plant Manager, and is responsible for coordinating the development, implementation, and integration of the RMP elements as is required under Section 68.15 of the RMP rule.\n\n2.  The stationary source and regulated substance handled.\nThe primary purpose of the Woodbridge Corporation is to produce polyurethane foam seat cushions for the automotive industry.  The foam is made by high-pressure injection of chemicals into a mold that is attached by carrier to a continuously revolving line.  The mold moves through a"

Toluene Diisocyanate (TDI), which is regulated by EPAs RMP rule, is one of the reactants requierd to manufacture polyurethane foam.  TDI is received at the plant by railcar and tanker trucks that have double-wall protection.  It is stored in two tanks in the contained bulk storage tank room.  The TDI is then transferred to the process utilizing a computer-controlled system.\n\nAccess to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, management personnel, and contractors.  The maximum amount of TDI that can be stored at this facility is 30, 085 gallons.  \n\n3.  Off-site consequences analysis scenarios\nEPAs RMP rule requires that we provide information about the worst-case release and alternative release scenarios for our facility.  The following are brief summaries of these scenarios, including information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the exposure distances for each scenarios.The methodology used to determine the distance to the toxic endpoint was the OCA table as established by the RMP rule.  The area locations of Hazardous Atmospheres (ALOHA) was used to determine the modeling parameters.  Meterological conditions of 99 degrees F at 68% humidity were used based on climatological data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.  An urban environment was assumed due to the characteristics of the local terrain.\n\nWorst-case Release Scenario\nOur worst-case scenario was determined to be a catastrophic failure of a railcar full of TDI at the railsiding, discharging the entire contents of 190,000 pounds.  It is assumed that the maximum temperature for the TDI during the unload could reach 95 degrees F.  As there is no containment at the railsiding, it is assumed a pool with a depth of 1 cm would evaporate and form a cloud that disperses downwind.  The distance to the endpoint concentration of 0"

      "SummaryText": ".007mg/L is 199 yards.  No residential population will be affected by this event.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario\nA rupture of the 15-ft, 2-inch flexible hose at the tanker-truck offloading station would trigger a 483 gallon release of TDI.  One of the two operators monitoring the offload process would manually shut off the flow to limit the loss of material.  The liquid would remain within the diked area.  The pool would form a toxic cloud that disperses downwind.  The distance to the endpoint concentration of 0.007 mg/L is <10.9 yards.  This release has the possibility of extending beyond the facility boundary, but would not impact any residential population.\n\n4.  The general accidental release prevention program and specific prevention steps.\nWe take a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of chemicals.  Our management systems for our TDI process address each of the key features of successful prevention programs including:\nSafety information\nHazard review of our processes\nOperating procedures\nTraining\nEquipment maintenance program\nRMP compliance audits\n\nAccident/Incident Investigation\nIn addition, we have established an Isocyanate Control Program that oulines the hazards of handling TDI and the controls in place to reduce the hazards of isocyanate exposure to the employees, the community, and the environment.  Those listed individual elements of our prevention program work together to prevent accidental chemical releases.  Our company and our employees are committed to the standard that these management systems set for the way we conduct business, and we have specific accountabilities and controls to ensure that we are meeting our own high standards for accident prevention.\n\n5.  Five-year Accident History\nWe have not had any TDI releases that qualify for listing in the EPAs erquired five-year accident history report.  We have had a small release inside the facility that did not impact our employees, the community, or the environment. \n\n6."

Our program provides essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during an emergency situation.  We have coordinated our plan with the LEPC and the fire department. A representative of the fire department routinely visits the facility to discuss how to respond to a TDI release.\n\n7.  Planned changes to improve safety\nPresently we continue to maintain our current safety management system.  We have implemented several safety features to the process since the last audit and we strive for continuous improvement."
