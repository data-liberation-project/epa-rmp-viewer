The CJO Water Treatment Plant has a treatment capacity of 60 million gallons per day (MGD).  The CJO Water Treatment Plant provides potable water supply to a population of approximately 212,000 people throughout Middlesex and Union counties.\n\nChlorine is utilized at the CJO Water Treatment Plant for the disinfection of potable water.  The chlorine process is the only process at the CJO Water Treatment Plant that is subject to the EPA and TCPA Risk Management Plant regulations.  Chlorine is stored in steel one-ton containers and 150 pound cylinders in the Chlorine Storage Room, which is a sealed reinforced concrete structure.\n\nMiddlesex Water Company has maintained an \"approved\" Risk Management Plan Program under the New Jersey Catastrophe Prevention Act (TCPA) for the chlorine process since approximately 1988.  The Water Company has an exceptional chlorine safety program, including extensive operator training, emergency response training, standard operating procedures, and chlorine safety equipment.  The chlorine process utilizes state-of-the-art design for all piping and equipment, including all necessary chlorine monitors, alarms and controls.\n\nEmergency response procedures include an on-site emergency response team, as well as off-site emergency response assistance from local emergency response agencies.  Annual emergency response drills are conducted, which include on-site and off-site responders.\n\nThe Water Company's written Risk Management Program includes all necessary Prevention Program elements meeting the requirements of EPA and OSHA Process Safety Management.  The Prevention Program includes elements such as safety information, standard operating procedures, operator training, preventative maintenance, hot works permits and other safety programs to ensure that the chlorine process meets the highest poss"
