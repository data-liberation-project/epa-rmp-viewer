      "SummaryText": "TESORO Los Angeles Refinery - Carson Operations has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\r\n\r\nThe refinery uses the HAZOP (hazard and operability) analysis method and other approved Process Hazard Analysis methods to perform these evaluations. \r\n\r\nThe analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  The hazards of the process, identification of previous incidents involving accidental release or potential for such, engineering and administrative controls and failure of such, and human factors will be addressed by the team performing the hazard analysis.  The findings and recommendations of the team are submitted to area management to assess the likelihood of the potential hazards, assess the severity of the consequences from potential releases, and assign priority for implementation of recommendations.  The recommendations and progress towards implementation is followed using a computerized tracking system.  The final resolution of findings are documented and retained.\r\n\r\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the TESORO Carson Refinery periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer in operation.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  \r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\n\r\nThe TESORO Los Angeles Refinery - Carson Operations maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as 1) unit startup, 2) normal operations, 3) temporary operations, 4) unit e"

The TESORO Los Angeles Refinery - Carson Operations incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs. Procedures are in place to ensure that new pressure vessels, piping systems, rotating equipment, storage tanks, instrumentation and control equipment, including spare parts are: 1) modified, repaired or fabricated to meet applicable codes; 2) meet design specifications and applicable codes; and 3) are inspected and checked for proper installation and consistency with specifications and manufacturers' instructions.  As part of this program, Positive Material Identification (PMI) is conducted, which involves physical testing to ensure that the correct metallurgy is received and installed as specified for both existing equipment, repair work, and new construction.\r\n\r\nSafe Work Permits\r\n\r\nThe TESORO Los Angeles Refinery - Carson Operations has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.  Examples include 1) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance; 2) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (hot work permit); 3) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space; and 4) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous materials before process piping or equipment is opened.

Critical procedures such as unit emergency procedures are reviewed annually during annual training sessions.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\n\r\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the TESORO Los Angeles Refinery - Carson Operations has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating or maintaining a process.  Initial training for operating and maintenance personnel who are new to a process includes health and safety training, fundamentals of refining, process overview and process fundamentals.  Job specific training is given to operators assigned to an operating unit.  This training includes specific safety and health hazards, emergency operations including shutdown, and safe work practices applicable to the operator's job tasks.  Job specific training includes on-the-job training, a written manual, written test, observations, and written sign-off.  The Carson Refinery also has ongoing refresher and supplemental training for all personnel.  Testing is conducted for all job specific training and craft qualification for each level of progression.

Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the refinery has procedures in place to ensure that contractors 1) perform their work in a safe manner, 2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, 3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, 4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, 5) understand and follow site safety rules, and 6) inform refinery personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with a process overview, information about refinery safety and health hazards, emergency response plan requirements, and safe work practices prior to their beginning work.  Additionally, all contractors that work on or near process units at the Carson Refinery must have completed a compulsory training program a (Refinery Safety Overview - RSO) that provides a standardized baseline of process safety training for all contractors that perform work at local area refineries.  Recertification to demonstrate knowledge of the required subject areas is required every year.  Site-specific safety training is another requirement, prior to contractors performing work.  In addition, the TESORO Los Angeles Refinery - Carson Operations evaluates contractor safety programs and performance as one of the key criteria for selection of a contractor to perform work in the refinery.

This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and to verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.  \r\n\r\nIncident Investigation\r\n\r\nThe TESORO Los Angeles Refinery - Carson Operations promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in personal injury, spills, fire/explosion, and release of a toxic or flammable material, major property damage, or environmental damage.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to refinery management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are documented and tracked to completion.  The investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings.  Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHA's and PHA revalidations.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits\r\n\r\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, qualified Tesoro staff periodically conducts"

Our policy is to implement the necessary controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  If a release does occur, we have trained personnel who will respond to control and contain the release, thereby reducing potential impact on our surrounding community.\r\n\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\r\n\r\nThe TESORO Los Angeles Refinery - Carson Operations is located in the city of Carson, California.
