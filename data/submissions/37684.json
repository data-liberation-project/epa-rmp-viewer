      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY - KFO Finley Area\n\n1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nAgrium?s ?Kennewick Fertilizer Operations (KFO)? is comprised of three facilities known as the Kennewick, Hedges, and Finley Areas.  The Finley Area handles anhydrous ammonia and aqua ammonia that are considered hazardous materials and are regulated substances under the Federal Accidental Release Program (ARP) and are considered in this Risk Management Plan (RMP).  The properties of these chemicals make it necessary to observe safety precautions in handling them to prevent human exposure, and to reduce the threat to the facility?s workers and nearby members of the community.  It is the facility?s policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State of Washington rules and regulations.  The prevention of accidental releases depends on adherence to the procedures used to handle anhydrous ammonia and aqua ammonia; the safety devices and systems designed and constructed into the facility; and the training of the pertinent personnel.  The various programs and documents are found in the facility?s comprehensive loss control system.\n\n2. Description of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\nAnhydrous ammonia is received at the Finley Area and is stored in an insulated atmospheric storage tank and two pressurized spheres.  Ammonia is received by rail-car from other sources and is shipped from the Finley Area by tank-truck and rail-car.  Ammonia is transported to the Kennewick Area via pipeline.  While in atmospheric storage the ammonia is refrigerated.  The ammonia is heated before loading tank-trucks, rail-car or exporting through the pipeline.  \n\nAqua ammonia is produced as a by-product from anhydrous ammonia system wet scrubber solution.  The dilute solution is collected into storage tanks and upgraded to product aqua ammonia by absorbing additional anhydrous ammonia into the solution.  The product aqua ammonia is shipped by tank truck and rail.\n\n3. Admini"

      "SummaryText": "strative Controls\nAdministrative controls are in place to prevent accidental releases.  Additional administrative controls exist to minimize the amount of anhydrous ammonia and aqua ammonia released and to limit the travel distance for each reported scenario if an accidental release were to occur.  These controls are inherent in the operational procedures for the equipment, processes and systems that use anhydrous ammonia and aqua ammonia, and are part of the training provided to the operators of these processes and systems.\n\n4. Mitigation Measures\nMitigation measures to limit the travel distance for each reported scenario exist that minimize the amount of anhydrous ammonia and aqua ammonia released to a minimum, if a release were to occur; and to preferably prevent a release from occurring.  The mitigation measures are inherent to the design, inspection, testing, and maintenance of the processes, systems and related equipment and components that use anhydrous ammonia and aqua ammonia.\n\n5. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\nThe facility complies with all applicable federal and state codes and regulations.  There are safety meetings and safety training.  The Process Safety Management (PSM) program is one part of the comprehensive loss control system implemented at the facility that address anhydrous ammonia and aqua ammonia processes and systems.  The implementation of PSM, Administrative Procedures and Safe Work Practices represent the facility?s main active commitments to an accidental release prevention program.\n\n6. Five-year Accident History\nThere have been no qualifying accidents in the previous five-year history of this facility to be reported in this RMP.\n\n7. Emergency Response Program\nThe details of the Emergency Response Program for regulated chemical processes at the facility are contained in two documents.  One is the Emergency Preparedness Action Plan (EPAP) that contains all of the emergency response prog"

The other is the On-Scene Incident Management Guide, a field guide for response actions based on the chemical involved.  This guide is for use by response personnel while responding to an emergency event.  The Emergency Response Program incorporates public notification and alert systems and procedures for notifying personnel at the facility to shelter-in-place or to evacuate as required.  Both the shelter-in-place and evacuation procedures have designated assembly areas and personnel accounting methods included.  The facility has qualified emergency response teams trained in accordance with HAZWOPER 29 CFR 120.  The facility conducts internal emergency drills and joint drills with the Fire Department.\n\n8. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\nCurrent applicable codes and regulations are continually reviewed as part of the PSM program to determine if specific commitments need to be made to achieve increased operational safety for the regulated chemical processes and systems.  These commitments include prevention and mitigation measures for accidental releases of the regulated substances."
