All plant configuration, operations and emergency response practices are managed using company standard operating procedures which are a part of the Company Management Systems described below.\n\n\n\nQuality System (QS)\n\nStandard operating procedures for all production and related services are managed using an ISO 9001 certified Quality System. The Quality System has been certified since 1994. \n\n\n\nEnvironmental Management System (EMS)\n\nAll environmental program procedures are included in an Environmental Management System that achieved certification under the ISO 14001 Standard. The RMP is a program procedure under the EMS. Emergency response plans are also resident here.\n\n\n\nHealth and Safety Management System (HSMS)\n\nAll Health and Safety written programs are already installed and controlled in the Management Systems process used by the ISO 9001 and ISO 14001 programs. The existing Safety Incentive Plan implements systematic methods for monitoring and improvement of health and safety requirements and issues. The structure is modeled on the ANZI-Z10 program, and certification will be sought should this credential receive wide acceptance.\n\n\n\nPolicy\n\nChemTreat is well aware that our business requires the management of certain hazardous chemicals, which if not properly controlled, introduce increased potential for harm to employees, the community and the environment. Accordingly, we have established systematic procedures to evaluate potential risks, establish procedures to manage those risks on a priority basis, and review and update our programs as conditions or capabilities change.

Hazardous and nonhazardous chemicals that are used in the blending process are stored in specifically designed and engineered storage and processing equipment. Chemicals are blended in a batch process into ChemTreat products which are distributed directly to customers. The only regulated substance under the RMP rule used at the facility is cyclohexylamine.  The substitution of other less hazardous materials have been evaluated and some substitution has been achieved; however the use of cyclohexylamine cannot yet be completely eliminated. \n\n\n\nCovered Process\n\nThe scope of the RMP covered process is limited to transfer and storage of cyclohexylamine in bulk storage tank. No other processes occur where as threshold quantity of cyclohexylamine is managed.\n\n\n\nPrevention Program\n\nChemTreat takes a systematic approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals. Our management systems address each of the key features of an accidental release prevention program including safety information, hazard review, operating procedures, training, preventive maintenance, compliance audits, and incident investigation. These individual elements of our operating procedures work together to prevent accidental chemical releases. ChemTreat employees integrate these management systems into the way we do business and establish specific accountability for accident prevention into our process.\n\n\n\nSafety Information\n\nRisk identification begins early in the product stewardship process when every new raw material proposed for addition to process use is evaluated to de"

It is very unlikely that any new RMP rule regulated substances would ever be authorized for addition to our operations. The requirements to manage the risks associated with any new hazardous materials are determined and all necessary configuration changes, program procedure updates and employee training are completed prior to introduction of the new material into the process. Safety information may be in the form of the chemical MSDS sheet and label or may require specific procedures to be drafted under the appropriate management systems program.\n\n\n\nHazard Review\n\nIn accordance with Section 68.50 of the RMP rule, we use hazard reviews to systematically identify, evaluate, and control process hazards. The most important products of our reviews are recommendations for reducing the most significant risks of accidental chemical releases. We conduct systematic hazard reviews of the cyclohexylamine transfer and storage process at our facility at least every five years (or more often if necessary because of process changes or incidents). \n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nIn accordance with Section 68.52 of the RMP rule, we use operating procedures to define how process related job tasks assigned to our personnel should be performed. Procedures are maintained under the various management systems programs. The facility maintains documentation which show operator and mechanic qualifications for those responsible for the cyclohexylamine system.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\nIn accordance with Section 68.54 of the RMP rule, we train our employees to safely perform their assigned tasks. Our training program includes initial training as well as refresher training every three years, or more often if major process or equipment changes are made. As part of our training, we include provisions for ensuring that employees understand the training (field demonstrations, observa"

An automated maintenance program is produced by the corporate computer system which governs the scheduling and record of completion of periodic maintenance on covered systems.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nIn accordance with Section 68.58 of the RMP rule, we conduct compliance audits to ensure that the facility is in compliance with the RMP rule. Audits are conducted in conjunction with the Semiannual Safety and Environmental Incentive Program Audits. At the completion of each audit, a report is generated which documents any noncompliance. Audit findings are addressed through the corrective action process.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigations\n\nIn accordance with Section 68.60 of the RMP rule, we perform incident investigations to help ensure that all incidents are thoroughly investigated, root causes are identified and corrected, and relevant findings are communicated throughout our organization to help prevent a recurrence. All incidents which caused or could have caused a release of cyclohexylamine shall be investigated no later than 48 hours of the incident. At the conclusion of the investigation, a report shall be prepared reviewed by a specially appointed investigation team. The report shall include at a minimum: the date of the incident, the date the investigation began, a description of the incident, the factors that contributed to the incident, and any recommendations resulting from the incident.\n\n\n\nFive-year Accident History\n\nThere have been no releases or incidents involving cyclohexylamine from the covered process that have resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage within the last five year"

ChemTreat coordinates any chemical release response actions with the Hanover County Fire Department and has the appropriate mechanisms in place to notify emergency responders when there is a need for a response. Each facility has its own Emergency Response Plan, however response to releases of cyclohexylamine by plant personnel are limited to those actions that would be considered as similar to routine operations.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes To Improve Safety\n\nThe existing configuration and operations of the cyclohexylamine system are of proven reliability. The primary improvement planned in this area is to replace cyclohexylamine with a less hazardous technology that will function as well or better in target systems. This will reduce inventory requirements or perhaps ultimately eliminate the need to participate in this program.\n\n\n\n\n\n"
