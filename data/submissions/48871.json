Chlorine, a substance considered hazardous by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), is used to manufacture bleach at this facility.  Because chlorine is a regulated substance, OnLine Packaging, Inc. must comply with the EPA?s Chemical Accident Prevention regulations (40 CFR Part 68).  Compliance involves developing and implementing a risk management plan (RMP), and submitting this RMP to the EPA.\n\nAt the OnLine Packaging, Inc. plant in Michigan City, Indiana, the maximum inventory of chlorine on site is a 90-ton tank car located on a railroad spur adjacent to the building.  Liquid chlorine is piped from the tank car into the building where it is reacted, under carefully controlled conditions, with caustic soda to produce bleach for consumer use.  The chlorine systems are designed and operated in accordance with Chlorine Institute recommendations, and the employees of OnLine Packaging, Inc. use appropriate safety precautions in handling chlorine to prevent accidental releases and minimize any hazards to human health and the environment.\n\nThe Michigan City plant has been in operation since 2002 and has never had an accidental release of chlorine in any quantity.  OnLine Packaging, Inc. also operates a plant in Plover, Wisconsin, which has never had an accidental release of chlorine of any reportable quantity.  A third OnLine Packaging facility is currently being built in Ardmore, Oklahoma, which is set to start production in 2007.  \n\nIn the event of an emergency involving chlorine, this emergency response plan calls for certain internal procedures and actions to be taken in addition to the immediate notification of the Michigan City Fire Department, the LaPorte County Emergency Management of Homeland Security Department (LaPorte LEPC), the National Emergency Response Center, and the Chemical Transportation Emergency Center (CHEMTREC).

The plan identifies outside agencies that will be notified and establishes procedures for evacuating personnel.\n\nOnLine Packaging, Inc. complies with the EPA?s Chemical Accident Prevention regulations and with all applicable state codes and regulations.  No changes are planned at this time that will alter the effectiveness of this RMP.  However, if continued operations indicate the need, changes will be implemented, and this RMP will be updated to ensure continued compliance with EPA standards."
