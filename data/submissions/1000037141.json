Milk Specialties Facility is extremely diligent in the handling of all chemicals and is dedicated to the safety of its employees and the neighboring community.  The facility's staff is highly trained and utilizes modern equipment to monitor the facility and provide safeguards, while effectively and safely using ammonia for refrigeration.\r\nMilk Specialties Facility has a long standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the Ammonia Refrigeration System.  Milk Specialties Facility's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. \r\n\r\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance \r\n\r\nMilk Specialties Global - Visalia Facility is located at 715 North Divisadero, Visalia, California 93291.\r\nThe calculated inventory for this facility is approximately 9,000 pounds (lbs.) of anhydrous ammonia.  Attachment C of the Safety Information Section contains a certification letter provided by the ammonia contractor (American, Inc.) which states the current anhydrous ammonia inventory at the facility.  Note:  As of July, 2013, the total calculated ammonia inventory is 9,000 lbs.  For documentation purposes the Milk Specialties Global - Visalia Facility has decided to submit the maximum intended inventory of anhydrous ammonia as 17,000 lbs. This is in order to give some room for future charges, if necessary. \r\n \r\nHazard Assessment Summary/Offsite Consequence Analysis \r\n\r\nWorst-Case Release Scenario Results Summary\r\nScenario Description: Per CalARP Regulations and EPA RMP Regulations, one worst-case analysis has been defined and modeled for the Ammonia R"

The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment documentation located behind the Hazard Assessment tab of the CalARP/RMP/PSM Program 3 Compliance Workbook.\r\n\r\nRisk Considerations\r\n\r\nAlthough the storage and use of anhydrous ammonia has inherent potential risks, and worst-case release scenarios can potentially reach the community; Milk Specialties Global - Visalia Facility has recognized these potential risks and structured its safety programs to make the worst case type of event non-credible.  In addition to the safety practices of the company and plant personnel to make this worst-case event non-credible, it should also be recognized that there are inherent analysis assumptions that make the results of the atmospheric dispersion analysis appear worse than what would actually be expected during such an event (e.g., In the event of a release, sudden rupture and flashing of ammonia would be highly turbulent.  Turbulence causes entrainment of air and the released vapor dilutes much more quickly than is shown in the model).\r\nIn addition to the use of conservative analysis assumptions that over-predict the effects of a potential release, other characteristics of the facility and site serve to minimize the potential risks associated with an ammonia release, including the following:\r\n- Well-designed Relief System\r\n- Safety Showers/Eyewash Stations\r\n- Gas Detection \r\n- Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) is used by plant personnel, as necessary.\r\n- The system undergoes periodic maintenance to reduce the likelihood of catastrophic failures.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention Program \r\n\r\nAs part of the implementation of this Program, key Prevention Program elements were documented and"

Furthermore, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are currently utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed.\r\n\r\nAs of July 2013, the facility maximum intended inventory of anhydrous ammonia is 9,000 lbs.  Therefore, the regulated substance is under the 10,000 lbs. threshold for US EPA RMP and the Cal/OSHA PSM threshold quantities, and over the 500 lbs state threshold for the CalARP Program.  As a result, the anhydrous ammonia covered process is subject to CalARP Program Level 2.  For documentation purposes and facility policies, the Milk Specialties Global - Visalia Facility has decided to submit a maximum intended inventory of anhydrous ammonia of 17,000 lbs. This is in order to allow for future charges, if necessary.   Therefore, with this assumption the covered process has over the 10,000 lbs. threshold quantity for US EPA RMP and Cal/OSHA PSM threshold quantities, and over the 500 lbs. state threshold for CalARP Program.  As a result, the anhydrous ammonia covered process will be subjected to CalARP Program Level 3, US EPA RMP Program Level 3, and Cal/OSHA PSM.  For the reasons mention above Milk Specialties Global - Visalia Facility will submit and implement a CalARP/RMP/PSM Program Level 3.  \r\n\r\nThe Anhydrous Ammonia Prevention Program 3 elements include:\r\n- Process Safety Information\r\n- Process Hazard Analysis\r\n- Operating Procedures\r\n- Training\r\n- Mechanical Integrity\r\n- Management of Change\r\n- Pre-Startup Safety Review\r\n- Compliance Audits\r\n- Incident Investigation\r\n- Employee Participation\r\n- Hot Work Permit\r\n- Contractors\r\nIn addition, key emergency response elements were addressed in Section 4.7 of this document. \r\n\r\nFive-Year Accident History \r\n\r\nNew accident history information - For any accidental release meeting the five-year accident history reporting criteria of Section 2750.9, the owner or operator"

For detailed information regarding the incident, please refer to the Incident Investigation Section of the CalARP/RMP/PSM Program Level 3.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\n\r\nThe Milk Specialties Global - Visalia Facility has implemented an Emergency Action Plan (EAP) and does not assume the role of first responder during an emergency.  However, Tulare County Health & Human Services Agency, Environmental Health Services (EHS) are trained and fully equipped to respond to hazardous material releases.  In case of an emergency, Milk Specialties Global - Visalia Facility will coordinate with local Fire Department and First Responders.\r\n\r\nThe Milk Specialties Global - Visalia Facility, the EHS Manager, Greg Clark, maintain the Business Emergency Plan (BEP) for the facility. The BEP provides the response protocols and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures, which have been implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility. The BEP is reviewed and updated at least once per year to ensure compliance with CalARP and BEP regulations.\r\n\r\nKey elements of the BEP include:\r\n- Emergency Alarm Procedures\r\n- Evacuation Procedures\r\n- Safety and Health Considerations\r\n- Notification Procedure\r\n\r\nExternal Events Analysis Information\r\n\r\nPursuant to the requirements of 19 CCR \u00a72"

If not known, the owner or operator of the stationary source shall work closely with the AA to determine what is required. If seismic events are applicable, the parameters used in the consideration of the seismic analysis and which edition of the Uniform Building Code was used when the process was designed.\r\n- The Facility conducted a Seismic Assessment for the Ammonia Refrigeration in May 6, 2013.  All findings are documented in the \"Seismic Assessment\" report located in the Seismic Assessment Tab of this Compliance Workbook. \r\n   - The magnitudes of the external events considered are detailed within the PHA Worksheets and were qualitatively risk-ranked by the PHA Team.\r\n      - For each external event, with a potential to create a release of a regulated substance that will reach an endpoint offsite, apply \r\n               1)The expected date of completion of any changes resulting from the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA)\r\n               2)Major hazards identified;\r\n               3)Process controls in use;\r\n               4)Mitigation systems in use;\r\n               5)Monitoring and detection systems in use; and,\r\n               6)Changes since the last PHA\r\n   - Refer to Section 5.0 Part 12 of this document, under PHA, for the required information.\r\n      - The date of the most recent field verification that equipment is installed and maintained as designed.\r\n   - The most recent field"
