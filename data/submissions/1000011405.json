To \nensure that our water remains safe throughout the distribution system to every \ntap, the plant adds a small amount of chlorine as a disinfection agent.  \nThe concentrated form of chlorine is liquefied and stored in one-ton containers. \nBefore it is mixed with water, chlorine can be extremely hazardous if released to \nthe air all at once.  \nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response \npolicies at your facility.\n\nThe Lake Lewisville Water Production Plant is committed to protecting its \nemployees, the public, and the environment from any accidental releases of \nhazardous materials used at its facilities.  We have implemented safety, \nenvironmental protection, and risk management programs to prevent hazardous \nmaterials releases.  If there is an accidental release, we will immediately call for \nemergency response, Denton Fire Department, to minimize the effect of the \nrelease and notify the public of any actions necessary to ensure public \nprotection, through emergency management agencies.  The water utility \nmanagement along with its employees is always looking for ways to improve \nsafety regarding the handling and use of chemicals.  In addition to safety, we \ncontinuously review operational and maintenance procedures to ensure the \nprocess is maintained as safe as possible.\nFive-Year Accident History\nWithin the past five years, the Lake Lewisville Water Production Plant has not \nhad any accidental releases that resulted in injuries or property damage. The \nplant has maintained an excellent safety record throughout its operating history \nand has never had a major chlorine release that could have had adverse effects \non the public.\nEmergency Response\n\t\n\t\"In the event that a chlorine release does occur, the Lake Lewisville Water \nProduction Plant has an emergen"

This includes severe weather like hail, high winds and tornadoes \nand hazardous material spills, that could occur anywhere in the city.  When the \ngeneral public hears the alarms, they either tune their radio to station 88.1 FM \nKNTU or tune their television to the City of Denton's cable station, Channel 26 for \ninformation on the emergency and what actions they should take.\n\t\n\tAll Lake Lewisville Water Production Plant employees are trained for \nhazard material awareness for first responders.

We will also be assessing \nfurther safety enhancements to the facility over the next few years.\n\nChlorine system of the past\nSafety improvements for the chlorine system began in 1987.  A new facility was \nbuilt that included both inside and outside on-site storage of chlorine containers \nwith an overhead hoist for moving the containers.  The new chlorine system is \nvacuum controlled; this reduced the amount of pressurized pipe.  Another safety \nimprovement was the addition of chlorine gas detector equipment with audible \nand visual alarms.\n\nSince 1987, additional improvements have occurred to increase chlorine safety.  \nMost of the safety improvements are changes in operational and preventive \nmaintenance procedures.  Through safety meetings, independent chlorine safety \naudits, and general discussions, all of the pressure piping and suspect \ncomponents were scheduled for replacement every five years.\n\nOperators became more aware of potential weaknesses of the system and \nbegan to perform routine system checks around the clock.   All doors leading \nfrom the chlorine system were reconfigured for easy evacuation.  A windsock \nwas installed to direct personnel in the event of an accidental leak.  In 1995, the \nchlorine gas detection system was replaced with a more reliable system that is \nprecisely calibrated.\nCurrent system\nThe current chlorine system is still going through changes to improve safety.

The City of \nDenton was assisted by Carollo Engineering to determine if our system could \nreduce or eliminate any hazards associated with its use of gaseous chlorine.  \n\nThe risks associated with storage and uses of hazardous chemicals are \ndiscussed throughout the RMP.  The safety record of the water treatment \nindustry relative to the use of hazardous chemicals has been very good \nhistorically.  In some cases, risks can be eliminated; however, usually it is a case \nof offsetting other risks. There are many different types of risks associated with \nthe storage and use of hazardous chemicals.  For purposes of the RMP, they \nwere divided into the following:\n?\tTransportation to the site\n?\tUnloading of the chemical at the delivery site\n?\tStorage of a chemical\n?\tOperational procedures for moving containers\n?\tMetering and conveying of a hazardous chemical to the application \npoint\nMetering and conveying risks are by far the most significant associated with the \ntreatment plant.  The failure of the flexible connections and lead gaskets seals \nare the most common cause of chlorine releases followed by valve packing \nfailure and equipment failure.  \n\nCarollo Engineering concluded that the alternatives to gaseous chlorine all \ninvolve significantly greater cost on a present-worth analysis without any risk \nreduction.

Since \nthat time, the Fire Department has switched to another brand of SCBA.  As a part \nof the risk management plan, all personnel at the water production plant have \ntaken an 8-hour hazard awareness class, facilitated by the Governor's office of \nthe State of Texas to learn about the hazards around the plant and out in the \nenvironment.  In addition to the hazard awareness course, several water production employees have been trained in a 40-hour hazard material \ntraining course and received certification as Hazard Material Technicians.  They \nreceived this training to respond to chlorine leaks at the plant as technical \nadvisors to our primary responders, the Denton Fire Department.  For incipient \nchlorine releases, these employees are the primary responders.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety\nBefore the hazard reduction/elimination study by Carollo Engineers, the water \nproduction plant had planed to retrofit the current chlorine facility with a chlorine \ngas scrubber system, during fiscal year 2000.  A chlorine gas scrubber system \npulls the air and chlorine gases from a room and neutralizes it, converting it into a \nbrine solution.  Carollo recommended building a new chlorine facility instead of a \nretrofit because the cost of getting the current facility up to the current building \nand fire codes was slightly less than the cost of a new facility.\n\nThe new facility will be built to the current building codes and will include many \nsafety improvements over the current facility.
