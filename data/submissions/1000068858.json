It specifically applies to GLWA's use of chlorine and sulfur dioxide. This program continues GLWA's commitment to the protection of its neighbors and its employees and the control of the potential for such a release. No such release has ever occurred at the plant that is the subject of this Program.\n\n\n\n(a) Program Summary\n\nThe program described herein supplements the procedures described in other GLWA documents such as general administrative guidelines and safety and heath manuals. The RMP/PSM program addresses program management procedures, hazard assessment, prevention program, emergency response, risk management plan and other requirements. Each topic has its own section in this program document, with management elements of the program contained in Section 15 of Subpart A: General.\n\nProcess safety information describing the hazards and physical properties of chlorine, safe operating limits, and descriptions of the major process equipment are included in Subpart D: Prevention Program.\n\n\n\n(b) Organization of Document\n\nThis RMP/PSM program document is organized in sections, with each section covering a primary element of the RMP/PSM process. The sections appear in the same order as their topics appear in the USEPA Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions rule, with same section number.\n\n\n\nAll tables and figures are included at the end of each section. In addition, various appended exhibits (forms, policies, technical information, etc.) are at the end of each section. This organization allows for each section, or RMP/PSM element, to stand alone, for ease in reference and use. Words or phrases in bold italics denotes items of particular importance. In addition, all initial references to figures, tab"

Subpart C of the USEPA rule establishes requirements for program 2 prevention programs. The corresponding subparts of this manual presents the program 3 prevention methods for the chlorine and sulfur dioxide systems.\n\n\n\n(d) Emergency Response\n\nSubpart E of this manual shows how GLWA will conduct Emergency Response after process upsets, chlorine releases, and sulfur dioxide releases.\n\n\n\n(e) Risk Management Plan\n\nSubpart F of the USEPA rule provides lists and quantities of regulated chemicals. The corresponding Subpart of this manual is empty, because there are no requirements that GLWA can implement. Subpart G of this manual documents GLWA's submission of an RMP*Submit report to USEPA. This subpart also includes a certification of the truth of statements in this document by a ranking GLWA official in Section 185.\n\n\n\n(f) Other Requirements\n\nSubpart H of this manual provides for keeping records, sharing information with the public, and conduction programs audits.\n\n\n\n(g) Trade Secrets\n\nThe only section of OSHA's PSM standard that is not reflected in USEPA's Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions rule is Trade Secrets. This topic does not apply to GLWA's Facility.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
