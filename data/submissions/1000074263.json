Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at the Stationary Source\n\n\n\nCalifornia Resources Corporation (CRC) is the owner and operator of the Grubb Lease Gas Plant. CRC adheres to all RMP Program 1 elements to protect its employees, environment, property, and the general public from any off-site impacts that could occur as a result of operations at the plant. CRC operates its facilities in compliance with applicable federal, state, and local safety, health, and environmental regulations, which serves to reinforce its long-standing commitment to worker and public safety at their facilities.\n\n\n\nThe Grubb Lease Gas Plant has developed an Emergency Action Plan, which requires coordination with local emergency response agencies. CRC employees are not first responders, and would request assistance from emergency response organizations for all emergency events.\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nThe Grubb Lease Gas Plant is located at 3055 West Pacific Coast Highway in Ventura, California 93001, approximately 1.3 miles north east of the Pacific Coast Highway. The facility receives natural gas from a variety of oil wells in the surrounding area, and it processes the gas into mixed natural gas liquids (NGLs). The NGL product consists primarily of ethane, propane, butane, isobutane, pentane, and isopentane. It is stored in a pressurized storage vessel before being shipped via Trucks off-site. The facility is classified as CalARP / EPA RMP Program Level 1 due to the flammable mixtures present. No regulated toxic substances are present at the facility in excess of the threshold quantities established by this regulation.\n\n\n\n3. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nThe Grubb Lease Gas Plant is subject to RMP requirements for a Level 1 program. The facility complies with RMP standards, and has implemented all of the requirements of the RMP Program 1 prevention p"

      "SummaryText": "rogram. CRC has implemented specific safety features for the prevention, detection and control of releases\n\nor regulated (and other) substances at the facility. CRC has created a CRC South HSE Manual which outlines all necessary safety and environmental programs that must be followed. This includes policies for Incident Reporting, Safety Policies, Safety Rules, Safety Standards, and Safety Programs.\n\n\n\n4. Five-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThere have been no accidental releases from the covered process that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage onsite, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage in the past 5 years.\n\n\n\n5. Emergency Response Program Summary\n\n\n\nCRC is not a first responder. CRC has provided the Business Emergency Plans (BEP) and Hazardous Materials Inventory (HMI) to the local CUPA for inclusion in the local hazardous materials area plan. During an emergency event, CRC can shut down the plant and send all gas to the flare. CRC would request assistance from local emergency response organizations.\n\n\n\n\n\n6. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nCRC evaluates, and as appropriate, implements changes to improve safety as opportunities are identified in PHAs, compliance audits, or by operating, maintenance, or other personnel."
