These chemicals must be used to provide cooling for the process and controlling the process heating.  It is our policy to have programs in place dealing with safety precautions in handling these substances and to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and state rules and regulations. Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle ammonia and propane combined with the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility combined with the safe handling procedures that we use and the training of our personnel. \n\nThis facilities emergency response program is based on the IIAR's \"Risk Management Guidelines Program for Ammonia Refrigeration\" and NPGA's LP Gas Handbook, \"Guidelines for Developing Plant Emergency Response Procedures.\" The plan has been provided and reviewed with the Rutherford County Local Emergency Planner Center.  Coordination with the LEPC has been made to notify them through the emergency response plan to respond to incidents that may affect the public.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCES AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nThe Simius Foods' manufacturing facilities is in the business of slaughtering processing pork and beef.  These products require cooking controls and cooling of the materials during and after being processed.  There are two hazardous chemicals (Anhydrous Ammonia and propane) used at this site for these purposes. \n\nAnhydrous Ammonia is the refrigerant used for the cooling process due to the low cost of the medium and the low temperatures that must be obtained.  The ammonia is enclosed within a closed loop that removes heat from the products and storage ro"

      "SummaryText": "oms.  The ammonia is evaporated by removing heat from the products and cooling areas at low temperatures and pressures and then dispenses the heat at high pressures and temperatures to outside air.\n\nThe ammonia system at the Simius Foods Inc. contains 65,000 pounds of ammonia.\n\nPropane is also used at the facility.  Propane is used in the cooking of the meat products.  It is received from retailers by truck and stored in an 18,000 gallon tank.  The maximum inventory of the tank is controlled at 85 percent level.  \n\nThe maximum amount of propane that can be stored at this plant is 65,178 pounds.\n\nSUMMARY OF MAJOR HAZARDS \n\nCONSEQUENCE OF FAILURE TO CONTROL HAZARDS\n\nAMMONIA\n\nHealth Hazards\n\nAmmonia is a colorless gas with extremely pungent odor.  Liquid ammonia vaporizes to a poisonous gas cloud.\n\nAmmonia is a severe irritant of the eyes.  It penetrates the eyes more readily than any other alkali.  Contact with liquid anhydrous ammonia and concentrated solutions can produce severe eye injury or blindness.  Exposure of the eyes to high gas concentrations can cause temporary blindness and severe eye damage.  Laceration or watering of the eyes can occur upon exposure to 150 ppm ammonia gas and higher.\n\nAmmonia is an irritant by inhalation.  At increasing concentrations it can cause symptoms ranging from runny nose, coughing, chest pain, trouble with breathing, and death.  It can cause severe breathing difficulties that are delayed in onset.  Inhalation of concentrations of 2500 to 6500 ppm causes shortness of breath, bronchospasm, chest pain, and pulmonary edema (filling of the lungs with fluid) that may be fatal.\n\nExposure of the skin to liquid anhydrous ammonia or high concentrations of the gas can cause first and second degree burns of the skin.  Vapor concentrations of 10,000 ppm are mildly irritating to moist skin, while 30,000 ppm or greater causes a stinging sensation and can produce skin burns and blisters.  These high concentrations of ammonia are corrosive to m"

      "SummaryText": "oist skin and other moist body tissues.\n\nPhysical Hazards\n\nAmmonia or ammonia with oil or other debris is an explosion hazard when exposed to flame or fire.  The Lower Explosive Limit (LEL) is 16% and Upper Explosive Limit (UEL) is 25% by volume in air.  Elevated temperatures can cause containers of the substance to explode.  Ammonia emits toxic fumes when exposed to heat.  When heated to temperatures above 8500F, ammonia will emit hydrogen gas.  The auto ignition temperature is 12040F if catalyzed by iron.\n\nAmmonia can react to form potential violent or explosive reactions with halogens (e.g., chlorine, bromine).  It can react to form potential violent or explosive reactions with strong oxidizers, hypochlorite bleaches, silver compounds, mercury compounds, gold, other metals, and acids.\n\n Common Exposure Control Methods\n- Process enclosure\n- Local exhaust ventilation\n- General dilution ventilation\n- Personal protective equipment\n- Use of water\n- Area monitoring (with alarm systems)\n\nPotential for Exposure to Ammonia\n\nThe refrigeration operation is a closed system with no purposeful exposure to ammonia.  As a closed system, exposure potentials are primarily related to equipment failure, fugitive emissions from improperly adjusted or worn valve packings, pump and compressor seals and pipe connector gaskets, or mistakes in operation of the system. \n\nPROPANE\n\nHealth Hazards\n\nPropane is a colorless gas with faint petroleum like odor.  It is shipped as a liquefied gas under its vapor pressure.  For transportation it may be stenched.  Contact with the liquid can cause frostbite.  It is easily ignited.  Its vapors are heavier than air and a flame can flash back to the source of leak very easily.  This leak can be either a liquid or vapor leak.  It can asphyxiate by the displacement of air.  Under fire conditions the cylinders or tank cars may violently rupture and rocket.\n\nWORST CASE SCENARIO - TOXIC CASE\n\nThe worst case scenario for toxic substances used at the Simius Foo"

The toxic endpoint was determined by using the Aloha computer-modeling program.  With a wind speed of 1.5 m/sec and a Stability Class of F in an urban topography the endpoint of the spill was determined to be 0.85 miles from the receiver.  The plant site is located in the suburb of the city of Forest City, North Carolina.  The public receptors within a radius of 0.85 miles from the plant site are schools and residents with a population of 661. \n\nWORST CASE SCENARIO - FALMMABLE SUBSTANCE\n\nPropane is used at the Simius Foods International site and falls into EPA's Program 2 level.  The worst case scenario for propane was calculated using the site's 18,000-gallon storage tank.  The endpoint was calculated to be 0.32 miles from a source release of 65,178     pounds.  The company policy is to limit filling the storage tanks to 85% capacity.  It was assumed that the entire contents of the storage tank were released as a vapor and 10% of the released quantity was assumed to participate in the resulting explosion.  The endpoint was determined using the \"RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance\" manual and RMP Comp computer program .  This endpoint will extend beyond the facility boundary. \n\nALTERNATE CASE SCENARIO - TOXICS\n\nAlternate case scenarios for Simius Foods International was reviewed by the maintenance and operating sections.  Considerations were given to the most probable cause of a leak within the ammonia system.  The possible leak scenarios considered were:\n\n- Transfer hose rupture\n- Process piping failure\n- Process vessel or pump releases from seals, drains, bleeds\n- Rupture of a sightglass\n- Overpressure and release through relief valves\n\nAfter discussing these and the operations of the refrigeration system, it was decided that the rupture of a sightglass was the most probable cause of a leak within the system.

This incident was the result of a valve bonnet coming off during operations of the valve and 600 pounds of ammonia was lost.  There were no injuries, deaths or damage to the environment as a result of this incident.  This incident was investigated and improvements were made in maintenance and operating procedures.\n\nThere have been no incidents in the last five years for the propane system. \n\nHOW RELEASES ARE PREVENTED\n\nHistorically, exposures to ammonia most often occur from:\n- Leaking valve stem packing glands while opening or closing a valve\n- Leaking at valve flanges or other piping connections\n- Pressurizing any equipment with sight glasses (especially the round type)\n- Mistakenly venting gas thro"
