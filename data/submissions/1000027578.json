The objective is to prevent a release of chlorine and to minimize the potential impact to ADM's employees, the public and the environment.  This objective will be accomplished by using the elements of process safety management, for example standard operating procedures, preventative maintenance program, employee training, and emergency response activities coordinated with local responders.\n\n\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED:\n\nADM North Water Treatment Plant is located in the north east side of the city of Decatur, IL and on the north end of Lake Decatur.  The facility purifies water from Lake Decatur to provide quality process water for the ADM manufacturing facilities within the Decatur complex.  The plant treats water by lime softening, filtration, and disinfection with chlorine.\n\nChlorine is the regulated substance that requires a Risk Management Plan (RMP) at this facility. \n\nThe main components of the chlorine disinfection system are a station where one-ton cylinders are transferred between the delivery truck and the chlorine room, a hoist to move the cylinders, and vacuum regulators to inject the chlorine into the water.  All equipment that contains chlorine is enclosed in a room with a monitoring system for detecting leaks. The monitoring system activates local and remote alarms.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS:\n\nThe facility uses the elements of Process Safety Management to control the hazards of using chlorine. The concepts in the prevention program include employee participation, analysis of hazards, operating procedu"

The monitoring system activates local and remote alarms.  The chlorine distribution system operates under vacuum.  \n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\n\nThe facility had no reportable accidents in the last five years.\n\nTHE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\n\nEmergency response at this facility is coordinated with the Decatur Fire Department so that in the event of an accident, immediate emergency response measures will be implemented.  The facility maintains a written Emergency Response Plan to deal with prevention of and response to accidental releases of hazardous materials.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\n\nRecommended actions from the last process hazard analyses have been completed.\n\nADM will continue to evaluate and implement changes when necessary to improve safety at the North Water Treatment Plant.\n\n"
