(CWR) is committed to protecting the health and safety of company personnel, contractors working at the West Tyler Gas Processing Plant (facility), our neighbors in the surrounding community and the environment.  This commitment is strongly supported by the senior management of CWR and is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as employee training, and in considering the design safety, installation, operation, and maintenance of this facility.  This facility implements both administrative and engineering controls to reasonably minimize the risk of an uncontrolled release of a hazardous substance.  The facility does not anticipate having any type of uncontrolled release.  However, if an uncontrolled release does occur, company personnel, in cooperation with local emergency response agencies, are trained to respond, minimize and/or eliminate any exposure that could occur to protect employees and the surrounding area.  \r\n\r\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\nThe Tyler Gas Processing Plant is a natural gas processing plant that produces liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) by mechanical refrigeration.  Natural gas piped to this facility is dehydrated, cooled and the contaminants removed.  The LPG, a mixture of methane, ethane, propane, butanes, pentanes, hexanes and C6+ compounds, is stored in a pressurized bullet tank for transportation by truck.  Condensate and produced water removed from the gas stream is stored in a separate tank for transport from the site via tanker trucks.  No listed toxic substances which exceed their respective threshold quantities are stored at this facility.\r\n\r\nHazard Assessment - Worst Case Scenario\r\nThe Worst-Case Scenario for this facility is failure of the LPG storage tank releasing the entire contents instantaneously to the atmosphere, resulting in an offsite impact radius of 0.6 mile.

They have also established an audit procedure to assure the continued integrity of the prevention program, and to ensure the safety and well being of employees and the surrounding area.\r\n\r\n5 Year Accident History\r\nThe Tyler Gas Processing Plant has had an excellent accident prevention program over the last five years.  There have been no releases of listed hazardous substances which resulted in offsite effects.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\nThe Tyler Gas Processing Plant has adopted and maintains a written emergency response plan to protect workers, ensure public safety and to protect the environment.  The plan details the procedures for responding to an emergency, including the release or potential release of a hazardous substance.  The procedures include instruction for response, communication, first aid, evacuation, accounting for personnel, company and agency notification procedures, and post incident cleanup and decontamination.  All emergency equipment is maintained following established procedures.  Employees are trained in the procedures and use of equipment appropriate to their role in the response effort.  The emergency response plan is coordinated with the local emergency responders such as local law enforcement, local and state government officials, and the local emergency planning committee.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\nCWR personnel continue to develop new ways to improve the safety of the facility.  This is done through responsibility matrices and training which is a vital part of any safety program.  Training is conducted according to a systematic schedule so employees and contractors are given the most up to date programs in the industry.  All new and modified equipment is designed with appropriate safety controls and devices."
