The site is located at 100 Treatment Plant Road, Frederick, MD, just off of Gas House Pike.  The plant is boarded by  Gas House Pike to the north and north east, the City of Frederick Golf Course to the east, the Frederick Municipal Airport to the south and farm land to the west.\r\nThe Plant includes a separate highly hazardous chemical storage building that includes a control room as well as pump room.  The building is mounted over the chlorination contact chambers.\r\nThe boundaries of the highly hazardous chemical system subject to the RMP regulation include the ton chlorine and sulfur dioxide Chemical Storage Room, the Feed Control room that houses the chemical control and injection systems, and the Hydro Tank Room which has one injection point.  Chlorine is also fed to the head of each of the two contact chambers, and sulfur dioxide is fed to the inlet of the dechlorination contact chamber. These are detailed in the Block Flow as well as the Process and Instrument Drawings (P&ID) which are part of the plant Process Safety Information (PSI).  All drawings are maintained in the plant's RMP Process Safety Information.\r\n1.6.1.\tREGULATED SUBSTANCE (b) (2)\r\nChlorine and sulfur dioxide are the only regulated substances on site which exceeds the EPA 40 CFR-68 rule threshold quantity of 2,500 pounds and 5,000 pounds respectively.

The chlorine and sulfur dioxide are received, stored and distributed to the WWTP wastewater process control systems. \r\nChlorine is an EPA and OSHA-listed toxic chemical.  It is an irritant and it is corrosive.  It is a halogen with the formula Cl2.  It is a chlorinating or oxidizing agent that is not flammable.  It has a one ppm OSHA ceiling Permissible Exposure Limit (PEL) and a NFPA health rating of four, severe; with immediate and delayed health hazards.  Chlorine is not a carcinogen.  The maximum inventory stored on site is eight each, one ton containers.  This equals 16,000 pounds.\r\nSulfur dioxide is also an EPA and OSHA-listed toxic chemical.  It is an irritant and also corrosive.  Its formula is SO2 and in combination with water forms sulfuric acid.  It reacts with chlorine to form a salt and is used to scavenge the excess chlorine in the wastewater process.  It has a five PPM OSHA PEL.  The NFPA health rating is a three.  The maximum inventory stored on site is six each one-ton containers.  This equals 12,000 pounds.\r\n \r\n\r\n2.\tHAZARD ASSESSMENT\r\nA hazard assessment was performed to determine the effects a release would have on the public and environment. For both chlorine and sulfur dioxide, the distance to a set endpoint concentration of the gas would travel was determined.  In addition, an estimate of the population that could be affected by a release of highly hazardous chemicals was determined, and sensitive receptors such as nursing homes were identified.  The hazard assessment considers two release scenarios-a \"worst case\" and an \"alternative case\". \r\nTwo offsite consequence analyses were conducted.  The first is a \"worst case release\".  The second is a more probable \"alternative release scenario\".  The first scenario is defined by EPA, which states that \"the operator shall assume that the maximum quantity in the largest vessel is released as a"

The 3 ppm endpoint is the Emergency Response Planning Guideline Level 2 (ERPG-2).  The sulfur dioxide endpoint is 0.0078 mg/l which equals about 3 ppm.  These levels are defined by the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) as the \"maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms which could impair an individual's ability to take protective action.\"  The residential population within a circle with a radius corresponding to the toxic endpoint distance was defined, \"to estimate the population potentially affected.\"\r\n2.1.\tWORST CASE   (C) (1)\r\nAtmospheric dispersion modeling for the worst case scenario was performed using the EPA assumptions and EPA's RMP Comp Program.

Modeling using the EPA/RMP Comp and EPA's guidance demonstrated the rate of highly hazardous chemical release is 14.8 lb. /minutes for a period of 30 minutes releasing a total of 444 pounds of chlorine.  The toxic endpoint distances determined is 0.10 miles and is in the process safety information.  The residential population that would be impacted by this release is zero and is recorded in the process safety information.  Receptors in this area were identified as the municipal golf course adjacent to the plant.\r\n\r\n3.\tACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM (D)\r\nThe City of Frederick WWTP accidental release prevention program is based on OSHA's PSM program and EPA's RMP Level 3 prevention program.  The PSM program has been in place and has been effectively used for many years.  It is part of the plant's operating culture.  There are two parts to the program.  The first is the general overall City of Frederick WWTP Division-wide program and the City of Frederick WWTP Treatment Plant site-specific program.  The second is the chlorine or sulfur dioxide specific actions within the site program.  This is coordinated with the Frederick County LEPC and the City of Frederick Fire/Rescue Department (including the Ft. Detrick Haz Mat Team).\r\n3.1.\tGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM   (D) (1)\r\nPlant-wide, many elements of the prevention program are used for all operations.  An overview of the generally written programs is listed below:\r\nThe City of Frederick WWTP has detailed process safety information on each of its operations. \r\nThe document maintenance system is integral to the management of change for all operations on site control.  \r\nTraining is the backbone of employee knowledge, job operations and is ongoing in each area.  Employee training in operations and maintenance emphas awareness of the hazardous and toxic properties of all chemicals used. Refresher training is conducted annually.\r\nMaint"

      "SummaryText": "support equipment of the highly hazardous chemical storage building, the control room, and hydro room meet and exceed design codes standards and good engineering practices.  The storage, hydro and control building rooms are equipped with forced ventilation systems.  There is a separate area monitor for chlorine and sulfur dioxide.  One for each will be found inside the storage room and one each in the control room.  If a highly hazardous chemical is detected, the monitor alarms and shuts down the forced air ventilation system.  It also starts the building chemical vent system.  Both monitors alarm in their local area as well as in the WWTP Main Control Room. \r\n3.2.3.\tEquipment Design\r\nBoth chlorine and sulfur dioxide have two types of pipe systems, high pressure and low (vacuum) pressure.  The high pressure chemical piping system is made of chemical compatible steel pipes, copper or other like compatible components.  There are also non-metallic compounds (not corroded by chlorine or sulfur dioxide) all are rated to 500 psig.  The maximum pressure of the highly hazardous chemical in the high pressure system is only 150 psig giving a 3-to-1 safety factor.  There are two sets of four each one-ton containers on each chlorine line.  A vacuum check regulator is mounted on the top (vapor) angle valve of each ton container.  This valve opens when a vacuum from the control system is applied to it.  Upon opening chlorine vapor flows from the ton container into the vacuum check regulator and enters the manifold that carries it to the control system.  One bank is in service and the other is on standby.  An automatic switch over system places the standby ton containers on line when the ones in service are empty.  The sulfur dioxide is piped similarly however it only has three each, one- ton containers per set.\r\nThe low pressure system operates under a vacuum pressure of 13 inches of mercury.  There is a pressure relief valve which vents if the pressure in the line reaches above"
