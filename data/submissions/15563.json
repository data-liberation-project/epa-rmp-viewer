The program must consist of a hazard assessment, a release prevention program and an emergency response program.  Additionally, the operator must describe the site's risk management program in a risk management plan (RMP). However, the regulation provides for 3 different programs of compliance dependent upon the eligibility criteria of covered processes including, but not limited to, the potential impact of chemical releases as identified in the hazard assessment.  For example, chemical processes which meet the criteria for program level 1 and program level 2 have very minimal requirements for release prevention programs and emergency response as compared to those for program level 3.  \n\nAt General Chemical's Syracuse Works, one listed chemical, Anhydrous Ammonia, is managed on-site in quantities greater than the threshold quantity under the program level 3 criteria. No chemicals are managed on-site under program level 1 or program level 2 criteria. As identified in this plan, Syracuse Works is in compliance with the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68 for management of Anhydrous Ammonia.\n\nThis RMP describes Syracuse Work's risk management program which includes a hazard assessment, release prevention program and emergency response program. The hazard assessment includes one worst case release scenario and one alternative case release scenario. The hazard assessment was conduc"

It takes into account safety and release prevention systems and procedures used at the plant to control releases. It is more realistic than the worst case release scenario; is calculated from a USEPA designated table; and, is used to plan a facility's emergency response to accidents.\n\nThe alternative case release scenario for Anhydrous Ammonia at Syracuse Works assumes Anhydrous Ammonia would be lost due to failure of a transfer hose during the unloading process.  It takes into account plant safety systems designed to limit a release.  The USEPA designated table states that the material released would travel 0.1 miles before reaching a non-hazardous concentration. \n\n4.0  General Accidental Release Prevention Programs and Chemical - Specific Prevention Steps \n\nGeneral Chemical maintains a comprehensive release prevention program designed to prevent accidental releases and ensure safe operations of our processes.  The accidental release prevention program implemented at Syracuse Works includes procedures and practices which address each of the required elements of the risk management program including:\n\n* Process Safety Information - Information relating to the hazards of the chemical(s), process technology and equipment information is maintained to ensure proper operation.\n\n* Mechanical Integrity - Equipment is routinely inspected and maintenance activities are managed in a manner to maintain the integrity of the equipment.\n\n* Process Hazard Analysis - Processes are routinely analyzed to identify and correct potential hazards, as well as increase the safety of the operating conditions.\n\n* Standard Operating Procedures - Detailed procedures are in place identifying actions necessary for multiple phases of operation, operating limits and safety considerations.\n\n* Employee Par"

However, if a release does occur, Syracuse Works has prepared employees in conjunction with local emergency response groups, to respond to a release.\n\n2.0  Description of Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nGeneral Chemical's Syracuse Works manufactures Sodium Nitrite.  The process of producing Sodium Nitrite requires Anhydrous Ammonia to be used as a raw material. Sodium Nitrite has a broad range of applications.  For example, it is used as a corrosion inhibitor, and a meat-curing agent.  It is also used in the production of textile dyes, rubber compounds, and charcoal briquettes.\n \nAnhydrous Ammonia is received by the Syracuse facility as a pressurized liquid in rail cars and is unloaded into two storage tanks.  Each storage tanks contains 12,669 gallons of Anhydrous Ammonia. \n\n3.0  Hazard Assessment\n\nUSEPA's Accidental Release Prevention Provisions require that General Chemical provide information about the worst case release scenario and alternative case release scenario for Anhydrous Ammonia handled at its Syracuse Works.  The following are brief summaries of these scenarios.\n\n3.1  Worst Case Release Scenario\n\nThe worst case release scenario as defined by the USEPA is a hypothetical accident for one of the chemicals at a site.  It assumes that all safety systems in the facility simultaneously failed and that all of the chemical in the largest container holding it at a site is released in a very short time.  An USEPA designated table defines the distance the material will travel until it disperses so much that it is no longer hazardous.  \n\nThe worst case release scenario at General Chemical's Syracuse Works assumes that a rail car containing Anhydrous Ammonia fails. The USEPA requires us to assume that all safety and release prevention systems simultaneously fail, and the contents are released in 10 minutes.  The USEPA designated table states that all the material released would travel"

For example, the following improvements are currently planned for Syracuse Works:\n\n* Installation of secondary containment for the Anhydrous Ammonia storage units.\n* Installation of an excess flow valve on the outlet of the Ammonia storage tanks.\n* Installation of a liquid Ammonia sensor in the vapor line to the compressor to automatically shut down the compressor if liquid is present in the vapor line.\n\n\n\n\n8.0  Certification\n\nThe undersigned certifies that, to the best of my knowledge, information, and belief, formed after reasonable inquiry, the information submitted is true, accurate and complete.\n                                                                              _______________________________________\n                                                                                              Plant Manager"
