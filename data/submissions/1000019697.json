Public and employee safety, as well as environmental protection, are primary concerns to Hiland Partners.  Accidental release prevention is a key factor in the design, construction and operation of all Hiland facilities.  Hiland facilities are designed constructed in accordance with applicable codes/standards and are evaluated to ensure that the equipment and piping complies with recognized and generally accepted good engineering practices.  Hiland facilities are equipped with many engineering safeguards (i.e.: pressure relief valves, automated shutdowns, alarms, etc.) that are designed to prevent situations that would require an emergency response.  Hiland's emergency response plan is reviewed/updated annually and provided to outside agencies that might be called upon for assistance in an emergency situation (i.e.:  police department, fire department, etc.). In addition Hiland provides annual emergency response training to all employees in accordance with 20 CFR 1910 120(e),q. \n\n(b)    Stationary Source and Regulated Substances.  The Matli Gas Plant is a stationary source as defined in 40 CFR 68.3.  The regulated substance at the facility is a flammable chemical mixture, Natural Gas Liquids (NGL), which is an aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbon mixture.  The mixture includes N-pentane, isopentane, N-butane, isobutane, propane, ethane and methane.  These chemicals have an RMP regulated threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds.  The facility has two aboveground (design fill a 30,000gallon and 18,000 gallon) storage tank for NGL's (NGL Product Storage Tank) that have a maximum controlled capacity of 48,000 gallons.  Administrate controls are used to limit the safe fill capacity to 80% of design, or 38,400 gallons total (24,000 gallons and 14,400 gallons, individually).\n\n(c)    Worst-Case Release Scenario and Administrative/Mitigative Controls.

      "SummaryText": "nces were evaluated.  The worst-case release scenario (WCRS) assumed that the largest (30,000 gallon) NGL storage tank ruptured resulting in a vapor cloud explosion having a 10% yield, whereas the alternate scenario assumed that the 30,000 gallon storage tank ruptured resulting in a vapor cloud explosion having a 3% yield.  Each scenario was evaluated using EPA guidane documents and calculations.  The WCRS endpoint was calculated to be 0.4 miles from the tanks.  Population data obtained using US Bureau of Census data for 2000 indicated that 5 public receptors were within the WCRS.  The alternate release scenario was computed to have an end point 0.2 miles from the facility and affect 3 public receptors, based on facility inquiry.  Various administrative and mitigative (engineering) controls have been implemented/installed as safeguards to prevent deviations outside safe operating limits (i.e., limiting safe fill capacity to 80% of design).  Administrative controls include utilizing a well-trained operation and maintenance staff that periodically visit and inspect the facility.  Mitigative (engineering) safeguards include such things as high pressure/overpressure relief valves, high-pressure shutdowns, high temperature shutdowns, high level shutdowns, etc.\n\n(d)    Hazard Communication Program.  Hiland has developed and implemented a Hazard Communication Program in accordance with 20 CRF 1910.1200(h) that ensures:  1) an MSDS is on file for all hazardous chemicals used or stored in the facility; 2) all applicable containers of hazardous chemicals are properly labeled/marked; and 3) employees receive annual training on the Company's Hazard Communication Program.\n\n(e)    Five Year Accident History.   The Matli Gas Plant has not had a regulated flammable chemical release in the previous five years.\n\n"
