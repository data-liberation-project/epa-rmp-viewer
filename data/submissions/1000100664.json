C&D will begin its operation of the Victorville Distribution Center in March 2012.  The C&D Victorville location consist of manufacture of liquid laundry detergent and manufacture of cat litter, as well as administrative offices, warehouse storage, and shipping areas for the full line of C&D consumer products.  Victorville will be the west coast distribution center for C&D. The C&D Victorville site includes 13,600 sf of administration space, 77,000 sf of manufacturing floor space, and 358,900 sf of warehouse situated in a commercial zone surrounded by several other warehouse and manufacturing facilities. The facility will operate 24 hours a day, 7 days per week and will employ approximately 100 people.\r\n\r\nFacility Description\r\n\r\nThe operations affected by the Risk Management Plan (RMP) involve the receipt and storage of aerosol product in consumer  containers.  Product is received in palletized cases via trailer truck at site loading docks.  The product is moved within the warehouse to a designated aerosol storage location via forklift trucks.  Aerosol product is removed from the warehouse via forklift truck and loaded onto trailers for shipment to customers.  Pallets may be brokendown by hand and cases re-palletized to accomodate less than full pallet  orders. \r\n\r\nManufacturing operations at the plant do not involve RMP regulated hazardous materials above threshold amounts. Various hydrocarbons are used as propellants in the finished good aerosol products stored in the warehouse.  Hydrocarbon propellants are defined by the US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) as hazardous materials.  USEPA enforces regulations designed to minimize the potential for accidental release associated with the handling of hazardous materials.  Additionally, US Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA) enforces ac"

The aggregate volume of flammable mixture in the Level II and level III aerosol can inventory will exceed the RMP threshold.\r\n\r\nAccident History\r\n\r\nThe C&D Victorville Distribution Center has no history of accidental releases associated with the regulated hazardous materials.\r\n\r\nPrevention Programs\r\n\r\nIn accordance with USEPA regulation and results of the hazard assessment, the Victorville Distribution Center is classified as a Program Level 1 facility.  Program Level 1 facilities are considered by USEPA to present minimal risk to the community.\r\nC&D has developed programs to comply with the required environmental, health and safety standards.  C&D takes a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals through process management systems and programs which include:\r\n\u00bf\tEmployee Participation\r\n\u00bf\tProcess Safety Information\r\n\u00bf\tProcess Hazard Assessment\r\n\u00bf\tOperating Procedures\r\n\u00bf\tOperator Training\r\n\u00bf\tMechanical Integrity\r\n\u00bf\tManagement of Change\r\n\u00bf\tPre-Start up Review\r\n\u00bf\tContractor Safety\r\n\u00bf\tHot Work Permits\r\n\u00bf\tAccident Investigation\r\n\u00bf\tCompliance Audits\r\n\r\nIn addition to C&D's management programs, specially designed systems to control, prevent, detect, and mitigate potential accidental releases are also in place.  These include an automatic, early suppression, fast response sprinkler system installed throughout the warehouse.  Aerosol storage racks are segregated by chain link fence and equipped with in rack sprinkler systems to further mitigate aerosol flammability accidents.  All C&D forklift operators are trained and certified.  The firewater and sprinkler systems are inspected and tested quarterly by an outside independent company.  Safety & emergency training of employees will commence upon ramp up of staffing in March 2012. Note that for purposes of the electronic filing, the data entry date was us"

The plan is tested on a regular basis through exercises and drills.  The plan is shared with the local Victorville Division of San Bernardino County Fire Department.\r\nIn the event of an emergency affecting the local community, C&D will work closely with the local, county, and state agencies to ensure public safety.  These agencies take the lead in informing the public on appropriate actions in the event of an emergency.  Victorville CUPA (Fire Division) has visited the site on January 31, 2012 and additional fire and safety inspections are anticipated prior to operation start up in March 2012. Planned Changes to Improve Safety.  The site recently had a CUPA inspection on March 5, 2020 to determine compliance which we passed with a few follow-up corrections from the inspection.  \r\n\r\nC&D strives for continuous improvement of its safety programs.  C&D trains our employees to safely perform their assigned tasks.  C&D encourages its employees to suggest improvements or changes that will help minimize the potential for unanticipated failure of programs and equipment, including forklift trucks.  The system and programs are routinely audited, typically by an outside company, to evaluate effectiveness and identify areas for improvement."
