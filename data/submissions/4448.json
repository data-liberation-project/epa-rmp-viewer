This flow generates a vacuum (approximately 1-3 in. Hg) which opens the vacuum regulator.  Upon loss of vacuum in the line from any one ton container, a diaphragm in the vacuum regulator will close, stopping any chlorine from escaping.  Any chlorine in the piping upon loss of vacuum will be drawn through the chlorinators and into solution.  As the on-line side of the manifold becomes empty, the system automatically switches over to the containers in the stand-by mode.  This ensures that chlorine is available.\n\n\nThe maximum quantity of chlorine that can be stored on site is 18,000 pounds - 9 one ton containers.\n\nHazard Assessment Summary\n\nWorst Case Release Result Summary\nScenario Description: Release of the maximum quantity of chlorine that can be stored in the largest vessel - 2,000 pounds in 10 minutes.  The containers are stored inside a building; however, during delivery, the truck is positioned outside the building.  The side doors are open and the monorail hoist  extends outside to the vehicle to unload the containers; therefore, passive mitigation measures were not incorporated in the release rate calculations.  The most pessimistic meteorological conditions were used as specified in the regulation.  The reference table included in EPA's RMP Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants was used to determine the maximum downwind distance to 3 ppm.  The result shows that offsite areas may be affected.\n\nAlternative Release Result Summary\nScenario Description: A release of chlorine gas from 1/4-inch diameter leak until the container is empty (2,000 pounds).  The release rate is based on the pressure within the three ton containers, hole or puncture area in the pipe, tank temperature, and a gas factor, which incorporates a discharge coefficient, ratio of specific heats, molecular weight, and conversion factors.

In addition, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed.  This includes common practices outlined by the Chlorine Institute.  In addition to the Management Programs, there is a chlorine leak detector situated in each room (storage and feed).   In the event of a chlorine leak that reaches a concentration of 1ppm, in either the chlorine storage room or the feed room by the sensors, a red alarm light outside the affected room is illuminated and an audible beacon is turned on.

IRWD is extremely cautious in the handling of all chemicals and is very diligent about safety for its employees and its communities. IRWD staff is highly trained and utilizes modern equipment to monitor its facilities to provide safeguards, while effectively employing these useful chemicals. These chemicals play an important role in water treatment and water reclamation, enabling everyone to lead healthier lives.\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nIRWD has an emergency response plan in effect to handle potential emergency situations at this facility. This plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n1.) To save lives.\n2.) To minimize and avoid injuries.\n3.) To protect the environment.\n4.) To minimize property damage.\n\nKey elements of the Emergency Response Plan include:\n\n - A detailed Emergency Response Action Guide\n - Key phone numbers and contact points for the IRWD Emergency Response Team\n - Incident Command System (ICS) w/Unified Command interface\n - ICS position descriptions w/responsibilities\n - Vicinity and evacuation maps\n - Detailed task-by-task plans for:\n     - Evacuation\n     - Fire in a Process or Non-Process Area\n     - Injuries\n     - Threats/Civil Disorder\n     - Wildland or Adjacent Property Fire\n     - External Events (e.g., seismic)\n     - Potential Imminent Danger to Personnel\n     - Chemical Spill (e.g., caustic, aqueous ammonia)\n     - Chlorine Release\n     - Off-Site Event Involving a Hazardous Material\n\nIRWD maintains a safety committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.

These employees train monthly and run drills twice a year. \n\nThe Emergency Response Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, chlorine health hazards, and mitigation procedures, which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This Plan has been reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM, RMP, and CalARP regulations\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\nThe chlorine system at Irvine Ranch Water District's Rattlesnake Reservoir Facility is used for the treatment of recycled water from the reservoir.  This is an unmanned facility.  An operator visits the site at least once per week.  If maintenance on the chlorine is required, two operators/maintenance personnel are present. Chlorine is stored in one-ton containers (9) in the chlorine storage room.  Chlorine gas leaving the one ton containers passes through a vacuum regulator to the chlorinator.  Still under vacuum from the chlorinator, it is drawn to injectors and mixed with water from the reservoir.  The chlorine solution is delivered to various locations.\n\nThe chlorine storage room has two independent manifold systems connected to a common header that feed into the chlorine system.  Three chlorine containers are connected to each manifold system.  One manifold is active and the other is kept in stand-by status.  Chlorine gas is drawn from the one-ton containers through a vacuum regulator to the chlorinators.  Still under vacuum from the chlorinator, it is drawn to an injector and mixed with water from the reservoir.  Tanks are replaced in groups of three when one side of the distribution system becomes empty.  Irvine Ranch Water District operators use a monorail hoist to do this replacement.\n\nEach container is positioned so that the valves are vertically aligned.  A vacuum regulator is connected to the top valve of each one ton con"
