These programs enable the \nbrewery to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences of significant releases of \nammonia.\n\n      It is Anheuser-Busch's policy to conduct our business in accordance with all \napplicable EHS laws, regulations and permits and to promote a healthful, safe and protected \nenvironment.  Each employee is mandated to comply strictly with this policy; neither \nproduction goals nor financial objectives shall excuse noncompliance.\n\n      Also, it is Anheuser-Busch's policy to assume a position of leadership in EHS \nmanagement.

We ask our \ncontractors to adopt EHS standards, ethics, and policies similar to our own and we will give \npreference to suppliers who do so.\n\n      We encourage our employees, our customers and the public to share with us their \nEHS concerns.  We maintain dialogue with relevant authorities and local communities \nconcerning EHS incident prevention and preparedness.\n\nAmmonia System\n      \n      Ammonia is used in the refrigeration system of the brewery.  As part of the brewing \nprocess, the beer is cooled to ensure its consistency, flavor and overall quality.  To ensure our \nbeers maintain the many positive qualities that cold brewing imparts, we refrigerate our beers \nas part of the production process.  The beer packaged in kegs also is stored in a refrigerated \narea in our facility until it's shipped.   Due to the hazards of ammonia, it is necessary to \nobserve certain safety precautions in order to prevent unnecessary human and environmental \nexposure, both within the brewery and the surrounding community.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\n      The brewery has a comprehensive prevention program in place.  This program \nincludes the following elements:\n* Process hazard analysis and review, including corrective action follow-up \nrequirements;\n* Standard operating procedures for the system that all operators must follow;\n* Formal operator training;\n* Preventative maintenance to ensure mechanical integrity (inspection, testing, repair);\n* Procedures to ensure proper management of changes to the system;\n* Safety review prior to startup of new or modified equipment; \n* Audits of the PSM and RMP programs;\n* Incident investigations;\n* Employee involvement in risk reduction programs;\n* Contractor safety procedures;\n* Hot work permit requirements;\n* Process safety information; and\n* Emergency planning and response.\n\n      The"

In fact, the brewery has never had releases with these impacts \nsince it began operation in 1954. \n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n      The brewery's emergency response program is based on OSHA's requirements for \nemergency action plans (29 CFR 1910.38) and HAZWOPER (29 CFR 1910.120).  We have \ntrained employees for emergency response and maintain a Environmental/Safety Incident \nPlan (ESIP) which has been supplied to, and discussed with, the Los Angeles City Fire \nDepartment.  We conduct annual drills for implementation of the ESIP at the brewery.  \n\n      Brewery personnel notify local agencies when emergency response is needed. Local \nagencies determine if the public needs to be notified. If it is determined that the public needs \nto be notified, the local agencies perform the notification task.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n      ABI's Los Angeles Brewery ammonia refrigeration system is periodically modified to \nimprove safety.  In 1998, the ammonia refrigeration pressure relief valves were all inspected \nand upgraded, when necessary. Recently, a few additional changes were recommended by the \nprocess hazard analysis (PHA) team, based on the PHA review of the facility. It is expected \nthat these recommendations will be evaluated by December 2004. The implementation of \nthese recommendations will further improve the safety of the ammonia refrigeration system."
