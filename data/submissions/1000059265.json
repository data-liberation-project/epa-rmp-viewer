The primary operations that are carried out at the facility are receiving, raw material storage, blending/fermentation/distillation, addition of denaturant, inventory storage, shipping and administration.  The [dry] feedstock is stored, milled and conveyed from the Grains Building to the Process Building, where it is mixed to form a mash and fermented.  The resulting liquor is distilled and processed to produce denatured ethanol, that is shipped via truck or rail car.\n\n\n\nThe materials at the plant that are regulated under the RMP provisions are denaturant (natural gas condensate).  As of September 2009, Laddonia went to an inline blending process, so no denatured ethanol is stored on site.  The storage tank for denaturant (T-805) has overfill monitors and is located in a secondary containment area.  \n\n\n\nPublic access to the facility from the highway is restricted by a scalehouse.  Much of the property is fenced, limiting vehicle access.  Personnel are on-site 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  There is a general alarm system at the facility and there is a multi-camera video surveillance system installed at the property.  The plant is fully lighted.  \n\n\n\nMissouri Ethanol is committed to protection of the environment through the combined use of inspection, maintenance, employee training and response preparation.  All Missouri Ethanol employees receive basic chemical awareness and safety training.   In the event of an emergency, Missouri Ethanol's Emergency Coordinator will direct internal response activities to the extent they are within the qualifications and capabilities of company personnel, taking reasonable precautions to prevent or minimize the extent of release or the co-mingling of materials.  Employees within their designated work areas will respond to small releases, if such response does not pose a danger to their health or "
