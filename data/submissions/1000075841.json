This commitment is strongly supported by senior management and is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as employee training and in considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of the facility.  Targa Resources implements both administrative and engineering controls to reasonably minimize the risk of an uncontrolled release of a hazardous substance.  The Little Missouri Gas Plant does not anticipate having any type of uncontrolled release.  However, if an uncontrolled release does occur, the personnel supporting the site in cooperation with local agencies are trained to respond, minimize and eliminate any exposure that would occur to protect employees and the surrounding area.\r\n\r\nDescription of Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\nThe Little Missouri Gas Plant is located near Watford City, North Dakota and is a natural gas processing plant which receives raw natural casing gas from oil well production.  Natural gas liquids (NGLs) are extracted from the raw gas and stored on site.  The extracted NGLs include methane, ethane, propane, butane and a pentane natural gasoline mixture that is delivered to market via transportation vehicles and/or pipeline.  There is also a heavier flammable mixture (condensate) which is produced and sent out via transportation vehicles and/or pipeline. The gas remaining after the liquids extraction it routed to a natural gas pipeline for commercial sale.  There is also refrigerant propane at the site.  There are no listed toxic substances which exceed their respective threshold quantities stored at this facility.\r\n\r\nFacility Location and Driving Directions\r\nT"

The facility can be found by traveling State Highway 85 south for 5.6 miles from Watford City, North Dakota until it intersects with County Road 37.  Travel 0.5 miles east on County Road 37 to the intersection with 125th Avenue NW.  From intersection of County Road 37 and 125th Avenue NW, travel south on 125th Avenue NW for 1.8 miles to the Little Missouri facility.\r\n\r\nHazard Assessment - Worst Case Scenario\r\nThe Worst Case Scenario for this facility is a release of a flammable mixture that would result as a failure of a hydrocarbon vessel releasing the entire contents instantaneously to the atmosphere having an offsite impact.  EPA's RMP*Comp was used to calculate a scenario where the entire contents of the largest facility vessel was considered for a vapor cloud explosion release.  This type of scenario is unlikely to occur.  In addition, qualified individuals operate the subject processes.  The equipment is inspected and maintained according to a preventative maintenance schedule further reducing the likelihood of this release occurring.\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention Program\r\nThe following is a summary of the accidental release prevention program in place at the Little Missouri Gas Plant.  The Little Missouri Gas Plant has been classified as a Program 3 facility because of the close proximity to a nearby commercial facility.  The facility is not only regulated by the EPA's Risk Management Program but also the OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.  This summary addresses many of the OSHA PSM elements. \r\n\r\nEmployee Participation \r\nTarga Resources encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling process safety information to participation as a member"

Up-to-date process safety information is maintained on a going basis.  The reference documents are readily available at the plant location.\r\n\r\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDS).  The facility ensures that the process is maintained within safe operating limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\r\n\r\nThe gas plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes material of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment.  This information, in combination with trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features integral to the process are not compromised.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\r\nTarga Resources systematically examines the Little Missouri Gas Plant facility processes to identify any potential hazards and ensures that adequate controls are in place to m"

      "SummaryText": "anage these hazards. \r\n\r\nThe Little Missouri Gas Plant primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  OSHA and the EPA recognize the analysis as an approved method for conducting PHAs.  Plant PHAs are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering and safety expertise.  The team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\r\n\r\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to company's local and corporate management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in responses to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\r\n\r\nTarga Resources periodically updates and revalidates the PHA results to ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not deviate significantly over time from the original design and safety features.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Any team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings are documented and retained.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\nThe Little Missouri Gas Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as:\r\n\r\n1.\tUnit startup\r\n2.\tNormal operations\r\n3"

These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.  \r\n\r\nTraining\r\nAn established comprehensive training program has been developed and implemented by Targa Resources.  All employees are trained in an overview of the process as well as in appropriate safe work practices.  In addition to training required of all employees, personnel having specific responsibilities under the operating and maintenance procedures are aptly trained in those procedures.\r\n\r\nContractors\r\nTarga Resources uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the gas plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors:\r\n\r\n1.\tPerform their work in a safe manner\r\n2.\tHave the appropriate knowledge and skills\r\n3.\tAre aware of the hazards in their workplace\r\n4.\tUnderstand what they should do in the event of an emergency\r\n5.\tUnderstand and follow site safety rules\r\n6.\tInform gas plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work\r\n\r\nThis is accomplished by providing contractors with:\r\n1.\tProcess Overview\r\n2.\tInformation about safety and health hazards\r\n3.\tEmergency response plan requirements\r\n4.\tSafe work practices prior to their beginning work\r\n5.\tSite safety comprehension test\r\n\r\nTarga Resources evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.

The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\nTarga Resources has established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pump and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.  The basic aspects of this program include:\r\n\r\n1.\tMaintenance and operational personnel training\r\n2.\tDeveloping written procedures\r\n3.\tPerforming inspections and tests\r\n4.\tCorrecting identified deficiencies\r\n5.\tApplying quality assurance measures\r\n\r\nThe combination of these activities forms a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.\r\n\r\nSafe Work Practices\r\nSafe work practices have been developed to ensure safe operations that are consistent with industry practice and meet regulatory requirements.

The MOC program requires that changes be documented, authorized by appropriate facility personnel, and that the changes are adequately conducted to prevent any type of release.  The MOC program also ensures that changes are communicated to affected personnel and that training has been conducted as necessary.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation\r\nTarga Resources promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings.  Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidations.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits\r\nTarga Resources periodically conducts an audit of the Little Missouri Gas Plant to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented and functioning properly.

The management team initiates any corrective actions taken in response to the audit and tracks them until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and the two most recent audit reports are retained.\r\n\r\n5 Year Accident History\r\nThe Little Missouri Gas Plant has not had any RMP-reportable releases in the past five years.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\nThis facility is a non-responding facility and has coordinated with the local fire department for response to large accidental releases. As a non-responding facility, the RMP emergency response program and emergency response plan requirements (40 CFR 68.95) are not applicable at this facility. However, the facility does maintain an emergency response plan that serves as guidance for facility employees to notify first responders, secure critical operations before evacuation, evacuate the facility and account for personnel, among other items. Facility personnel are trained in procedures and use of equipment appropriate to their role in response to small accidental releases.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\nTarga Resources personnel are continually developing new ways to improve the safety of its equipment and operations.  This is done through training which is considered a vital part of any safety program.  Training is conducted according to a schedule so employees and contractors are given the most up-to-date information available.  All new and modified equipment is designed with appropriate safety controls and devices.\r\n\r\nManagement System\r\nThe Area Manager has overall responsibility for development, implementation and integration of the risk management program at this facility. Specific responsibilities are summarized in the backup documentation associated with this RMP plan."
