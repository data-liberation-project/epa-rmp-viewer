      "SummaryText": "1. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n\n\nTaylor Farms Retail conducts inspection procedures to review refrigeration equipment prior to startup and during operations. These procedures identify potential sources of release and equipment corrections required to prevent these releases. On-site personnel and certified refrigeration contractors review the equipment as required.\n\n\n\nOn-site personnel provide initial emergency response. On-site personnel will make a preliminary assessment in the event of a release and will provide first response. First response may include emergency equipment shutdown, system isolation, or controlled operation such as pump down to prevent or reduce an off-site release. No emergency operations will be performed that are beyond the capabilities of the operators or other on-site personnel. Local fire and police departments with mutual aid response will provide emergency response for a major release event. Refrigeration contractors would also be on-call to provide emergency response.\n\n\n\nEmergency response training will be conducted yearly for current employees and as required for new employees. Records will be kept of all training performed at the site for a minimum of five (5) years.\n\n\n\n2. STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\n\n\nTaylor Farms Retail uses anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant in their operations. Drawings in RMP Binder Chapter 8 - Appendix 8.1 show the facility location map and site plan.\n\n\n\nTaylor Farms Retail has over 10,000 lbs. of ammonia in any single refrigeration system. Anhydrous ammonia is used as a refrigerant in product storage, vacuum cooling, ice making and water chilling operations. \n\n\n\nThere are three separate refrigeration systems at the facility.\n\n\n\nSystem 1 - Raw Product Receiving - Pre cooling - Processing - Shipping: This system is the oldest system in the facility which was constructed in phases over the years. Original facility was constructed before 2000 and cold rooms "

System 1 equipment includes screw compressors, pressure vessels, ammonia pumps and auto purger located in the engine room, diffusion tank, pressure vessels and plate & frame water chiller outside the engine room, evaporative condensers on the engine room roof, air cooled evaporators and falling film water chillers in the cold rooms and valve stations and penthouse type evaporators on the cold room roofs. Two 12 palette (half car) vacuum tubes are installed next to raw product storage room during the summer season April thru October yearly. Estimated ammonia charge of System 1 is 56,000 lbs.\n\n\n\nSystem 2 - Finished Product Storage - Pre-cooling - Ice making: This system is the newest system in the facility which was constructed in 2015. System serves evaporators located in finished product storage and shipping docks along with the two 12 palette vacuum tubes and an ice maker skid that are brought to the site during summer season.

System 3 equipment includes screw and reciprocating compressors, pressure vessels, evaporative condensers, plate & frame water chillers, diffusion tank and related piping and valve groups. All system 3 equipment are located outdoors. Estimated ammonia charge of System 3 is 4,000 lbs.\n\n\n\nThe total quantity of ammonia currently at the site is approximately 80,000 lbs. Public receptors are located within the worst-case accidental release toxic endpoint area.\n\n\n\nThe compressors have safety cutouts that will shut down the compressors upon detection of unsafe operating conditions. System 2 has automatic cross-over valves that will relieve pressure and shut down the compressors in case of high-pressure buildup. All pressure vessels and the compressors are protected against high-pressure situations by safety relief valves. All low side vessels (except the System 1 Vacuum Tube Surge Drums) that are connected directly to the suction of compressors are installed with high level float switches that shuts down compressor upon detection of high liquid level in the vessel. \n\n\n\nSystem 1 refrigeration machinery room and diffusion tank, System 2 refrigeration machinery room, cold rooms and diffusion tank are installed with ammonia sensors that triggers an alarm and initiates pumpdown process upon detection of ammonia vapor at set levels in the vicinity of the sensor. Exhaust fans are activated in the engine room and refrigeration control system sends alarms to refrigeration manager in case of an emergency situation or any high pressure, high temp or ammonia detection.\n\n\n\nRefrigeration drawings are located in RMP Binder Appendix 8.1-Refrigeration System Drawings.

System 2 operates as two stage hybrid system during the ice maker operations in the summer season. In general, the process chemistry for each system is described in RMP Binder Chapter 8.3.\n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammonia (NH3) is a gas in its natural state and is extremely irritating to mucous membranes and lung tissue. The gas is pungent and may be suffocating as shortness of breath and labored breathing can develop if inhaled. Prolonged inhalation of high concentrations may cause bronchitis and/or pneumonia, with some residual reduction in pulmonary functions. Repeated or prolonged contact of high concentrations of ammonia to the skin can cause frostbite, redness, pain, and serious skin burn. See RMP Binder Appendix 8.4 for Safety Data Sheets (SDS) for anhydrous ammonia.\n\n\n\n3. GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nTaylor Farms Retail maintains a release prevention program to eliminate or minimize releases. The program includes regular inspections, monitoring equipment and logging conditions, scheduled maintenance, and operator training. There is a program to analyze releases for ways to prevent a similar future release, see RMP Binder Chapter 16-Incident Investigation.\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system has specific safety procedures to prevent a release. Operators and mechanics are trained for safe operation and maintenance of the refrigeration system. They are also trained in emergency response procedures in the event of an ammonia release. There are emergency shut-off switches outside the refrigeration machinery room for shutting down the system. Ammonia detectors are installed in some of the cold rooms, engine rooms and two diffusion tanks. Personnel will automatically be notified if any detector exceeds its set point. Monitoring is done 24 hours per day. An emergency automatic crossover system (for System 2 only) and diffusion tank allow system pressure to "

FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nAccording to Taylor Farms Retail there has been no incident that resulted reportable ammonia release or personnel injury within the last 5 years. \n\n\n\n5. EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nIn the event of a release, certain personnel are designated to determine the potential hazard and coordinate response procedures. The Safety Coordinator is responsible in coordinating emergency response and will be contacting emergency response agencies, schools, daycare centers, and acute care facilities that may be affected by the release. The Safety Coordinator will also be responsible for evacuation of employees if necessary and for coordination with community emergency responders if off-site evacuations are required. A description of the emergency response plan is included in RMP Binder Chapter 20.\n\n\n\n6. PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nRecommended corrective actions to mitigate the potential for an accidental ammonia release are proposed on the tables located in RMP Binder Chapter 0.0. The table items are a result from recommendations made during the Process Hazard Analysis, a Code Compliance Review, and a Safety Inspection performed by a qualified person. Some corrective items in the recommendation table originate from multiple codes but are listed only once. Based on the severity of the hazards identified, priority level and implementation deadlines are also recommended.\n\n\n\nAll refrigeration equipment is well maintained and operated in a safe manner by trained personnel. Operating, maintenance, training, and safety procedures will be formalized with improved written documentation.\n\n"
