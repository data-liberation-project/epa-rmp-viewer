      "SummaryText": "The Company's facility in Red Oak, Iowa produces fertilizer (plant food) for agricultural use. The plant food product is produced by mixing several chemicals in a reactor, including aqua ammonia. The ammonia storage process consists of two above ground storage tanks (each 30,000 gallons) and associated piping, valves, pumps and other miscellaneous equipment. The Company stores Ammonia, concentration of 20% or greater, CAS 7664-41-7 (Aqua Ammonia CAS 1336-21-6) in a threshold amount greater than 20,000 pounds.\n\n\n\nThe Company also obtains anhydrous ammonia from the United Farmers Mercantile Coop (\"UFMC\") via a pipeline. The UFMC is located adjacent to the Company. Anhydrous ammonia is transported via a pipeline from UFMC to the Company where the anhydrous ammonia is converted to aqua ammonia and stored by the Company as aqua ammonia. No anhydrous ammonia is stored on premises or in the pipeline. The pipeline is shut off and emptied when anhydrous ammonia is not being transported from UFMC to the Company. The total quantity of anhydrous ammonia that can be in the pipeline is approximately 1,000 pounds. The threshold quantity for anhydrous ammonia to make it a covered process is 10,000 pounds. Technically, the anhydrous ammonia is not a covered process. However, the Company has elected to include anhydrous ammonia in its RMP. The Company can either receive aqua ammonia by highway transport tanker or it can receive anhydrous ammonia and convert it to aqua ammonia. This RMP covers both the receiving of aqua ammonia by highway transport tankers and the receipt of anhydrous ammonia from UFMC and then converting it to aqua ammonia for storage and utilization.\n\n\n\nThe Company has one regulated substance (aqua ammonia) that is at or above the threshold quantity as specified in 40 CFR 68.130, and therefore must comply with the RMP program. The Company also utilizes another regulated substance (anhydrous ammonia) that is below the threshold quantity and the Company has included t"

Under this program, our facility has assessed, and continues to assess, hazards to determine how accidental releases can impact the public health and environment.\n\n\n\n1.The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the facility:\n\n\n\nThe Nachurs facility located at 1705 North Broadway, Red Oak (Montgomery County), Iowa complies with applicable requirements for ammonia storage, and it is Nachurs' policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state and local laws. If an accidental release were to occur involving the ammonia systems, Nachurs would immediately notify the Red Oak Fire Department, who would respond to the emergency.  Nachurs has an Emergency Action Plan which would be followed.  The Plan provides for sheltering in place or evacuation as directed by the scene commander.  Employees are equipped with radios to maintain communications.\n\n\n\n2. A description of the facility and the regulated substances handled:\n\n\n\nThe Nachurs facility produces plant food for commercial and private use. The plant food product is produced by mixing several chemicals in a reactor, including ammonia. The ammonia system consists of a converter, above ground storage tanks, associated piping, valves, pumps and other miscellaneous equipment.\n\n\n\n3. The general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\n\n\nThe Nachurs facility complies with USEPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable federal, state and local codes and regulations. The ammonia system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with applicable state law using materials approved for use with ammonia.  As an administrative control, tanks are only filled to 90% of capacity.  The ammonia storage tanks are located within dike walls.  The floor of the dike drains to a spill containment ar"

      "SummaryText": "ea.  The ammonia system is visually inspected daily, it is fully inspected annually by the Maintenance Department and it is inspected every five years by a qualified outside inspection entity.  The thicknesses of the tanks are measured every five years by the outside inspection entity.  Unloading of ammonia is performed on unloading pads with a 6\" berm surrounding the pad.  Tankers being unloaded are equipped with an emergency shut-off valve.  Employees are trained in the proper procedures for storing and handling ammonia.  \n\n\n\n4. Five-year accident history:\n\n\n\nThe Nachurs facility has never had an accident involving its ammonia storage system resulting deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or shelterings in place.\n\n\n\n5. The emergency response program:\n\n\n\nIn the event of an emergency accidental release involving the ammonia system, it is Nachurs' policy to immediately notify the Red Oak Fire Department who would respond to the emergency. The Red Oak Fire Department is aware of this policy.\n\n\n\n6. Planned changes to improve safety: \n\n\n\nNachurs feels that its system and procedures are appropriate for handling and storing ammonia, and there are no improvements to safety needed at the current time."
