The teams will include members of the operations and maintenance departments including supervisors and managers.  The goal is to have those involved with the chlorine process placed on teams.\n\nThe completed plan will be available for all employees.\n\n\nTEAMS\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nBryan Fisher  Op II                         \nGary Turley, Project Manager            Rock Marker Lab Tech II\n\nMechanical Integrity\nBryan Fisher, Op II\n\nCompliance Audit\nGary Turley, Project Manager\nRock Marker, Lab Tech II                 Bryan Fisher Op II\n                           \nCHLORINE DISINFECTION PROCESS SAFETY ANALYSIS\n\nHAZARDS\n\nTOXICITY\nChlorine, in and of itself, is not toxic.  It is, however, classified as a poisonous gas because when it combines with moisture it produces corrosive acids.  If inhaled the gas combines with moisture in the body to form acids that irritate and burn bodily tissues.  Chlorine inhalation can cause lung damage and death from pulmonary edema.\n\n\nExposure limits: TWA = 0.5 parts per million.  STEL = 1.0 ppm\n\nEye effects: 1 ppm can cause redness, tearing and irritation.  Exposure to greater concentrations of vapor or to liquid can cause burns and blindness.\nSkin effects: Exposure to liquid will cause burns.  Exposure to gas can cause burns.\n\nOther toxic effects: Inhalation is the major route of exposure. Exposure to 3-6 ppm can cause irritation of the upper respiratory tract, headaches, and coughing.  10 ppm will cause severe irritation of respiratory tract.  15-20 ppm can cause nausea, vomiting, dizziness, shortness of breath, and chest pain.  Pulmonary edema and chemical pneumonia can follow.  Exposures to greater concentrations can cause unconsciousness and death.\n\nExposure to 0.5 ppm for 8 hours or 1.0 ppm for 4 hours can cause transient reduction in pulmonary capacity.\n\nChlorine is not listed as a carcinogen by NIP, IARC or OSHA.\n\n\nChronic effects: Chronic exposure is unlikely because of the disagreeable odor of concentrations of even 1 ppm.  Tests indicate that intermittent exposures to concentrations of that level caused no observable adverse health effects.\n\nOral ingestion is unlikely because chlorine exists as a gas at ambient temperatures.\n\n\n\nPHYSICAL PROPERTIES AND DESCRIPTION\nChlorine is an element of the halogen family.\n\nMolecular Weight: 70.9  Specific gravity (liquid): 1.467\nBoiling point: -34o C  Melting point:  -101o C\n\nChlorine is stored under pressure as liquid in one ton containers.  Liquid chlorine is brownish and about 1.5 times as heavy as water.  Chlorine is removed from the containers as a gas.  Chlorine exists as greenish/yellowish gas at normal temperatures and has a sharp disagreeable odor.  Chlorine gas occupies 450 times the volume of its liquid state.   Chlorine gas is approximately 2.5 times as heavy as air.\n\nREACTIVITY AND CORROSITIVITY DATA\n\nChlorine is stable.\n\nChlorine is neither explosive or flammable, but will support combustion.  Dry chlorine is not corrosive but it easily combines with water to form corrosive hypochlorous and hydrochloric acids.\n\nINCOMPATIBILITY DATA\nMay cause fire and/or explosion upon contact with turpentine, ether, ammonia, hydrocarbons, certain metal hydrides, carbides, nitrides, oxides, sulfides, phosphates, or easily oxidized materials.\n\n\nPROCESS TECHNOLOGY\n\nChlorine is used at the Pampa Water Treatment Plant, in the manner mandated by state and federal laws, to disinfect treated municipal water by inactivating potential pathogens.  Although the exact process is not completely understood, chlorine is thought to penetrate the cell wall causing destruction of the organism.\n\nINVENTORY\nMaximum:  4 (1 ton cylinders)  Minimum: 1  Operating: 1\n\nSTORAGE\nTon cylinders are placed between roller chocks that are bolted to the floor of the storage room or on rollers on the chlorine scales.  Chlorine must be stored under pressure to maintain its liquid state (See boiling point above).  The pressure varies with ambient temperature.  At 50o F for example, the pressure inside the cylinders is 60 psi.  Pressures increase as temperatures increase.  The cylinders are equipped with a fusible plug that acts as a pressure release if ambient temperature reaches 158o F. To avoid excessive temperatures the storage room is ventilated on one side with an exhaust fan located in the ceiling. \n\nSince chlorine gas is removed from the cylinders by vacuum there are no pressure lines in the storage room.\n\nSAFETY LIMITS\nTemperature:  Upper..120o F.   Lower..N/A\n(In reality temperatures in the storage room are those of the outside because the room is not enclosed on two sides.)\n\nPressure: Upper  250 psi   Lower..N/A\n(Pressure would be approaching 318 psi before the fusible plug(s) give.)\n\nExceeding 158o F. or 318 psi would cause a release of chlorine gas that would threaten the safety of employees and physical integrity of any metals contacted in the presence of water.     \n\nELECTRICAL CLASSIFICATION\nN/A\n\n\nEQUIPMENT UNITS\n4 chlorine ton cylinders**\n2 scales capable of holding one cylinder each*\n2 remote readouts, one for each scale\n1 manifold with hookups for one cylinder\n1 regulator*\n1 chlorinator*\n1 eductor (injector)*\n1 cable hoist for moving chlorine cylinders\n2 self contained breathing units**\n\n*See Appendix II for detailed information on these equipment units\n**See Appendix III for detailed information on these equipment units\nPHYSICAL PROCESS\nChlorine is purchased in ton cylinders.  Cylinders are removed from the delivery truck and placed in roller chocks in the chlorine room.  Empty cylinders are loaded on the delivery truck and returned to the supplier. \n\nRemoval of gas from the cylinders is accomplished by means of a vacuum generated by a venturi tube (eductor).  Service water is pumped across a venturi tube increasing the velocity causing a drop in pressure.  There is an aperture in the venturi tube connected to a line to a v-notch chlorinator which in turn is connected to a regulator affixed to the uppermost valve on the chlorine cylinder.  The vacuum withdraws chlorine gas from the cylinder.\n\nThe rate of removal is controlled in one of two ways.  Manually, dosage is changed by adjusting a rotometer.  Automatically, the dosage can be linked to a percentage of the RAW water flow.  The chlorinator and eductor are plumbed in parallel and valved so that application can be made at the flash mixer (ahead of the sedimentation basin).  Chlorination is for proper kill of pathogenic organisms through the sedimentation basin with a limit set forth from the permit issued by the Texas Commision on Enviromental Quality for the Pampa WTP.  Final treated water chlorine residual is maintained by the chlorine injected at the flash mixers.\n\nFor the Pampa Water Treatment Plant the daily residual must be at least 0.8 mg/L leaving the plant and can not drop below 0.2 mg/L in the distribution system without a violation being reported to the TNRCC. \n\nThe in-service chlorine cylinder is placed on a scale for monitoring of pounds used.  Dial read outs, located in the chlorine room, provide constant monitoring of the total weight on the scales.  Each day during morning rounds (between 08:00 and 08:30) the weight is noted and the pounds used during the previous day calculated.  Chlorine consumption is entered in the process control spreadsheet as pounds used per 24 hours. \n\nThe regulator affixed to the cylinders are valve and heating devices that open when vacuum is applied and close automatically when the cylinder is empty.  Since the chlorine is stored as liquid under pressure in a partially filled cylinder (80% full at 68o F.= 1 ton.) chlorine gas is drawn off the top of the cylinder.  If, when the cylinder is placed on line a tiny amount of liquid chlorine enters the regulator assembly the heater converts it to gas.  \n\nThe regulator is attached to the in-service cylinder. The empty cylinder is then removed from the scale and is replaced by a full cylinder. \n\nCHEMICAL PROCESS\nWhen chlorine is added to water the chemical reaction is:\n      Cl2    +   H2O  -->       HOCl                 +            HCl\n chlorine       water        hypochlorous acid       hydrochloric acid                         \n                                                                                                               Hypochlorous acid is the primary disinfectant and is thought to inactivate bacteria, viruses, and most protozoa by penetrating the cell wall.  Certain protozoa that form cysts in adverse environments can, however, be quite resistant to chlorination.\n\nSome of the hypochlorous acid dissociates as follows:\n\n     HOCl      -->                     H+            +           OCl-     \nhypochlorous acid         hydrogen ion             hypochlorite ion\n\n\nHydrochloric acid also dissociates in water:\n        HCl     -->                    H+           +           Cl-\n hydrochloric acid           hydrogen               chlorine  ion   \n\nChlorine is an oxidizing agent and will combine with impurities, if present, in the water to form chlorine compounds such as chloramine.  Feeding of additional chlorine destroys some of these compounds (A procedure known as breakpoint chlorination).  \n\n\nVENTILATION\nOne fan provides forced air ventilation in the chlorine storage area and fan, located in the ceiling, provides for ventilation.  The fans are controlled by switches located outside of the room. \n\nSAFETY EQUIPMENT\nThere is a chlorine leak detector installed near the chlorinator.\n\nA bottle of ammonia is provided near cylinders to manually check for leaks.  (Ammonia fumes and chlorine gas combine to form a white vapor.)\n\nThe storage bay is  partially enclosed, located on the east end of the water treatment plant.  As previously noted the chlorinator room has an automatic ventilation system with actuated louvers.  \n\nPersonal protective equipment is located in the office building. Equipment includes boots, gloves, and rain gear in addition to the self-contained breathing units. \n\nThe door to the storage facility is clearly marked with the standard hazardous materials signs.  \n\nChlorine \"B\" repair kit is located with the personal protective equipment in the tool room of the administration building.  \n\nPlease see the emergency response plan for further safety information.\n\nALARMS\nThe chlorine leak detector alrms are located outside the chlorinator room and outside the storage area.  The alarm is also connected to the security system to generate a phone notification of a leak during unmanned hours.\n\nThere is a sedimentation basin chlorine residual analyzer to alarm if residual become to high or low.\n\n\n\nINSTRUMENTS\nChlorine residuals in the sedimentation basin are continuously monitored by a Great Lakes Instruments chlorine analyzer or as needed by the operators.\n\nMATERIALS OF CONSTRUCTION\nSee mechanical drawings for piping schematic.\n\nVENTILATION SYSTEM DESIGN\nThere is one fan that vents to the outside, located in the chlorinator area.  The fan is controlled by a limit switch that activates when the door is opened.  The limit switch also activates the force air supply into the room.\n\nCHLORINATION PROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS\n\nINTRODUCTION\nA \"What-If\" method is used to identifying hazards.  We have assumed only one operator on duty unless a malfunction occurs during work, such as changing cylinders, that requires a two man team.\n\nThe only place that chlorine is under pressure is in the cylinders themselves.  Therefore, the principal hazards involved are the integrity of the cylinders and cylinder valves.\n\nPLANT SITING\nThe plant is located west of the City limits on West Kentucky Street.  \n\nGround is rolling, stable, and above the flood plain.\n\nDistance from the chlorine storage area to the nearest dweeling is about 1,000 feet.\n\n\nINTERNAL FACTORS\n\nCHLORINATORS, EDUCTORS, PIPING\nWhat-if a leak developed on the piping?\nBecause chlorine gas is removed from the cylinders by vacuum a failure of the vacuum lines would: (A) Cause the regulators on the cylinders to fail closed; and (B) Cause outside air to be sucked into the lines.  No hazard exists.\n\nWhat-if a chlorinator fails?  \nA vacuum failure causes the regulator to fail closed.  No hazard results.\n\nWhat-if an eductor (injector) fails?  \nA vacuum failure causes the regulator to fail closed.  No hazard results.\n\nREGULATORS\nWhat-if a regulator fails?  \nRegulator is designed to fail closed.  No hazard results.\n\nWhat-if the regulator heater fails?  \nRegulator still functions.\n\nCYLINDER VALVES\nWhat-if a cylinder valve will not open?\nValve wrench can be struck sharply with the palm of the hand.  If valve will still not open the supplier is called and the cylinder is exchanged.  No hazard results.\nWhat-if a cylinder valve will not close properly?\nIf the leak is minor the valve cap can be put on and the valve can be opened and closed.  The handle can be struck sharply with the palm of the hand to seat it.  Check valve to see if leak still exists.  If the leak is bad enough for self-contained breathing units to be donned the fire department and or Chemtrec will be called.  Operators can don breathing units and enter the storage room with fireman and repeat procedure outlined above.\nWhat-if a cylinder valve breaks off while operator is opening or closing it?\nOperators while already wearing SCBA leave room, call fire department and Chemtrec.  After fire department arrives, leak can be stopped by at least two people wearing the proper personal protection equipment and hammering a drift pin from the repair \"B\" kit in the opening left by the broken valve. \n\nCYLINDERS\nWhat-if liquid chlorine appears in the hypalon tubing when cylinder is placed in service?\nClose valve, use hair dryer to gently warm tube until chlorine dissipates.  Remove regulator, rotate cylinder 180o, reattach regulator and place in service.  \n\nWhat-if liquid chlorine still appears in the hypalon tubing?\nTake cylinder off line and inform supplier of defective cylinder (probably over-filled) and request a replacement cylinder.\n\nWhat-if a cylinder develops a leak in a side wall?\nFire Department and Chemtrec must be called.  After the fire department arrives the leak can be repaired by two people using the repair \"B\" kit, while wearing the proper personal protection equipment.\n\nWhat-if a catastrophic failure of a cylinder occurs?\nFire department and Chemtrec must be called.  Operator will notify project manager or next in command.
