The Raleigh NGL Unit is owned by Tellus Energy and operated by Tellus Operating Group, LLC. The natural gas liquids are stored in one (1) 30,000 gallon tank containing mixed flammable compounds consisting primarily of ethane, propane, butane, isobutane, pentane, and isopentane. This 30,000 gallon NGL storage tank is located inside a remote plant site, the Raleigh CO2 Plant, and over one-half (1/2) mile from the nearest public receptors. A truck unloading dock is located in front of the tank. A dike is installed around the tank for containment of any potential liquids. Piping runs to the tank from the processing unit inside the Raleigh CO2 Plant. \r\n\r\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response policy at the Raleigh CO2 Plant, including the Raleigh NGL Unit, is to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws. If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the Smith County EMA and request that they respond to the emergency. We have coordinated our response plan with the Smith County EMA; Smith County EMA also receives SARA Tier II reports describing hazardous materials handled onsite. Our Emergency Response Plan has been developed in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements and includes procedures for responding to an accidental release, for emergency health care, and for notifying the public and appropriate agencies. This facility complies with EPAs Chemical Accident Prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations. \r\n\r\nWe have never had an accident involving flammable materials that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or shelterings in place. \r\n\r\nThe Risk Management Plan includes a worst case release involving a vapor cloud e"

      "SummaryText": "xplosion of the 30,000 gallon tank which would theoretically result in a release of 145,000 pounds of a flammable mixture. The endpoint to 1 psi is 0.4 miles as calculated from RMP*Comp(TM). The same endpoint is calculated for flammable mixtures or 100% propane. Based on the lack of past releases and the absence of any public receptors within the flammable endpoint radius, the facility is subject to Program Level 1 under RMP. Although not required for Program Level 1, an alternative release scenario was evaluated. Alternative scenario evaluations indicate an 1 psi endpoint of less than 0.4 miles."
