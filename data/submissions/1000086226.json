THE FACILITY POLICY\r\n\r\nTHE OWNERS, MANAGEMENT, AND EMPLOYEES OF NORTHERN RESOURCES COOPERATIVE ARE COMMITTED TO THE PREVENTION OF AN ACCIDENTAL RELEASE OFANHYDROUS AMMONIA. IF AN ACCIDENTAL RELEASE SHOULD OCCUR, THE FACILITY IS PREPARED TO WORK WITH THE LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENT, OR OTHER AUTHORITIES, TO MITIGATE ANY RELEASE AND MINIMIZE THE IMPACT OF THE RELEASE TO PEOPLE AND THE ENVIRONMENT.\r\n\r\n2. FACILITY INFORMATION\r\n\r\nTHE PRIMARY ACTIVITY AT THE FACILITY IS THE STORAGE  OF FERTILIZERS FOR SALE TO FARMERS.\r\n\r\nANHYDROUS AMMONIA IS RECEIVED, STORED AND DISTRIBUTED FOR DIRECT APPLICATION. ANHYDROUS AMMONIA IS USED FOR CROP PRODUCTION NUTRIENTS.\r\n\r\nTHE MAXIMUM QUANTITY OF AMMONIA STORED WOULD BE 220,000 POUNDS IN OUR 30,000 GALLON STORAGE TANK. THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY HANDLED WOULD BE THE UNLOADING OF A TANK TRUCK HOLDING 40,000 POUNDS.\r\n\r\n3. THE WORST-CASE  RELEASE SCENARIO AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO.\r\n\r\na. THE WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO FOR ANHYDROUS AMMONIA WOULD BE THE RELEASE OF THE TOTAL CONTENT OF THE STORAGE TANK RELEASED AS A GAS OVER 10 MINUTES. THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY RELEASED WOULD BE 130,000 POUNDS, WHICH REPRESENTS THE VOLUME OF THE STORAGE TANK AT 85% CAPACITY AS LIMITED BY DESIGN STANDARDS. THE DISTANCE TO\r\nTHE ENDPOINT (POINT OF DISPERSION TO 200 PPM) IS 1.12 MILES.\r\n\r\nb. THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO FOR ANHYDROUS AMMONIA BASED ON THE HAZARD REVIEW IS A 2 MINUTE RELEASE FROM A BREAK IN A 3 INCH PIPE. THE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT (POINT OF DISPERSION TO 200 PPM) IS .78 MILES.\r\n\r\n4. THE ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\n\r\nTHE FACILITY HAS IMPLEMENTED THE PROVISIONS OF SAFETY REQUIREMENTS FOR THE STORAGE AND HANDLING OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA, K-61.1, PUBLISHED BY THE AMERICAN NATIONAL STANDARDS INSTITUTE, INC. AND THE STANDARDS OF THE US OCCUPATIONAL SAF"
