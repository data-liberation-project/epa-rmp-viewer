We react steam and methane (natural gas) to form hydrogen gas, which we then purify compress and feed into hydrogen pipelines.\n\nRegulated Substances\n\nThis facility uses, manufactures or stores a chemical listed in part 68 of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, beyond a threshold quantity, as established by the EPA.  The chemical is:\n          Flammable mixture containing hydrogen, methane and other components, manufactured on site.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Policy:\n\nLinde is dedicated to being the best performing industrial gas company in all aspects of our business, including safety, health and environmental affairs.  Our safety, health and environmental policy calls for a commitment to protecting the health and safety of our employees, neighbors and the surrounding environment.\n\nThis policy is the basis for engineering and construction programs that produce equipment and process systems that minimize the possibility of accidental chemical releases and operational safety programs that ensure safe operations of our facilities.  Linde is committed to the continuous improvement of these programs.\n\nLinde is an active member of the American Chemistry Council and subscribes to the council's program of Responsible Care; Employee Health and Safety Code of Management Practices.\n\nPrevention Program:\n\nIn accordance with OSHA's Process Safety Management standard and EPA's Risk Management Program rule, the Laplace facility has a comprehensive accident prevention program in place.  This program is built around process safety concepts such as:\n-  Technical documentation of PSI (Process Safety Information), describing the physical properties of the hazardous substances, the safety systems in place to control these substances and the critical operating parameters of the associated equipment and systems.\n\n-  Procedures and programs to develop, maintain and control key progr"

Following is a description of some of these safety features.\n\n-  At this location, we have field mounted fire alarm control systems which tie into the central control unit that will alarm and indicate the location of the problem.\n\n-  Fire extinguishers are located in key areas of the plant.  They are inspected monthly and undergo yearly inspections by an outside vendor.\n\n-  Plant operation emergency shutdowns (if process variable is exceeded) will shutdown the plant and isolate the process.  This location has multiple plant emergency trips located throughout the facility.\n\n-  During plant emergency alarm conditions, this facility contacts Valero Refinery first responders.\n\nThe facility completed construction and was started up in 2013.  It has not experienced an accident reportable under the RMP regulation in the last 5 years.\n\nEmergency Response Program:\n\nLinde has an emergency response action program in place to minimize the effects of accidental release of regulated substances to employees, the public and the environment.

For situations requiring technician-level response, Linde has in place an emergency action plan with the refinery who is our site host.  The refinery's response team is considered our first responder.\n\nAll facility employees are trained in their role in the emergency plan and emergency drills are conducted at least annually.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\nLinde has a commitment to safety that is expressed in a company-wide goal of \"Zero/Zero\", which means zero accidents and zero injuries or illness at each and every location.  We look to constantly improve the safety of our processes using recommendations developed through the preventions program and a program soliciting safety suggestions from our employees.\n\nThere are currently no major projects for safety improvements that have reached the planning stage."
