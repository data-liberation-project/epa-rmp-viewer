      "SummaryText": "This Risk Management Plan for Eagle Glass Specialties, Inc. applies to the storage of Hydrofluoric Acid (70%), which is the only 112r listed material that is stored at the facility in quantitites above the trigger level.  Eagle Glass Specialties, Inc. has a maximum of eight (8) 55-gallon drums of Hydrofluoric Acid (70%) on site at any given time.  No flammable materials are stored at the facility at quantities above the trigger level.\n\nFor Hydrofluoric Acid (70%), the Worst Case Scenerio involves the rupture of all eight (8) drums at one time.  In this event,  The predicted endpoint for this release would be 0.2 miles, affecting 232 people.  The Alternate Case Scenerio involves the rupture of a single drum of acid, causing it to drain out in ten minutes.  The predicted endpoint for this release would be 0.1 miles, affecting 42 people. \n\nThe facility has not experienced a major release of Hydrofluoric Acid.   An emergency response program has been prepared to provide deal with any major release.  These measures include:\n     1.  Using  the plant intercom to notify plant personnel of a suspected release.\n     2.  Limiting access to the release area only to properly trained and equipped maintenance and supervisory personnel.\n     3.  Dialing 911 in the event of a major release.\n     4.  Utilizing established safe operating procedures to contain the release."
