The titanium tetrachloride is subsequently oxidized to titanium dioxide.  The Edge Moor site process also produces ferric chloride as a co-product, which is used in wastewater treatment applications.\n\n\n\nThe following RMP-covered Hazardous Materials are used at the Edge Moor site:\n\n-    Chlorine (Cl2)\n\n-    Titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4)\n\n-    Phosphorus TriChloride (PCl3)\n\n\n\n3.0     GENERAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nDuPont takes a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  DuPont was an originator of the Process Safety Management (PSM) framework, which formed the basis of the OSHA 1910.119 PSM standard in 1992 (and later the EPA's RMP standard).  \n\n\n\nEdge Moor's management systems address each of the key features of successful PSM programs, including:\n\n-    Process Safety Information (i.e. Process Technology)\n\n-    Process Hazard Analysis\n\n-    Operating Procedures and Safe Work Practices (including hot work)\n\n-    Training and Performance\n\n-    Mechanical Integrity\n\n-    Quality Assurance\n\n-    Management of Change (technology and subtle)\n\n-    Pre-startup Safety Review\n\n-    Compliance Audits\n\n-    Incident Investigation and Reporting\n\n-    Employee participation\n\n-    Contractors (safety, training and performance)\n\n-    Management of Change- Personnel\n\n-    Emergency Planning and Response\n\n\n\nThese individual elements of our prevention program work together to prevent accidental chemical releases.  In addition, DuPont has internal policies and standards that exceed OSHA and EPA regulations in the implementation of Process Safety Management.  We use first-and second-party audits to review performance trends, identify non-conformances with standards, and drive continuous improvement.  We have leading and lagging indicators of PSM performance, which are reviewed quarterly with top "

Edge Moor utilizes a comprehensive corrective action tracking system to manage and document actions taken to improve process safety performance.  \n\n\n\nThe Edge Moor site is also covered by DuPont's corporate standards for Management of Highly Toxic Materials (for Cl2, TiCl4, and PCl3).  These are mandatory standards covering the entire range of hazardous materials handling, including equipment design, materials of construction, supplier and customer auditing, operating and maintenance procedures, training, process controls, leak detection and mitigation, and emergency response.  These standards also provide for additional 2nd-party auditing by corporate highly toxic material experts.  \n\n\n\n4.0     FIVE- YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThe Edge Moor site keeps records for all chemical releases that occur at the facility.  There were no significant accidental chemical releases involving materials covered under EPA's RMP rule during the past 5 years.  \n\n-    There have been no lost workday injuries to Edge Moor employees or contractors involving process chemicals at Edge Moor within the past 5 years\n\n-    The employee injuries reported in our accident history typically involve small, localized exposures to process chemicals where medical treatment and/or work medication was provided\n\n-    There have been no off-site chemical exposure incidents within the past 5 years\n\n\n\n5.0     EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe Edge Moor site maintains an emergency response plan, which meets all the requirements stated in the RMP rule.  Our program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  Edge Moor maintains an on-site emergency response team with round the clock coverage for potential release scenarios.  \n\n\n\nFurthermore, we coord"

Edge Moor has strong working partnerships with the local responders such as Brandywine Hundred Fire Company, Delaware state police, New Castle County LEPC, DNREC, and mutual aid groups such as the New Castle County Hazmat team (NCCIHMRA).  Joint training programs are periodically conducted.    \n\n\n\nDelaware Emergency Management Agency (DEMA) in partnership with the LEPC operates an advanced Emergency Notification System including auto-dialer for specific locations, multi-media emergency alerts, and inter-agency response capability.
