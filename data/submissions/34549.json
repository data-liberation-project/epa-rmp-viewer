All applicable procedures of\n40CFR 68.170 are addressed in the plan, which seeks to provide for employee safety, public health,\nand response agency interaction.\n\nThe Joshua Street Water Pollution Control Plant utilizes chlorine to disinfect the effluent flow before\nsending it to the Flint River.  The treatment plant services the residents of the City of Albany,\nsurrounding areas, and a large industrial base comprised of a wide range of manufacturing.  The\nchlorination process includes (liquid) chlorine cylinders, chlorination equipment, an instrument room,\nelectrical equipment, and process specific safety equipment.\n\nThe Joshua street Water Pollution Control Risk Management Program includes the following key elements to\nmitigate the effects of potential chlorine release hazards:\n     *    Operator Training\n     *    Preventive Maintenance Program\n     *    Process specific safety equipment\n     *    Safe and effective standard operating procedures, written with operator participation\n     *    Hazard review of equipment and procedures\n     *    Auditing and inspection programs\n     *    Comprehensive Management Program\n\nFurther, WPC has an active environmental, health and safety program with the following elements\nspecifically supporting the safe handling of chlorine and the chlorination process:\n     *    Respiratory protection (SCBA) program\n     *    Chlorine detectors\n     *    Chemical right to know program\n     *    Personal protective equipment program\n\nThe Joshua Street Treatment Plant has an emergency response plan, which has been coordinated with\nthe City of Albany Fire Department and Dougherty County Emergency Services, both of whom are\nmembers of the Local Emergenc"

Emergency response drills, drill\nevaluations, and facility tours are conducted annually, at which time emergency operation and\nresponse procedures are also reviewed.\n\nWPC takes a proactive approach to risk management and emergency response through continuous joint training sessions between WPC employees and local response agencies.  These preventative measures will provide for the continuous improvement of communications and will maintain effective procedures for the safe handling of and timely emergency response to potential chlorine hazards."
