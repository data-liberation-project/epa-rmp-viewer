The commitment is demonstrated in the design, operation and maintenance programs developed and implemented specifically for this facility.\nOperation and maintenance personnel are trained in the appropriate emergency response procedures to follow in the event of an accidental release. However, accident prevention is the ultimate goal and as such a site-specific mechanical integrity program is being implemented and maintained.\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\nThe Williams Front Range Gas Plant is located near Keenesburg, Colorado. It is a plant that is designed to extract natural gas liquids (ie: ethane, propane, butane, and heavier hydrocarbons) from raw natural gas and at the same time produce a pipeline quality gas (primarily methane). There are no toxic substances above threshold quantities at this facility.\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\nThe Williams Front Range Gas Plant has developed and implemented a process safety management (PSM) program that consists of all of the required 14 elements of PSM. The facility has also implemented a Program 3 Prevention Program that mirrors PSM requirements, where applicable, and integrates required aspects of public health and safety relative to plant operations.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThe Williams Front Range Gas Plant has had no accidental releases in the past 5 years that have resulted in offsite consequences.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nThe Williams Front Range Gas Plant has developed and maintains a site-specific Emergency Action Plan (EAP) that includes actions to take in the event of an uncontrolled release of a hazardous substance. The EAP includes the names and phone numbers of not only company personnel but also the names and phone numbers of support services (contractors, police departments, fire departments, medical services/hospitals, regula"

Williams continues to look for, develop and implement programs that will improve an employee's ability to identify and correct potential workplace hazards. Williams also endeavors to ensure policies, programs and procedures are developed and implemented to meet applicable laws, rules and regulations.
