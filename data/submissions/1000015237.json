The Pleasant Valley Compressor Station was constructed to remove sufficient hydrocarbon liquids to reduce the heat content of the gas to within pipeline specifications.  The gas plant is designed to remove approximately 10,000 gallons per day from a 40 MMSCFD gas stream.   Liquid hydrocarbons are removed from the gas and are stored in one 18,000 gallon NGL storage tanks.  The liquid hydrocarbons are then transported via high pressure tanker truck to a fractionation facility for further processing.  The tanks are unloaded daily.\n\nThe Pleasant Valley Compressor Station is located over 4 miles south of the city of Myton, Utah.  The gas plant is located NW1/4, SW 1/4, Section 10 T4S, R2W in Duchesne County Utah. There are no public receptors in the immediate area.  The gas plant is normally unmanned; however the facility is inspected daily by Newfield personnel and tanker truck personnel.  The emergency shut off for the gas plant is located in several exit points of the facility.\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at your facility.   \nThis facility complies with NFPA-58 requirements for LP-Gas storage, and it is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to isolate, shutdown gas plant operations from the emergency shutoff, and stay away until the situation is safe. Liquid hydrocarbons will also be removed if possible without endangering personnel.  Once the site is determined to be safe, equipment will be repaired.  The Roosevelt Fire Department or the Duchesne Fire Department will not respond to any emergency at the gas plant unless requested to do so by a Newfield supervisor.  If Fire Department support is requested, Newfield personnel will supervise and coordinate all activ"

People will be kept away from the gas plant until the site is determined to be safe by Newfield personnel. \n(24 Hour)Emergency numbers to call, in order are:  Mike Guinn at (435)823-2073, and Brad Mecham at (435)823-4008.\n\nA description of your facility and the regulated substances handled.\nThe Pleasant Valley Compressor Station removes liquid hydrocarbons from a gas stream.  The LPG is collected and stored in one 18,000 gallon propane tank.  One tanker trucks loads per day are removed to ensure that the tanks are filled to less than 88% of their total capacities.  The plant is designed to remove 10,000 gallons per day.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario.  \nThe worst-case scenario is failure of the 18,000 gallon storage tanks when filled to the greatest amount allowed (88% at 60 F), resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  Since this facility is located in a remote, unoccupied area, the worst-case scenario would not affect anyone beyond our property.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps.  \nThis facility complies with EPAs accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.  The NGL system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with NFPA-58 and state law.  The site has been graded to prevent potential leaks from the storage tanks from accumulating under the tanks creating a vapor cloud explosion that consumes both tanks.  If leaks do occur, the liquid hydrocarbons would flow away from the tanks and accumulate in an area where the material can volatilize.\n\nFive-year accident history.  \nThis facility has not had an accident that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, or evacuations.\n\nThe emergency response program.  \nIn the event of an emergency involving our NGL system, it is our policy to shutoff and isolates the gas plant.  People will be kept away from potential fire and explosions.  Liquid hydrocarbons will only be removed if it can be removed w"
