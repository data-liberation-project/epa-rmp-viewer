We use a system of safety devices, rigorous training, strict procedures, and intergrated emergency response to prevent releases and reduce the impact of releases that might occur. Safety controls include hydrocarbon sensors, excess flow valves, interlocked ventilation, redundant safeties on critical functions, and alarms that automatically stop the process. The following safety measures are in place: Regular equipment inspection, prevenative maintenance program, elements of PSM, systematic training of all employees on job functions, safe operation, process controls, emergency actions; written procedures and standards basedon risk assessment, root cause investigation of incidents, and regular audits of procedures, equipment, and systems by both Sealed Air and outside agencies.",

      "SummaryText": "1. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES:\nThe Sealed Air plant at Madera has implemented an accidental release prevention policy which intergrates hydrocarbon sensors, redundant safety systems, operational procedures, and management practices. All applicable procedures of the EPA and OSHA are adheared to. The Madera plant Emergency Response Policy involves site specific plans which are detailed in the Emergeny Response Plan and coordinated with the local fire departemnt. \n2. THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE HANDLING:\nThe Madera manufacturers plastic foam packaging, and uses Propane and Butane as blowing agents to make plastic foam. These are the only regulated substances in threshold quantities at this location. Propane and Butane are flammable hydrocarbons held under pressure to maintain liquid form, but are relaesed from the product during manufacutring as a gas. This gas is captured and send to an oxidizer as a means of emission control.\n3. WORST CASE AND ALTERNATIVE CASE SCENARIOS:\n\"Worst-case release\" scenario is defined in the OCA and is the failure of the largest tank when full, vapors finding an ignition source, and 10% of the release explodes. The plant is located in an industrial park with no residental housing close by.\nThe \"alternative release\" scenario or more credible scenario is based on the catastrophic failure of the 2\" delivery piping. This breach allows a 30 seconl leak before the excess flow valves seal off the flow. The impact distance in both cased has been derived using EPA \"RMP Offsite Consiquence Analysis Guidance\" document.\n4. SEALED AIR ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS:\n*Risks and hazards for propane and butane are so much alike no distinction is made.\n*PSM Process - completed WHAT IF review of all stages of process.\n*System of hydrocarbon sensors at critical points of storage, piping, and manufacturing to identify releases.\n*Staged alarm and automatic process"

      "SummaryText": " shutdown by hydrocarbon sensors and fire alarm system.\n*Employee monitoring and safety check off for unloading, tank filling operation.\n*Daily, weekly and monthly checks of components and piping.\n*Regularly scheduled prevenative maintenance.\n*Routine periodic testing of sensors, interlocks, safeties, and alarms.\n*Hydrocarbon Safety Program - Corporate safety program that identifies minimum standards for the safe use of hydrocarbons, including training of employees and visitors, systems, detection, static control, procedures, equipment, and ventilation.\n5. FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\nNo accidental releases in the past 5 years\n6. EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\nAll employees trained on emergency action plan including alarm response and building evacuation. The emergency response team is trained for all emergencies including leaks and incipiant fire fighting. Fire alarm system will automatically summons the local fire department, shut down the process, and shut off the gas supply. Pre-planning conducted with local fire department. Emergency operation and response reviewed on an annual basis.\n7. PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPORVE SAFETY:\nNumerous changes to improve safety, reduce risks, and prevent releases have come about because of the Process Hazard Analysis, Hydrocarbon Safety Program, annual emergency procedures review, root cause incident investigations, wisdom from other facilities, internal audits, and annual fire department visits. As part of Sealed Air's commitment to safety, periodic review and update is an on going process."
