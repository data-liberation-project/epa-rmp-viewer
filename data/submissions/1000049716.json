At a pressure of 250 psi or greater, a safety relief valve activates to relief pressure in the system.  Once shutdown, the system will equiliburate the ammonia throughout the system.  Additionally, the compressors will alarm and shutdown once the pressure drops 10\" of mecury to minimize losses of ammonia from system failure.",

Like many food facilities, we use\n\nanhydrous ammonia in our refrigeration system. Ammonia is the best refrigerant available for our use.\n\nBecause of its moderate toxicity and slight flammability, ammonia is considered a hazardous material.\n\nGordon Food Service is committed to maintaining a safe manufacturing operation for our employees and the\n\nsurrounding community. Our refrigeration system obeys our local building and fire codes, as well as industry consensus\n\ncodes and standards where appropriate. Finally, to comply with requirements of the Occupational\n\nSafety and Health Administration and the United States Environmental Protection Agency, we have a Process\n\nSafety Management program to help us operate and maintain the system safely.\n\nOur priority is to prevent accidental releases of hazardous materials instead of merely responding to\n\nproblems. Our Process Safety Management program includes elements addressing:\n\n- Employee Participation: We involve our employees at all appropriate points in our program.\n\n- Process Safety Information: We maintain information relating to the safety of ammonia and the design\n\nlimits of the refrigeration system so that our employees are fully informed.\n\n- Process Hazards Analysis: We conduct detailed studies of our refrigeration system to identify the important\n\nhazards and safeguards and to identify appropriate changes to improve safety.\n\n- Operating Procedures: We provide written operating procedures to help our staff stay within the safe\n\noperating limits of the refrigeration equipment.\n\n- Mechanical Integrity (Maintenance and Quality Control): We have established a comprehensive program of\n\ninspections and preventive maintenance to keep mechanical failures from occurring.\n\n- Training: We train our mechanics in safe operation and maintenance of the refrigeration system.\n\n- Management of Change: Alterations to the refrigeration sys"

As required, this scenario has offsite impact, meaning that a level of 200 ppm ammonia is reached\n\nbeyond the property line.\n\nThe \"alternative\" scenario involves the function of a pressure relief valve, a safety device intended to prevent\n\noverpressure in our system. This scenario also has (much lower) offsite impact. We routinely make s"
