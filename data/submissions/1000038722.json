The location of the facility is 7113 East MLK Blvd., Austin, Texas 78724 in Travis County. This summary was prepared to comply with the Risk Management Plan requirements under the Clean Air Act 112(r). The facility has the potential to store a maximum of 64,000 pounds of chlorine in thirty-two (32) one ton cylinders. The facility utilizes 8 cylinders \"in-service\" and 8 cylinders \"stand-by\" with automatic transfer as the cylinders become empty. Once the cylinders are empty the lines are disconnected and connected to full containers. The facility maintains 16 cylinders in storage and orders chlorine, as necessary, for delivery of new cylinders and removal of empty cylinders. The facility also stores sulfur dioxide for de-chlorination which is a covered process under the Risk Management Program. The facility has the potential to store a maximum of 28,000 pounds of sulfur dioxide in fourteen (14) 1 ton cylinders. The facility utilizes 2 cylinders \"in-service\" and 2 cylinders \"stand-by\" with automatic transfer as the cylinders become empty. Once the cylinders are empty the lines are disconnected and connected to full containers. The facility maintains 10 cylinders in storage and orders sulfur dioxide, as necessary, for delivery of new cylinders and removal of empty cylinders.\n\n\n\nThe facility has not had a release event associated with either covered process involving chlorine or sulfur dioxide. The facility is equipped with several mitigation systems and process controls to respond to an emergency in the event of system failure.\n\n\n\nThe Walnut Creek Waste Water Treatment Plant maintains a Risk Management Plan containing all of the elements required for a program 2 facility under the Clean Air Act section 112(r) regulati"

These maps delineate the areas that are considered hazard zones under each scenario that would require either evacuation of the area or have the residents or occupants sheltered in place. \n\n\n\nAustin Water Utility (AWU) takes many precautions to prevent releases of chlorine and/or sulfur dioxide gases that could affect their employees, nearby businesses, and the public. The facility operates under a current Risk Management Plan which details both the dangers associated with using chlorine and sulfur dioxide and the precautions implemented to ensure the safe use of chlorine and sulfur dioxide in the chlorination process of treating wastewater for discharge to waters of the state. Precautions include routine inspection of the equipment, proper stock of emergency response and personal protection equipment, and training of facility personnel on proper operating and emergency response procedures. The most probable type of release may occur when there is a transfer hose or washer failure in the chlorine or sulfur dioxide lines. AWU has trained a number of workers who know how to use emergency equipment, self-contained breathing apparatus and other personal protective equipment to repair such leaks. AWU keeps a \"B\" kit on site and has trained its employees to perform repairs on operational leaks. The RMP includes current standard operating procedures for preventative maintenance on the chlorination system. \n\n\n\nAny Emergency Response is to be done in conjunction with the Austin Fire Department.
