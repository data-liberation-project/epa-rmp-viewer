Box 310  Shelby, NE  68662     \nMailing Address\n\nRisk Management Plan-EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nFacility Policy:\n\nThe management and employees operating each of our facilitied are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of hazardous material transported or stored on our locations.  In the event an accidental release should occur, we ae prepared to work with our Local Fire Company(s), Emergency Response Personnel, and other appropriate authorities deemed applicable depending on the specific incident, to best mitigate any release and to minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\nFacility Information:\n\nThe primary activity of our company is NAICS code 422510, \"establishments promarily engaged in operating country or terminal grain elevators,\" however we are also engaged in providing \"agricultural inputs\" that include the receiving, storage, and reloading of Anhydrous Ammonia for delivery to farmers in our area.  The NAICS code we feel most applicable for receiving, storing, and reloading Anhydrous Ammonia is #493130 \"farm product warehousing and storage.\"  Although Anhydrous Ammonia is the only product subject to the EPA Risk Management Plan at this time, it should be noted that we also handle propane for both agricultural uses and home heating, which is under condideration as a listed substance.  We include propane (as well as all crop protectants and petroleum products) in our planning, training, and maintenance programs, however only the Anhydrous Ammonia facilities will be included in this report.\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application to farm fields during the early spring and fall months.  During the balance of the year little if anyh product transfer occurs.  The maximum quantity stored"

The maximum quantity handled at a given time would be the off loading of a semi-trailer vehicle tank holding 40,000 to 42,000 lbs.\n\nThe facility is operatied on an \"as needed\" basis with staff present only during the receiving and reloading of product for delivery.  Total annual hours for these need s do not meet the 2,080 hour requirement to qualify as a \"full-time employee\" on site, therefore item number 1.11 is zero.  Our facilities have adequate lighting, and are inspected at various times of day and night throughout the year.  Time expended for these inspections is not included in our staffing calculation.\n\n\nAccidental Release Program:\n\nOur Anhydrous Ammonia accidental release program is based on guidelines found in the American National Standards Institute, Inc.(ANSI) standard K-61.1\"Safety Requirements for the Storae and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia; and the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) standard 29CFR 1910.111 \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.\"  We conduct annual employee training on the safe handling, transportation, and distribution of Anhydrous Ammonia, and have installed safety equipment including, but not limited to :Excess flow valves, Barriers to avoid damage by trucks or other vehicles, and Lock outs to prevent tanpering when the site is unattended.  We also maintain routine contact with our local fire department and emergency response personnel; and have provided and /or participated in safety training exercises on Anhydrous Ammonia.  We have developed an Emergency Action initiates evacuation, emergency medical care, contacts for assistance, etc. for all areas of our company including the Anhydrous Ammonia facility included in this plan.  The primary emergency coodinator is listed in the Registration Section of this document.  If this individual is unavail"
