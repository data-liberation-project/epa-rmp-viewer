On 9/20/2023, OG Packing & Cold Storage had an accidental release of ammonia. The accident occurred at approximately 10:55 AM. The Building D Zone 5 Coil #3 had abnormal ice buildup due to mechanical failure of the defrost drain pitch being slightly off. An operator then used a small hammer and chisel to remove ice from the ammonia coil, and ultimately struck the bottom tube causing a small leak in the tube.\n\nThe duration of the release was estimated to be 68 minutes before the coil was isolated, stopping the leak. The amount of ammonia released was estimated to be approximately 56 lbs. There was one employee injury. \n\nAn investigation was performed and the following recommendations were made and have been completed:\n\nRecommendation #1 -\nThe operator used a small hammer and chisel to remove ice from an ammonia coil. Abrasive tools should never be used on live ammonia equipment.

The main suction accumulator receives vapor from the flooded accumulators and separates any residual liquid from the vapor to allow only the vapor to be piped to the suction of each compressor. Liquid in the main suction accumulator drains by gravity into the liquid transfer pump. The main suction accumulator is equipped with a high level float switch that is wired to shut down the compressors in the event of a high level situation. This prevents liquid ammonia from entering the compressors. Under normal conditions, the main suction accumulator contains low pressure vapor ammonia.\n\nLiquid Transfer Vessel \nThe purpose of the liquid transfer vessel is to transfer liquid from the low side of the refrigeration system back to the high pressure receiver. The liquid transfer vessel receives liquid from Accumulator 5. Once the liquid level in the liquid transfer vessel reaches the float switch, the three way solenoid valve is energized for a period of time causing the liquid transfer vessel to become subject to high pressure and allowing the liquid to drain by gravity into the high pressure receiver. Under normal conditions the liquid transfer vessel can contain either high or low pressure liquid and vapor.\n\nCompressors\nThe purpose of the compressors is to raise the temperature and pressure of the low pressure gas in order to reject the heat absorbed in the evaporators and hydrocoolers to the atmosphere.
