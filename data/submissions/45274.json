Each facility maintains emergency prevention and response procedures and equipment appropriate to the hazards onsite.  A team of employees trained to respond to specific hazards (the CERT) is maintained at this facility.  The CERT participates in biweekly training to ensure preparedness in the unlikely event of a hazardous chemical release.  \n\n2. Description of Stationary Source\n\nAnhydrous ammonia (ammonia) which is a regulated hazardous substance, is handled at the Bartow fertilizer manufacturing facility.   The hazardous properties of ammonia make it necessary to observe safety precautions in handling the substance to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to facility personnel health as well as contractors, and to reduce the threat to the community.  At the Bartow facility, ammonia is stored in greater than the threshold quantity of 10,000 lbs.  Ammonia is used as a raw material in the Cargill facility.  The ammonia is stored in tanks as a liquefied gas.  The ammonia is then piped to the monoammonium phosphate (MAP) and diammonium phosphate (DAP) plants.  Liquefied or gaseous ammonia may pose a health risk if the compressors, containers, or lines transferring the ammonia develop leaks or rupture.  Ammonia is brought into the facility  via the Tampa Bay Pipeline into four storage vessels (bullets). The capacity of each bullet is 200 tons.  Administrative controls at the facility limit the quantity of ammonia stored in each bullet to 175 tons.  \n\n3. Prevention Program\n\nBased on a review of the applicable regulations, Prevention"
