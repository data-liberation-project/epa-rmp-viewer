Accidental Release and Emergency Response Policies\n\nIt is the general policy of the Grand Rapids Water Filtration Plant to take all precautions and preventative measures necessary to ensure against unplanned releases of any hazardous substances that might prove harmful, either to plant employees, or persons in the vicinity of the plant. There are numerous structural and administrative safeguards in place which are intended to prevent hazardous materials releases. Structural elements and mechanical systems are subject to a rigorous inspection and preventative maintenance program to ensure they operate properly. Plant personnel receive training concerning safe handling procedures for the chemicals they utilize in their work, as well as specialized training concerning procedures to follow in the event of an unexpected release of hazardous materials.\n\nIn addition to safety policies unique to the Water filtration Plant, this facility is also subject to numerous safety policies and requirements applicable to departments of the City of Grand Rapids in general. The general safety program policy for the City states: ?The city will comply with all safety laws and regulations.? Compliance with the edict is enforced via implementation of an active City safety program, administered by staff of the Office of Risk Management.\n\n2. Facility description and nature of regulated substances handled\n\nThe primary business of this facility is the treatment of potable drinking water for a resident population of approximately 275,000 persons. This activity using chlorine gas as a disinfection agent. The chlorine is in a liquid under pressure and is delivered to the facility via truck. The chlorine is stored in one-ton steel cylinders, with 24 cylinders being the average number on site on most occasions. Liquid chlorine is distributed by piping into evaporator units where it is converted into gaseous form, and it is then injected into the filtered water a various points.\n\n3. Measures for p"

      "SummaryText": "reventing accidental releases of hazardous materials\n\nThe Lake Michigan Water Filtration Plant is subject to two major MIOSHA Rules that address the prevention of accidents and injuries resulting from hazardous chemical releases. The first is the Process Safety Management Program (PSM), the General Industry Rule 91. The PSM program requires comprehensive assessment and analysis of all chlorine related processes, with the objective of ensuring that all systems are capable of functioning in a safe manner at all times. The second of these programs, The Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response Program (?HAZWOPPER?) is under authority of the MIOSHA Occupational Health Rule 325.52101-52137. The HAZWOPER Program requires development of a detailed plan outlining all steps which will be undertaken in the event of a hazardous material release, and which personnel will be responsible for various action. A formal HAZWOPER Plan is currently in effect at the facility and facility staff conducts regular test exercises of the plan.\n\nThere are a variety of structural and mechanical safeguards at the facility, which are designed to prevent the release of hazardous material, and to mitigate the effects of any release that might occur. Security at the facility includes perimeter fencing and video monitoring of exterior areas of the premises. A chlorine gas detection system is in place to provide instant warning of any unexpected chlorine release. A chlorine gas scrubber device is used to collect the chemically neutralize chlorine from an accidental release before the chlorine can be released to the exterior environment. Repair kits are located at strategic points in the facility to allow prompt control of any chlorine leakage that might occur.\n\n4. Five-year accident history\n\nIn the five-year period preceding the date of this plan, there have been no releases of hazardous substance from the facility, which have produced any off-site effects to person or properties in the plant "

Emergency Response Preparations\n\nBecause of the quantity of chlorine handled by this facility, it is subject to regulation under authority of Title III of the Superfund Amendments Reauthorization Act, also referred to as the ?Emergency Preparedness Community Right to Know Act?. This law requires that the facility, working in cooperation with local governmental agencies and officials, must establish a formal plan for responding to off-site chemical emergency incidents. The facility has established such and emergency plan, the most current edition of which is dated March 5, 1997. The plan outlines the nature and quantity of hazardous products stored and used at the facility. It identifies the projected areas around the facility which would be impacted in the event of a release and the protective action that should be taken by public safety officials to ensure the safety of persons within the affected areas. The plan also contains detailed information regarding emergency contacts that are to be made in the event of a chemical release from the facility.\n\nIn addition to the plan noted above, the facility?s emergency plans in response to HAZWOPER program requirements are also of significance. Although the emergency response measure outlined in the facility?s HAZWOPER plan are focused on protecting employees of the facility, the same measures are effective in preventing chemical releases to the exterior as well.\n\n6. Planned changes to improve safety\n\nNo changes planned."
