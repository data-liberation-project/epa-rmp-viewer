ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\r\n\r\nOK Foods, utilize anhydrous ammonia in a closed-circuit refrigeration system. OK Foods established; programs, procedures and safety devices to prevent exposure to personnel, community and surrounding environment also protect property assets.  Policies have been created to comply with all Federal, State, and Local regulations. OK Foods strives to prevent potential releases through continual, training and revision of policies, programs and procedures.  \r\n\r\nEmergency response program has specific notification procedures in the event of an accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. Working in conjunction with the Oklahoma City Fire Department and the Local Emergency Planning Committee to prepare for necessary notification of all affected neighbors.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\r\n\r\nThe primary purpose of our facility is the further processing of poultry products to produce cooked, frozen products for wholesale and retail consumers. We utilize one regulated substance above the threshold level:  anhydrous ammonia.\r\n\r\nAnhydrous ammonia is used as refrigerant for the refrigeration system, cooling and freezing. An outside company is used to fill our main receiver tanks.  Piping then carries the ammonia to the needed refrigeration, cooling or freezing units. Access to the site is restricted to facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors. \r\n\r\nO.K. Foods has two independent systems at this site. Both have capacity above the 'covered' process threshold.  The largest process contains 23,000 pounds of ammonia.  The total amount of ammonia stored at this facility is 34,400 pounds.  \r\n\r\n3.

      "SummaryText": "CH REPORTED SCENARIO\r\n\r\n\r\nWorst Case Scenario (endpoint based on RMP*Comp online ver.; population from MARPLOT 5.0.1)\r\n\r\nThe worst case scenario for this facility has been determined to be a release of 23,000 pounds of ammonia from the high pressure receiver.  The rule requires the assumption that the entire contents of the largest vessel, or the vessel with the furthest endpoint impact, without management controls, are released within 10 minutes as a two phase flow.  O.K. Foods has determined  the East Engine Room receiver to be the source of the worst-case release.    \r\nDistance to endpoint: 2.9 miles\r\nPopulation: 10,010\r\n\r\nAlternative Scenarios (endpoints based on RMP*Comp (on-line version); population from \r\nMARPLOT 5.0.1)\r\n\r\nAll 5 alternative scenarios identified in 68.28(b)(2) were considered and are summarized here.  \r\n(i.)\tDelivery truck transfer line failure at the East Engine Room receiver.\r\na.\tToxic endpoint distance = 0.4 miles\r\nb.\tPopulation affected = 0\r\n(ii.)\tProcess piping failure (1 pipe outside East Engine Room).\r\na.\tToxic endpoint = 0.9 miles\r\nb.\tPopulation affected = 4\r\n(iii.)\tRelease from hole inside OKC plant creates puddle\r\na.\tToxic endpoint < 0.1 mile\r\nb.\tPopulation affected = 0\r\n(iv.)\t1 high pressure relief valve release from plant\r\na.\tToxic endpoint = 0.8 miles\r\nb.\tPopulation affected = 0\t\r\n(v.)\r\nVapor leak from an 8 in2 hole in an un-liquefied container inside Plant.\r\na.\tToxic endpoint = 0.6 miles\r\nb.\tPopulation affected = 0\r\n\r\nScenario (iv.) is considered by the O.K.
