This process includes MSDS/SDS, PHA, Process Safety Information, Reactivity review, regulatory review, safety review, RAGAGEP for engineering standards, a PSSR process, HAZCOM & Process training and exposure monitoring. \n\n\n\nEmployees have received training in basic emergency response. The plant has an emergency alarm system. The facility utilizes a web-based area emergency notification system. The system will notify the SERLEPC, surrounding cities and affected plants in the area should the need arise.\n\n\n\nThe site maintains a fire water system designed to NFPA standards. The system consists of hydrants and monitors that cover the process and storage tank areas. Additionally the capability to apply foam from each monitor station is in place.

We continually strive to maintain our facilities in compliance with all applicable local, state and federal laws governing environmental. Health, safety and security. We continually strive to manage operations in a manner that protects the environment, employees, surrounding communities and equipment. The RCMS consists of identifying hazards/risk, mitigating those risks, implementation and auditing. This management system includes the assessment of release prevention and emergency response.\n\nNova is a PSM covered facility. As such, Nova has fully implemented all aspects of the PSM process. Two Process Hazard Analyses (PHA) were conducted with regards to acrylonitrile. The first reviewed the new acrylonitrile unloading system and the second reviewed the production process.\n\nThe PHAs systematically examined the process and identified hazards associated with the operation of that process. The process identified hazards, credible human errors and/or equipment failures that could lead to an accidental release, evaluated the likelihood and/or consequences of various scenarios, determined if existing specific prevention controls are adequate and where inadequate, identify corrective actions. PHAs at Nova are conducted by a multi-disciplinary team that includes representatives from operations, maintenance, technical and SHE.\n\nNova maintains clearly written operating procedures and safe work practices to ensure that both experienced"

Procedures are reviewed on an annual basis or as needed.\n\nNova utilizes a Management of Change (MOC) process to ensure changes to the process (chemicals, technology, equipment & personnel) are scrutinized before they are made to ensure the changes do not compromise the safety and integrity of the process.\n\nNova has a well-established mechanical integrity program. This program ensures that equipment critical to process safety is fabricated to specification, installed correctly and maintained in a safe operating condition.\n\nNova's management stresses safe and environmentally sound operations in employee training programs and in written materials available, including safe operating procedures.\n\n\n\nDescription of Nova Molecular Technologies and the Regulated Materials Handled\n\nNova is a batch chemical manufacturing facility. Nova's capabilities include batch and continuous distillation, high pressure reaction, amine chemistry, hydrogenation, custom production and commercial chemical development.\n\nThe regulated substance is acrylonitrile. A brief process description follows:\n\n?    Acrylonitrile is brought into the plant in dedicated trailers.\n\n?    The acrylonitrile is unloaded through a dedicated closed system into a dedicated storage tank.\n\n?    The acrylonitrile is pumped and metered from the dedicated storage tank to the reactor through acrylonitrile dedicated piping.\n\n?    The acrylonitrile is mixed with other reactants (amination reaction) and is totally consumed at the end of the reaction process.\n\n?    At this point, the next steps in the process do not contain acrylonitrile.\n\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe management of Nova has implemented appropriate administrative and technological safeguards to ensure the safety of workers and continued safety of public receptors.\n\nPrior to bringing acrylonitrile onsite Nova designed a dedicat"

The system includes the use of zero emission truck fittings, vapor recovery unloading, dedicated piping systems with minimal flange connections, zero emissions pump (mag drive) and flange covers. The system was hydro-tested prior to being put into service.\n\nNova has implemented the following plans/programs based upon applicable laws & regulations and best practices:\n\n?    OSHA General Industry Safety & Health Standards\n\n?    OSHA PSM standard (14 elements)\n\n?    Emergency Response Plan\n\n?    Comprehensive fire monitor system\n\n?    Spill Prevention, Control and Countermeasures Plan \n\n?    Hazardous Waste Contingency Plan\n\n?    Active member of the Southeast Regional Local Emergency Planning Committee (SERLEPC)\n\n?    Active member BAY AREA Citizens Advisory Panel (BAYCAP)\n\n?    Utilize \"Recognized And Generally Accepted Good Engineering Practice\" (RAGAGEP) for equipment design, material specifications, inspection frequency and hazard reviews.\n\n?    Utilize a computer based maintenance management system.\n\n?    Comprehensive safety, heath, environmental, security, hazardous communication and process training are utilize to minimize risk of material release.\n\nThe Five Year Accident History\n\nNova has no history of any accidental release of acrylonitrile, as this is the first time handling the material.\n\nNova has not had any reportable releases of hazardous materials in the previous five years.\n\n\n\nThe Emergency Response Program\n\nNova has developed an Emergency Action Plan (EAP) for the release of acrylonitrile. This plan includes evacuation routes, personnel accounting and training. The EAP also contains a listing of notifications to be made and responsible party.\n\nAn Emergency Response Plan (ERP) has been developed to address fire and release incidents. This ERP includes an acrylonitrile specific section.\n\nNova participates in a local web-based emergency notification system. The system allows Nova to provide emergency notifications to local LEPCs, C"

      "SummaryText": "ity Emergency Operations Centers, schools and local industrial facilities in a very timely manner.\n\nNova does not have a fire brigade and is therefore dependent upon the Pasadena Fire Department for response to fires. Operations and maintenance personnel are trained as incipient level responders and as such can utilize fire extinguishers and fire monitors/foam in an initial defensive measure. The fire department has been provided with a list of hazardous materials for pre-planning. Additionally, the fire department has access to the resources of a large, highly experienced chemical plant mutual aid organization (Channel Industries Mutual Aid).\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe following are planned changes to improve safety:\n\n?    Improved Operator training program\n\n?    Addition of remotely actuated valves (will prevent personnel from being in area).\n\n?    Optimizing operational procedures\n\n"
