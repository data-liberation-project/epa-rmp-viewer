The Houston Chemical Plant's Accidental Release Prevention programs prevent accidents at each stage of plant operation. New or expanded facilities are built to current engineering standards, and hazard reviews are conducted on all chemical processes. Process workers are trained and certified in detailed operating procedures. Equipment is regularly inspected to standards, and is an integral part of the preventative maintenance system. \n\nCoordinated emergency response actions between the Houston Chemical Plant and local emergency officials are planned and practiced. By working together, the emeregency response teams are prepared to take the necessary measures to protect the public if an incident occurs. \n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION\n\nThe Goodyear Houston Chemical Plant was built in 1943 by the U.S. government to produce synthetic rubber.  After World War II, The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company purchased the Houston plant from the government, and has since expanded and modernized the facility.\n\nSynthetic rubber manufactured at the facility is called \"Plioflex\" rubber.  To produce it, two petrochemicals, butadiene and styrene are reacted with several chemical agents in a soap and water solution. The reaction of butadiene and styrene to produce rubber gives off heat, and the temperature of reaction is controlled by the coolant anhydrous ammonia.\n\nButadiene is a flammable substance that is stored under pressure in sufficient quantity to be regulated.  Anhydrous ammonia is also regulated.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM \n\nThe prevention program is guided by the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation, and applies to process operations containing the chemicals butadiene and anhydrous ammonia. Some of the more important aspects of the accidental release prevent"

Goodyear conducts training and participates in practice; with CIMA plant members.\n\nThe Goodyear emergency response teams are trained in fire fighting, rescue, hazardous materials response, and emergency medical care. \n\nGoodyear Houston is a active member of the Houston Local Emergency Planning Committee.\n\nPLANNED IMPROVEMENTS\n\nThe Goodyear Houston Chemical Plant has programs and systems in place that result in continuous improvements in safety at the facility ."
