      "SummaryText": "octane gasoline feed fractions from the Naphtha HDS and Hydrocracker units into a stabilized high octane blending stock. This is accomplished through the use of catalyst under high temperatures and a hydrogen atmosphere. The Naphtha Hydrosulfurization (HDS) Unit is designed to treat the feedstock for the #1 Reformer. Treatment is necessary to prevent contamination and plugging of the Reformer catalyst. The #1 Reformer/Naphtha HDS Unit is Program 3 because of regulated flammable mixtures.\n\nCoker\nThe Coker is a thermal cracking unit designed to receive and process vacuum residuum from the Crude unit which is separated into sweet dry gas, debutanized or depropanized gasoline, coker stove oil, light coker gas oil, heavy coker gas oil and coke.

      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe BP Cherry Point Refinery has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe BP Cherry Point Refinery, located in Blaine, WA, operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products from crude oil. The refinery has several regulated flammables: isobutane, pentane, propane and a flammable mixture. In addition, the refinery uses ammonia, which is a regulated toxic substance.  Other toxic substances common to refineries were evaluated.  Hydrogen sulfide, sulfur dioxide and mercaptans do not exceed their respective T/Qs and therefore are not reported. The regulated processes consist of the following units:\n\nCrude/Vacuum Unit\nThe Crude/Vacuum Unit consists of two processes. The Crude Unit consists of two basic processes, thermal fractionation and vacuum fractionation. The Crude Unit is the initial process unit in the refinery. It is designed to take raw crude oil, remove salt and sediment, then heat and fractionate the crude into finished and intermediate products. The Vacuum Unit is designed to process crude tower bottoms in the vacuum diesel fractionator (VDF) tower and the vacuum tower.  Negative pressure, a vacuum, is required to fractionate this heavy material without forming coke. The Crude Unit is Program 3 because of regulated flammable mixtures.\n\n#1 Reformer/Naphtha HDS Unit\nThe #1 Reformer/Naphtha HDS Unit consists of two processes. The purpose of the #1 Reformer/Naphtha HDS Unit is to convert the low"

The #2 Reformer is Program 3 because of regulated flammable mixtures.\n\nLiquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) Unit\nThe Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) Unit processes light end absorber release gas and produces fuel gas and propane. The Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) Unit is Program 3 because of regulated flammable mixtures.\n\nStorage and Handling\nThe Storage and Handling area involves storing unit feeds and intermediates (Tank Farm-Unit 33), blending finished fuels and shipping to the Olympic Pipeline (Blender-Unit 36), receiving and shipping of unfinished products across the dock (Dock-Unit 34/35), and the storage and shipment of liquefied petroleum gas by rail and truck (Propane/Butane Loading -Unit 37). Storage and Handling is Program 3 because of regulated flammable liquids.\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT RESULTS\n\nThe worst-case scenario associated with toxic substances in Program 3 processes at the Cherry Point Refinery is a catastrophic failure in the Hydrocracker, resulting in a release of 59,200 lb. of anhydrous ammonia over a 10 minute period.  Although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit was taken for administrative controls or passive mitigation measures was taken into account evaluating this scenario.  The maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 200-ppm (0.14 milligrams per liter) for this worst case scenario is 2.8 miles.  None of the other toxics at the Cherry Point Refinery exceed their T/Qs.\n\nThe alternative case scenario for anhydrous ammonia is failure of a transfer hose line during transfer from a supply truck to our storage tank.  This failure results in a release of 1,450 lb of anhydrous ammonia over a 10-minute period for a total release of 14,500 lb.  The release period of 10 minutes might seem too little at first glance, however, the tank truck and discharge lines have excess flow val"

We also have 3 fire monitors that can be directed into the area for further mitigation.  No credit was taken for this mitigation in calculating the alternate case scenario distance of 1.1 miles.\n\nThe worst case scenario for a release of flammable substances in program 3 processes at the refinery is a vapor cloud explosion involving the full inventory of the largest storage tank containing isobutane.  No administrative controls are in place to limit the storage inventory in the tank, therefore, the full tank inventory of 6,000,000 lb is assumed to release, completely vaporize, and ignite resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this worst case scenario is 1.46 miles.  Although we have controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for mitigation measures was taken into account in evaluating this worst case scenario.\n\nThe alternate release scenario for flammable substances at the Cherry Point Refinery is a vapor cloud explosion resulting from the release of propane from a rail car damaged in an accident while being moved inside the refinery.  Even though unlikely, the entire contents, 150,000 lb, of the rail car are lost over a 10-minute period.  The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this event is 0.29 miles.  This event was selected as being a more practical scenario for the Cherry Point Refinery.\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the BP Cherry Point Refinery. Because processes at the refinery that are regulated by the EPA RMP regulation are also subject to the OSHA PSM standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\nEMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION\n\nBP Cherry Point e"

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis performed at Cherry Point will be either HAZOPs (hazard and operability studies) or What if-Checklist studies.  The HAZOP and What if-Checklist process is based on the principle that a team approach to hazard analysis will identify more problems than when individuals working separately and combine results.  The PHA team consists of individuals with varying backgrounds and expertise who are brought together and, through collective brainstorming, thoroughly review of the hazards of the process.\n\nThe team's findings are forwarded to local management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options are tracked until they're complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, tracked to completion and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the refinery periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews are conducted every 5 years. The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.\n\nOPERATING PROCEDURES\n\nThe Cherry Point Refinery maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process. These procedures can be used as a reference by experie"

These procedures are maintained current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\n\nThis information is readily available to operators in the process units and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\nTRAINING\n\nTo compliment the written procedures for process operations, the refinery has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process. New employees receive basic training in refinery operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years. All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training. A modern, up to date, fully programmable computer-driven simulator is also available for Crude Unit employees to practice unit operation.  The simulator is fully functional and can duplicate all unit characteristics.  The display panels, which are identical to those used in our control room are realistic. The simulator can also be used to simulate proposed changes to determine whether safety parameters could be violated.\n\nCONTRACTORS\nThe Cherry Point Refinery uses contractors to supplement its work force during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.

This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work. In addition, the refinery evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor. Refinery personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\nPRE-STARTUP SAFETY REVIEWS\n\nThe Cherry Point Refinery conducts a process startup safety review for any new facility or facility modifications that requires a change in the process safety information. The purpose of the safety review is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment in service. This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all-supporting systems are operationally ready. A safety review involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\nMECHANICAL INTEGRITY\n\nThe refinery has well established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.

If a deficiency is identified, employees correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service, or a team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\n\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance. The Cherry Point Refinery incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs. This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\nSAFE WORK PRACTICES\n\nThe Cherry Point Refinery has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety. Examples of these include: (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (4) a permit and procedure to control hot work activities, and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space. These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\nMANAGEMENT OF CHANGE\n\nThe Cherry Point Refinery has a comprehensive"

Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures are updated to incorporate these changes. In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.\n\nINCIDENT INVESTIGATION\n\nThe refinery promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury. The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a reoccurrence, and forwards these results to refinery management for resolution. Corrective action taken in response to the investigation teams' findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete.

The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released. The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first-aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post incident cleanup and decontamination requirements. In addition, the refinery has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment. Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties. The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to refinery processes or other refinery facilities.\n\nThe overall emergency response program for the Cherry Point Refinery is coordinated with the Whatcom County Local Emergency Planning Committee. This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives.
