Hester Water Treatment Plant, Big Spring, Texas are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\r\n\r\n2.  The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\r\nRoy C. Hester Water Treatment Plant's primary activities encompass water treatment for the City of Big Spring, Texas.  We have two regulated substances present at our facility, Chlorine and Ammonia (Anhydrous).  The regulated substances at our facility are used to treat (disinfect) potable water for our customers.\r\n\r\nThe maximum inventory of Chlorine at our facility is 16,000 pounds.  The maximum inventory of Ammonia (Anhydrous) is 14,010 pounds.\r\n\r\n3.  The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\nRoy C. Hester Water Treatment Plant has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release program that is in place at our stationary source.\r\n\r\nSafety Information\r\nRoy C. Hester Water Treatment Plant maintains a detailed record of safety information that includes the management system, major hazards summary, MSDS data sheets, safe upper and lower temperatures, pressures, flows and compositions, equipment specifications, and codes and standards. \r\n\r\nHazard Review\r\nRoy C. Hester Water Treatment Plant conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently"

The checklists are undertaken by a team of quailfied personnel with expertise in process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of five years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\nFor the purpose of safety conducting activities within our covered processes, Roy C. Hester Water Treatment Plant maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\r\n\r\nTraining Program\r\nRoy C. Hester Water Treatment Plant has a training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competant in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Training includes both formal classroom training and one-on-one on the job training.  Formal classroom is provided at short courses to comply with operator certification requirements.  Employees complete a 20-hour safety course.\r\n\r\nManagement\r\nRoy C. Hester Water Treatment Plant carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to enssure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks include among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems and controls.  Qualified personnel carry out maintenance operations with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits\r\nRoy C.
