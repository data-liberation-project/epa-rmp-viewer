Bustamante Wastewater Treatment Plant (RRBWWTP).  The RRBWWTP is at 10001 Southside Road in El Paso, Texas.  The location is depicted on the Site Location Map in Appendix C.  This plant is surrounded by agricultural, residential land and vacant land.  The plant is bordered to the southwest by the international boundary with Mexico, to the northwest by the Jonathon Rogers Water Treatment Plant and to the Southeast bye the Rio Bosque Wetlands Park.\r\n\r\n1.2 ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\r\nEPWU-PSB has prepared this Risk Management Plan (RMP) for the chlorination process at RRBWWTP, in compliance with 40CFR68, found in the EPA's General Risk Management Program Guidance (GRM\u00ad PG), the registration for this process is presented in Appendix A.\r\n\r\nThe RMP objectives are:\r\n\u00bf\tHazard Assessment-communicate the extent of a possible chlorine release and identify potential receptors\r\n\u00bf\tPrevention Program-develop strategies to prevent an accidental release\r\n\u00bf\tEmergency Response Program-formulate contingency planning in the case of an accidental release\r\n\r\nHazard Assessment\r\nThe worst case scenario modeled by the Areal Locations of Hazardous Atmospheres (ALOHA&reg;) software indicates a vulnerable zone radius of 2.5 miles.  The alternative release analysis indicates a vulnerable zone radius of 13 yards. The Hazard Assessment shows an estimated population within the worst case scenario at 22,700 people; Mexico's potential affected population was unable to be determined however, a comparable population in Mexico resides within the vulnerable zone. The alternative \"more likely\" release estimated population is approximately 0 people.\r\n\r\nThe RMP rule requires the identification of environmental receptors within the toxic endpoint zone for both worst case"

The RRBWWTP is approximately eight-hundred (800) yard from the Rio Grande River. The Rio Grande River is a natural and international border between Mexico and United States and provides habitat for aquatic wildlife. The International Boundary and Water Commission (IBWC), is the responsible agency to monitor the ecosystem of the Rio Grande.\r\n\r\n2.\tThe Rio Bosque Park.  Located southeast of the RRBWTP, the Rio Bosque Park is a 372-acre wetland. This natural habitat can be a highly productive ecosystem during the monsoon season. The park is owned by the City of El Paso and provides habitat to wildlife and migratory birds.\r\n\r\n3.\tThe Feather Lake Wildlife Sanctuary.  The Feather Lake Wildlife Sanctuary is a 44-acre wetland, used as stormwater retention and managed for wildlife conservation.\r\n\r\nThese three environmental receptors qualify as vulnerable zones in the worst case release scenario. There were no vulnerable zones found in the alternative release scenario.\r\n\r\nPrevention Program\r\nThe goal of the Prevention Program is to integrate technologies, procedures, and management practices to minimize the probability of an accidental chlorine release. The Prevention Program incorporates safety information, hazard review, operating procedures, training, maintenance, compliance audits and incident investigations.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\nThe Emergency Response Program is modeled after the EPWU-PSB's \"Emergency Response Action Plan\" and the Chlorine Institute Pamphlet 1 Chlorine Basics.  The Emergency Response Program incorporates an emergency response plan, equipment procedures and training in relevant procedures for employees involved in the chlorination process.  \r\n\r\nMexico and The United States created the Jointed Contingency Plan (JCP), designed for rapid international response to contingencies associated with chemical hazardous substances on the inland bor"

The JCP is designed to protect the health, human safety and the environment by providing international guidance and coordinated responses between the two countries (Mexico-US).\r\n\r\n1.3 PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\nEPWU-PSB plans to review and revise, as necessary, the chlorination process operating procedures in order to make certain that the operators understand the human factors that may lead to accidental releases.  The emergency response plan is also reviewed and updated to reflect changes and ensure that employees are informed of changes.  \r\n\r\n2 HAZARD ASSESSMENT (40CFR68 SUBPART B)\r\n\r\n2.1 APPLICIBILITY (\u00a7 68.20)\r\nSection 112(r) of the Clean Air Act requires covered facilities to develop Risk Management Programs in an effort to \"prevent accidental releases and minimize the consequences of releases.\" Chlorine (CAS 7782-50-5), a regulated substance under section 112(r)(7) of the Clean Air Act, has a threshold quantity of 2,500 pounds as listed in Table 1 of \u00a768.130. The RRBWWTP is subject to the RMP regulation because the chlorination process at the facility utilizes and/or stores a greater quantity of chlorine than the threshold quantity. Currently, the RRBWWTP has the potential to store up to twenty-four (24) one-ton chlorine containers in the chlorination storage area, a potential of 48,000 pounds of chlorine.\r\n\r\nUnder the RMP guidelines, the chlorination process at the RRBWWTP qualifies as a Program 2 process. The process is not listed as Program 3 because the facility is not covered under the OSHA Process Safety Management requirements and the process is not part of the SIC codes listed in \u00a768.10(d)(1).  The chlorination process does not qualify for Program 1 status because a worst case release would reach a public receptor, therefore not satisfying \u00a768.10(b)(2).\r\n\r\n2.2 OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS PARAMETERS (\u00a7 68"

      "SummaryText": ".22)\r\n\r\n2.1.1 ENDPOINT\r\nAs specified in Appendix A for \u00a768.22(a)(1), the toxic endpoint for chlorine is 0.0087 mg/L. The toxic endpoint corresponds to a concentration of 3.0 parts per million (ppm).\r\n\r\n2.1.2 WIND SPEED AND ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY CLASS\r\nPer the RMP rule, a wind speed of 1.5 m/s and an F stability class, utilized in the worst case release analysis. Weak winds, nighttime cooling and little turbulent mixing characterize the F atmospheric stability class.  The atmosphere is considered stable under the F stability classification.  These wind and atmospheric conditions allow for maximum plume transport and are therefore appropriate for a worst case release analysis.\r\n\r\nThe atmospheric data used for the RMP's update was obtained from the National Weather Service (NWS) Office for the El Paso, Texas region. The NWS station is located at the Dona Ana County Airport at Santa Teresa, New Mexico, approximately 16 miles northwest of downtown El Paso.\r\n\r\nFor the alternative release scenario, the regulations allow the use of typical meteorological conditions for the geographic area. According to the NWS Office, the average wind speed for El Paso is 8.5 miles per hour (3.8 m/s). The atmospheric conditions would be best described by the C stability classification.  The C classification is representative of a neutral atmosphere with moderate turbulence. These wind and atmospheric conditions are more probable to occur and are therefore used in the alternative \"more likely\" release scenario.\r\n\r\n2.2.3 AMBIENT TEMPERATURE AND HUMIDITY\r\nFor the worst case analysis, the RMP rule requires the use of the highest daily maximum temperature in the previous three years and the average humidity. The three-year (January 2016 through January 2019) maximum temperature for El Paso is 111\u00b0F and the daily average relative humidity is 37%.\r\n\r\nFor the alternative release scenario, the regulations indicate the use of average temperature and humidity data.

For the alternative release analysis, the regulation indicates that the release height be determined by the release scenario.  Since the process area is near ground level, the release was assumed to occur at ground level.\r\n2.2.5 SURFACE ROUGHNESS\r\nThe software model used in the offsite consequence analysis considers the roughness length (Zo) of the terrain as a parameter in the transport analysis.  For example, Grass (artificial, 7.5 cm high), Grass (thin to 50 cm), Vegetation (1 m to 2 m high) and a Large City (Tokyo) have a roughness length of 1 cm, 5 cm, 20 cm and 165 cm, respectively.  Since the modeling software utilizes a heavy gas model, the software considers a roughness length of up to 10 cm.\r\n\r\nThe topography of the area near the chlorine process is urban with obstacles in the immediate area such as trees or small buildings. The topography of the area near the chlorine process is desert rangeland with residential housing developments and several industrial areas. A roughness length of 10 cm, the upper limit for the heavy gas model, was selected for both analyses\r\n2.2.6 DENSE OR NEUTRALLY BUOYANT GASES\r\nIn accordance with the RMP rule, the dispersion model utilized for the hazard assessment accounted for gas density.  Since chlorine gas is 2.4 times heavier than air, the heavy gas model in Areal Locations of Hazardous Atmospheres (ALOHA&reg;) Version 5.4.7 was utilized for the dispersion analyses, instead of a buoyant gas model.\r\n2.2.7 TEMPERATURE OF RELEASEED SUBSTANCE\r\nFor the worst case analysis the RMP rule requires the use of the maximum of either the highest daily maximum temperature in the previous three years or the typical process temperature.  For dispersion modeling purposes, this temperature was 111\u00b0F, the highest daily temperature in El Paso, Texas for the previo"

For modeling purposes, the chlorine was released at the average ambient temperature of 69.1\u00b0F.\r\n2.3 WORST CASE ANALYSIS (\u00a768.25)\r\nThe worst case release scenario selected was the release of the entire contents of a one-ton chlorine container.  According to the EPA's Risk Management Program Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants, the worst case scenario \"need only consider the largest vessel, regardless of interconnections with pipes and other vessels.\"  The worst case analysis performed on the chlorine process indicates a vulnerable zone radius of 2.5 miles (Appendix B) as determined by the ALOHA&reg; modeling software.  The worst case analysis was conducted in compliance with the RMP rule, as presented below.\r\n2.3.1 NUMBER OF RELEASE SCENARIO\r\nFor the Program 2 process, the EPWU-PSB analyzed and reported \"one worst case release scenario that is estimated to create the greatest distance in any direction to [a toxic endpoint] resulting from an accidental release of regulated toxic substances from covered processes under worst case conditions\" (\u00a768.25(2)(i)).\r\n2.3.2 DETERMINATION OF WORST CASE RELEASE QUANTITY\r\nThe RMP rule requires \"the worst case release quantity shall be the greater of the following: for substances in a vessel, the greatest amount held in a single vessel, taking into account administrative controls that limit the maximum quantity; or for substances in pipes, the greatest amount in pipe taking into account administrative controls that limit the maximum quantity\" (\u00a768.25(b)).  The one-ton (2,000-lb) worst case release quantity selected represents the greatest amount held by a single vessel.\r\n2.3.3 WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO FOR TOXIC GASES\r\nAccording to the RMP rule, \"for regulated toxic substances that are normally gases at ambient temperature and handled as a"

The ALOHA&reg; modeling software determined this radius after the appropriate parameter values were applied.  The alternative release analysis was conducted in compliance with the RMP rules, as presented below.\r\n2.4.1 NUMBERS OF SCENARIOS\r\nThe RMP rule requires at least one alternative release scenario be identified and analyzed for each regulated toxic substance held in a covered process (\u00a768.28(a)).  Since chlorine is the only toxic substance used at this facility above, the RMP threshold, one alternative release scenario was identified for the offsite consequence analysis.\r\n2.4.2 SCENARIOS TO CONSIDER\r\nThe alternative scenario was defined as a pipe leak between the ton containers and the evaporator based on its likeliness of occurrence.  ALOHA&reg; Source Strength module was used to estimate the release rate.  The alternative release scenario assumed a 1/8 inch diameter hole on a 3/8 inch pipeline. The pipeline was considered as being attached to an infinite source, the release was considered as continuous for a period of 60 minutes.  This is a conservative estimate of the response time by the emergency personnel to an accidental release.  \r\n2.4.3 PARAMETERS TO BE APPLIED\r\nThe parameters used to determine the distance to the toxic endpoints are discussed in Section 2.2.

Chlorine is irritating and corrosive to the eyes, skin, and respiratory tract and reacts violently with easily oxidized materials. Considering that the boiling point for chlorine is -29.4\u00b0 F, contact with evaporating chlorine or equipment releasing flashing chlorine can cause frostbite burns.  Chlorine gas is heavier than air and will tend to travel along the ground and fill low spaces and pits displacing air.\r\n4.2.1.1 SAFETY DATA SHEETS\r\nA Safety Data Sheet (SDS) for the chlorine process at the facility is"

One-ton containers of chlorine are designed to withstand pressures of at least 330 psig that can develop at a temperature of 165\u00b0 F, the point at which the fusible plugs melt to relieve pressure in the event of a fire.  Temperatures may drop if chlorine gas is withdrawn to approaching the boiling point of-29.4\u00b0 F, but are usually higher due to heat transfer from the surrounding air.\r\n\r\nDesign maximum flows are generally defined by the capacity of the chlorine flow regulating devices. Design minimums are typically zero. The composition will not change until the material is contacted with water, typically in the chlorinators or evaporators.\r\n\r\nThe upper and lower operating limits may vary from storage containers to point of application depending upon whether the process is feeding vapor or liquid, where a vacuum regulator may be located, and whether the process utilizes an evaporator. The limits must be checked based upon the storage containers and the process design.\r\n4.2.1.4 EQUIPMENT SPECIFICATIONS\r\nSpecifications for the equipment utilized in the chlorination process included is in Appendix H.\r\n4.2.1.5 CODES AND STANDARDS\r\nThe codes and standards used to design, build, and operate the chlorine process are summarized in Table 4-2.\r\n\r\nTable 4-2: Codes and Standards\r\nSystem/Component\tCommonly Used Current Code or Standard\r\nBu"

At this time the overall plan seems to be effective and only a few minor adjustments were noted.\r\n\r\nThe first course of action in a 'worst case scenario' such as a major chlorine leak, would be to alert other employees in the plant using the telephone, radio or intercom system if possible.\r\nThe second course of action would be to immediately call 911 to report the type of emergency and location. This should be followed by notifying the EPWU-PSB Dispatch on \"Channel 1\" as soon as possible for necessary internal actions.\r\nThe third course of action should be an evacuation of the plant.  Initially, the designated meeting place to account for all plant personnel will be located outside of the fence by the East Riverside Canal exit gate. If circumstances dictate, such as if wind direction changes, everyone will need to move either East or West along the levee road as necessary. If possible, the employee in charge should act as liaison with the Incident Commander from the El Paso Fire Department. This will serve as a contact for information exchange between the two departments.\r\n\r\nDue to the nature of wastewater treatment processes, other types of emergencies remain a possibility.  This plan represents the procedures during a worst case scenario realizing different actions may need to be taken for other emergencies.\r\n5.2.6 EMERGENCY FIRST AID PROCEDURES\r\nAny injured employee suffering from chlorine inhalation should be sent to the hospital.  To the extent possible, another plant employee should accompany the injured employee.\r\n5.2.6.1 GENERAL\r\n\u00bf\tCaution: Use proper PPE to ensure you do not become a casualty\r\n\u00bf\tPrompt action is essential; Remove exposed person form contaminated area"

Mexico and The United States created the Joint Contingency Plan (JCP), designed for rapid international response to contingencies associated with chemical hazardous substances in the inland border.   The JCP provides a mechanism for cooperation between the Sister Cities.  The Inland Border plan is not designed to overrule any statutory authorities held by either participant nor misconceive legally binding rights or obligation of the international and domestic laws.\r\n5.7.2 PURPOSE\r\nThe purpose of the JCP is based on La Paz Agreement, signed on August 14, 1983. The JCP is designed to effectively respond to significant chemical hazardous contingencies, chlorine in this scenario.  It also aims to protect the health, human safety, and the environment by providing international guidance, joint, and coordinated responses between sister cities (Mexico-US).\r\n5.7.3 PLANNING AND PROCEDURES FOR AN EMERGENCY\r\nAfter EPWU-PSB have implemented its Emergency Evacuation Plan, Mexico/U.S. Co-chairs coordinating authorities must be notified of the major chlorine leak.\r\n5.7.4 VERBAL NOTIFICATION\r\nThe JCP requires that any chemical, in this scenario chlorine, that has a potential to affect the environment along Inland Border Area must be reported immediately to the following centers, telephone numbers are described in in Appendix S:\r\n\u00bf\tNational Response Center (NRC)\r\n\u00bf\tU.S. EPA Regional Coordinator\r\n\u00bf\tU.S. JRT Co-chair\r\n\u00bf\tNational Communications Center (CENACOM)\r\n\u00bf\tCOATEA/PROFEPA\r\n\u00bf\tInternatio"
