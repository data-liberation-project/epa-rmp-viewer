The information presented in the RMP is derived from data obtained in Chase Products Company\u00bfs Emergency Response Contingency Plan and interviews with operations personnel.\n\nChase Products Co. manufactures an extensive list of aerosol type products.  Some examples of these products include personal hygiene (i.e., spray detergents, hair spray, etc.) and residential use (i.e., glass cleaner, insecticides and spray paints).  Chase Products Co. uses an aerosol propellant storage system to contain their A31 (100% isobutane); A46 (85%isobutane/15% propane); and A80 (60% propane/40% n-butane) gases which are used as the primary propellants in their aerosol products.  The system consists of three on-site USTs each having a maximum storage capacity of 18,000 gallons and one 30,000-gallon rail car.  The USTs and railcar are connected to a series of pumps and conveyance pipes, which ultimately transfer the propellants to 16-ounce (12.25 oz net) product cans.  Because Chase Products Co.\u00bfs aerosol propellant storage system is subject to OSHA PSM standards, the system falls under Program 3 requirements according to EPS\u00bfs Risk Management Program.  No additional RMP processes were identified at the site.\n\nStationary Source Description\n\nThis RMP report details the operations associated with the propellant storage system used in the manufacturing of aerosol type products.  The following stationary sources of propane, n-butane and isobutane within the storage system include:\n\n\t\n?

      "SummaryText": "railcar are considered to be a stationary source because of the potential to leak the entire amount of their contents, resulting in a subsequent vapor cloud explosion.\n\n? Propellant System Control Valve \u00bf A31, A46 and A80 propellants pass through control valves located overtop of the USTs containing these propellants.  These valves may be manually operated to isolate sections of the propellant distribution system.  An exterior valve is considered a stationary source since a leak may develop around the valve stem packing, which may produce a vapor cloud that could potentially ignite and travel offsite.\n\t\n\n\n\nExecutive Summary\n\nChase Products Company is committed to worker and public safety in the operation of our facility.  This commitment to safety is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training programs and administrative controls in our process.  \nChase Products Co. utilizes the elements of a process safety management (PSM) program to ensure that our propellant storage system is operated in the safest manner achievable.\n\nChase Products Co. manufacturers an extensive list of aerosol type products.
