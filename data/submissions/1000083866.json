In addition, in an actual emergency, the City of LaSalle Fire Department, LaSalle County LEPC, and other sources of emergency response may be called on to provide mutual aid. The Peru Facility assists local officials in the development of emergency procedures to identify resources, chemicals, contacts and material safety data sheets for participating companies. Since its certification in November 1993, the Peru Facility has been a participant in the International Standards Organization (ISO) 9001 quality management program.\r\n\r\n2.Regulated Substances.\r\n\r\nThe Peru Facility manufactures polystyrene-based products consisting of one main process area where expandable polystyrene (EPS) is produced and a tank farm where the regulated substance is stored. The polymers are produced in a batch process. The Peru Facility has one RMP-regulated substance, Flammable Mixture (flammable liquid), at the facility. The Flammable Mixture is impregnated inside the polystyrene to cause the beads to expand when heated by the end user.\r\n\r\n3. General accidental release prevention program and chemical specific prevention steps.\r\n\r\nFollowing is a brief summary of the elements that the Peru Facility has implemented to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements outlined by the EPA as well as with the Occupational Health and Safety Adminis"

This includes information pertaining to:\r\n\r\nHazards of regulated substances: For each applicable substance, there is a Safety Data Sheet (SDS) which discusses the physical properties of the chemicals, exposure hazards, the required personal protective equipment and the appropriate first aid and emergency treatment for exposure.\r\n\r\nThe technology of the process: Includes a discussion of process chemistry, safe upper and lower limits, analysis of consequences of deviation and corresponding corrective actions.\r\n\r\nEquipment in the process: Includes such information as materials of construction, diagrams of the piping and instrumentation, safety systems and design codes.\r\n\r\nPROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nThe Peru Facility has performed process hazard analysis on each covered process to identify the potential hazards, the adequacy of the engineering and administrative controls and the ways to minimize those hazards. The Peru Facility utilizes the HAZOP methodology, a recognized and generally accepted method, for identifying and evaluating hazards in the process. The Peru Facility assigns employees to the HAZOP team who are knowledgeable in the HAZOP methodology and the specific process. The HAZOP team develops recommendations to reduce the potential hazards which, if approved, are to be implemented within a reasonable period of time.\r\n\r\nOPERATING PROCEDURES\r\n\r\nThe Peru Facility maintains written operating procedures that were developed in consultation with operators, designed to provide clear instructions for safely conducting activities associated with a covered process. The procedures address steps for all operating phases, safety systems, control measures and precautions to prevent exposures to process hazards. The procedures are reviewed and revised p"

The training emphas safety and health hazards, emergency operations, and safe work practices. Operators receive periodic refresher training.\r\n\r\nMECHANICAL INTEGRITY\r\n\r\nThe Peru Facility has developed written procedures for maintaining the operating components of the process (including pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown system controls, and pumps) through the mechanical integrity program. The program is comprised of trained personnel who are to follow maintenance, testing and inspection procedures designed to ensure proper function of process equipment.\r\n\r\nMANAGEMENT OF CHANGE\r\n\r\nThe Peru Facility has established and implemented written procedures to manage changes to process chemicals, technology, equipment, procedures, and any changes to the facility that affect a covered process. The procedures are designed such that, prior to any change, the following issues are to be considered: the technical basis for the proposed change, its impact on safety and health, any modifications to operating procedures, the necessary time period for the change, and any authorization requirements. Employees involved in operating a process, as well as maintenance and contract employees whose job will be affected, are to be informed of and trained in the change. If necessary, the process safety information and operating procedures are to be updated.\r\n\r\nPRE START-UP SAFETY REVIEW\r\n\r\nThe Peru Facility performs pre start-up safety reviews when the addition of or a modification to the facility is made that is significant enough to require a change in the process safety information. The pre-startup safety review is designed to confirm, prior to the introduction of highly hazardous chemicals, that constructio"

Planned changes to improve safety.\r\n\r\nThe Peru Facility has an on-going commitment to improve safety and protect the environment. In addition to scheduled internal company audits and inspections, the Peru Facility performs an annual self-evaluation as a Star Site in OSHA's Voluntary Protection Program. The following health, safety and environmental improvements are anticipated during the next several years based on our most recent VPP recertification inspection:\r\n- Installation of a SIL II SIS overfill protection system on the pentane storage tanks;\r\n- Improved protection of our shipping dock doors as related to walking and working surfaces;\r\n- Improved fall protection systems for ladders used to access the top of buildings, bins, tanks etc.;\r\n- Improvements in guarding systems in the packaging area and;\r\n- Additional ergonomics assessments and improvements in the packaging area."
