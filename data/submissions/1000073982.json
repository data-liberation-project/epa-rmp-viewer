Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n \n\nWe at HollyFrontier Navajo Refining Company in Lovington (Navajo's Lovington Refinery), NM are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety. This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n \n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\n \n\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Petroleum refining. All products are distilled from the crude oil feed, stabilized, then transported offsite via pipeline to the HollyFrontier Navajo Refinery site in Artesia, NM.  There are 2  RMP-regulated flammable mixtures present at our facility. These flammable mixtures may contain methane, ethane, butane, isobutane, isopentane, pentane and propane. The two flammable mixtures are both derived from the light ends of the crude distillation process.  The RMP-regulated flammable mixtures were identified by conducting a review of the estimated composition of each major vessel within each process unit.  The composite of RMP-regulated flammable mixtures within a given process unit were reported as a single flammable mixture within the RMPlan.  RMP-regulated flammable mixtures are present in both the crude and vacuum units at the facility, comprising the two flammable mixtures reported in the RMPlan.  \n\n \n\n3. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps \n\n \n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA. The refinery has an active program in place to maintain compliance with the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) progr"

The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\n \n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nNavajo's Lovington Refinery maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all Lovington refinery processes.\n\n \n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently. The methodology used to carry out these analyses is What If or HAZOP. The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of every five years. Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner. \n\n \n\nOperating Procedures\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, the Lovington Refinery maintains written operating procedures. These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\n \n\nTraining\n\nThe Lovington Refinery has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes. Refresher training is provided at least every three years and more frequently as needed.\n\n \n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe Lovington Refinery carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations. Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.

Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\n \n\nManagement of Change\n\nWritten procedures are in place at Navajo's Lovington Refinery to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures. Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\n \n\nPre-startup Reviews\n\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at Navajo's Lovington Refinery. These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\n \n\nCompliance Audits\n\nNavajo's Lovington Refinery conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented. These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\n \n\nIncident Investigation\n\nNavajo's Lovington Refinery promptly investigates any incident at the Lovington refinery that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance. These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring. All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\n \n\nEmployee Participation\n\nNavajo's Lovington Refinery truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.

Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out. Navajo's Lovington Refinery has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related the contractor's work and the processes. Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\n\n \n\n4.
