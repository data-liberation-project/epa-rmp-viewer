The Plan provides for the implementation of an Incident Command System to direct and coordinate the plantA?s response activities.  The Plan has been coordinated with the LEPC and with the local Fire Department who would direct all offsite community notification activities.  Honeywell Baton Rouge maintains its own professionally trained Emergency Response Team (ERT) which is knowledgeable and prepared to respond to incidents involving accidental releases of hydrogen fluoride, hydrogen chloride, chlorine, chloroform, difluoroethane, and trifluorochloroethylene.  The ERT conducts quarterly emergency response drills and exercises.  Annual in-house audits of the plantA?s emergency response system are performed.  The plant is equipped with an extensive underground fire water system supplied by 1,500 GPM and 1,000 GPM fire pumps drawing from dedicated fire water tanks totaling 325,000 gallons.  The local Fire Department Hazardous Materials team is invited to tour the facility annually.  Honeywell Baton Rouge works in full cooperation and coordination with the Office of Emergency Services.

RMP programs.  In previous reports, the dates provided for the last PHA or PHA update of a covered process were reported as the date the PHA started.  The plant is now reporting this required information as the date the PHA was completed.  Also, the facility has begun an auditing program that reviews several selected program elements during a calendar quarter which is conducted repeatedly throughout the three year audit cycle.  During this audit cycle, the facility will audit all of the required elements following this methodology.   This method replaces the previously used one time audit review approach during the three year cycle.\n\n\n\n"
