Included in the SOP are measures to be taken internally by Hillshire Brands as well as measures to be taken by off-site response agencies.\r\n\r\nHillshire Brands has trained approximately 55 on-site personnel to respond to accidental ammonia releases.  These personnel receive training and take part in monthly Hazmat meetings.

In addition, Hillshire Brands' ammonia refrigeration system is designed and constructed in accordance with accepted industry standards and good engineering practices.\r\n\r\nHillshire Brands has also developed and implemented a PSM program pursuant to OSHA regulations and as such, has evaluated the system for the potential of anhydrous ammonia releases.   Some of the controls installed to prevent catastrophic releases of ammonia are process equipment (vents, pressure relief valves, backup pumps, and manual shutoffs) and automated controls (automatic shut-offs, ammonia leak detection system, and electrical distribution system grounding).  In addition, Hillshire Brands has trained approximately 55 team members to respond to potential ammonia releases (HazMat team).\r\n\r\nHillshire Brands has developed standard operating procedures for all equipment in the ammonia refrigeration system that incorporate safety measures into the procedures.  These safety procedures were developed by refrigeration system operators and are recertified annually. Hillshire Brands encourages employee participation in development of the control measures used at the plant by means of meetings and training sessions. Changes to the operating procedures are to be communicated to affected employees.\r\nHillshire Brands understands that maintaining the refrigeration system in good working order is essential to preventing accidental releases; therefore Hillshire Brands has implemented a preventative maintenance program.

Hillshire Brands' refrigeration system consists of receivers, compressors, evaporators, condensers, and piping. \r\n\r\nWorst Case Release Scenario\r\n\r\nThe Zeeland, MI facility has an ammonia 30 deg. Accumulator vessel as the single largest ammonia vessel.  The liquid-full capacity of the 30 deg. Accumulator is 2487 cubic feet.  Using the ammonia temperature of 30 degrees yields an approximate operating pressure of 45 psig and an ammonia liquid density of 39.96 pounds per cubic foot.  The calculation of 2487 cubic feet multiplied by the liquid density yields the ammonia capacity of 99,392 pounds.  Using RMP Comp with the settings of ammonia liquefied under pressure, Rural topography with mitigation the distance to endpoint is 4.0 miles.\r\n\r\nThe worst-case release scenario was developed following EPA regulations and is not considered by Hillshire Brands to be a likely release scenario for the facility. During normal operations, Hillshire Brands maintains the receivers at no more than 60% capacity. Only during pump-down operations do the receivers have the potential to be filled to 80% of capacity. The receivers are operated in pump-down mode less than 1% of the time during the year.\r\n\r\nAlternative Release Scenario\r\n\r\nTyson Foods has chosen the alternative release scenario of a pressure relief valve activation.  Pressure relief valve activations historically have been the primary release type within the company based on reports to Environmental Compliance.  The Zeeland, MI facility has one Pressure relief valve that meets this air rating.  The Parker RS-SRH3 SRV is located on the 30 Deg Accumulator.  The valve has an inlet port size of 3/4 and an outlet port size of 1-1/4 and discharge flow rating of 2068 pounds per minute (air rating) at a pressure setting of 250 psig.
