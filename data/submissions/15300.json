      "SummaryText": "The City of Cape Canaveral owns and operates the Cape Canaveral Wastewater Treatment Facility (CCWWTF), located at 600 Tower Road in Cape Canaveral, Florida.  The CCWWTF has a design capacity of 1.8 million gallons per day.\n\nLike the majority of municipal wastewater treatment plants in the United States, gaseous chlorine is used at the CCWWTF as a disinfectant to destroy pathogenic organisms in the treated water.  The popularity of chlorine as a water disinfectant is mainly due to its effectiveness and relatively low cost.\n\nThe same properties that make chlorine valuable as a disinfectant also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling chlorine as a safeguard to our workers, our community and the environment.  Chlorine is notably irritating to the eyes, nose, throat and lungs.  More serious human health effects could result from higher chlorine exposure, such as intense coughing, chest pains and in extreme cases, death.\n\nThe City of Cape Canaveral's commitment at the CCWWTF is to store, handle and use chlorine in a manner that achieves the needed benefits of disinfection while minimizing both onsite and offsite risks.  This is accomplished by designing a safe process, maintaining the process in optimum working condition, operating safely through documented procedures and extensive training, and providing an emergency response capability to minimize the consequences of chlorine release, should a process accident ever occur.  Our commitment to employee and community protection is demonstrated in the fact that over the CCWWTF's entire operating history, there have been no chlorine accidents that resulted in death, serious employee injury or offsite consequences.\n\nIt is the City's policy to adhere to all applicable Federal, State of Florida and local rules and regulations.  This specifically includes compliance with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for chlorine accidental release "

      "SummaryText": "prevention and emergency response.\n\nThe primary measures for accidental chlorine release prevention are contained in the document Process Safety Management for Cape Canaveral Wastewater Treatment Facility.  This process safety management (PSM) document was prepared in conformance with OSHA and EPA risk management rules, as well as industry-specific guidelines and best management practices relevant to release prevention.  CCWWTF's Plant Manager has the responsibility for ensuring that this program is implemented in the workplace as written.\n\nThe CCWWTF emergency response plan relies on a team of onsite trained personnel and, as necessary, offsite mutual-aid groups such as fire and rescue services.  The emergency response plan at CCWWTF is based on the Incident Command system, where onsite responders work in coordination with local hazardous materials response teams to implement the CCWWTF and regional response plans.  CCWWTF personnel receive annual chlorine emergency response training, which includes the donning of protective equipment and hands-on application of the chlorine cylinder repair kits kept at the plant.\n\nThe Worst-Case and Alternative Chlorine Release Scenarios\n\nAs part of the Risk Management Plan submittal a hazard assessment was conducted which included the development of worst-case and alternative release scenarios.\n\nEPA defines a worst-case release as a scenario involving the greatest amount held in a single vessel or pipe.  In CCWWTF's case, this involves the release of the entire contents of two (2) one-ton chlorine cylinders.  The release is assumed to occur over a ten-minute period, and only passive mitigating effects of the enclosure are considered.  Applying the worst-case parameters to the CCWWTF situation results in a distance to chlorine endpoint (defined as 0.0087 milligrams per liter) of 1.3 miles.  In other words, any human  or environmental receptors within 1.3 miles of the chlorine storage building are within the worst-case distance.\n\nE"

      "FacilityID": 15300,
      "SummaryText": "PA defines an alternative release as a scenario more likely than the worst-case, but that nevertheless results in an impact offsite (unless no such release is possible).  Passive and active mitigating measures (chlorine detection, operator response, etc.) are considered in this scenario.  Without an accident history on which to base a more likely scenario, a scenario was selected based on information provided in the Chlorine Institute Pamphlet 74, Estimating the Area Affected by a Chlorine Release.  The scenario involved the release of chlorine liquiid through a broken 0.25-inch valve inside the chlorine storage area.  Response time is conservatively assumed to occur in 60 minutes.  This scenario results in a distance  to chlorine endpoint of 0.1 mile.  There are public receptors within this release area.\n\nThe distance to endpoint calculations were performed using EPA's RMP*Comp model.  The RMP * Comp model was developed specifically for compliance with the accidental release prevention requirement for predicting the travel distance of an accidental release.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nCCWWTF plant operators are provided with annual chlorine safety training that includes hands-on practice of assessing and repairing a chlorine leak.  Plant personnel also review the emergency plan on an annual basis.  The emergency response plan covers all aspects of emergency response including escape procedures and routes, procedures for employee accounting, notification proceedures, medical duties and response procedures  for spills and leaks.  If a major chlorine leak were to occur, the emergency plan requires immediate notification of the regional hazardous materials response team for assistance, including orderly evacuation or sheltering-in-place of the surrounding community."
