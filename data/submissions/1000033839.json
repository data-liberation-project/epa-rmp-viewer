This is a specially caged area (with ceiling to floor chain link fence) along the facility main building's southeast corner. This area stores only hand held aerosol spray cans, the largest of which contains approximately 1.5 pounds of propellant and product. The finished aerosol product storage area constitutes a Program Level 1 process for purposes of complying with the RMP regulatory requirements.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention & Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nITW Professional Brands is committed to maintaining safe conditions, and to providing our personnel with training in safe operating practices.\r\n- Storage is in a controlled area.\r\n- Area is occupied during working hours.\r\n- Floor personnel are required to report leaking or spillage immediately to a supervisor.\r\n- Area is sprinklered and connected to alarm system to notify fire department.\r\n- Fire Department and Spill Response contractor are within 10 minutes of facility.\r\n\r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program & Chemical Specific Release Prevention \r\n\r\nITW Professional Brands employees are dedicated to maintaining the aerosol product storage in a safe manner.

      "SummaryText": "ssional Brands maintains current safety information on propellants, and reviews potential hazards that may be associated with the storage of the aerosol products at the facility.  ITW Professional Brands trains operating and maintenance personnel in procedures and safe practices. New employees are trained before being allowed to work alone and periodic refresher training is provided to all employees. \r\n\r\nFive Year Accident History\r\n\r\nThis facility has not had an accidental release of isobutane from the facility which resulted in evacuation, sheltering in place, adverse health effects to employees or to the public, or damage to property.\r\n\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\n\r\nThe Olathe facility employees are not qualified to respond to an uncontrolled release of propellant.  The Olathe Fire Department has a fully staffed facility approximately 1/8 mile west of ITW Professional Brands.  ITW Professional Brands has notified the Olathe Fire Department's Hazardous Materials Unit that in the event of a release of unconrolled amounts of propellant, the company will alert the Fire Department (via 911); facility personnel will be instructed to follow planned evacuation procedures; and a 24-hour emergency response contractor will be notified (spill response contractor is within 10 minutes of facility).\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nSafety improvement is on-going at ITW Professional Brands, largely due to continuous feedback from employees to management and to the Safety Committee."
