These prevention programs comply with all applicable requirements of OSHA's PSM regulations, as stipulated in 26 CFR 1910.119, and all applicable EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) requirements, as stipulated by 40 CFR Part 68. The nature of the processes and the type and quantities of hazardous substances present require that these processes be considered as Program 3 processes for EPA RMP regulations. The following elements are included in the Safety Management system at Tonawanda: 0. Management Responsibility; 1. Process Safety Information (General information - SDS's, SOP's, Safety Procedures, Process Controls, Equipment Manuals, Design Files, Product Safety, Process Technology, and Equipment Safety); 2. Process Hazards Reviews; 3. Operating Procedures; 4. Training; 5. Mechanical Integrity; 6. Management of Change; 7. Pre-Start-Up Safety Reviews; 8. Compliance Audits; 9. Incident Investigations; 10. Employee Participation; 11. Hot Work Permits; 12. Contractor Safety; 13. Site Security activities including a Site Vulnerability Analysis.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program - The PeroxyChem Tonawanda Plant Emergency Response Program involves the preparation of an Emergency Response Plan tailored to each process and the emergency response services that are available in the nearby community. The Emergency Response Plan complies with EPA Emergency Response Program requirements stipulated in 40 CFR Part 68."

Rural conditions were deliberately chosen to create a more conservative approach as was the F class stability. Public impact includes, schools, residences, hospitals, recreation areas, and major commercial offices or industrial areas. Environmental impacts include state parks and wildlife sanctuaries, preserves or refuges.\r\n\r\nAlternate Release Scenarios - RMP regulations require that at least one alternate release scenario be identified and analyzed for each regulated toxic chemical present. A scenario that is more realistic than the worst-case scenario was selected as the alternate release case.\r\n\r\nThe alternate release scenario simulates an ammonia railcar transfer line rupture. The event is assumed to release 6,840 pounds of ammonia during a twenty (20) minute period at a rate of 342 pounds per minute. The estimated distance to the toxic endpoint (0.14 mg/l) is 0.3 miles. This scenario was modeled using the RMP*Comp and assumed a complete rupture of the liquid transfer hose during railcar unloading. The loss was assumed to be for a twenty (20) minutes duration with a manual response to close the railcar unloading valve and did not account for the excess flow valve in place on the railcar in order to keep the model conservative. The estimated residential population within the area is ~4300. Public impact includes parks and recreational areas, and major commercial offices and industrial buildings. The institutions, parks, and recreational areas within the 0.3 mile radius from the release source were located using WNY street maps from Map Works, Inc. No environmental contacts were impacted. This scenario did not take into account any of the automatic devices installed in the unloading system and is therefore considered conservative. The actual response time should be less than a minute upon detection of a release in this sc"
