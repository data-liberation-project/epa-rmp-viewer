Our commitment is demonstrated by the capital and human resources invested in our accident and accidental release prevention / mitigation programs.  Enable Midstream's mitigation efforts include; personnel training, safety engineered design; thorough process hazard analyses; compliance audits; management of change; contractor oversight; and planned equipment installation / operation / maintenance of our processes.  Enable Midstream's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, gas plant personnel are trained to follow Enable Midstream's emergency response operating procedures in an effort to safely avert further release and minimize the impact to public and environmental receptors\r\n\t\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE CANUTE NATURAL GAS PROCESSING PLANT AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\t\r\nThe Canute Natural Gas Processing Plant, located approximately 7 miles south and 1 mile west of Canute in Washita County, Oklahoma, operates a cryogenic expander plant with refrigeration assist to extract liquid petroleum products from raw natural gas.  Plant products include pipeline quality natural gas - primarily methane - and natural gas liquids (NGL) comprised of ethane, propane, butane, pentane, and heavier hydrocarbons, some of which are regulated flammable substances.  The part of the process that was selected to represent all regulated flammable substances at the Canute Natural Gas Processing Plant which could contain a regulated flammable substance above the threshold quantity is as follows:\r\n\t\r\n\u00bf\tProduct Surge Tank (V-190) comprised of ethane-plus (NGL) mixture.\r\n\r\nThis process vessel was selected due to having the greatest inventory and endpoint pot"

In addition to following the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP), the Canute Plant follows applicable laws set forth in OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard 29 CFR 1910.119.\r\n\t\r\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\r\n\t\r\nUnder the RMP regulations, the Canute Natural Gas Processing Plant is classified as a Program Level 3 facility.  Under Program Level 3 guidelines, the Worst-Case Scenario (WCS) associated with a release of a regulated flammable substance is a Vapor Cloud Explosion (VCE) involving the full inventory of the largest storage tank containing the ethane-plus NGL mixture.  A written procedure is in place to limit the storage inventory to 128,904 lbs. (80% of the maximum tank capacity), however, for Worst Case Scenario calculations, the full inventory (100% maximum tank capacity of 161,131 pounds) of this tank are assumed to release and ignite, resulting in a VCE.  The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this WCS is 0.44 miles or 2,316 feet.  Additionally, although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for passive mitigation measures was taken into account in evaluating this WCS for the Canute Natural Gas Processing Plant.\r\n\t\r\nThe Alternative Release Scenario (ARS) for flammable substances at the Canute Natural Gas Processing Plant is a VCE resulting from a release of 31,906 pounds of ethane-plus NGL over a sixty (60) minute period, resulting from a seal failure at the product pumps.  The hypothetical release is expected to be isolated by an operator in less than sixty minutes (active mitigation).  The maximum distance to the 1-psi overpressure endpoint for this even"

Because the processes at the gas plant which are regulated by the EPA's RMP rule are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accidental release prevention program.\r\n\t\r\nEmployee Participation\r\n\t\r\nThe Canute Natural Gas Processing Plant encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the gas plant accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the gas plant and addresses each accident prevention program element.  In addition, the gas plant has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and employee safety issues.  These initiatives include forming teams to promote both process and personal safety.  The teams typically have members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and plant management.  Operations personnel also participate in the development and review of operating procedures, process safety information (PSI), and training and mentoring of other personnel.\r\n\t\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\n\t\r\nThe Canute Natural Gas Processing Plant develops and maintains a variety of technical d"

These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis / configuration information.  Specific departments within the gas plant are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.  A table summarizing the reference documents and their location is readily available as part of the written employee participation plan to help employees locate any necessary process safety information.\r\n\t\r\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response / exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).  This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For specific process areas, the gas plant has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in our Operating Procedures and/or Process Safety Information. The gas plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\r\n\t\r\nThe gas plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment.

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\r\n\t\r\nThe Canute Natural Gas Processing Plant primarily uses the Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of Enable Midstream personnel and/or contractors who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This PHA Team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. \r\n\t\r\nThe PHA team's recommendations are reviewed with corporate management to approve or revise recommended mitigation actions.  Once approved, mitigation actions are assigned a relative risk ranking based upon the magnitude/immediacy of necessary actions to reduce hazard risks - as deemed necessary by the PHA Team, PHA Team Leader, and/or Corporate Management.  This risk reduction ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All management-approved PHA Team recommendations are tracked until they are completed.
