      "SummaryText": "Ammonia is used as a refrigerant in the Winter Garden facility's tank farm, cold rooms, blend rooms and freeze tunnel.  The function of the high-pressure received is to hold the system operating charge or the ammonia surge capacity and to form a liquid seal for the system.  The ammonia receivers for the Main plant system are one vertical tank with an 8,000-pound capacity and one vertical tank with an 18,000-pound capacity, and are located outside of the main plant machine room along the south wall.  Receiver for the Annex system is one vertical tank with a capacity of approximately 14,000 pounds, and is located outside of the Annex machine room along the north wall.  The facility packages juice in bulk (55 gal drums and tanker trucks) and for retail in frozen cans (12, 16 and 48 oz.).  The facility has not had any reportable releases of ammonia in the past 5 years.  Training is conducted during the whole year during monthly safety meetings.  Annual drills are conducted using both company and non-company personnel to ensure timely and accurate responses should an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia occur.  Improvements are made every year to assist in preventing ammonia releases.  Changes to the main system were completed in 2004 and included the addition of an 18,000-pound receiver to the Main system and replacement of the 10,300-pound receiver for the Annex system with a new 14,000-pound receiver. In March 2011 the facility improved their new hire orientation program to include ammonia safety training.  This has been expanded to the contntractor orientation program also."
