The types of automobile parts produced by the Rootstown Foundry include, but are not limited to, air intake manifolds, suspension brackets, oil filter adapters, deactivator housings, ect..\nThe Rootstown Foundry uses the semi-permanent mold process to produce most of it's castings. The semi-permanent mold process derives it's name from the fact that the mold is more or less permanent but the sand cores utilized inside the casting are temporary - they can only by used one time. Sand cores produced at the Rootstown Foundry are used to form internal passages in the casting and are made up of sand and resins that are used to bind the sand together. The production process of producing the sand core is refered to as the core making process. Important equipment utilized in the coremake process include a mixer, core machine, and a corebox. The mixer, mixes the sand and resins together, which is then fed by conveyor to a hopper above the core machine. After the sand and resin is mixed and transported to the hopper, it is then blown into the cavity of the corebox which is specifically designed for the casting that is to be manufactured.Once the sand and resin mix is in the cavity, sulfur dioxide (a catalyst) is introduced into the sand and resin mixture which activates the curing process. Curing is the process in which the sand/resin mixture changes from a wet, mud-like substance into a solid form. The coremake process utilizes (1) 2000 lb. cylinder or approximately 165 gallons of sulfur dioxide that moves through piping and into the corebox. Sulfur dioxide enters into the corebox as a gas and exits through vacuum hoses into a scrubber, which neutralizes the sulfur dioxide. \nThe Rootstown Foundry's Risk Management Program descibes worst case and alternate case scenario's that could possible happen in the event of an emergency.

      "SummaryText": "y has in place an emergency alarm system that will alert trained personnel to a concentrated area of sulfur dioxide. This allows an immediate investigation of a possible hazard. If a hazard is found, an emergency evacuation alarm is sounded which in-turn shuts down the sulfur dioxide system and alerts on-site haz-mat trained individuals of a potential discharge or release. In the event of a cylinder leak, specifically on-site trained haz-mat employees can apply a cylinder patch specifically designed for these cylinders. Sulfur dioxide is a non-flammable gas and fuse plugs are provided to allow a slow release of sulfur dioxide if the tank temperature is elevated or the cylinder is over pressurized. Mapping is provided in our program that explains the areas ouside the plant.\nThe Rootstown Foundry prevention program complies with the Occupational Safety and Health (OSHA) PSM rule and a failure mode and effect analysis was utilized along with written operating procedures to comply with those rules and regulations. Trained personnel with a step-by-step checkoff sheet closely scrutinize the hook up of the sulfur dioxide cylinders to the system. Space aged stainless steel fittings are utilized throughout the system to ensure leak free piping. Employees have been trained to identify potential problems and report those problems to management personnel. Hazmat trained employees are trained by a contracted certified industrial hygenist and are certified on a annual basis. The Rootstown Foundry has not had any reportable releases or spills within the past five years. \nThe Rootstown Foundry's emergency response program describes personnel responsible for the evacuation of the company and the coordination with the local agencies to address accidental releases of sulfur dioxide. The emergency evacuation plan is shared information with the local fire departments and the local emergency planning committee.Outside responders with these agencies, as well as other agencies applicable,"
