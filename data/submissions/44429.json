If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department and law enforcement personnel to mitigate any release to residents and the environment of our community.\n\n2. Facility Information: The primary activity at the facility is the storage and sales of fertilizers to farm producers in out area. \n   a. Anyhdrous Ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direcct application as a crop production nutrient.\n   b. The maximum quantity stored would be approximately 52,000 pounds in our 12,000 gallon storage tank, The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a rail tank car holding approximately 156,000 pounds.\n\n3. Worst-Case Release Scenario and Alternative Release Scenario:\n   a. The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a rail tank car released as a gas over 10 minutes. The maximum quantity released woruld be approximately 156,000 pounds which represents the volume of the rail tank car at 85 percent capacity as limited by the design standards. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.18 miles.\n   b. The alternative release scenario (most likely potential incident) is a release from a break in a transfer hose. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion of 200 ppm) is .33 miles.\n\n4. Accidental Release Prevention Program. The facility has implemented the provisions of \u00bfSafety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\u00bf, published by the American National Standards Institure, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \u00bfStorage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\u00bf.\n\n5. Five-Year Accident History: There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that hare caused any deat"
