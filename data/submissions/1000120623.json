This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If such a release does occur, our employees are trained to follow the Emergency Action Plan and to evacuate the facility as necessary. We are also coordinated with the Racine County LEPC which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n2.  FACILITY INFORMATION & REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Saputo \u0096 Caledonia facility is located at 13001 Baxter Ct., Franksville, WI. 53126. The plant\u0092s primary purpose is to provide cold storage for multiple facilities in Saputo during the distribution process. The facility employs approximately 135 full-time employees. There is one RMP-regulated substance, anhydrous ammonia, used in the plant\u0092s refrigeration system. This system contains a calculated charge of 12,167 lbs. of anhydrous ammonia. The system was filled with 12,000 lbs. of ammonia. \n\n3.  GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE & CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION\n\nThe Saputo \u0096 Caledonia plant follows the 14 elements of the OSHA Process Safety Management program as a release prevention program for RMP. In addition, Saputo Corporate \u0096 Department of Refrigeration Services works with the plant confirming regulatory and corporate standards are being followed, providing guidance and standardization on the RMP and OSHA PSM programs and acting as a resource for the plant on the RMP, PSM and other environmental programs.\n\n4.  FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nSaputo \u0096 Caledonia is a new facility and does not have a 5-year history currently. A continuous record will be maintained from the initial startup. Due to our"

EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nSaputo \u0096 Caledonia has developed an Emergency Action Plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials as well as other emergency events that might occur at the plant. The purpose of Saputo\u0092s Emergency Action Plan is to ensure employees know and understand what to do in the event of an emergency to minimize injuries and property damage. The plan includes various aspects of an emergency including adequate first aid, evacuations, and notification of local emergency response agencies. Employees are trained in evacuation, hazard communication, and chemical safety. In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect pertinent changes.\n\n6.  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nSeveral developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program. Recommendations resulting from the PHA, compliance audits and mechanical integrity inspections will be addressed in a timely manner. In addition, regular interaction with Saputo Corporate \u0096 Department of Refrigeration Services, Health & Safety, Risk Group and Department of Environmental affairs will improve compliance and overall plant safety."
