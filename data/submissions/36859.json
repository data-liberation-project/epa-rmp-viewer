If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Gray County LEPC and/or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.  FACILITY INFORMATION\nThe primary activity at this site involving anhydrous ammonia is the operation of a portable pipe reactor that operates on this site on a random basis (when fluid fertilzer production is required).  The ammonia is used exclusively for that purpose.  The operations with ammonia involve the storage of the ammonia and the unloading from a tanker truck.  The actual use of the ammonia is covered by the portable pipe reactor under it's PSM.\n\n3.  WORST-CASE SCENARIO AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO\nThe worst-case scenario would be the release of the total contents of the 30,000 gallon storage tank.  This would result in the release of up to 130,000# of liquid ammonia over a 10 minute period.  The ammonia being released from the pressure in the tank would vaporize.  The distance to the end point is 6.7 miles calculated using RMP Comp. The alternative release scenario, based on the most likely potential incident , is the failure or a leak in the process piping system.  This could result in the release of 260# of ammonia over a 15 minute period.  The distance to the end point is 0.3 miles as calculated using RPM Comp.\n\n4.  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\nAs part of it's comliance with the PSM rule, the facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safe Requirements of the Strorage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia K-61.1\", published by the American Health Standards Institute, Inc.  The use of established operating and maintenance procedures is emphasized.\n\n5.  FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the last five years at the facil"

EMERGENCY RESONSE PROGRAM\nThe facility has a written emergency response plan and has provided the state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III.\n\n7  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic reviews are performed to assess the maintenance and operations to establish safe operating conditions.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
