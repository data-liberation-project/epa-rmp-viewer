      "SummaryText": "Hydrite Chemical Co. operates as a Chemical Distribution Warehouse for chemicals used in a variety of industries from food processing to waste water treatment.  We at Hydrite Chemical are strongly committed to employee and public safety and environmental responsibility.  It is our policy to control our processes to prevent the accidental release of harmful or noxious materials that could endanger or irritate our employees, plant visitors, or neighbors.  This commitment is integrated into our design standards, equipment installation and maintenance practices, operating procedures and training programs.\n\nHydrite Chemical has developed and trained written emergency response procedures in the event of an accidental release from any of our processes.  These written plans have been provided to the local emergency response agencies including local emergency response personnel, hospitals, state and federal agencies.\n\nHydrite warehouses two chemicals regulated by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management Program and the Environmental Protection Agency Risk Management Program.  These chemicals are anhydrous forms of chlorine and sulfur dioxide.  Both materials are received in compressed gas cylinders ranging from 105 lbs. to 2,000 lbs..  We have on-site storage of 40,000 pounds of chlorine and 18,000 pounds of sulfur dioxide.  These materials are stored as a liquid under pressure.  All storage containers are designed to comply with National Standards including the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT), National Fire Protection Association (NFPA), OSHA, and the Chlorine Institute.\n\nWorst case scenario for regulated toxic gases is based on the total loss of the maximum quantity stored in each container.  Release is assumed to occur over a 10 minute period with weather conditions as defined by EPA in the Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.  Passive mitigation for enclosures is included as all material is received and stored within a"

      "SummaryText": "building.  Hydrite has elected to use the ALOHA modeling package to keep our scenarios comparable with the local emergency response providers.  The worst case scenario for sulfur dioxide has the greatest distance to the endpoint and does have off-site impacts.\n\nAlternate scenarios for both chlorine and sulfur dioxide were based on a fuseable plug failure on a ton container allowing the quantity in the container to be released through the 3/8 opening for 15 minutes.   Weather conditions used were as specified in the EPA Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.  Modeling was conducted using ALOHA.  The alternate scenarios for both materials do have off-site impacts.\n\nHydrite Chemical has multiple release prevention programs integrated into all phases of operation from design through maintenance.  Each chemical is reviewed for physical hazards, health hazards, environmental hazards and process hazards.  Both processes are subject to the OSHA PSM program and as such, undergo a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA).  Written operating procedures have been developed and are reviewed on a regular basis.  Employee training procedures have been developed and are implemented ensuring the employees understand the hazards of the chemicals, know how to operate the equipment, know how to shut down the process and how to respond to a release.  Pre-start up safety reviews are performed prior to operation of new equipment or receipt of new chemicals.  Equipment maintenance procedures have been developed and implemented, including routine inspections and scheduled maintenance.  Hydrite Chemical believes that every incident has the potential for serious impact and practices Incident Investigations to determine root cause and corrective action for all releases whether they resulted in injury or impacted away from our plant or not.\n\nA review of the previous five year accident history indicated no releases with community impact. \n\nHydrite Chemical has developed and maintained an Emergency Respons"
