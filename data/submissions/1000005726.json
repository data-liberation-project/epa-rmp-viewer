XTO Energy demonstrates this commitment by investing our resources in accident prevention, by continuous safety training, and by placing a high value on safety during design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our goal is to implement reasonable procedures to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  In the event of a release, trained company personnel will respond accordingly to control and contain the release.\n\nPROCESS DESCRIPTION OF THE FACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Tyrone Gas Plant, located in Tyrone, Oklahoma, operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products (e.g., natural gas, y-grade NGL, and condensate) from natural gas. The Tyrone Gas Plant has several regulated flammables, such as propane and butane.  There are no regulated toxic substances at the Tyrone plant. \n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n\nThe Worst Case Scenario (WCS) associated with a release of flammable substances in Program Level 3 processes at the Tyrone Gas Plant is a Vapor Cloud Explosion (VCE) involving the inventory of the largest storage tank containing 12,115 gallons (53,739 lbs.).  The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this WCS is 0.30 miles.  Although numerous controls are in place to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for passive mitigation measures was taken into account evaluating this WCS.\n\nThe Alternative Release Scenario (ARS) for flammable substances is a VCE resulting from the release of 36,386 lbs from a broken hose to the product loading pump.  The release is expected to be isolated by the operators within 15 minutes (active mitigation).  The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this event is also 0.30 miles.  This event was selected as being a practical scenario for use in emergency planning and response.   \n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PRO"

Because processes at the gas plant are regulated by the EPAA?s risk management program (RMP) regulation and are also subject to OSHAA?s PSM standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHAA?s PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.   The plant is subject to EPA's risk management program (RMP) Program 3.  \n\nEmployee Participation\n\nThe Tyrone Gas Plant encourages participation by employees in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participate as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the gas plant accident prevention program.  In addition, the plant has a number of initiatives under way which address process safety and employee safety issues.  These initiatives include forming teams to promote both process and personal safety.  The teams typically have members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and plant management.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe Tyrone Gas Plant uses a wide range of reference materials to maintain safe operation of each process.  These documents address specific chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.\n\nChemical specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in MSDS sheets.  The gas plant ensures that the process is maintained within acceptable limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems.\n\nThe gas plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide i"

The information includes materials of construction, design pressure, temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised. \n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nThe Tyrone Gas Plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within the program, each process is analyzed to identify potential hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe Tyrone Gas Plant primarily uses the checklist technique to perform these evaluations.  This is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process, as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.  \n\nThe hazardous analysis findings are forwarded to corporate management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to findings is based on relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  The ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to the teamA?s findings are tracked until they're completed.  The final solution of each finding is documented and retained.

Once the team's findings are forwarded to management for consideration, the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\nThe plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  The reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The teamA?s findings are documented and retained and sent to corporate management for resolution.  \n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe Tyrone Plant maintains written procedures that address process operations such as (1) startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new employees.  The procedures are periodically reviewed to ensure accuracy.\n\nIn addition, the Tyrone Plant maintains written operating procedures, which are readily available to operators in the process unit and other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their tasks.\n\nTraining\n\nTo compliment the written procedures for process operations, the facility has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in facility operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After operators demonstrate adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  The refresher training is conducted at least every three years.

Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the gas plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform gas plant personnel of any hazards that they find doing their work. This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.  In addition, the Tyrone plant evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.  Gas plant personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\nThe Tyrone Gas Plant conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service. This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.  A PSSR involves field verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.  \n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe Tyrone Gas Plant has well-established practices for preventative maintenance of pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps, and compressors.
