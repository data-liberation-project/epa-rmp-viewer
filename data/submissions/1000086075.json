              "Description": "PNA has used an ICP since 1999 for its management of various disasters and hazardous chemical release response scenarios. Under the National Response Team (NRT) guidance, the ICP is intended to serve as ?one plan? to satisfy the regulatory requirements of EPA, OSHA, and others while taking a comprehensive approach to disaster planning. This ICP satisfies the 40 CFR Part 68 requirements for an Emergency Response Program. PNA?s ICP was updated on March 11, 2020. ICP training is provided year-round to all personnel via on-line training and a recorded video. PNA conducted hands-on ICP emergency response training on February 14, 2020. The ICP is located throughout the facility and available on the corporate intranet. \n\n\n\nPNA has regular contact with the Scotland County LEPC including sending copies of its annual EPCRA reports to the chairman of the LEPC. PNA has also made conscious efforts to train personnel in on-site response until off-site support arrives.\n\n",

Highway 1611, Business Highway 74, and the Shoe Heel Creek border the facility.  The facility, which produces automotive and commercial building glass (NAICS 327211), sits on approximately 430 acres and operates 24 hours a day, 365 days per year.  Pilkington employees approximately 325 people from the surrounding community.\n\n\n\nThe facility is subject to 40 CFR Part 68 \"Risk Management Program\" (RMP) rule for the flammable chemical hydrogen due to on-site storage quantities in excess of the RMP regulatory limit of 10,000 pounds for all flammables.  Hydrogen is stored onsite in a tank.  \n\n\n\nIn addition, PNA is subject to the regulations for two toxic substances above the threshold quantities, sulfur dioxide (anhydrous) and a toxic substance/compound that has been categorized as Confidential Business Information (CBI) under 40 CFR 68.151. Henceforth this compound will be referred to as CBI_1.\n\n\n\nThe facility has worked diligently to maintain a safe environment for their employees and the surrounding community. There have been no reportable accidents involving RMP-related substances during the past 5 years.\n\n\n\nThe facility currently maintains emergency response activities in an Integrated Contingency Plan (ICP). The facility has trained its employees on response actions and has coordinated response activities with the Scotland County Emergency Coordinator, who heads the Local Emergency Planning Committee."
