      "SummaryText": "RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nTrenton Agri Products, LLC\n\nTrenton Agri Products, LLC (TAP) is an existing ethanol facility located in Hitchcock County, Nebraska.  TAP began operations at the ethanol plant in March 2004. The reports and information are an established part of TAP\u00bfs procedures and much of the training has been ongoing.  Given that TAP is an existing facility, there have been periodic reviews and revisions to reports and information maintained at the facility to date.  \n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Response Policies:\n\nTAP has a commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated in the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel as well as considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility.\n\nTAP\u00bfs policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, plant personnel will respond to contain the release as necessary. The two ethanol tanks, two final product tanks, and denaturant tank are all located in a large bermed Tank Farm containment area that is separated from the plant.  A release from one of these tanks would not be able to migrate off-site, and a fire could be quickly extinguished.  TAP has coordinated with the Trenton Volunteer Fire Department/Hitchcock County Sheriff for emergency response procedures.\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances:\n\nTrenton Agri Products LLC ethanol plant is located in on US Highway 34, two (2) miles northeast of Trenton, Hitchcock County, Nebraska.\n\nThe facility operates 24 hours per day, 7 days per week for the purpose of manufacturing fuel grade ethanol from corn.  The regulated substance under the RMP program is Anhydrous Ammonia and Denaturant (natural gasoline) which is considered a flammable mixture.  TAP Ethanol Plant has determined that the radius of impact from a worst-case release would be about 2.39 mile"

      "SummaryText": "s; due to the amount of ammonia stored on site.  The radius of impact for denaturant is about 0.4 mile.\nOff-site Consequence Analysis Results:\n\nThe worst case scenario at the facility is the release of all 102,420 pounds of ammonia creating a toxic cloud.  The worst-case scenario is based on the release of all ammonia stored on site.  The worst case vapor cloud endpoint is approximately 2.39 miles from the center of the plant.  Public receptors are located within this 2.39 mile radius.  The worst-case scenario at the facility is the release of 750,000 pounds of denaturant creating a vapor cloud explsion.  The worst-case scenario is based on a release from entire denaturant tank.  The worst case vapor cloud endpoint is approximately 0.4 miles from the center of the facility.  Public receptors are also located within the 0.4 mile radius.\n\nAlthough TAP Ethanol Plant has numerous controls in place to prevent such a release and to manage potential consequences, no credit for administrative controls or passive mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating this scenario.\n\nSince the facility qualifies as a Program 3 due to the close proximity of public receptors, Program Safety Management has to be completed for this facility.\n\nSince the facility also qualifies as a Program 3, Alternative Release Scenarios (ARS) were required.  The ARS is the release of 500,000 pounds of denaturant creating a vapor cloud explosion.  The ARS endpoint is approximately <0.1 miles from the center of the facility.  The ARS is also the toxic release of 2,390 pounds per minute of ammonia.  The ARS endpoint is approximately 0.64 miles from the center of the facility.  There are public receptors within the 0.64 mile radius that would be affected by the alternative release.\n\nFive Year Accident History:\n\nTAP reported a spill in the distillation portion of the facility on 5/5/2004.  The spill was reported and taken care of by TAP employees.  No injuries were reported as a result of the inci"

Ethanol is not a reportable chemical for RMP purposes and therefore was not claimed on the Accident History portion of this RMP.\n\nEmergency Response Program Information:\n\nThe TAP Ethanol Plant has several safety programs in place at the facility that incorporate emergency response, including a Health and Safety Plan.  An SPCC Plan has been prepared and implemented in accordance with applicable regulatory standards and timeframes.\n\nThe facility also conducts employee training as part of facility activities.  TAP Ethanol Plant's corporate policy places the utmost importance on worker, public and environmental safety, which is reflected in facility plans and training activities."
