Facility information\n\tThe primary activity of our facility is the storage of anhydrous ammonia for\nsale to farmers.\n\tAnhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application\nas a crop production nutrient.\n\tThe maximum quantity stored would be 134,415 pounds in our 30,000 gal.  \nstorage tank.\n3.

The worst case release scenario would be the release of the entire contents of \nof our storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes. The maximum quantity\n\treleased would be pounds, which represents the volume of the storage tank at 87%\n\tcapacity as limited by design standards. The distance to toxic endpoint is 5.6 miles.\nB. The alternative release scenario based on the most likely potential  incident\n\tis a release from a break in a transfer hose. The distance to toxic endpoint is 0.3 mile.\n4.
