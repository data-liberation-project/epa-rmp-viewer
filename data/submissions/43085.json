      "SummaryText": "Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response\n\nThis site uses n-Pentane and isopentane in its manufacturing operation. Handling systems were designed with controls to prevent and minimize accidental releases. Written unloading procedures require supervision of the unloading process by workers trained to detect failures and prevent releases. Alarms, excess flow devices and automatic shut down systems connected to detectors are employed. Our Emergency Response Plan includes response by employees trained in the handling of hazardous materials and by local fire and emergency response agencies. There is a strictly enforced no smoking or open flame policy in areas where pentane may be present.\n\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe site has several manufacturing areas; pentane is used in EPS bead production and foam sheet extrusion.\n\nThe n-Pentane is used to manufacture expandable polystyrene (EPS) beads. It is usually received at the site in rail cars, stored in underground storage tanks and pumped to batch tanks used for the manufacture of EPS beads. The maximum amount of n-Pentane stored on site is 297,440 pounds.\n\nIsopentane is used in the extrusion of polystyrene foam sheet which is subsequently processed into various disposable food service items. The isopentane is usually received on site in rail cars and is stored in a 60,000 gallon above ground storage tank. The isopentane is pumped to foam extruders where it is injected into melted polystyrene during the production of foam sheet. The maximum amount of Isopentane stored on site is 312,250 pounds.\n\nRelease Prevention Program\n\nThe facility maintains written procedures for the safe handling of pentane and employees directly involved are trained in safe handling practices. Detectors are appropriately placed to alert staff to the presence of pentane should a release occur.\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nThere were no reportable incidents within the last five years.\n\nThe Emergency Response Pr"
