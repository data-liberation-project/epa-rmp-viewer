This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the ammonia refrigeration system.  It is Arctic Cold's policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  \n\nThe Program 3 at Arctic Cold La Brea, is a facility run program that includes; Process Safety Management (PSM) Compliance and Environmental Health and Safety (EHS) Compliance.   \n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance Handled:\n\nArctic Cold La Brea is located at 1349 West La Brea Avenue in Santa Maria, California. The facility is situated approximately 2 miles west of Highway 101 and 1 mile south of Highway 166. \n\nThe facility was constructed and began operations in 2014.  \nThe regulated substance handled at the facility is anhydrous ammonia.  The facility's primary activities revolve around large-scale public storage of food products.  All of the ammonia inventory is used as refrigerant.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:\n\nAs part of the implementation of the RMP Program, key Prevention Program elements were documented and implemented by Arctic Cold La Brea, which also serve to manage process safety issues associated with the use of anhydrous ammonia.  Furthermore, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are currently utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed.  \n\nThe regulated substance is over the 10,000-lbs. federal threshold for EPA RMP and OSHA PSM.   As a result, the anhydrous ammonia covered process (ammonia refrigeration system) is subject to OSHA PSM and EPA Program 3.\nProgram 3 Prevention Program Elements include:\n\u00bfProcess Safety Information\n\u00bfProcess Hazard Analysis\n\u00bfOperati"

The Facility Emergency Response Plan is coordinated with the local responding units, such as the local fire department or HAZMAT Team. \nPlanned Changes To Improve Safety\n\nSeveral studies have been conducted to examine mitigation measures to improve safety at the facility.  These studies include:\n\u00bfA Hazard Assessment\n\u00bfA Process Hazard Analysis\n\u00bfA Compliance audit\nAny outstanding recommendations from these studies and the target completion date or closure have been provided within each individual report."
