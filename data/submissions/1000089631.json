      "SummaryText": "Chief Ethanol Fuels, Inc. (Chief Ethanol) actively pursues a safe and healthy workplace in accordance with our corporate Safety and Health policies.  Management is actively involved with employees in establishing and maintaining an effective safety and health program.  Managers participate with employees in ongoing safety and health program activities, including:\n\n1) Promoting safety and health through active personal example and committee participation;\n\n2) Providing safety and health education and training for employees, supervisors and managers; and\n\n3) Reviewing, updating and enforcing workplace safety and health rules.\n\n\n\nFacility Description\n\nChief Ethanol, located in Hastings, Nebraska, was constructed in 1984 to produce grain derived denatured ethanol for motor fuel while providing animal feed from the remaining distiller's grains.  Major expansions completed in 1993, 1999, 2006, & 2008 have resulted in the plant having the capacity to produce approximately 80 Mmgal per year of denatured fuel grade ethanol. During 2020 the facility started producing industrial ethanol for hand sanitizer as a response to the COVID-19 national pandemic in addition to fuel ethanol.   \n\nEthanol is produced by a fermentation process using corn or milo.  Chief Ethanol processes approximately 80,000 bushels of grain per day.  In addition to ethanol production, the plant produces up to 600,000 tons per year of distiller's grains (both wet and dry) that is used for an animal feed.  Natural gasoline is used to denature the fuel ethanol produced and is stored at the plant in a 30,000 gallon above ground steel storage tank within a 4.5 ft high diked secondary containment area.  \n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response\n\nChief Ethanol follows the Process Safety Management OSHA standard and incorporates the PSM elements for the ethanol distillation, storage, and loading process.  Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies are included in the site's SPCC, "
