It is the policy of Cold Storage Solutions to adhere to all applicable Federal, State, and Local laws and regulations. The ammonia refrigeration process at Cold Storage Solutions has been designed and operates in accordance with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule, and applicable State and Local codes and regulations.  Cold Storage Solutions has qualified engineering, operations, and maintenance personnel knowledgeable in the process, and the safe operation of ammonia refrigeration systems, with direct responsibility of the process.  The process is also designed and operated in compliance with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's Process Safety Management Rule.  Cold Storage Solutions has developed a management system that will oversee the implementation of the Risk Management Program.  This implementation will be overseen by the following team of employees:\r\n\r\nMr. Thomas Parenteau will have overall responsibility for the development, implementation, and integration of the program.  Assistance for program supervision is provided by the Safety Director and the Facilities Maintenance Manager, with ultimate responsibility lying with the Facility Manager.  \r\n\r\nCSS Management is committed to the implementation of the Risk Management Program and views it as a vital aspect and integrated part of daily operations.  CSS Management has provided the support and resources to insure the successful implementation of the identified procedures on an ongoing basis.  Furthermore, Cold Storage Solutions realizes that it is of the utmost importance to convey not only its commitment, but further yet a committed culture of safety to its employees, supervisors,"

The stationary source is the ammonia refrigeration system located at Cold Storage Solutions 230 Kenneth Welch Drive, Lakeville, MA.  It is owned and operated by CS Storage IV, Inc..  The only Risk Management Program regulated substance at this facility is anhydrous ammonia, which is classified as a toxic substance, liquified under pressure.  \r\n\r\nThis facility is a cold storage warehouse/food distribution facility primarily engaged in the refrigerated (cold storage) of seafood and cranberry products Cold Storage Solutions operates the 230 Kenneth Welch Drive facility on an approximately 13-acre industrially zoned parcel in Lakeville, Massachusetts (see Figure 1). The site is situated approximately 2.5-miles north of Assawompsett Pond, the public drinking supply for the City of Taunton, .47 miles southwest of Rt. 495, an interstate highway which averages 50,000 vehicles per day, .32 miles south of a CSX freight rail line, and 2.6 miles north"

      "SummaryText": "of Assawompset Elementary School.  The two separate and distinct refrigeration systems in this facility have a combined inventory of approximately 16,793 pounds of anhydrous ammonia stored on site in the two separate ammonia refrigeration systems.  System 1 is 8,626 lbs and System 2 is 8,167 lbs.  This process does not meet the requirements of Program 1.  It is subject to OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard.  The Accidental Release Prevention Program applicability threshold for anhydrous ammonia is 10,000 lbs.  Thus, this Risk Management Plan has been developed to meet the EPA Program 3 Level of Compliance.\r\n\r\nThe process is the standard refrigeration cycle.  Anhydrous Ammonia is utilized as a primary refrigerant, with the only substance within the system being Anhydrous Ammonia.  The process causes the ammonia to boil into a gas and then cool into a liquid, repeating the process continuously.  The refrigeration system lowers the liquid pressure to lower the boiling point and then evaporates the ammonia within the system using room air as the heat source.  The system then compresses the ammonia into a high pressure temperature and cools the gas until such time as it condenses.  The condensed liquid is pumped into a low pressure side of the system where the pressure is lowered and the cycle repeats itself.  The ammonia changes states form to a liquid-gas-liquid cycle.  Anhydrous Ammonia does not change chemically, and it is not consumed or released during the refrigeration cycle.  Ammonia continually recirculates throughout the system.\r\n\r\nThe Risk Management Program Manual has been developed specifically to prevent or mitigate accidental releases associated with the storage and use of anhydrous ammonia at the Cold Storage Solutions facility. As noted in specific sections, portions of this Plan, including technical details associated with anhydrous ammonia operations.

The process is currently designed and maintained in compliance with ANSI/ASHRAE guidance, as well as the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration Standards.  Process verification takes place through design audits by trained personnel and/or consultants and refrigeration contractors.  The schedule of such verifications is at least once every three years.  The RMP also works concurrently with the OSHA Process Safety Management program under 29 CFR 1910.119.  CSS employees and management staff participate in both regulatory safety programs in order to maintain an accident free work environment.\r\n\r\nThis Cold Storage Solutions facility follows the Environmental Protection Agency Risk Management Plan under 40 CFR 68, and OSHA's 29 CFR 1910.119 Process Safety Management Program.

Cold Storage Solutions executes documented maintenance inspections on process equipment to ensure safe and proper operation.  Process equipment included within the MI Program includes pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shut down systems, system controls, and compressors.  Maintenance procedures are carried out by qualified and certified refrigeration and maintenance personnel with a background in refrigeration maintenance practices.  Training is provided to personnel as needed every three years and during process changes.  PM is performed in accordance with OSHA-PSM, and in many cases, the process safety equipment PM Schedule prescribed by Cold Storage Solutions exceeds recommended equipment maintenance schedules.  An extensive PM Program schedule is carried out on a daily-weekly-monthly-quarterly-semi-annual-annual basis.  Ammonia Detection sensors are present at multiple locations within the facility and tested semi-annually.  Relief Valves are replaced on a 5 yr. change out schedule according to industry best practices.  Emergency Ventilation and Emergency Shut Down Controls are also tested on a monthly schedule.

Employee training is focused on topics such as:  Ammonia Properties and Emergency Response, Respiratory Protection, Process Safety Management, Hot Works Program, Ammonia Detection Devices, Atmospheric Monitoring, CPR/First Aid, and Emergency Action Plan Implementation.
