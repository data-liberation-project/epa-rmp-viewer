Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the stationary source\r\n\r\nThe facility adheres to the federal, state, and local rules and regulations. The facility is in compliance with the OSHA requirements for handling of anhydrous ammonia and the OSHA process management standard. Employees of the facilities are engaged in ongoing training about their responsibilities in implementing compliance programs. Should an emergency occur, it the company's policy to notify the Detroit Fire department and request that they respond to the emergency situation \r\n\r\n2. Stationary source and regulated substances handled\r\n\r\nAnhydrous ammonia is stored in a bulk tank at the facility. The facility is engaged in heat treatment of steel. Heat treatment process involves introducing ammonia in the controlled ovens containing metal. \r\n\r\n3. The worst case release scenario and the alternative release scenario including the administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for the reported scenarios\r\n\r\nThe worst-case scenario for the facility is considered to be the release of the contents of the tank when filled to the maximum allowed limit under written administrative controls (11900 gallons of ammonia; 59500 pounds of ammonia). The distance corresponding to 59500 lbs of ammonia release is 2.83 miles.\r\n\r\nThe alternative release scenario identified for the facility is the release through the transfer line connecting the tank with the transfer hose of anhydrous ammonia delivery truck that loads the tank. In this scenario, the liquid contained in the transfer line empties out, and the check valve closes, limiting the loss to the contents of the line (approximately 75 lbs). The attendant will then close the main loading valve at the tank. The maximum distance corresponding to the release of 75 pounds is 0.1 miles.\r\n\r\n4. The general accidental"

The design, installation and maintenance of anhydrous ammonia tank is performed in conformance with ANSI standards, state and local regulations. Facility personnel have been trained in accordance with safe handling procedures developed by Tanner Industries, the supplier of both tank and anhydrous ammonia to the facility.\r\n \r\nThe material handling activity is performed after all of the following precautions are met:\r\n* The truck has backed up to the transfer loading pipe\r\n* The transfer hose has been attached by the delivery truck operators\r\n* Inspection by both the truck and facility operators has occurred\r\n* The load has been accepted by the facility\r\n\r\nAll the transfer operations are monitored and follow a written standard operating procedure (SOP)\r\n\r\n5.
