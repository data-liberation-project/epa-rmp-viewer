Missouri-American Water Company management is committed to protecting its employees, the public and the environment.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive safety, environmental protection and accident prevention programs that are designed to ensure that the risks involved in the handling, use and storage of chlorine are minimized.\nCHLORINE SYSTEM\nChlorine is used to purify drinking water.  It is an important chemical that disinfects against disease producing organisms, and is used in the treatment of 98% of U.S. drinking water.  Based on the hazards of chlorine, however, it is necessary to observe certain safety precautions in order to prevent unnecessary human and environmental exposure.\nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\nEPA's RMP rule requires that information be provided about the worst-case release scenario and alternative release scenario for our facility.  The worst-case scenario would assume a release of 2,000 pounds of chlorine in 10 minutes.  Based on EPA's RMP*Comp v.1.06 atmospheric modeling software, the vapors formed as a result of the release would have off-site consequences.  A major release represented by this worst-case scenario is highly unlikely as it assumes a complete failure of the vessel, the failure of all safety systems, no emergency response, and worst-case weather conditions.  The alternative release scenario assumes the yolk connection on a one-ton container to the liquid feed line fails with the valve open, and a chlorine release occurs within the building.  Based on modeling, this scenario would have off-site consequences.  The results of the facility's process hazard analysis and the Company's operating history suggest that even this \"credible worst-case\" scenario is extremely unlikely to occur, but it can serve as the basis for e"

Our comprehensive prevention program ensures the safe operation of the chlorine system and prevention of accidental releases.  The chlorine system at the water treatment plant is designed for safety, and the process is continuously monitored.  Chlorine detectors and alarms rapidly alert operators to any problems.   We follow Chlorine Institute Standards and use only equipment and materials certified for chlorine service.  A chlorine scrubber is in place at the facility which would help to mitigate the effects of a chlorine release by neutralizing the vapors.  Comprehensive operating procedures provide clear instructions for safe operation of the chlorine system.  Process safety information  includes detailed information related to chlorine hazards, process technology and process equipment.  A process hazard analysis is performed and reviewed regularly to identify, evaluate and conrol the risks associated with the chlorine system.  Operators are formally trained to operate the chlorine process safely, and receive comprehensive classroom and on-the-job training.  Procedures are followed to ensure proper management of changes to the system and a safety review is performed prior to startup of new or modified equipment.  A preventative and corrective maintenance program ensures the mechanical integrity of the chlorine system, and includes procedures for equipment inspection, testing and repair.  Employees receive specialized training to perform chlorine system maintenance, and a contractor safety program is in place to ensure contractors are qualified and trained to safely work on the chlorine process.  Compliance audits will be conducted regularly to ensure that our programs are "

Emergency response is coordinated with the regional emergency management agency and the Local Emergency Planning Committee.  In the unlikely event of a major chlorine release, plant personnel would immediately contact the local emergency responders and a contract emergency response organization that would dispatch a trained HAZMAT team to the site.  Local authorities have plans in place to communicate with the public regarding response and protection actions.\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nMissouri-American Water Company works to continually improve all areas of safety, and regularly evaluates necessary upgrades and improvements to ensure the safe operation of the facility.
