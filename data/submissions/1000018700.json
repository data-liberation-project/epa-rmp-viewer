Management recognizes that leadership in environmental protection is critical to all of our stakeholders, customers and communities in which we do business.  We meet or exceed all federal, state and local standards in the operation of our plant.  Our core purpose is to be the supplier of choice for customers worldwide.  Our stakeholders produce value added egg products utilizing liquid egg in either whole, white or yolk form.  Anhydrous Ammonia is used in our refrigeration system to maintain and control temperatures of our manufacturing processes.  This ensures that our products are processed and maintained at proper temperatures to inhibit microbiological growth.   Our refrigeration system consists of 2 systems that both utilize anhydrous ammonia and arenot connected.\nWe comply with OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM), OSHA Emergency Action Plan, Emergency Response, EPA Oil Spill Prevention Countermeasure and Control plan and applicable EPCRA regulations at state and local levels.\nWe have an Emergency Response plan that is coordinated with the local fire department and agencies for response and notifications.  Tours/drills/training are conducted on a regular basis.  We also review with the fire dept. the key points to know about a refrigeration system and invite them to participate in our emergency response training.  Evacuation drills are held on a regular basis with all stakeholders.  These drills are critiqued and any deficiencies are reviewed and appropriate corrective action taken. \nPreventive Maintenance is tracked on a computer maintenance management system.  This is allowing us to build trend history in an organized manner and allowing us to become predictive vs. preventive in our maintenance and further ensuring safe operation of our systems.  "
