Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements. The Plaquemine Facility developed a Safety Involvement Team (SIT) and a Unit Safety Involvement Team (USIT) to increase employee involvement. Both teams provide value in Employee Participation. They focus on updating safety procedures, plant inspections, unit, and plant safety issues and they are a voice to Management concerning plant safety issues. In addition, the Plaquemine Facility  employee's have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses in particular.  The Plaquemine Facility has been recognized by the Chemical Manufacturers' Association for having Employee Involvement Programs that are \"Examples of Excellence in the Chemical Industry.\"\n\nContractors\n\nThe Plaquemine Facility hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out.   The Plaquemine Facility has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related the contractor's work and the processes.  Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.  Also, the Plaquemine Facility holds Contractor Safety Meetings where all of the contractors are invited to discuss updates to policies and procedures, and escalate concerns, provide input and suggestions, and ensure a two-way communication to provide solutions to potential hazards before they arise.\n \nFive-year Accident History\n\nThe Plaquemine Facility has"

This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances and to protect people, property and the environment.\n\nThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nOur facility's primary activities encompass the manufacture of Electrochemical and Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC) Resins.  We have two regulated substances above the RMP threshold quantity present at our facility.  These substances are Chlorine and Vinyl Chloride Monomer.  Chlorine is used in the manufacture of Vinyl Chloride Monomer.  Vinyl Chloride Monomer is used for feedstock in the manufacture of PVC resin.\n\nThe Plaquemine Facility schedules and plans for facility and unit outages for turnaround and maintenance purposes.  During these timeframes, the railcar inventories may increase.  The increase in inventory of the railcars has been reflected in the 2025 resubmission to ensure that the maximum potential inventory has been included.  There has not been an increase in production related inventories. \n\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe Plaquemine Facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.    The following sections briefly describe the elements of the accidental release prevention and process safety managements programs that are in place at our facilit"

The primary methodology used to carry out these analyses is \"HAZOP\" coupled with a Layers of Protection Analysis (LOPA).  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel which may include expertise in engineering, process operations, maintenance and environmental, health and safety.  In most cases, third-party PHA consultants are hired to facilitate the PHA, which allows for another form of expert opinions and guidance. Findings related to the hazard analysis are entered in our electronic tracking system.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, we maintain written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The procedures also contain consequences of deviation and actions to take in order to maintain safe operation of the process.  The information is regularly reviewed, maintained through the management of change process, certified annually, and is readily accessible to workers involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\n\nThe Plaquemine Facility has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every three years and more frequently at intervals determined by the complexity of the process and employee input.

Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others, pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls, and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\n\nWritten procedures are in place to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and trained to deal with the modification prior to working with the modified process.  In addition, operating procedures and associated PSI are updated as required.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\n\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at the Plaquemine Facility.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures, training of affected personnel, and installation quality are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nThe Plaquemine Facility promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.

For the last 15 years, three RMP certification cycles, there has not been accidents on our site that meet the RMP criteria as defined in \u00a768.42.    \n\nEmergency Response Plan\n\nThe Plaquemine Facility has a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public.\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.  Emergency responders are trained or drilled on a quarterly basis.  Our emergency plan has been coordinated with and verified by Iberville LEPC.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety \n\nCurrently (February of 2025), the Plaquemine Facility has submitted a VPP application in an effort to achieve OSHA VPP Star status.  This effort is to demonstrate excellence in health and safety of the facility.\n\nThe Plaquemine Facility has instituted an employee hazard recognition program where employees can formally submit potential areas of concern.  An employee-based safety team (Safety Involvement Team - SIT) reviews the hazards and develops solutions to resolve the potential hazard. \n\nA Safety Field Observation effort has been put into place to document by salaried technical personnel. This is in an effort to involve all levels of employees, in the safety program.\n\nTo help improve emergency response time, chlorine detection sensors are installed within the Chlorine Unit and around the perimeter of the facility.
