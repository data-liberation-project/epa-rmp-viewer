      "SummaryText": "Chlorine is the most commonly used substance for disinfecting drinking water.  The addition of chlorine or chlorine compounds to water is called chlorination.  Chlorination is considered to be the most important process for preventing the spread of waterborne disease in drinking water.  The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP) also uses chlorine for drinking water disinfection purposes to protect public health per state and federal water quality standards.  Storing and handling large quantities of chlorine can create hazardous situations.  LADWP takes safety obligations in storing and using chlorine as seriously as it takes providing safe drinking water.  The LADWP Santa Ynez Chlorination Station chlorine handling process is subject to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program and Plan and also to the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program requirements.  The facilities subject to the EPA and CalARP regulations are required to prepare and update Risk Management Plans (RMPs).  The RMP is to include policies and procedures followed to safely operate the facility and the actions which will be taken by the facility in an event of an emergency.  LADWP prepared and submitted the RMPs for the Santa Ynez facility in June 1999 and June 2004.  This RMP is the five-year update of the June 2004 RMP.  LADWP prepared a Program Level 2 RMP in 2004 because Santa Ynez Chlorination Station is not subject to PSM regulations.  In the excess of caution, LADWP has now decided to prepare a Program Level 3 RMP.  Thus, this 2009 update of the RMP demonstrates compliance with the Program Level 3 requirements.\n\nThe following information is specifically required in the RMP Update Executive Summary: \n\n\u00c2\u00bf\tAccidental release prevention and emergency response policies.\n\u00c2\u00bf\tGeneral facility and regulated substances information.\n\u00c2\u00bf\tSummary of the accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps.\n\u00c2\u00bf\tFive-year accid"

All applicable requirements of the State of California and EPA\u00c2\u00bfs Prevention Program are adhered to, including key elements such as training, systems management, and emergency response procedures.  \n\nThe LADWP emergency response policy involves the preparation of emergency response plans for hazardous materials which are tailored to each facility and to the emergency response services available in the community, and is in compliance with the EPA and CalARP Program Emergency Response Program Requirements.  The LADWP has prepared an Emergency Response Plan for the Santa Ynez Chlorination Station to facilitate coordination and emergency planning with offsite response officials and facilities in the event of an emergency.  The emergency response plan has been coordinated with local response agencies (City of Los Angeles Fire Department).  The Santa Ynez Chlorination Station has an excellent record in preventing accidents from occurring.\n\nGeneral Facility and Regulated Substance Information\n\nThe Santa Ynez Chlorination Station is located at 1351 North Palisades Drive in Pacific Palisades, California.  The station serves to chlorinate water stored in the Santa Ynez Reservoir.  The treated water is then piped into the distribution network which serves parts of West Los Angeles with potable water. The station has a building which houses chlorine stored in ton containers, three weighing system for the containers, three chlorinators, and associated process piping.

All three chlorine containers can be connected to the chlorination process to feed chlorine gas.  The one-ton container is the largest vessel (container) on line. The maximum quantity of chlorine present at the Santa Ynez Chlorination Station at any given time exceeds the listed threshold quantities in the EPA and CalARP rules.  It also exceeds the listed threshold quantities in the federal and California Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Standards. However, the facility is normally unstaffed and water treatment operators visit the facility three times a week and respond to any trouble alarms which may occur.  Thus, the LADWP Santa Ynez facility is not subject to federal or California OSHA PSM regulations.\n\nThere is a maximum of three chlorine one-ton containers at the chlorination station. All three chlorine containers rest on load cell scales, which allow the operators to monitor the chlorine weight remaining in the container.  Chlorine gas is withdrawn from the ton container through a vacuum regulating valve, which is installed directly on the container angle valve.  Chlorine gas is pulled under vacuum from the vacuum regulating valve through plastic tubing and the chlorine header lines to one of the three chlorinators provided at the chlorination station. In case of rupture of the plastic tubing connecting the container to the header lines, air would be drawn in rather than chlorine being released, and the vacuum regulator would shut down the chlorine supply at the container angle valve, operating as a shut-off valve.  From the chlorinator, the gas is then pulled by vacuum to injectors which draw chlorine gas into mixing water to form a concentrated solution.  The injectors are in a cabinet near the chlorination building.  The chlorine solution discharged"

The required conditions prior to startup include:\n\n\u00c2\u00bf\tConstruction and/or equipment are in accordance with design specifications.\n\u00c2\u00bf\tSafety, operating, maintenance, and emergency procedures are in place and are adequate.\n\u00c2\u00bf\tA PHA has been performed for any new facilities and recommendations have been resolved or implemented prior to startup.\n\u00c2\u00bf\tAt modified facilities, MOC requirements have been met.\n\u00c2\u00bf\tTraining of each operating and maintenance employee involved in the process is complete.\n\nThese procedures ensure that no new/significantly modified process will start-up and no regulated substances will be introduced into such a process prior to the pre-startup safety review.  This constitutes a final check that the process and equipment are ready to go and that the recommendations of the PHA have been implemented or adequately addressed.  This will ensure that the design and construction of a new or modified process is safely executed and that the facility is prepared to operate it. \n\nMechanical integrity procedures for the plant ensure that written maintenance procedures are implemented and documented, including training of maintenance personnel.\n\nMaintenance \n\nThe LADWP operates a MAXIMO Program that generates a task order for performance of the preventive maintenance routine after a designated time past the closing of the previous task order for that maintenance.  Description of the work to be performed is included with the printed work order.  The water treatment supervisor is responsible for this task.  \n\nIn addition, the written maintenance procedure is provided in the Operation and Mainten"

These allow the operator to rapidly review what maintenance is necessary.  The schedules are supplemental to the log sheets on-site and provide a summary and quick reference to manufacturer's O&M manuals.  A maintenance log book is provided on-site for quick reference by the Operator. \n\nLADWP documents inspection, testing, and maintenance of chlorination equipment and assures the performance is done in accordance with the recommendations of the manufacturer and industry groups (i.e., Chlorine Institute).\n\nHot Work Permits and Management of Change \n\nHot work refers to work involving electric or gas welding, cutting, brazing, or similar flame or spark producing operations.  The procedures call for the issuance of a hot work permit whenever it is conducted on or near the chlorination process and other areas deemed appropriate as described in the procedures.  Fire prevention and protection systems are in place prior to the issuance of the hot work permit.  The permit indicates the dates the work is authorized for, the location and specific operational requirements and is kept on file in the administrative office. \n\nLADWP Management of Change (MOC) procedures include steps required to be taken by plant personnel prior to implementing changes to chlorination equipment, procedures, raw materials, and processing conditions.  Training, process safety information, operating procedures, and maintenance procedures are updated according to the changes made.\n\nInternal Compliance Audits\n\nThe LADWP has been certifying at a minimum of every three years that compliance with Program 2 Prevention Program requirements is met and that procedures and practices developed are adequate and being followed.

For each internal audit, the audit team completes a Compliance Audit Certification Page and Compliance Audit Checklist forms (one form for each prevention program requirement).  The Compliance Audit Certification Page provides process identification, the dates of the audit, team members, and certification by the audit leader.  The Compliance Audit Checklist details the requirements of each RMP element and contains questions that may assist with the auditing process. The audit checklist for each element consists of the following three sections:\n\n\u00c2\u00bf\tRecords Review: A review of the RMP written Prevention Program.\n\u00c2\u00bf\tOn-Site Conditions: The audit team reviews the program elements based on observation of the plant conditions and safety practices.\n\u00c2\u00bf\tInterviews:  The program elements are evaluated by interviewing personnel from appropriate functions including operations, maintenance, management, and contractors.\n\nTeam members record RMP program deficiencies identified during the audit on the checklist.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nThe LADWP incident investigation procedures describe incident reporting, investigation, and investigation reporting steps to be followed by plant personnel.  The incident investigation is started promptly but no later than 48 hours after the event.  The LADWP promptly addresses and resolves all recommendations and implements the recommendations in a timely manner to prevent an incident recurrence.  All incident investigation reports are retained on LADWP file for at least a period of five years from the date the reports are completed.  \n\nFive-year Accident History Summary\n\nNo chlorine releases that could have caused safety or health hazard (deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place) occurred"
