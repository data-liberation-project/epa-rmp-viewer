This Risk Management Plan has been developed for The Village of Parks Water Treatment Plant in accordance with 40 CFR part 68.  This facility is subject to the requirements of this program due to the usage and storage of chlorine in an amount greater than 2,500 lbs.\n\nThe facility is located within the city limits of Parks, LA on Martin Street.  The area surrounding the plant is residential and commercial with the City Hall across the street and the fire department next door.  The latitude and longitude of the facility was obtained using a hand-held Garmin 75 GPS device with an accuracy of +/- 100 meters.  The facility is easily identified on the USGS quadrangle map entitled Parks, LA.\n\nThe facility treats and supplies water to residential and commercial entities located in Parks and adjacent areas.  This treatment includes the chlorination of the water supply prior to being distributed throughout the system.  The rate of chlorine injected into the water is automatically regulated and varies based on the current needs.  Once the chlorine is injected into the water it is diluted to an amount which is less than 1% chlorine by weight.  Therefore, the process that is subject to the RMP requirements begins with the chlorine supply (2-1 ton cylinders) and ends at the point of injection into the water.  The facility purchases the pre-filled chlorine cylinders from DPC Enterprises, L.P. approximately once every two months.  The water plant stores a maximum of two-one ton cylinders (4,000 lbs.) at any one time. The cylinders are located within a hinged fiberglass building with 12 x 6\" vents on all sides.  The door to this building is locked at all times.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario would involve the release of the greatest amount from a single vessel as required by 40 CFR part 68.25 (b)-Determination of worst-case release quantity. This type of release may occur as a result of catastrophic natural or other unforeseen dis"

A release of 2,000 lbs. for a duration of 10 minutes results in a 1.3 mile distance to the toxic endpoint.  This endpoint, developed by the American Industrial Hygiene Association, is the location where minimal effects of exposure to the toxic substance are likely to occur.  This distance encompasses the entire Village of Parks from Hwy 31 at La Freniere Rd. to Hwy 347 at Barras Rd. and from True Friend Rd. just before Lee Champagne Rd. to Hwy 3039 before Section 28 Rd.  According to a January 1999 publication of a July 1, 1998 population estimate the population of Parks is approximately 509. \n\nAn alternative case or a more likely release of chlorine could occur as a result of a valve, regulator seal, or gasket leak, or from a small amount of liquefied chlorine being trapped between the valve of the cylinder and the equipment regulator head.  The process is visually inspected for leaks at least twice each day by the plant superintendent. The chlorine cylinders are located within a hinged fiberglass building. This limits the rate at which chlorine is emitted into the atmosphere thus allowing for more time to notify the public and emergency response personnel.  This building is lifted off of the tanks only during times when a new shipment of chlorine is being delivered.  The maximum time period between daily inspections is 12 hours.  Assuming the chlorine flashes to the atmosphere within the fiberglass building at a rate of 0.5 ft3/min for a maximum of 12 hours (72 lbs. of chlroine) the distance to the toxic endpoint is less than 0.1 mile.  The area within 0.1 mile of the facility extends from Hwy 31 at Pe'Rioux St. to Main St. at Parks Primary School and along Bridge St. from in-between Main & Melancon St. to Trailer Park St.  Based on a  maximum population density of 8,268 p/mi2, the population within 0.1 mile of the facility is approximately 65.

These procedures are kept on-site in the O & M Manuals developed by Domingue-Szabo & Associates, Inc.  Records of inspections, testing, and maintenance are also kept on file at the facility.  In addition to being enclosed within a fiberglass building the process is also equipped with an automatic shut-off system.  If a change in pressure within the injection line is detected the system automatically closes the flow valve at  the chlorine tank.\n\nWritten emergency response procedures are kept on file at the facility.  The emergency response procedures describe actions for incidental response for facility personnel in the event of a relatively small leak or release that does not pose an immediate safety or health hazard.  If incidental response activities do not halt the release or the release poses an immediate safety or health hazard, specially trained response personnel are contacted to take over response activities.  In the event of a chlorine leak or release, employees are instructed to assess the situation and to determine if it is safe to discontinue the leak without the help of emergency responders.  If there are any doubts as to the safety of the release, the employees are to initiate the written notification procedures.  \n\nCurrent safety features installed at the facility include the enclosure of the cylinders within a fiberglass building which limits the rate at which chlorine is release into the atmosphere.  The injection system is also equipped with a device that automatically closes the valves at the cylinders if a loss in pressure within the injection line is detected.
