This commitment is demonstrated by resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training, emergency equipment, participation in emergency drills, and meetings with local emergency response organizations.\n\n\n\nThis commitment is also consistent with the corporation's environmental, health and safety policy, which provides that:\n\na)  All facilities will be designed, operated, and managed to protect the health and safety of the employees and the public;\n\nb)  All employees will be educated on the applicable environmental, health and safety standards and procedures;\n\nc)  Sufficient human and financial resources will be allocated to sustain these goals; and  \n\nd)  Audits will be conducted regularly to verify compliance with this policy.\n\n\n\nThese corporate policies also identify the importance of complying with OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, so that all employees and the surrounding community will be adequately protected from potential fire, explosion and /or toxic release hazards associated with catastrophic releases.\n\n\n\nIt is Mosaic Fertilizer LLC's policy to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated and hazardous substances.  If an accidental release does occur, Mosaic's trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.  Mosaic has a comprehensive program for complying with safety and environmental regulations for all regulated and other hazardous substances handled.\n\n\n\n2. Stationary Source and the Regulated Substance Handled\n\n\n\nThe Mosaic New Wales Plant produces monoammonium phosphate (MAP), diammonium phosphate (DAP), and crop nutrients, as well as a variety of animal feed ingredients.  The raw materials used in this process include molten sulfur, phosphate rock, and anhydrous ammonia.  The sulfur is burned with air"

In turn, the sulfuric acid is reacted with phosphate rock to produce phosphoric acid.  Phosphoric acid is then reacted with the anhydrous ammonia to produce MAP and  DAP. \n\n\n\nRegulated toxic substances involved in the process include anhydrous ammonia, sulfur dioxide, and sulfur trioxide; however, anhydrous ammonia is the only PSM/RMP regulated substance that exceeds the listed threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds (lbs.).  Sulfur dioxide and sulfur trioxide are fully consumed as intermediates in the production process, and they are not present in quantities that exceed their applicable threshold quantities.\n\n\n\n3. General Accident Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Steps\n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is regulated as a highly hazardous chemical under OSHA's PSM Standard.  The quantity of anhydrous ammonia present at the New Wales Plant exceeds the OSHA PSM threshold for ammonia, so the New Wales Plant is subject to OSHA's PSM requirements.  The New Wales ammonia process therefore satisfies the eligibility requirements for a Program 3 Prevention Program under the RMP rule.  The New Wales plant has fully implemented OSHA's PSM standard requirements and is using this program as its RMP Prevention Program.  A brief summary of the facility's PSM program is as follows:\n\n\n\nThe PSM Program at the New Wales Plant is an active on-going process with full participation from employees at all levels and from all areas of the facility.   The initial Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) for the covered process was completed in 1994 and revalidated in 1998, 2002, 2007 and 2011. The action items generated from the PHA revalidations have been completed or are currently in progress.  The ammonia storage system was upgraded to meet applicable nationally recognized codes and standards following the 1998 revalidation.\n\nThe New Wales PSM Review commi"

This includes writing and updating operating and maintenance procedures; training for all operators and maintenance personnel; reviewing mechanical integrity, quality assurance, and management of change programs, and contractor safety programs; and developing an audit schedule which meets the OSHA PSM standard requirements.\n\n\n\nMaximum Intended Ammonia Inventory Correction:\n\nThe maximum intended ammonia inventory reported in Section 1.17.c.3 has historically been based on the actual quantity of ammonia stored in the facility. Per the Risk Management Plan RMP E-submit user manual, the inventory should be calculated based on the maximum quantity that can be stored in a covered process at any one time during the calendar year; thus the reason for the quantity change reported in Section 1.17.c.3 of the current submittal. Additionally it was discovered that the reported pounds in Sections 2.5 and 3.5 (Quantity Released) of the RMP plan were incorrectly reported in previous submissions due to a unit conversion error (kg to lb) while transmitting data from the modeling report. The quantity released values have been corrected in the current submittal to reflect the correct quantity based on the modeling done in 1999. Please note that none of the quantities stored on site in the process have changed. \n\n\n\n4.  Five Year Accident History\n\n\n\nIn the past five years, the New Wales ammonia process has had no accidental releases that resulted in on-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering-in-place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n\n\n5.

The New Wales Emergency Response Program contains procedures for notifying plant personnel, the public, and local emergency response agencies about an accidental release.  It has been designed to advise all plant personnel how to respond to emergency situations and what their responsibilities are during emergencies.  The New Wales Plant has defined an emergency as  a non-routine, unusual set of circumstances that call for immediate safety or environmental action.  The New Wales plant also has an Emergency Action Team on each shift that conduct training and practice drills with County emergency personnel.  These Teams are provided with appropriate personal protective and accident mitigation equipment to handle plant emergencies.\n\n\n\n6.
