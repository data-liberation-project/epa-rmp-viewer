All applicable procedures of the ANSI K-61.1 - 1989 revision of the ?Safe Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia,? as adopted by Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship (IDALS) are adhered to.  Our emergency response policy involves the preparation of response plans that are tailored to our facility and to the emergency response services available in our community, and is in compliance with the EPA Emergency Response Program requirements. \n\nThis facility is in the business of selling anhydrous ammonia to farm customers as a form of nitrogen fertilizer.  The facility has one anhydrous ammonia storage tank, with a caacity of 18,000 gallons water capacity.  The storage tank, several anhydrous ammonia nurse tanks, risers for filling nurse tanks, electrical panels, lighting, and safety equipment are all parts of this facility's anhyrous ammonia operation.  The total storage capacity of the installation including the nurse tanks is estimated at 402,600 lbs. The facility is manned during the season and is operational through normal business hours.\n\nThe off-site consequences analysis includes two anhydrous ammonia release scenarios, identified as \"worst-case\" release and \"alternative\" release scenario.  The first scenario is defined by EPA and shall assume the maximum quantity of one vessel is released as a gas in 10 minutes due to a catastrophic break.  The alternative release scenario is defined as a more likely accidental release of anhydrous ammonia caused by a transfer hose failure.\n\nThe \"worse-case\" release scenario involves a catastrophic failure of the tank, releasing the entire 78,800 pounds of anhyrdous ammonia.  The off site consequences were calculated using \"TFI's RMP Guidance for Ammonia Retailers\".  The worst c"

The distance to the endpoint was 0.93 miles.  It is estimated that 223 people would be affected by this release.\n\nThe \"alternative release\" scenario assumed a hose break and leaks, 7,200 pounds of anhyrdous ammonia.  The EPA recmmend wind speed of 3.0 meters per second with a \"D\" atmospheric stability class was used in this scenario.  Using urban topography and \"TFI's RMP Guidance for Ammonia Retailers\" the toxic endpoint is 0.46 mile.  The population with in that area is estimated to be 209 people .  The assumption is that the duration of the release is 2 minutes because equipment, exess flow valves, and human intervention will stop the leak.  \n\nLeinen, Inc. has had no anhydrous ammonia leaks within the past 5 years.  Even though the company has had no releases it still coordinates annual visits with the local fire department to review the systems and procedures for response to a leak.\n\nLeinen, Inc. has several key elements in it's accident prevention plan: \n     1.  The anhydrous ammonia system adheres to the laws and regulations that are based on the 1989 revision of the ANSI \n          K61.1 adopted in 1990 by the State of Iowa.\n     2.  Annual training is required of all personnel on hanlding, transferring, or transporting anhydrous ammonia.  The training \n          includes properties of ammonia, safe handling practices, first aid, and emergency response.\n     3.  Use of good management practices as specified by industry standards and training aids.\n     4.  Frequent site inspections by management and safety consultants.\n     5.  Annual inspections by IDALS fertilizer inspectors include safety equipment, tanks, and handling equipment.\n     6.  Use of proper anhydrous ammonia personal protective equipment and safety equipment.\n\nChanges are made in the system when necessary or when required by regulation c"
