Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.\n\nThe maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia that can be stored would be 210,000 \npounds, this includes the amount of anhydrous ammonia that could be stored in nurse \ntanks.\n\nAqua ammonia is stored, and distributed for application as a crop production nutrient.  The storage and handling system consists of storage tanks, mixers, loading riser and associated plumbing.  Acess to the site is restricted to authoried employees, authorized management personnl and authorized contractors.\n\nThe maximum quanity of aqua ammonia that can be stored would be 190,000 pounds.\n\n3. The accidental release prevention program.\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable \nstate codes and regulations.  This facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety \nRequirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by \nThe American National Standards Institute, Inc. as adopted by state regulation and "
