(ONEOK) is committed to managing all operations in a manner that protects the environment and the health and safety of employees, customers, contractors and the public while fully complying with applicable laws and regulations.  ONEOK\u00c2\u00bfs management philosophy goals are achieved through the implementation of the Environmental Health and Safety Management Systems, by the personal commitments of employees and contractors, and by open communication with employees, customers, neighbors, and regulators.\n\nThe purpose of this Risk Management Plan is to provide information about operations at the facility, programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, emergency response plans in the event an accidental release should occur, the five-year accident history of the facility and planned changes to improve safety at the facility.\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\nThe Conway LPG Storage Facility is one of many facilities owned and operated by ONEOK.  The facility receives various products via pipeline, rail and truck and stores them in above ground vessels and underground storage caverns.  These products are shipped to customers via pipeline, truck and rail.  The RMP flammable substances stored at the facility in amounts greater than threshold quantity are:  propane, butane, isobutene, butylene, two propylene mixtures, natural gasoline, and ethyl mercaptan.  There are no toxic chemicals present at the facility.  The facility is classified as Program Level 3 under the regulation.  \n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs in place at the facility are part of the high standards striven for by ONEOK.  These high standards include:\n\n\u00c2\u00b7\tOperating in compliance with required environmental permits and regul"

Ongoing analysis of the potential hazards of the process, detailed training of employees, and emphasis on safety has helped avoid any serious chemical release accidents over the last 5 years.  Part of this program has also involved identifying and taking steps to avoid potential accidental chemical releases.
