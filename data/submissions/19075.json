The outlets of the storage tanks and the railcars are protected by excess flow valves that close tight if their set point is exceeded. The storage tanks and railcar unloading areas have perimeter flamable gas detectors. There is a leak detection and repair program that calls for the inspection and gas testing of flanges. There are water curtains that are activated by high LELs around the storage and unloading areas. There are heat activated deluge with foam systems over any area where the 2-methylpropene is handled. All personell who operate or maintain equipment, or manage the process in an area where  2-methylpropene is handled are trained on safe handling techniques,  countermeasures for leaks, how the fire system works, what to do in case of fire or leak,etc.... There is a management of change program. All 2 methylpropene areas fall under the plants 29CFR1910.119 compliance program. The reactor is not inside a perimeter of flamble detectors, but is covered by a haet activated deluge system ( there is no accumulation of 2-methylpropene; it is used as fast as it is introduced into the reactor). All other safety programs apply. There are parts of the transfer lines that are not inside of the detection perimeter or under the deluge systems, but they are in the leak detection and repair program and are protected by excess flow valves, and all other prevention programs apply.",

This is accomplished through both engineering and administrative controls. All applicable elements of the U. S. EPA's Prevention Program and OSHA's Process Safety Management standard are adhered to. The Merisol Antioxidants LLC's Emergency Plan is tailored to meet the needs of any foreseeable release at the Oil City, PA facility, and was developed using in put from the local emergency response agencies (Cornplanter Twp. Vol. FD, Rouseville Vol. FD, Oil City FD, And Venango Emergency Management Agency). The plan was submitted and approved by the Venango County, PA Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC). \n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance Handled\n\nThe Merisol Antioxidants LLC facility located at Oil City, PA is a manufacturing facility that produces Butylated Hydroxy Toluene (BHT), a crystalline Phenolic antioxidant. Isobutylene (2-methylpropene) is stored in bulk on the plant, and is used to add the butyl groups onto mixed cresols (methylphenol). The isobutylene storage tank and associated transfer equipment have several engineered safety features, such as thick walled tanks; excess flow valves; perimeter monitor & alarm systems; pressure relief valves; a flare protected vent system; and administrative procedures to prevent or detect releases. The plant is manned and the isobutylene system is monitored 24hrs a day. There are automated vapor dispersing, fire extinguishing and associated alarm systems around the isobutylene storage and off-loading areas. All storage and handling equipment as well as all safety and countermeasure equipment are on a rigid test and inspection program as well as a general preventive maintenance program.\n\nThe offsite consequence"

      "SummaryText": " analysis includes consideration of two release scenarios for this chemical.\n1.) The worst case as defined by the EPA, \"the owner or operator shall assume that the ... maximum quantity in the largest vessel ... is released as a gas over 10 minutes,\" due to an unspecified failure.\n2.) The alternate case as defined by the EPA as, \"more likely to occur than the worst case release scenario\".\n\nWorst and Alternate Case Scenarios\n\nThe worst case involves the total failure of one of the on site storage tanks. There are two tanks within 10 feet of each other. Rail cars, which are smaller than a storage tank, are off-loaded to a storage tank from less than 100 feet away. The failure would result in the release of 186300 lbs. of isobutylene within 10 minutes. If all of this were converted to gas, and a ground level ignition source were introduced, the resulting energy release would cause a greater than 1 psi overpressure shock wave for a 2417 ft or 0.46 mi. radius. There are some residences inside the endpoint boundary of the worse case. There are no schools, hospitals, nursing homes, recreational parks, etc. There are no environmental receptors inside the end point boundary.\n\nThe alternate case Scenario involves a breach (20% rupture) in a two-inch (i.d.) liquid isobutylene transfer line between the storage tanks and the reactor. The release is 161 lbs./min., which is slightly below the excess flow valve setting of 191 lbs., for 13 min. This would result in 2093 lbs. released, and would result in a concentration of isobutylene above its LEL (2% in air) for a radius of 120 ft from the leak.  This radius would extend beyond the boundary of the plant by thirty feet on the West side of the plant. The only receptor in this endpoint boundary is a rail yard. The railroad does occasionally have employees working inside the boundary area.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Prevention Steps\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program includes but is not limited t"

Merisol Antioxidants LLC does not have an emergency response team for fire response, but all operations and maintenance employees are trained at the 24 hour technician level for hazardous material spills and clean-up. Merisol Antioxidants LLC personnel have been trained how to activate countermeasures and notify emergency response agencies.

Some of the planned changes to improve the safety of the isobutylene storage and transfer system are listed below.\n1.) Install high temperature shutdown switches on the isobutylene charge pumps.\n2.) Install high-pressure shutdown switches on the discharge of the isobutylene charge pumps.\n3.) Install interlocks between the perimeter flammable gas detectors, and the isobutylene storage tanks' discharge valves and charge pumps.\n4.) Install interlocks between the fire alarm and the isobutylene storage tanks' discharge valves and the charge pumps.\n5.) Install mass meters to compare amount of isobutylene leaving the storage tank to that entering the alkylation reactor; and interlock a maximum difference with discharge valves and charge pumps.  \n\n Merisol Antioxidants LLC has a continuous improvement philosophy in all safety and environment issues.\n"
