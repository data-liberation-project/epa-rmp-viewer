Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify potential hazards controls in place to manage these hazards, and recommend additional controls, as appropriate.\n \nThe Texaco Velma Gas Plant uses hazard and operability studies (HAZOP's) which are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. The team identifies and evaluates potential hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures. \n \nThe Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) team findings are forwarded to local management for resolution. Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team. The approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n \nThe facility periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.

This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n \nTraining\n \nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Texaco Velma Gas Plant has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in process operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. A performance review and written test specific to the facility operations is administered and must be successfully completed during this training period. After operators demonstrate adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they are allowed to work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years, or more frequently upon request. All training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify/demonstrate (e.g., via performance review, skills demonstration and written tests.) that the operator understood the training.]\n \nContractors\n \nThe Texaco Velma Gas Plant uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.

The following is a description of existing safety features applicable to prevention of accidental releases of regulated substances in the facility.\n \nUniversal Prevention Activities\n \nThe accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all RMP-covered processes at the Texaco Velma Gas Plant.  Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\n \nSpecialized Safety Features\n \nThe Texaco Velma Gas Plant has safety features on many units to help:\n(1) contain/control a release\n(2) quickly detect a release, and\n(3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release\n\nThe following types of safety features are used in the covered processes: \n \nRelease Detection\n 1. Hydrocarbon and hydrogen sulfide detectors with alarms\n \nRelease Containment/Control\n \n 1. Process relief valves that discharge to a flare to capture and incinerate episodic releases\n 2. Automated and manual valves to permit isolation of the process\n 3. Automated shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high  temperature)\n 4. Curbing or diking to contain liquid releases\n 5. Redundant equipment and instrumentation (e.g., uninterruptible power su"

This commitment is demonstrated by our efforts in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will evaluate the situation, take actions within the capabilities of the facility, and/or notify the necessary outside agencies\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Texaco Velma Gas Plant, located in Velma Oklahoma, U.S.A., operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products (e.g., Y grade mixture) from natural gas. The Texaco Velma Gas Plant has regulated flammables, including: \nPropane\nButane\nIsoPentane\nPentane\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with a release of flammable substance(s) at the Texaco Velma Gas Plant is a vapor cloud explosion involving 290,000 pounds of a flammable mixture contained in a single vessel. The entire inventory is assumed to release and ignite, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion. Since this facility is located in a populated area, the WCS could affect offsite endpoints and nearby public receptors.  Although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for passive mitigation measures was taken into account in"

      "SummaryText": "evaluating this WCS.\n\nThe alternative release scenario (ARS) for flammable substances at the Texaco Velma Gas Plant is a vapor cloud explosion resulting from the release of a flammable mixture from transfer piping (60,000 pounds released in 15 minutes). The release is expected to be isolated by plant operations personnel within 15 minutes. Since this facility is located in a populated area, the ARS could affect offsite endpoints and nearby public receptors. This event was selected to as being a practical scenario for use in emergency planning and action.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM \n \nFollowing is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Texaco Velma Gas Plant. Because processes at the facility that are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) risk management program (RMP) regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n \nEmployee Participation\n \nThe Texaco Velma Gas Plant encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the facility and addresses each accident prevention program element.  In addition, the facility has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and employee safety issues.  These initiatives include forming teams to promote both process and personal safety.  The"

      "SummaryText": "teams typically have members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and plant management.\n \nProcess Safety Information\n \nThe Texaco Velma Gas Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. The Safety, Health and Environmental Representative is assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information. A table summarizing the reference documents and their location is readily available as part of the written employee participation plan to help employees locate any necessary process safety information.\n \nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs. For specific process areas, the facility has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in an operators procedures manual. The facility maintains the process within these limits by using process controls and monitoring instruments, trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n \nThe facility also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment. This information, in combination with procedures and equipment operating history, provides a basis for inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes so safety features in the process are not compromised.\n \nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n \nThe Texaco Velma Gas Plant has a comprehensive program to identify and"
