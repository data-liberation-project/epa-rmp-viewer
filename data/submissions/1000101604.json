The procedures describe the manner of response to a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released. The procedures address notification of local emergency response agencies if a release occurs. Employees receive training in emergency procedures.\n\nThe overall emergency procedure program for the Rocklin Terminal is coordinated with the Placer County Emergency Management Program. This coordination involves periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials and industry representatives. The Rocklin Terminal has around the clock communications capability with appropriate Emergency Management Program officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., Placer County Fire). This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident. The facility's emergency response program is developed in accordance with Section 25503, Division 6.95 of the California Health and Safety Code, Hazardous Materials Business Plan requirements. \n\nThe emergency response program is updated in when necessary based on modifications made to the plant facilities.

The worst-case release scenario is the release of propane from a bank of six (6) storage bullets when filled to the greatest amount . The scenario assumes a complete release of 645,660 pounds of propane gas. The pressure wave (with an endpoint of 1 pound per square inch gauge over atmospheric pressure) would extend 0.7 miles (1.1 kilometers). The pressure wave could reach the residential neighborhood located to the southwest of the site as well as the Placer County government center located to the east of the site. There are no sensitive receptors within this blast zone. An estimated total of 1240 nearby residents could be impacted by a blast. \n\nALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO. The alternative release scenario based on the hazard review (or a more plausible potential incident) is a catastrophic release from a full-sized (10,000 gallon water capacity), tanker truck. This scenario assumes that the tanker leaks from the bottom mounted entry valve and that the entire contents of the truck are released to the atmosphere. The alternative release scenario would produce a pressure wave with an endpoint of 1 pound per square inch gauge over atmospheric pressure that would extend 0.2 miles (0.32 kilometers).
