Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Luverne Farmers Co-op Elevator in Karnak are strongly committed to employee, public, and\nenvironmental safety.  This commitment is an inherent part of our comprehensive accidental release\nprevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance,\nand employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement\nappropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If such a release does\noccur, our trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of\nthe release.  We also coordinate our response efforts with the Hannaford Fire Department, which\nprovides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n  2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities include support services for crop production.  We have anhydrous\nammonia stored in a 52-ton tank at our facility in Karnak (Figure 1).  The maximum amount stored\nis 52 tons (104,000 pounds) at the maximum fill capacity of 85%.\n\n  3. Worst Case Release and Alternative Release Scenarios\nWe utilized RMP PRO for the worst case and alternate case scenarios of the required offsite\nconsequence analysis for our facility.  The following details these scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario involves a catastrophic release of the entire contents of the\nanhydrous ammonia storage tank (104,000 pounds) in gaseous form over a 10-minute period.  At\nClass F atmospheric stability, 1.5 m/s wind speed, and urban topography, the maximum distance to\na toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L is 4.6 miles (Figure 2).

Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14\nmg/L of ammonia is 0.31 mile (Figure 3).  The estimated population within a 0.31-mile radius of the\nfacility is 12.\n\n  4. General Accidental Release Prevention Program\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the EPA's accidental release prevention\nrequirements as set forth in 40 CFR part 68.  The following sections briefly describe the elements\nof the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\nLuverne Farmers Co-op Elevator maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the\nchemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associated with all processes\n(Appendix D).\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are\nidentified and controlled effectively.  Any findings from the hazard analysis are addressed in a\ntimely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nLuverne Farmers Co-op Elevator maintains written operating procedures to ensure that activities\nwithin our covered processes are conducted safely.  These procedures address various modes of\noperation; the information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in\nthe processes (Appendix B).\n\nTraining\nLuverne Farmers Co-op Elevator has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that\nemployees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with\nthese processes.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nLuverne Farmers Co-op Elevator conducts documented maintenance checks on process equipment\nto ensure proper operation.  Maintenance checks are conducted by qualified personnel with previous\ntra"

Examples of process equipment that would receive maintenance\nchecks include:  pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency\nshutdown systems, controls, and pumps.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance\nchecks are corrected in a safe and timely manner (Appendix C).\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at Luverne Farmers Co-op Elevator to manage changes in process\nchemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or\nother employees whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly\nnotified of the modification and offered training to deal with it.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nLuverne Farmers Co-op Elevator routinely conducts pre-startup safety reviews related to new\nprocesses and modifications in established processes.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that\nconstruction, equipment, and operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior\nto placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nLuverne Farmers Co-op Elevator conducts compliance audits on a regular basis to determine whether\nthe plan's provisions, set out under the 40 CFR part 68, are being implemented.  Any non-\ncompliance issue discovered during the audit is promptly corrected.\n\nEmployee Participation\nLuverne Farmers Co-op Elevator truly believes that process safety management and accident\nprevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views\nconcerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees\nhave access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP,\nparticularly information resulting from process hazard analyses.\n\n  5.
