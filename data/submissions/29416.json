As part of this commitment, ARP has established a system to help ensure the safe operation of the processes at its facility.  One component of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the Alabama River Pulp and Alabama Pine Pulp mills that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR Part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements:  Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMPlan) describing the risk management program at ARP.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMPlan requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program implemented by ARP.\n\nARP's risk management program consists of three elements:\n1.  A hazard assessment to help understand (a) the potential offsite consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and (b) accidents that have occurred during the last five years associated with the use of substances regulated by the RMP rule (regulated substances) - see topics 1.3 and 1.5.\n2.  A prevention program to help maintain and safely operate the processes containing more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance (covered processes) - see topic 1.4.\n3.  An emergency response program to help respond to accidental releases of regulated substances from covered processes - see topic 1.7\nInformation further describing these elements is provided in this RMPlan.\n\nAlthough the risk management program at ARP helps provide assurance that the facility is maintained and operated in a safe manner, it is only one component of the safety program at the mill.  In fact, ARP has implemented a comprehensive safety program and established many levels of safeguards against release "

When a hazardous substance is used at the mill, the equipment is carefully designed, built, and operated to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release.  Industry and government standards are closely adhered to in the design, construction, and operation of the equipment.\n\nARP limits damage from a release, if such a release occurs.  ARP trains workers to respond to an accidental release, reducing the consequences of a release if it occurs.  In the event of an accidental release, the mill's fire department will work with local emergency responders to help ensure that injuries and environmental damage will be minimized.\n\nThe safety program at the mill consists of a number of elements, only some of which are required by the RMP rule.  This RMPlan is primarily intended to describe those parts of the safety program at ARP that are required by the RMP rule.\n\n1.1  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nARP is committed to the safety of employees and the public, and to the preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  The mill implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances.  These controls include training programs for personnel; programs to help ensure safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of processes in the mill; and programs to evaluate the hazards at ARP.\n\nIn the event of an accidental release, ARP controls and contains the release in a manner that will be safe for employees and will help prevent injury to the public or the environment.  The mill provides response training to its employees, designates an emergency response coordinator to oversee response activities, and coordinates response efforts with the local fire department.

In order to effectively implement these policies, ARP established a management system headed by the Environmental Manager to oversee RMP-related activities.\n\n1.2  Facility Information and Regulated Substances\n\nARP operates two bleached kraft pulp mills that employ approximately 540 full-time workers.  The two mill produce bleached kraft market pulp for sale to customers.  As part of this manufacturing process, ARP handles chlorine dioxide in sufficient quantities to be covered by the RMP rule.\n\n1.3  Offsite Consequence Analysis\n\nARP performed an offsite consequence analysis to estimate the potential for an accidental release of a regulated substance to affect the public or the environment.  The offsite consequence analysis consists of evaluating both worst-case release scenarios and alternative release scenarios.  ARP does not expect a worst-case release scenario to ever occur.  The alternative release scenario was selected to help the Monroe County Emergency Management Agency improve the community emergency response plan.  An alternative release scenario represents a release that (1) might occur at a facility like ARP and (2) would result in the greatest potential offsite consequences if the release occurred.  \n\nThe RMP rule includes specific requirements for the worst-case and alternative release scenarios that must be reported by ARP.  The rule requires one worst-case and one alternative release scenario for chlorine dioxide.  The worst-case release scenario for toxic substances is the rupture of a 147,000 gallon of aqueous chlorine dioxide solution at a concentration of 10.5 grams per liter.  This scenario would result in the release of 12,873 pounds of chlorine dioxide gas to the atmosphere.  The maximum distance to the toxic endpoint concentration is 24 miles.  The U. S. Census indicates that 42,900 people live within this distance from the mill.  Several public receptors are located within this dis"

Kelley State Park, is located within this distance from the mill.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for chlorine dioxide is a release from a chlorine dioxide transfer line to the bleach plant.  This scenario assumes that chlorine dioxide solution is spilled to the ground at a rate of 500 gallons per minute and requires 10 minutes before the transfer pump is deactivated.  The maximum distance to a toxic endpoint is 1.9 miles.  The U. S. Census indicates that 269 people live within this distance from the mill.  The Alabama River and several houses are located within this distance.  No environmental receptors are within this distance.\n\n1.4  Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nSince its inception in 1978, ARP has used a prevention program to help prevent accidental releases of hazardous substances.  Beginning in 1992, the mill formalized this prevention program for the Kraft Pulp Bleaching process to comply with the 14 elements of the OSHA process safety management (PSM) prevention programs for chlorine dioxide.  In 1996, the EPA's RMP rule established similar requirements for Program 3 processes.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of ARP's Program 3 prevention program that address the EPA's RMP rule accident prevention program requirements.\n\n1.4.1  Process Safety Information\n\nARP maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to help ensure safe operation of the mill processes.  These documents address (1) physical properties of hazardous substances handled at the mill, (2) operating parameters of the equipment, and (3) design basis and configuration of the equipment in the mill.  ARP ensures that this process safety information is available to all mill employees, the Monroe County Emergency Management Agency, and local emergency responders.\n\nMaterial safety data"

The MSDS for chlorine dioxide is available to mill operators and local emergency responders for ready reference.  \n\nThe engineering design documents include the operating parameters and the design basis and configuration of the equipment in each covered process.  The available information includes:\n- operating parameters\n- block flow or simplified process flow diagrams\n- process chemistry\n- maximum intended inventories\n- safe upper and lower limits for parameters such as temperature, pressure, or flow\n- consequences of deviation from established operating limits\n- design basis and configuration of equipment\n- piping and instrument diagrams, including materials of construction\n- electrical classification\n- safety systems\n- applicable design codes and standards\n- design basis for relief and ventilation systems\nWhen important information was not available from the design documents, it was developed through special projects.  Many of the operating parameters are included in the operating procedures to help with the safe operation of the process.  These documents are used (1) to train employees and contractors, (2) to perform process hazard analyses, and (3) to help maintain the equipment.\n\n1.4.2  Process Hazard Analysis\n\nARP performs and periodically updates process hazard analyses (PHAs) for the covered processes to help identify process hazards and generate recommendations that might improve the safe operation of the process.  A team composed of personnel with engineering and process operating experience and a leader with process hazard analysis experience is assembled to analyze the hazards of the process.

The operating procedures (1) are used to train employees, and (2) serve as reference guides for appropriate actions to take during both normal operations and process upsets.  Mill employees develop and maintain operating procedures that cover all phases of operations, including initial startup, normal operations, normal shutdown, emergency shutdown, startup following a turnaround or emergency shutdown, and temporary operations.\n\n1.4.4  Training\n\nARP trains workers to safely and effectively perform their assigned tasks.  The employee training program includes both initial and refresher training that covers (1) a general overview of the process, (2) the properties and hazards of the substances in the process, and (3) a detailed review of the process operating procedures and safe work practices.  Demonstrations and employee observations are used to verify that an employee understands the training material before the employee can resume work in the process.\n\n1.4.5.  Mechanical Integrity\n\nARP maintains the mechanical integrity of process equipment to help prevent equipment failures that could endanger workers, the public, or the environment.  The mechanical integrity program includes (1) an inspection and testing program to help identify equipment deterioration and damage before the equipment fails and (2) a quality assurance program to help ensure that new and replacement equipment meets the design standards required for service in mill processes.

Process changes that are determined to be a replacement in kind (e.g., replacing a valve with an identical valve) are allowed without completing a full management of change program.  All other changes must be confirmed through the full management of change program to help ensure that inadvertent consequences of process changes are prevented, safety consequences of changes are addressed, affected process safety information and procedures are updated, and affected employees \nare notified of the changes.\n\n1.4.7  Pre-startup Review\n\nARP performs a safety review of a new or modified process before the process is placed into service to help ensure that the process has been prepared to operate safely.  This review confirms that:\n- construction and equipment are in accordance with design specifications\n- adequate safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency procedures are in place\n- employee training has been completed\n- for a covered process, a PHA has been performed if the process is new or management of change requirements have been completed if an existing process has been modified\nA pre-startup review checklist is completed to document the review and to ensure that appropriate issues have been addressed.\n\n1.4.8  Compliance Audit\n\nThe mill audits covered processes to be certain that the prevention program is effectively addressing the safety issues of ARP's operations.
