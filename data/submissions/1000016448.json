      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION POLICIES\nIsland Equipment Company is located in Guam. The facility stores and distributed chlorine and sulfur dioxide and employs approximately 20 persons at this location. \nIsland Equipment Company has a long standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and safety.  Island Equipment Company's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substance.\n \nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\nA maximum of 27,920 lbs of sulfur dioxide and 27,920 lbs of chlorine are stored at the facility.  The substances are not used for any processes and no maintenance is performed on the cylinders while on site.\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY/OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\nWorst-Case Release Scenario Results Summary:\nScenario Description: Per the EPA Regulations, one worst-case release scenario has been defined for each of the covered substances.  The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment documentation.  \n\nAlternative Release Scenario Results Summary:\nScenario Description: Per the EPA Regulations, one alternative-case release scenario has been defined each of the covered substances.  The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment documentation.  \n\nRisk Considerations:\nAlthough the storage and distribution of chlorine and sulfur dioxide has inherent potential risks, and worst-case release scenarios can potentially reach the community; Island Equipment Company has recognized these potential risks and structured its safety programs to make the worst-case type of event non-credible.  In addition to the safety practices of the company and facility personnel to make this worst-case event non-credible, it should also be recognized that there are inherent analysis assumptions that make the results of the atmospheric dispersion analysis appear worse than what would actually be expected"

      "SummaryText": "during such an event (e.g., In the event of a release, sudden rupture and flashing of ammonia would be highly turbulent. Turbulence causes entrainment of air and the released vapor dilutes much more quickly than is shown in the model).\n\nThe history of Island Equipment Company (i.e., no RMP-applicable chlorine or sulfur dioxide releases in the last five years) reflects the adequacy of the design and diligence of the facility staff in safely storing chlorine and sulfur dioxide.\n \nRISK MANAGEMENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\nAs part of the implementation of the RMP Program 3, key Prevention Program elements were documented and implemented by Island Equipment Company to manage safety issues associated with the storage and distribution of chlorine and sulfur dioxide. Prevention Program 3 elements include:\n \n\u00c2\u00a768.65\tProcess Safety Information (PSI) \n\u00c2\u00a768.67\tProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\u00c2\u00a768.69          Operating Procedures (OP)\n\u00c2\u00a768.71\tTraining (TRN)\n\u00c2\u00a768.73\tMechanical Integrity (MI)\n\u00c2\u00a768.75\tManagement of Change (MOC)\n\u00c2\u00a768.77\tPre-Startup Review (PSSR)\n\u00c2\u00a768.79\tCompliance Audits (CA)\n\u00c2\u00a768.81\tIncident Investigation (II)\n\u00c2\u00a768.83\tEmployee Participation (EP)\n\u00c2\u00a768.85\tHot Work Permit (HWP)\n\u00c2\u00a768.87\tContractors (CO)\n\u00c2\u00a768.90\tEmergency Planning & Response (EP&R)\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThere have been no RMP-applicable releases of ammonia at the facility in at least the past five (5) years.  \n\nFLAMMABLES: WORST CASE\nThe use of flammable materials at Island Equipment Company facility is not encompassed by either the federal or state RMP requirements.  Therefore, this section is not applicable. \n\nFLAMMABLES: ALTERNATIVE RELEASE\nThe use of flammable materials at Island Equipment Company facility is not encompassed by either the federal or state RMP requirements.  Therefore, this section is not applicable.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nIsland Equipment Company is extremely diligent in the handling of chlorine and sulfur dioxide. Planned changes to improve safety are listed as recommenda"
