According to DEGADIS modeling, this release (distance to point of dispertion to 200 PPM) would have off site  impact.  It should be noted that Shuter Sunset Farms, Inc. has never had a release of this type from our facility.\r\n\r\nALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO.\r\n\r\nThe most common alternative release scenario(s) from our facility would not reach an end-point off site.  The alternative release scenario modeled for the purpose of this plan is a 2-minute release from a stationary storage tank representing a valve and hose failure requiring a manual shut down.  The total amount of anhydrous ammonia released in the scenario would be 11,908 pounds.  This release scenario (distance to point of dispersion to 200 PPM) would have off site impact.  It should be noted that Shuter Sunset Farms, Inc. has not had a release of this type from our facility.\r\n\r\nTHE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREFENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC STEPS.\r\n\r\nThe ammonia system is designed, installed and is maintained in accordance with ASTM standards and the ASME codes.  This facility complies with the ANSI K61.6 standards (1969), EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule as well as all applicable federal, state and local codes and regulations.\r\n\r\nOur ammonia system is protected from major releases by internal excess flow valves, check valves, relief valves and manual shutoffs.  The load-out risers used for the purpose of filling the nurse tanks are protected by excess flow valves to immediately stop the flow of ammonia if a line or a hose fails.  All of the main storage tank valves and the riser load valves are locked when not in use.\r\n\r\nOur ammonia system is inspected on a regular basis with maintenance and preventive maintenance scheduled and documented.
