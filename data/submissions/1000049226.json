Shuter Sunset Farms' mission states \"To provide for the safety of our employee and the general public\".\n\nIn order to fulfill this mission, Shuter Sunset Farms, Inc. has a person with responsiblity to administer the comprehensive safety and environmental programs and procedures.\n\n\n\nThis facility maintains 4- 1,500-gallon nurse tanks for farm use.  Our combined storage capacity in nurse tanks is 21,015 pounds.  Anhydrous Ammonia is stored in one stationary storage tank {1@ 18,000 gallon}, on site.  84,060 pounds of anhydrous ammonia is the maximum storage capacity of stationary storage tanks.  Therefore, the total facility anhydrous ammonia storage capacity for our facility is 111, 075. The largest single storage vessel at our facility contains 84,060 pounds.\n\n\n\nTHE WORST CASE SCENARIO.\n\n\n\nOur worst case scenario is the loss of the total contents of the 18,000 gallon storage tank, when"

According to DEGADIS modeling, this release (distance to point of dispertion to 200 PPM) would have off site  impact.  It should be noted that Shuter Sunset Farms, Inc. has never had a release of this type from our facility.\n\n\n\nALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO.\n\n\n\nThe most common alternative release scenario(s) from our facility would not reach an end-point off site.  The alternative release scenario modeled for the purpose of this plan is a 2-minute release from a stationary storage tank representing a valve and hose failure requiring a manual shut down.  The total amount of anhydrous ammonia released in the scenario would be 11,908 pounds.  This release scenario (distance to point of dispersion to 200 PPM) would have off site impact.  It should be noted that Shuter Sunset Farms, Inc. has not had a release of this type from our facility.\n\n\n\nTHE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREFENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC STEPS.\n\n\n\nThe ammonia system is designed, installed and is maintained in accordance with ASTM standards and the ASME codes.  This facility complies with the ANSI K61.6 standards (1969), EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule as well as all applicable federal, state and local codes and regulations.\n\n\n\nOur ammonia system is protected from major releases by internal excess flow valves, check valves, relief valves and manual shutoffs.  The load-out risers used for the purpose of filling the nurse tanks are protected by excess flow valves to immediately stop the flow of ammonia if a line or a hose fails.  All of the main storage tank valves and the riser load valves are locked when not in use.\n\n\n\nOur ammonia system is inspected on a regular basis with maintenance and preventive maintenance scheduled and documented.

Anhydrous Ammonia is received by truck, is handled and stored onsite and is a regulated substance by the EPA requiring us to comply with the Risk Management Program.  We haul ammonia to our fields in 1,500 gallon nurse tanks.  We apply the ammonia into the soil as a source of nitrogen fertilizer for growing agriculture crops.\n\n\n\nTraining is provided for all employees at least annually, whenever there is a change in process or whaterver competency with the regulations is questioned.

In preparation for this, we have coordinated with all the local response agencies by providing information and facility tours to ensure that they are familiar with and property prepared for and incident at our facility.  This will help to ensure that our community has the strategy for responding to and mitigating the threat posed by an ammonia release.
