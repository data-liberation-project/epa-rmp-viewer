      "SummaryText": "The Citizens Utilities Water Company of Pennsylvania Home Treatment Facility handles up to 3 - 1 Ton chlorine cylinders.  Emergency Response and Accidental Release Prevention Policies have been instituted to include:  operation and maintenance procedures, training of employees, incident investigation, notification procedures in the event of a chlorine release, PPE for trained employees, on-site and off-site emergency response plans and procedures for notifying the local emergency planning committee in the event their response is necessary.\n\nThe facility has had no accidents resulting in on-site or off-site releases.\n\nTwo scenarios for off-site consequences have been completed.  The Worst-case scenario describes the release of an entire 1 - Ton cylinder in a 10 minute period or 200 pounds per minute.  Since the cylinder is housed within a building, the release rate has been reduced to 110 pounds per minute.  Atmospheric conditions utilized for the scenario include a wind speed of 1.5 meters per sc=econd and an atmospheric stability class of F.  Under these conditions, the distance to the toxic endpoint was 2.2 miles.\n\nTeh alternate-release scenario was based on a chlorine container isolation valve failure.  This is the most common malody that results in an accidental release of chlorine gas.  A release rate of 0.2 pounds per minute was modeled, along with a wind speed of 3.0 meters per second and an atmospheric stability class of D.  Public off-site impacts were noted from this scenario.\n\nAn on-site Emergency Response Program and other safety information have been developed.  This program has been integrated with the Hazardous Materials Off-Site Emergency Response Plan.\n\nThis Risk Management Program will be updated as necessary based on changes in facility processes, if they occur.  The program will undergo review at least every 5 years if no changes occur."
