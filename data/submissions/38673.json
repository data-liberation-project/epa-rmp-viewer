      "SummaryText": "Chlorine is the most commonly used substance for disinfecting drinking water.  The addition of chlorine or chlorine compounds to water is called chlorination.  Chlorination is considered to be the most important process for preventing the spread of waterborne disease in drinking water.  The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (DWP) also uses chlorine for drinking water disinfection purposes to protect public health per state and federal water quality standards.  Storing and handling large quantities of chlorine can create hazardous situations.  DWP takes safety obligations in storing and using chlorine as seriously as it takes providing safe drinking water.  The DWP De Soto Chlorination Station chlorine handling process is subject to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program and Plan and also to the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program.  The facilities subject to the EPA and CalARP regulations are required to prepare and update Risk Management Plans (RMPs).  The RMP is to include policies and procedures followed to safely operate the facility and the actions which will be taken by the facility in an event of an emergency.  DWP prepared and submitted the RMP for the Desoto facility in June 1999.  This RMP is the five year update of the June 1999 RMP.  The following information is specifically required in the RMP Update Executive Summary: \n\n* Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies.\n* General facility and regulated substances information.\n* Summary of the accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps.\n* Five-year accident history summary.\n* Emergency response program summary.\n* Planned changes to improve safety.\n\nThe above information for the De Soto Chlorination Station is provided below.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe DWP accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates the use of proven te"

The maximum quantity of chlorine present at the De Soto Chlorination Station at any given time exceeds the listed threshold quantities in the EPA and CalARP rules.  It also exceeds the listed threshold quantities in the federal and California Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Standards. However, the facility is normally unmanned and water treatment operators visit the facility three times a week (when the chlorine facility is under operation) and respond to any trouble alarms which may occur.  Thus, the DWP De Soto facility is not subject to federal or California OSHA PSM regulations.\n\nA maximum of two chlorine containers is present at any given time at the chlorination station.  Both ton containers rest on load cell scales, which allows the operators to monitor the chlorine weight remaining in the container.  Chlorine gas is withdrawn from the ton container through a vacuum regulating valve, which is installed directly on the container angle valve.  Chlorine gas is pulled under vacuum from the vacuum regulating valve through plastic tubing and the chlorine header lines to one of the two chlorinators provided at the chlorination station. In case of rupture of the plastic tubing connecting the container to the header lines, air would be drawn in rather than chlorine being released, and the vacuum regulator would shut down the chlorine supply at the container angle valve, operating as a shut-off valve.  From the chlorinator, chlorine gas is pulled by vacuum to an injection vault downhill from the station, where it is dissolved into mixing water to form a concentrated solution.  This solution is then piped into the distribution water through a diffuser.  A residual chlorine analyzer monitors residual chlorine in the pipeline downstream from the diffusers and provide"

The De Soto Chlorination Station has prepared an Emergency Response Plan for Hazardous Materials to facilitate coordination and emergency planning with offsite response officials and facilities in the event of an emergency.  The emergency response plan has been coordinated with local response agencies (City of Los Angeles Fire Department).  The De Soto Chlorination Station has an excellent record in preventing accidents from occurring.\n\nGeneral Facility and Regulated Substance Information\n\nThe De Soto Chlorination Station is located at 11200 De Soto Avenue, Chatsworth, California.  The facility is located just south of the Simi Valley-San Fernando Valley Freeway, and north of Rinaldi Street, next to the De Soto Reservoir.  This facility has been installed to disinfect the flow in the De Soto Trunk Line and serves the Chatsworth and San Fernando Valley area. The station includes a chlorination room, which contains chlorine containers, two chlorinators, a chlorine detector, and various safety equipment, and an instrument room, which contains a flow recorder, various electrical panels, a UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply) and additional safety equipment.

The hazard review was further reviewed in April 1999.  In March 2004, a hazard review was again performed for the whole chlorination system and will be updated again within a five-year period or whenever there is major change in the process.

      "SummaryText": "Procedures for informing the public and local emergency response agencies about accidental releases.\n* Documentation of proper first aid and emergency medical treatment necessary to treat accidental human exposures and the detailed information on emergency health care.\n* Procedures and measures for emergency response after an accidental release.\n\n(b) Procedures for the use of emergency response equipment and for its inspection, testing, and maintenance. \n\n(c) Training in relevant procedures for all employees involved with the chlorination process.\n\n(d) Procedures to review and update, as appropriate, the emergency response plan to reflect changes and ensure that employees are informed of changes.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nAs part of the preparation of the Risk Management Program, a hazard review was performed in April 1999 for the chlorination system.  The hazard review was performed using the Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) technique and covered both equipment and procedures used for the chlorine handling system.  A number of equipment and procedural changes were made as part of the implementation of the recommended actions.  All the above recommendations have been evaluated and implemented by the DWP.  Additional 15 changes to further improve chlorine safety were identified in March 2004, when the hazard review was completed for the facility.  It is expected that these recommendations will be evaluated by December 2004.  The implementation of these recommendations will further improve the safety of the chlorine system."
