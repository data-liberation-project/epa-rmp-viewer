      "SummaryText": "GENERAL DESCRIPTION\n\nThe disinfection process in use at the Elmhurst Wastewater Treatment Plant involves a train of six one-ton cylinders split into two headers that are connected by a single pipe to a chlorine injection diffuser.  The two trains of three-one ton cylinders are connected to a header via capillary lines that are individually valved and can be removed from service one at a time.  The two three-tank headers connect to a single line with a pressure induced transfer switch.  If pressure is low on the tank side, the transfer switch will move to the higher pressure system.  This transfer switch is also a backflow prevention valve.  If a header that is not in use ruptures, gas from the in-use header cannot escape.  This minimizes the numbers of tanks which may be venting to atmosphere in the event of a header rupture.\n\nWhen a transfer occurs due to on line tanks becomming empty, an alarm signals plant staff that the valve has activated.  If the alarmactivates at an unexpected time or interval, staff are notified and can investigate the situation.  Likewise, if a low pressure condition is found in the system, an alarm alerts staff to this condition.  If this occurs at a time that is unexpected or too frequent an interval, staff will respond to it as well.\n\nThe process room is equipped with a leak monitor that will alert staff in the event of excessive chlorine gas being present in either the storage or injection rooms.  \n\nThe chlorine injection system is a vacuum operated system meaning that in the loss of a vacuum diaphragms close which prevent the leak of gas to atmosphere.  If a rupture occurs on the feedline to the injector or if a rupture occurs on the line from the chlorinator itself, only minimal gas will escape to the room.  The entire system is designed to operate with a vacuum source.  If the vacuum source is interrupted, gas flow stops.\n\nThe entire process is in active use from May 1 to October 30 each year.  From November 1 to April 30, the system"

These tanks are replacements for empties and are not connected to the header in anyway.  Valves are closed and cover plates are installed to protect the valves from any accidental damage.  \n\nThe entire building is dedicated to a single use without unusual traffic or other applications.  The only time the building is in use or is occupied is when the chlorine system is being maintained or tanks are being changed.\n\nRESPERATOR TRAINING\n\nPURPOSE\n\nTo provide training in the use and care of the Division respirator gear.\n\nSELECTION AND USE\n\nThe Division is equipped with three types of respirators:  A:  a SCBA equipped with the pressure demand type regulator which is to be used in emergency situations where mobility is needed.  The specific Division situations are CONFINED SPACE uses and CHLORINE (C12) or SULFUR DIOXIDE (SO2) leaks at the wastewater plant.  B:\nthe five minute escape bottle with the full enclosure head bag and pressure demand type regulator to be used while in a confined space when the atmosphere goes from safe to unsafe.  C:  the supplied air/hip pack system supplied with the pressure demand regulator.  This system is to be used while working on C12 or SO2 tank changes at the WWTP.\n\nINSTRUCTION\n\nAnnual training exercises shall be conducted with all Division staff.

Since this is impossible while wearing corrective lenses, they will have to be removed while wearing the face mask.  A proper fit is also impossible if the user has sideburns or beard growth.

Before using, inspect the mask for signs of wear, cracking, scratched face plate, check the face seal for any sign of deterioration.  Check the straps for tears or weakness.  Check hoses and fittings as well as tank straps and supports.  Reports any signs of damage to your supervisor.

The plant site is bordered on the north side by Salt Creek Sanitary District, the east side by Salt Creek and a residential area, the south side by business and commercial properties and the west side by Route 83 and a residential area.  See Appendix 4 for site layout.\n\nBased on a hazard analysis, an Emergency Planning Zone (EPZ) has been established for the facility that extends from the facility to a distance of one-half mile.  The size of this EPZ is based on the worst chemical at the facility.  Specifically this EPZ is bounded on the north by Albert Street & the railroad tracks, the east by Hillside Avenue, the south by Washington Street and Wilson Street, and the west by Villa Avenue.\n\nGeneral Description of off-Site Land Use\n\nThe area located within the EPZ is primarily residential.  There is, however, 20 structures with a special population that will require attention in the event of a release.  These facilities are listed on Pages Two and Three.\n\n      Likely Transportation Routes to and From the Facility\n\nThe Elmhurst Wastewater Treatment Plant is served by the following transportation route:\nRoute 83\n\nIt is over this route that the potential for a transportation accident is the greatest.\n\n\n    Major Chemical Concerns\n\nThe facility has indicated that it stores, handles, or manufactures the following extremely hazardous chemicals in excess of the EPA designated threshold planning quantity.  These chemicals along with their potential hazards are listed below:\n\nChlorine - Chlorine gas may cause severe irritation of the eyes,nose, and respiratory tract with tearing, and runny nose, sneezing, coughing, choking, and chest pain. Severe breathing difficulties may occur, which may be delayed in onset. Pneumonia may result. In high concentrations chlorine may irritate the skin and cause sensations of burning and prickling, inflammation, and blister formation.  Any contact with liquid chlori"

Corrosion of the teeth, skin irritation, and reduced respiratory capacity may result from repeated or prolonged exposure.\n\nSulfur Dioxide - It may cause death or permanent injury after very short exposure to small quantities. 1,000 ppm causes death in from 10 minutes to several hours by respiratory depression.  It is an eye and respiratory tract irritant, Persons with asthma, subnormal pulmonary functions or cardiovascular disease are at a greater risk.\n\nDETECTION, NOTIFICATION, AND WARNING SYSTEM\n\nIf the incident involves the potential or actual release into the environment of a CERCLA/SARA designated hazardous material, in excess of the reportable quantity, then the Facility Emergency Coordinator, or his designee, will classify the incident and then notify, via telephone, the local Fire Department, Local Emergency Coordinator, and the State Emergency Response Commission.  A call to 9-1-1 will satisfy the requirement of notifying the jurisdiction's Fire Department, The numbers for these notifications are shown on the front page of this document.\n\nVerbal notification of these agencies will be accomplished using the Chemical Accident Reporting System (CARS) form, The CARS Form, and instructions for its use are shown in Appendix 5. The use of this form will ensure that all parties involved in the emergency transmit and receive information in a uniform format that is easily understandable.\n\nWhen a chemical release occurs at the facility, plant management and employees are alerted of the problem through an alarm system consisting of flashing lights and alarms.  Gas sensors, located in the chlorine storage room, are tied to an alarm system in the control room.  If an alarm sounds, the facility operator alerts on-site personnel and provides notification of the community by calling 9-1-1.  The 9-1-1 operator, at DuComm, will notify the Elmhurst Police and Fire Departments, the Villa Pa"

Additionally radio station WDCB-FM (90.9) will be utilized as the Emergency Broadcast      System (EBS) station for the DuPage County area, This station will be used to transmit news and official instructions from local levels of government to the general public.  Activation of this system will be accomplished through the DuPage County Office of Emergency Management.\n\nACCIDENT CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM\n\nResponse to a fixed-site hazardous materials incident will be accomplished in a manner that is consistent with the severity of the incident.  Therefore an accident classification system has been established.
