      "SummaryText": "INTRODUCTION\nPL Propylene purchased ExxonMobil's Houston Olefins Plant and is in the final stages of converting it into an on-purpose propylene plant in Houston, TX.  The plant will convert propane into propylene and be the largest propane dehydrogenation plant in the world.  Located on the Houston Ship Channel, the plant will be in close proximity to one third of the U.S. propylene consumption and the largest global exchange point of propylene.\n\nRISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM\nAs a result of federal requirements, 40 CFR Part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Program (ARPP), PL Propylene is required to develop and implement a Risk Management Program (RMP) due to the quantities of propane, propylene, and ammonia that are consumed or manufactured in the propylene production. In developing its RMP, PL Propylene has conducted an analysis of potential offsite consequences of an accidental release including a worst-case and alternative case release scenario.  The facility is currently completing its construction and will be operational starting September, 2010.\n\nPREVENTION PROGRAMS\nThe PL Propylene facility has a number of prevention programs to ensure the safety of its workers and the community it operates in:\nA?Work Permit Safety Procedures -- Cold Work, Hot Work, Line Breaking, Confined Space Entry and Soil Excavation / Penetration.  Each procedure contains a requirement for periodic field audits to verify the practice in the field meets procedure requirements.  Each procedure has a review cycle.\n\nA?Incident Reporting / Investigation -- The site has a process for reporting all incidents.  Incidents are reviewed with staff and supervisors daily.  Root cause investigations are conducted for significant incidents (i.e. OSHA recordable injury, mechanical failures resulting in equipment damage or possible loss of containment of process materials/chemicals) and significant near miss incidents to prevent the incident from reoccurring.\n\nA?Training -- Training processes are in place to"

      "SummaryText": " ensure operations personnel are adequately trained and qualified / certified for the jobs they perform.  Periodic refresher training is required.  Maintenance of certifications is required.  \n\nA?Inspection -- The plant has a Facilities Inspection / Housekeeping Safety Procedure.  The procedure contains checklists for various areas, i.e. Process and Storage Areas, Maintenance Shops, Roads and Grounds, Laboratory, Control room and Offices.  Representatives from each functional group are required to participate in the inspections.  Action items / findings are tracked to completion.\n\nA?Management of Change -- The plant has a robust MOC process.  Any change to a process, equipment, piping, staffing, training, etc is managed through the MOC process.  The plant uses a document / information management system (MockingBird) to control the MOC documentation, approval, and change implementation process.  \n\nA?Safety Policy -- The plant has a Safety Policy whereby the management states their commitment to providing a safe and healthy workplace.  The safety policy also defines the responsibilities of supervisors, company employees and contractors regarding safety performance, behaviors, non-compliance consequences.\n\nA?Accident Prevention Program -- The plant has an accident prevention program.  The program establishes responsibilities for accident prevention through fundamental Health & Safety Management. The program defines responsibilities of supervisors, company employees and the Health and Safety Staff.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE\nEmergency response plans are in place to outline actions to take should an accidental release occur.  The emergency response activities are in coordination with the Greater Houston Local Emergency Planning Committee.\n\nCOMMITMENT TO SAFETY AND OUR COMMUNITY\nPL Propylene is an active member of the Houston Community Advisory Panel (HCAP).  The HCAP is comprised of community residents, business people, teachers, etc.  The HCAP meets monthly and participating i"
