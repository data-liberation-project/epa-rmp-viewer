However, should a release occur, plant personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\nDescription of Stationary Sources and Regulated Substances:\nThe Lake Erling plant is located in a remote area south and east of Bradley, Arkansas, about three (3) miles east of Arkansas State Highway 29.  The nearest public receptor is more than two (2) miles from the facility.  The plant processes about 5 MMSCFD of natural gas and provides a service and produces a mixed hydrocarbon product.  The gas is dehydrated and hydrocarbons, which might otherwise condense in the gas injection well and in the transmission pipeline, are removed.  Natural gas flows from the producing wells into the plant where it is dehydrated and processed utilizing a propane refrigeration process. The hydrocarbons removed by the plant are stored in a 30,000 gallon, pressurized tank.  The product is hauled from the plant site by transport trucks. The dry processed gas is either re-injected into the producing formation for pressure maintenance or is sold into a transmission pipeline.  No threshold quantity of a regulated toxic substance is present at the plant site.\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results:\nThe WCS is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) involving the full capacity of the product storage tank, 123,000 pounds.  Although a written procedure is in place to limit the inventory to 90% of capacity, the entire tank capacity was used in this scenario.  EPA's RMP*COMP software was used to determine the maximum distance to a 1 psi endpoint was 0.4 miles.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program:\nThis facility was built in accordance with the appropriate mechanical and electrical codes for gas processing plants and is "

Employees are well trained and well informed of the operation and safety precautions needed to keep this facility a safe operation to both the employees and the general public.  Daily checks of the plant and the proper functioning of all equipment has resulted in no injuries and no releases since the facility was started up in August 1993.\n\nFive Year Accident History:\nThere have been no injuries or releases during the past five (5) years.\n\nEmergency Response Plan:\nLafayette County OES office is the plant's contact in case of an emergency.  The appropriate phone numbers are posted at the plant and employees have been instructed on notification procedures in case of an emergency.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\nNo changes are planned.  The plant has a perfect safety record and will continue with the current program."
