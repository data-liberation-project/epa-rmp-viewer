California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program - Title 19 CCR, Chapter 4.5\n\n?    Federal EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) - Title 40 CFR ?68\n\n?    California Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 8 CCR ?5189\n\n?    Federal Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 29 CFR ?1910.119\n\n\n\nHereafter this program will be referred to as the RMP-PSM program.\n\n\n\nThis program is intended to be a \"living document\". As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible and updated as necessary. To accomplish this, Community Renewable Energy Services has elected to use PSMWriter&copy;, software developed and distributed by Resource Compliance, Inc. This software will assist us with updating, maintaining, scheduling, and tracking RMP-PSM related activities. \n\n\n\n1.1    COMMUNITY RENEWABLE ENERGY SERVICES, RISK & PROCESS SAFETY MANAGEMENT PROGRAM \n\n\n\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that Community Renewable Energy Services has updated/developed their unified RMP-PSM Program. This program has been prepared to address the risks involved in operating and maintaining the following processes which have the presence of hazardous chemicals above threshold quantities: \n\n\n\n\n\nAmmonia    | Anhydrous Ammonia | 20,000\n\n\n\nOur RMP-PSM program promotes overall plant, worker, and public safety. The program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of hazardous chemicals. Overall, the program is designed to prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.\n\n\n\nCommunity Renewable Energy Services has an exemplary safety record, one that we are quite proud of. Our company has many policies and procedures in place to promote overall plant, worker and public safety. We have: \n\n\n\n1.    Prepa"

Organized the program so that it meshes closely with general Community Renewable Energy Services business practices\n\n3.    Utilized PSMWriter&copy; software to ensure that all necessary Community Renewable Energy Services employees have access to relevant information (SOPs, PHAs, audits, etc.)\n\n\n\nThe RMP-PSM program sets forth rules, procedures and practices that will help our employees protect themselves and our neighbors.\n\n\n\n1.2    PROCESS DESCRIPTION\n\n\n\nCommunity Renewable Energy Services has an ammonia system which functions to remove NOx, SOx chlorides, and sulfur from the flue gas.  This is done by routing the flue gas through a shower of water controlled to a specific pH level.  The scrubber water pH is controlled by adding sorbent material (ammonia) preferably, additional ammonia to the scrubber water.   The flue gas is naturally acidic due to chlorides and sulfurs in the fuel, and so the scrubber water will tend to become acidic if no additional ammonia is added.  The amount of ammonia required to maintain a pH will vary depending on fuel quality and use of ammonia in the NOx controller.  A lower pH will be more likely to capture ammonia; a higher pH will be more likely to capture chlorides and sulfurs.  Community Renewable Energy Services' scrubber will operate in the 5-6.5 pH range.\n\n\n\n1.3    GENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE & CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\n1.3.1    GENERAL \n\n\n\nWe inform our employees engaged in process operations of the dangers of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia in annual safety meetings. During these meeting we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\n\n\n\nCommunity Renewable Energy Services has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the ammonia process. These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental rele"

The results of the analyses are reported in the body of the program. \n\n\n\n1.3.2    ANHYDROUS AMMONIA\n\n\n\nThe ammonia process at the Community Renewable Energy Services facility is an integral part of the overall business and operates most of the year. It is extremely important that this process is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner. Management is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.\n\n\n\n1.4    FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nCommunity Renewable Energy Services has had no accidental release within the last five (5) years.\n\n\n\n1.5    EMERGENCY ACTION AND RESPONSE PLAN\n\n\n\nCommunity Renewable Energy Services' emergency action and response program has been developed to satisfy the following requirements:\n\n\n\n?    California \"Emergency Action Plan\" - Title 8 CCR ?3220\n\n?    Federal \"Emergency Action Plan\" - Title 29 CFR ?1910.38 \n\n?    California \"Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response\" (HAZWOPER) - Title 8 CCR Title 8 ?5192(q)\n\n?    Federal \"Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response\" (HAZWOPER) - Title 29 CFR ?1910.120(q)\n\n\n\nStrategically, we will respond \"minimally\" to a release. Under this plan we will call emergency personnel and evacuate the facility. All response activities would be done in coordination with the Local Fire Department and their Hazardous Materials Response Team. \n\n\n\nEvery year we review with our employees our evacuation procedures in the event of an emergency, including a hazardous chemical release.\n\n\n\n1.6    PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nOur company has an outstanding safety record, one that we are quite proud of. Many policies and procedures have been implemented to promote overall plant, worker and public safety. Nevertheless, Community Renewable Energy \n\nServices continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.\n\n\n\nBy utilizing PSMWriter&copy; software, all necessary employees have access to every aspect of the RMP-PSM program.

In addition, PSMWriter&copy; tracks all RMP-PSM related events so that Community Renewable Energy Services' management team can ensure that the RMP-PSM program is being implemented.\n\n\n\nCommunity Renewable Energy Services has implemented all aspects of the RMP-PSM program. When a RMP-PSM program requirement is completed (i.e. mechanical integrity inspection, process hazard analysis, compliance audit, etc.) any specific action items related to that event are entered into PSMWriter&copy;, assigned a responsible person, and given a due date. Once the action item has been completed, the resolution can be documented using PSMWriter&copy; as well. A list of current or past due action items can be accessed at any time by those with access to PSMWriter&copy;.\n\n\n\nIn addition to utilizing PSMWriter&copy; to create, schedule, track, and document events, Community Renewable Energy Services has also entered into a contract with California Controlled Atmosphere to obtain help with RMP-PSM program implementation. A copy of California Controlled Atmosphere's service agreement has been included in this program with the support material.\n\n\n\nFor the future, Community Renewable Energy Services now thinks of the RMP-PSM program as a \"living document\". It is an interactive framework that guides safe action for Community Renewable Energy Services employees, but allows for feedback and continual improvement. Through the RMP-PSM program Community Renewable Energy Services will continue to maintain overall plant worker and public safety. \n\n"
