As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible and updated as necessary. To accomplish this, Community Renewable Energy Services has elected to use PSMWriter&copy;, software developed and distributed by Resource Compliance, Inc. This software will assist us with updating, maintaining, scheduling, and tracking RMP-PSM related activities. \r\n\r\n1.1\tCOMMUNITY RENEWABLE ENERGY SERVICES, RISK & PROCESS SAFETY MANAGEMENT PROGRAM \r\n\r\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that Community Renewable Energy Services has updated/developed their unified RMP-PSM Program. This program has been prepared to address the risks involved in operating and maintaining the following processes which have the presence of hazardous chemicals above threshold quantities: \r\n\r\n\r\nAmmonia\t| Anhydrous Ammonia | 20,000\r\n\r\nOur RMP-PSM program promotes overall plant, worker, and public safety. The program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of hazardous chemicals. Overall, the program is designed to prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.\r\n\r\nCommunity Renewable Energy Services has an exemplary safety record, one that we are quite proud of. Our company has many policies and procedures in place to promote overall plant, worker and public safety. We have: \r\n\r\n1.\tPrepa"

This is done by routing the flue gas through a shower of water controlled to a specific pH level.  The scrubber water pH is controlled by adding sorbent material (ammonia) preferably, additional ammonia to the scrubber water.   The flue gas is naturally acidic due to chlorides and sulfurs in the fuel, and so the scrubber water will tend to become acidic if no additional ammonia is added.  The amount of ammonia required to maintain a pH will vary depending on fuel quality and use of ammonia in the NOx controller.  A lower pH will be more likely to capture ammonia; a higher pH will be more likely to capture chlorides and sulfurs.  Community Renewable Energy Services' scrubber will operate in the 5-6.5 pH range.\r\n\r\n1.3\tGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE & CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\n1.3.1\tGENERAL \r\n\r\nWe inform our employees engaged in process operations of the dangers of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia in annual safety meetings. During these meeting we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\r\n\r\nCommunity Renewable Energy Services has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the ammonia process. These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental rele"

The results of the analyses are reported in the body of the program. \r\n\r\n1.3.2\tANHYDROUS AMMONIA\r\n\r\nThe ammonia process at the Community Renewable Energy Services facility is an integral part of the overall business and operates most of the year. It is extremely important that this process is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner. Management is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.\r\n\r\n1.4\tFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nCommunity Renewable Energy Services has had no accidental release within the last five (5) years.\r\n\r\n1.5\tEMERGENCY ACTION AND RESPONSE PLAN\r\n\r\nCommunity Renewable Energy Services' emergency action and response program has been developed to satisfy the following requirements:\r\n\r\n\u00bf\tCalifornia Emergency Action Plan - Title 8 CCR \u00a73220\r\n\u00bf\tFederal Emergency Action Plan - Title 29 CFR \u00a71910.38 \r\n\u00bf\tCalifornia Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response (HAZWOPER) - Title 8 CCR Title 8 \u00a75192(q)\r\n\u00bf\tFederal Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response (HAZWOPER) - Title 29 CFR \u00a71910.120(q)\r\n\r\nStrategically, we will respond minimally to a release. Under this plan we will call emergency personnel and evacuate the facility. All response activities would be done in coordination with the Local Fire Department and their Hazardous Materials Response Team. \r\n\r\nEvery year we review with our employees our evacuation procedures in the event of an emergency, including a hazardous chemical release.\r\n\r\n1.6\tPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nOur company has an outstanding safety record, one that we are quite proud of.
