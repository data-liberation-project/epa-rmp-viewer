The Facility Policy\n\nThe owners, management and employees of Tallahatchie Farmers Supply, Inc. are committed to prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other aurtorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.  The Facility Information \n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage of fertilizers for sale to farmers.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application by farmers.\n\nThe maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia stored on site would be 288,915 pounds; 131,325 pounds in 1 -  30,000 gallon  storage tank and 157,590 pounds in 6 - 6,000 gallon tanks.\n\n3.  The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario:\n\nThe worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a anhydrous ammonia storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity release would be 131,325 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The worst case release would result in material leaving the facility's property.\n\nThe alternative release scenario based on the most likely potential incident is a release from a break in a transfer hose which might result in a release of 11,908 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  The alternative case release would result in material leaving the facility's property.\n\n4.  The accidental release prevention program\n\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".\n\n5.  The Five-Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidental"

The Emergency Response Program\n\nThe Facility has:\n\na.  A written Emergency Action Plan, in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38;\nb.  Provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\nc.  A written emergency response program, in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.120, including pre-emergency training and employee training.\n\n7.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
