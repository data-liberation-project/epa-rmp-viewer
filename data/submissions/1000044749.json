This commitment is inherent to our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with our regulated processes. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible accidental releases of regulated substances. However, if such an accidental release does occur, we are coordinated with off-site emergency response support.\n\n\n\n\n\n- The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nCurrently ammonia  (Anhydrous) is the only RMP regulated substance present at this facility in a threshold quantity.  It is utilized as the primary cooling media in our closed-loop refrigeration system. The system?s purpose is to provide refrigeration for cold storage and distribution operations.  Due to the characteristics of our ammonia refrigeration system, as well as Process Safety Management (PSM) applicability, Koch Foods is covered under Program 3 of the RMP regulations.\n\n\n\nThe Worst Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario, including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario, have been completed as required by the RMP Rule. To evaluate both the worst case and alternative release scenarios, EPA's RMP COMP was utilized exclusively. The RMP COMP model is referenced in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance as an acceptable model for the mathematical approximation process.  \n\n\n\nAs specified in the RMP Guidance, the worst case and alternate case release scenarios have been calculated and the results of the calculations are on file at the Koch Foods Gadsden Facility.  Public and environmental receptors that could possibly be affected by the scenarios were determined through t"

      "SummaryText": "he use of LANDVIEW 6 mapping system software, and US Census Bureau 2000 data. \n\n\n\n\n\n- The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nKoch Foods has taken all necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set forth in 40 CFR Part 68.  Koch Foods is also subject to the OSHA PSM Standard under 29 CFR 1910.119, as well as the EPCRA Section 302 and 311/312 notification/reporting requirements.\n\n\n\n\n\n- Emergency Action Plan\n\n\n\nKoch Foods current Emergency Action/Response Plan focuses on evacuation and response of the facility in the event of an ammonia emergency.  The facility maintains a written Emergency Action/Response Plan to document specific procedures to be implemented in the event of various emergencies, including ammonia release. The Plan includes procedures for facility evacuation, as well as for notification to the local emergency response agencies, which are responsible for notifying the public.  The Plan allows Koch Foods personnel trained in emergency response operations to respond to an upset or release. The plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within the facility that would require modified procedures.\n\n\n\n\n\n- Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nKoch Foods aim is to provide a professional service as efficiently as possible while minimizing the use of toxic materials wherever and whenever prudent.  In this effort our highest priority will be the proactive pursuit of cost-effective process changes that reduce or eliminate the use and/or generation of hazardous toxics at the endpoint of service.  Where hazardous toxics cannot be eliminated, improving controls to handle these substances will be explored and implemented wherever possible."
