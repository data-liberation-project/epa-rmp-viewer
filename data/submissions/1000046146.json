This standard is often referred to as the risk management program rule.  The facility is covered by the rule because it processes anhydrous ammonia in excess of the regulatory thresholds.  Anhydrous ammonia is used in the facility's refrigeration system, and is a listed chemical due to toxicity.\n\n\n\nAccording to the risk management program rule, covered facilities must develop and submit a Risk Management Plan (RMP) to the EPA.  The RMP and any subsequent updates must include registration information, a summary of the risk management program, and a certification statement.  The RMP will be made available to the public.  The purpose of this project was to compile the information and materials necessary to submit an updated RMP.\n\n\n\nAn offsite consequence analysis was conducted on a worst-case release scenario and an alternative release scenario involving anhydrous ammonia.  The analysis of the worst-case release scenario assumed ammonia was released to the atmosphere over a 10-minute period.  The resulting plume was modeled according to the method presented in the EPA's RMP Comp.  The distance at which the ammonia concentration in the plume falls below the regulatory endpoint concentration was determined to be 4.7 miles.  It was further determined that within 4.7 miles of the facility there is a population of 7,506 people.  The public receptors identified within 4.7 miles of the facility are schools, residential, commercial/industrial areas.\n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario examined a release of ammonia resulting from a failure during normal operation.  However, for the alternative release scenario the quantity released is based on the  normal operating inventory of an adjacent vessel rather than the largest vessel.  For a 10-minute release, the d"
