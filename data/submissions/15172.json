      "SummaryText": "CITY OF PANAMA CITY BEACH WASTE    WATER TREATMENT PLANT EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nThe City of Panama City Beach (\"The City of PCB\") has been requested to develop, implement, and submit to the Unites States Environmental Protection Agency a detailed Risk Management Plan for Wastewater Treatment Plant One by June 21, 1999.  The following is an executive summary on the components and progress of the plan.  \n\na.    The City of Panama City Beach accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures, organizations, and management practices.  The City emergency response policy utilizes the emergency response services available within the City and County and is in compliance with the EPA Emergency Response Program. \n\nb.    The City currently collects, transmits and treats wastewater from residential and commercial buildings between the Hathaway Bridge and Phillips Inlet.  The City of PCB Wastewater Plant One chlorination system has been installed to disinfect wastewater.  The sulfur dioxide system has been installed to restore the chlorinated wastewater to a point where it is safe to be returned to the environment.   The chlorine and sulfur dioxide are individually handled in two one-ton containers. This facility is manned twenty-four hours a day and seven days a week.  Wastewater treatment operators inspect the facility daily and will respond to any trouble alarms if such a need arises.\n\nc.    The City has two chlorine release scenarios, identified as \"worst case release\" and \"alternative release\". The worst case release scenario is catastrophic failure and could be caused by corrosion, impact or construction defects.  It involves a failure of a one-ton chlorine container.  We referred to data collected by AWWA Research Foundation and American Water Works Association to determine the distance traveled by the chlorine released before its concentration decreases to the \"toxic endpoints\".  Atmospheric dispersion modeling used a direct release"

The worst case release scenario is catastrophic failure and could be caused by corrosion, impact or construction defects.  It involves a failure of a one-ton sulfur dioxide container.  We referred to data received from the assistance of the Department of Community affairs and the use of the risk management computer program to determine the distance traveled by the sulfur dioxide released before its concentration decreases to the \"toxic endpoints\".  Atmospheric dispersion modeling used a direct release with a discharge rate of 200 lb/minute for 10 minutes.  The toxic endpoint distance was calculated to be 0.90 miles.
