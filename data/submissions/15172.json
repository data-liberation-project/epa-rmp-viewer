      "SummaryText": "with a discharge rate of 200 lb/minute for 10 minutes.  The toxic endpoint distance was calculated to be 2.60 miles.  The residential population potentially affected within a circle with a 2.60 mile radius corresponding to the toxic endpoint was estimated to be 2,520. \n\t\n\tThe other scenario is defined as a more likely to occur situation and could be caused by tubing failure, bad connection, or valve failure resulting in the release of gas.  This scenario was modeled as a release from a horizontal cylindrical tank with the release occurring through a short pipe or valve in the top of the tank. The maximum average sustained release rate was 10.50 lb/minute for a 60 minute duration.  The toxic endpoint distance was 0.48 miles. The residential population potentially affected within a circle with a 2.60 mile radius corresponding to the toxic endpoint was estimated to be 465. Both scenarios used an ambient temperature of 77 degrees Fahrenheit as required by regulations. \n\n\t\n\tActive mitigation measures for chlorine presently applied are the use of chlorine vacuum piping and a permanently installed and operative chlorine leak detector.\n\n\tThe City has two sulfur dioxide release scenarios, identified as worst case release and alternative release. The worst case release scenario is catastrophic failure and could be caused by corrosion, impact or construction defects.  It involves a failure of a one-ton sulfur dioxide container.  We referred to data received from the assistance of the Department of Community affairs and the use of the risk management computer program to determine the distance traveled by the sulfur dioxide released before its concentration decreases to the toxic endpoints.  Atmospheric dispersion modeling used a direct release with a discharge rate of 200 lb/minute for 10 minutes.  The toxic endpoint distance was calculated to be 0.90 miles.

      "SummaryText": "CITY OF PANAMA CITY BEACH WASTE\tWATER TREATMENT PLANT EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nThe City of Panama City Beach (The City of PCB) has been requested to develop, implement, and submit to the Unites States Environmental Protection Agency a detailed Risk Management Plan for Wastewater Treatment Plant One by June 21, 1999.  The following is an executive summary on the components and progress of the plan.  \n\na.\tThe City of Panama City Beach accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures, organizations, and management practices.  The City emergency response policy utilizes the emergency response services available within the City and County and is in compliance with the EPA Emergency Response Program. \n\nb.\tThe City currently collects, transmits and treats wastewater from residential and commercial buildings between the Hathaway Bridge and Phillips Inlet.  The City of PCB Wastewater Plant One chlorination system has been installed to disinfect wastewater.  The sulfur dioxide system has been installed to restore the chlorinated wastewater to a point where it is safe to be returned to the environment.   The chlorine and sulfur dioxide are individually handled in two one-ton containers. This facility is manned twenty-four hours a day and seven days a week.  Wastewater treatment operators inspect the facility daily and will respond to any trouble alarms if such a need arises.\n\nc.\tThe City has two chlorine release scenarios, identified as worst case release and alternative release. The worst case release scenario is catastrophic failure and could be caused by corrosion, impact or construction defects.  It involves a failure of a one-ton chlorine container.  We referred to data collected by AWWA Research Foundation and American Water Works Association to determine the distance traveled by the chlorine released before its concentration decreases to the toxic endpoints.  Atmospheric dispersion modeling used a direct release"

      "SummaryText": "c endpoint was estimated to be 872. \n\t\n\tThe other scenario is defined as a more likely to occur situation and could be caused by tubing failure, bad connection, or valve failure resulting in the release of gas.  This scenario was modeled as a release from a horizontal cylindrical tank with the release occurring through a short pipe or valve in the top of the tank. The maximum average sustained release rate was 5.30 lb/minute for a 60 minute duration.  The toxic endpoint distance was 0.20 miles. The residential population potentially affected within a circle with a .20 mile radius corresponding to the toxic endpoint was estimated to be 194. Both scenarios used an ambient temperature of 77 degrees Fahrenheit as required by regulations. \n\t\n\tActive mitigation measures for sulfur dioxide presently applied is the use of sulfur dioxide vacuum piping.\n\n\tThe general accidental release prevention program consists of the following:\n\n\t \tHigh level of training of water plant operators and fire department personnel\n\n\t \tPreventive maintenance programs\n\n\t \tUse of appropriate safety equipment\n\n\t \tUse of accurate and effective operating procedures\n\n\t \tImplementation of an auditing and inspection program\n\t \n\tChemical-specific prevention steps when connecting or disconnecting chlorine or sulfur dioxide cylinders require that at least two employees must be present, each wearing a NIOSH/MSHA approved respirator and skin protective equipment.\n\t\nd.\tNo accidental releases of chlorine have occurred at this facility in the past five years.\n\ne.\tThe Wastewater Plant has an emergency response plan coordinated by the City of Panama City Beach Fire Department.  \n\nf.\tPlanned changes to improve safety will be to provide continuing training and accident drills in cooperation with the Fire Department."
