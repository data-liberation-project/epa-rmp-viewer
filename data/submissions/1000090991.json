This commitment is reflected in the safety and environmental programs that are implemented at the facility.  For example, written procedures have been created for operating the ammonia refrigeration system.  World Class Distribution, Inc. has also developed a robust maintenance program to ensure the equipment is in good operating condition.  Only trained refrigeration technicians with the refrigeration contractor are permitted to perform system operations and maintenance.  All of these programs are geared towards the prevention of an accidental release at the facility.  In addition, these programs incorporate emergency procedures to mitigate the effects of a release if it does occur.  At such an event, emergency coordinators will assess the situation and notify outside responding agencies as necessary.\r\n\r\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\r\n\r\nWorld Class Distribution, Inc. is located at 2388 Mason Avenue in Daytona Beach, Florida.  Ammonia is used in the facility's refrigeration system to provide cooling for the storage of food products.  The system uses a maximum of 15,000 pounds of ammonia.  A description of how the process operates is presented below:  \r\n\r\nLiquid ammonia in the high pressure receiver is fed to the high temperature recirculator.  The recirculator pumps liquid to the evaporators.  At the evaporators, air is drawn over the coils by the fans.  The ammonia flowing inside the coils is partially vaporized as it absorbs heat from the surrounding air.  The partially vaporized ammonia is returned to the recirculator, where the liquid settles at the bottom of the vessel, while the vapor rises to the top.  The vapor in the vessel is pulled off by the compressors and discharged to the condensers.  At the condensers, the vapor is condensed back into liquid, which then drains to t"

The EAP covers procedures for: 1) evacuating and accounting for visitors and employees, 2) dealing with an ammonia release and other foreseeable emergencies that could occur onsite, 3) notifying external agencies and emergency response personnel, and 4) administering first aid measures for ammonia exposure.  Employees are informed of the elements of the EAP.  In the event of an ammonia release, employees will evacuate or shelter-in-place, depending on the nature of the release, and the facility will contact the fire department for assistance as necessary.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis studies and Compliance Audits have been performed on the ammonia refrigeration system. These studies have resulted in action items to improve safety at the facility.  The recommendations mainly consist of formalizing procedures, implementing practices consistent with industry standards, and performing inspections and tests to maintain the integrity of the equipment.  World Class Distribution, Inc. has implemented these action items.   In addition, the facility plans to continue providing employees with a safe work environment through continued training on current policies and procedures, and conducting audits to identify deficiencies and make improvements."

The program includes but is not limited to the following elements:\r\n\r\n\u00bf\tSafety information regarding the chemical hazards, and operating and technical specifications for the equipment;\r\n\u00bf\tWritten procedures for operating and maintaining the processes;\r\n\u00bf\tTraining for employees involved with system operations and maintenance;\r\n\u00bf\tWritten procedures for managing system changes and startup of a modified process;\r\n\u00bf\tInvestigating releases and near misses and implementing measures to prevent recurrence;\r\n\u00bf\tWritten procedures for conducting hot work on or near the regulated processes;\r\n\u00bf\tContractor management policies to ensure contract employee safety while on facility premises; and\r\n\u00bf\tEmployee involvement in program development and implementation.\r\n\r\nIn addition, engineering controls have been implemented to reduce the chance of an accidental release to the environment.  These are comprised of equipment monitoring systems and safety cutouts to shut off the equipment when operating parameters exceed safe operating limits.  Relief valves on pressurized ammonia vessels prevent equipment rupture in the event of overpressurization. An ammonia diffusion tank has also been installed to prevent a relief valve release from going offsite. Regular inspections and tests are performed to ensure these controls are in good working order.\r\n\r\nFive Year Accident History\r\n\r\nA review of the facility's five year accident history showed that there have been no incidents at the facility that meet the RMP criteria for a reportable accident (onsite deaths, injuries, or significant property damage; or known offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place).  In addition, there have been no incidents at the"
