Each site is also responsible for regulatory compliance issues that apply to the site.  The City of Lakeland Office of Risk Management provides assistance in training for site employees and in budgeting and procurement of safety and training services.\n\n2. Description of Stationary Source\n\nThe McIntosh Power Plant is located on the north shore of Lake Parker. The plant consist of three steam electric generating units, two diesel units and one gas turbine generating unit for use during periods of peak power demand. The McIntosh facility supplies electric power to the City of Lakeland and the surrounding area. The Northside Wastewater Treatment Plant, located on Lake Parker on property adjacent to the McIntosh facility, includes disinfection, filtration, clarification, and aeration processes which treat wastewater for the City of Lakeland.  Since the McIntosh and Northside facilities are located on one contiguous property and have a common owner, they filed a joint Title V Air Permit.  For this reason, they are now submitting one Risk Management Plan summary to comply with the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68.  The facility will therefore be referred to as the McIntosh/Northside facility.\n\nThe McIntosh Power Plant stores liquefied anhydrous ammonia in one 30,400 gallon tank for addition to the Selective Catalytic Reduction System.  Although the tank has a total capacity of 30,400 gallons, the Ammonia Unloading Procedure limits the ta"

This is equivalent to approximately 134,368 lbs. of ammonia, which exceeds the 10,000 lb. threshold quantity.\n\nThe Northside Wastewater Treatment Plant adds chlorine to the treated wastewater as a disinfection agent.  The chlorination process is located in a three-walled, covered building at the southwest corner of the site, where liquefied chlorine gas is stored in up to twelve one-ton containers.  Six containers are always connected to the chlorination system, and up to six are stored nearby.  The total chlorine inventory in the process at any one time ranges from 12,000 to 24,000 lbs.  This exceeds the 2,500-lb. RMP threshold quantity.\n\n3. Description of the Worst Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nSCR Ammonia Process\n\nThe worst case release scenario is rupture of the storage tank, releasing 134,368 lbs. of ammonia over a ten minute period.  Under worst case weather conditions, the ammonia gas could travel 6.9 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public or environment (reaching a concentration less than .14 mg/L), using the WWTP Guidance Table.\n\nThe alternative release scenario is a pipe break off the liquid pipe line off the storage tank of ammonia which would result in a flashing two phase release from a hole created by the failure of a 2 pipe connected to the tank.  Under normally expected weather conditions and considering active mitigation in the form of an excess flow valve, the ammonia gas could travel 0.4 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public or environment (reaching a concentration less than .14 mg/L), using the WWTP method.\n\nWWTP-Chlorination process\n\nThe alternative release scenario for the chlorine process at the Northside WWTP is a leak at a rate of 74 lb/min. from the container liquid supply valve due to failure of the fitting which attaches the valve to the container.  Under normally expected weather cond"

Prevention Program\n\nThe RMP regulation requires classification of each process into a Program Level 1, 2, or 3 in order to determine the prevention program requirements.  Since the worst case release scenario would impact a public receptor, the process can not be classified as a Program 1.  Program 3 processes are ones that are not Program 1, but are subject to OSHA's Process Safety Standard , 1910.119, or part of one of the 10 NAICS codes listed in the RMP regulation.  The City of Lakeland facility, as a power plant, has an NAIC code of 22111, which is not one of the ten listed codes.  This means that the McIntosh Power Plant facility  process would be classified as Program 3 only if they are subject to the PSM Standard.  McIntosh Power Plant has concluded it is subject to the PSM Standard. For RMP compliance purposes, this places the McIntosh Power Plant process in the Program 3 level.  The anhydrous ammonia process will use the PSM program which has been developed as the required Program 3 Prevention Program.\n\nThe McIntosh Power Plant and Northside Wastewater Treatment Plant have separate programs in place to comply with the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard, 29 CFR 1910.119.  The PSM Program for the Northside WWTP was established in 1997 for the chlorine process.\n\nThe McIntosh Power Plant PSM Program was established in June of 2001 for the new SCR ammonia  process prior to its installation in the upcoming fall of 2001.  The McIntosh Power Plant PSM Program receives full support of plant management and involvement of employees at all levels.\n\n5. Accident History\n\nThe McIntosh Power Plant has had no accidental releases of chlorine or anhydrous ammonia in the past five years.\n\n6. Emergency Response"
