We at the Belmont Water Treatment Plant (Belmont WTP) use chemicals too.  For example, we use chlorine to disinfect our water to provide safe drinking water for human consumption.  Storing large quantities of chlorine can be a hazard.  We take our safety obligations in storing and using chlorine as seriously as we do providing the public safe, disinfected drinking water.  The following document describes what could happen if there were to be an accident, the steps we take everyday to ensure a safely operating plant, and what to do in event of an emergency.  \r\nAccidental Release Prevention and  Emergency Response Policies\r\nThe Philadelphia Water Department (PWD) and Belmont WTP accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates proven technology, trains staff on operation and maintenance practices, and uses tested management system practices.  All applicable procedures of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Prevention Program are adhered to, including key elements such as training, systems management, and emergency response procedures.  \r\nThis document complies with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Risk Management Program, under Section 112 (r) of the Clean Air Act (CAA) Amendments of 1990, 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68. The Belmont WTP has a chlorination system that uses chlorine gas fed from ton cylinders. This document summarizes our existing health and safety programs, our internal management response team, policies, procedures, and on-going actions that are designed to prevent or minimize impacts of accidental releases of chlorine to the environment. The Belmont WTP has prepared a detailed and comprehensive emergency response plan to handle any potential accidental releases that is designed to safeguard both on- and off-s"

To date, we have had an excellent record in preventing accidents from occurring.\r\nGeneral Facility and Regulated Substances Information\r\nThe Belmont WTP, operating since 1966, is located at 4300 Ford Road in the City of Philadelphia. The plant is located on property between the Ford Road and Belmont Avenue in Philadelphia.  Surface water taken from the Schuylkill River is treated and disinfected at the Belmont WTP to EPA standards and sent to the public for human consumption. This water treatment process includes preliminary screening, coagulation and sedimentation, filtration, and chlorination before final distribution to the public. The Belmont WTP produces up to 86 million gallons per day (MGD) of potable water, with an average flow of 46 MGD.\r\nThe facility currently stores chlorine, which is a regulated toxic substance under 40 CFR Part 68 - RMP. The Plant's chlorine storage exceeds the listed threshold quantity of 2,500 pounds in the RMP Regulations. \r\nLiquid chlorine is brought to the plant via delivery trucks that drop off the ton containers at the chlorine loading/unloading area. Chlorine leak detector monitors continuously check for leaks in the bulk storage areas and in the chlorination rooms. Other indicators include chlorine feed and evaporator alarms. These alarms are annunciated at the central and local control panels at the plant in the main control room. In the case of a leak, the storage area has an audible alarm and red flashing warning light on top of the building.  In addition, an evaporator shut-off and pressure reducing valve is designed to close if low evaporator gas temperature is detected; thus preventing liquid chlorine from reaching the gas piping system.  These valves also reduce pressure and allow for quicker liquefaction to occur.  All process related, factory-set pressure relief valves are set to protect the integrity of the equipment.\r\nThe ton cylinder usage area and the chlorination rooms are enclosed in a building.  Both"

Room air is vented to a scrubber that neutralizes the gases.  Emergency showers and eye wash stations are provided at each building.  The main control building has Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBAs) available.   \r\nThe Belmont WTP is controlled at State Road by a gate that is only open during normal working hours.  Visitors and contractors must check-in at the guard shack and administration building and be approved by Belmont WTP staff prior to entry into the facility.  The plant is manned 24-hours a day, year round, and alarms notify staff of any problems or situations that require follow-up investigations at all times.      \r\n\r\nFive-year Accident History Summary\r\nNo chlorine releases that could have caused safety or health hazards to any individuals at on-site or off-site locations (no deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place) occurred at Belmont WTP during the last five years. \r\nSummary of the Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-specific Prevention Steps \r\nBelmont WTP is in compliance with Federal Risk Management Planning (RMP) requirements.  Chemical-specific prevention steps include availability of self-contained escape breathing apparatus, worn by the operators during connection and disconnection of the chlorine supply, awareness of the hazardous and toxic properties of chlorine, and the presence of chlorine detectors and alarms.\r\nBelmont WTP's accidental release prevention program is based on the following key elements:\r\n* Detailed management system and clear levels of responsibilities and team member roles\r\n* Comprehensive safety process information that is readily available to staff, emergency responders,  and contractors\r\n* Comprehensive preventive maintenance program\r\n* Completion of a process hazard analysis of equipment and proc"

This information was compiled from numerous sources and is intended to be a one-stop source for the reader seeking data about these substances.  This information includes chlorine background information, material safety data sheets (MSDS), and chlorine reaction chemistry.\r\nEquipment safety information was meticulously compiled on the chlorine process.  Specifications for the process are collected in one place for easy reference.  Details such as maximum intended inventory; safe upper and lower temperatures; safe upper and lower pressures; and codes and standards used to design, build, and operate the processes are on file at the facility.\r\nWe also have procedures in place that is triggered to update safety information if there is a major change that makes existing information inaccurate.\r\nHazard Analysis \r\nIn 1998, a detailed hazard analysis (HA) was conducted with plant staff, engineering, and administrative staff for the regulated process.  The team consisted of process operating and maintenance experts and process design engineers.  The HA technique used was the What-If scenario and process checklist procedure, per acceptable approach guidance from EPA.
