This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n1.)  To save lives.\n2.)  To minimize and avoid injuries.\n3.)  To protect the environment.\n4.)  To minimize property damage.\n\nBama Pie maintains an emergency response committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This Plan was prepared as part of Bama Pie's compliance efforts associated with the PSM and RMP regulations. \n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe Bama Pie facility prepares pies, cakes, and pastry products for distribution.  Prior to December 2003, the faciliy operated a small ammonia refrigeration system that was not applicable to the EPA Risk Management Program regulation. The facility has undergone a major expansion that is scheduled to startup in December 2003, which will require the facility to comply with the Program Level 3 of the EPA RMP.\n\nThe refrigeration process, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for process equipment and cold storage rooms.  Changes in pressure are directly related to changes in temperature.  For example, lowering the ammonia pressure lowers its temperature.  Low pressure (cold) liquid ammonia provides refrigeration by removing ambient heat.  Removal of ambient heat causes the liquid ammonia (contained within the system) to"

Typical operating conditions range from vacuum (approximately 12 Hg) on the low pressure side of the system to 150-160 psig on the high side.\n\nAmmonia is used as the refrigerant in the refrigeration process.\n\nThe total ammonia inventory is 25,000 pounds.  \n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY\n\nWorst Case Release Summary\n\nThe worst case release for this facility was that of the maximum quantity of ammonia that can be stored in a vessel.  The largest vessel, High Pressure Receiver, is located inside the engine room and has a maximum capacity of 17,900 pounds.  This quantity was released in 10 minutes.  This vessel is located inside a building; therefore, the enclosure was used as a passive mitigation measure. The most pessimistic meteorological conditions were used: 1.5 meters/second wind speed, and F stability.  The facility is located in an urban setting.  The downwind distance was determined using Exhibit 4-4 from the EPA Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration, May 2000.  The release reaches off-site and may affect population receptors.  No environmental receptors are affected by this potential scenario.\n\nAlternative Release Result Summary\n\nThe alternative release scenario was that of a 0.75 inch diameter leak of high pressure gas ammonia for one hour.  This scenario was chosen because the facility has a 0.75 inch ammonia gas line that is located outside the building. The quantity of ammonia released in one hour at this rate is 3,180 pounds.  The meteorological conditions used were 3 meters/second wind speed, and D stability. The facility is located in an urban setting.  The downwind distance to 200 ppm was determined using Exhibit 4-5 from the EPA Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration, May 2000.  The release reaches off-site and may affect population receptors.  No environmental receptors are affected by this potential scenario.\n\nACCIDENTA"

There are ammonia sensors located in the engine room and the pressure relief header. The ammonia detection system will start the emergency ventillation system. The facility can access the liquid and hot gas solenoid King valves remotely through the computer control system. There is an emergency shut off switch located outside the engine room to shut down the entire system.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThis facility is undergoing a major expansion which will require it to be in compliance with the EPA Risk Management Program in December 2003. Prior to that time, Bama Pie operated a much small ammonia refrigeration system and between December 1998 and November 2003, there was one reportable release of 100 pounds of ammonia on August 2, 2001. \n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe Bama Pie facility has an Emergency Response Program in place.  The facility has an Emergency Response Team that is trained to First Responder Technician Level on an annual basis.
