Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nWhiteWave Foods became the legal owner of the property on November 18, 2010.  Prior to that date the property was previously owned and operated by Americana Foods for the production of ice cream and frozen dessert products.  Since the purchase of the property, WhiteWave Foods has completely renovated the building and its anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system.  This RMP submittal represents our second submission based on the 5 year renewal requirements. \n\n\n\nWhiteWave Foods is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent to our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operation procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with our regulated ammonia refrigeration system. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If such a release does occur, we are completely coordinated with the Dallas Fire Department and the Dallas County LEPC for emergency response support.\n\n\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nThis facility is primarily used for the production and storage of plant and dairy based products.  The only RMP regulated substance present at our facility is ammonia, utilized as the primary cooling media in our closed-loop refrigeration system. Refrigeration is a critical part of our business, providing cold storage capabilities for products per Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations.  The new ammonia system contains approximately 71,000 pounds of ammonia.\n\n\n\nDue to the  and characteristics of our ammonia system, as well as Process Safety Management (PSM) applicability, this facility is covered under Program 3 of the"

Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, piping systems, pressure relief valves, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in applicable maintenance practices. Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed. Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change\n\n\n\nWritten procedures are in place at WhiteWave Foods to manage changes in ammonia systems technology, equipment, and procedures. Process operators, maintenance personnel, or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by an ammonia systems modification are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\n\n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews\n\n\n\nPre-start up safety reviews are conducted any time the ammonia refrigeration system, or any of its components, is opened for repairs, tie-ins, or modifications. These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating procedures, and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\n\n\nWhiteWave Foods conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.

All reports are retained for a minimum of five (5) years.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\n\n\nWhiteWave Foods believes that Process Safety Management (PSM) and accident prevention is a team effort. Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements. In addition, our employees have access to all information related to PSM and RMP implementation, including Process Hazard Analyses (PHA) information.\n\n\n\nContractors\n\n\n\nOn occasion, our company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and/or construction activities related to the ammonia refrigeration system. Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out. WhiteWave Foods has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related to the contractor's work with the ammonia systems. Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of ammonia occur.\n\n\n\n4. Five-year Accident History\n\n\n\nThe RMP regulation defines an \"RMP Accident\" as the following:\n\n\n\n\"The release must be from a covered process and involve a regulated substance held above its threshold quantity in the process.\n\n\n\nThe release must have caused at least one of the following:\n\n\n\n?    On-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage (?68.42(a)); or\n\n?    Known offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place (?68.42(a)).\"\n\n\n\nBased on the above definition and an investigation into the facility's accident history, there have been no significant releases of ammonia that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 100 pounds in the last five years (November 2011 - November 2016) for the Five-Year Accident History at the facility.\n\n\n\nHowever, a near-miss occurred on April 12, 2016.

The facility determined that the release came from the manhole area of the compressor oil separator where the bolts had been removed in order to begin service on the coalescing filters. It was determined that the release occurred after the technician missed a step in the SOP that would have had him address a check valve.  Re-training on the maintenance procedures was conducted to ensure that maintenance department personnel were aware of the safe and proper steps.\n\n\n\n5. Emergency Response Plan\n\n\n\nWhiteWave Foods maintains an Emergency Action Plan in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38.  In the event of a release requiring evacuation of the building, local emergency response agencies will be contact to assist with rescue, firefighting, first-aid, medical treatment, and other response functions.  The facility has an emergency action plans in place to address evacuation procedures and responding agency contact information.  As needed and in a timely manner, the plan is updated as necessary.\n\n\n\nThe Dallas County LEPC is the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) with which our emergency action plans have been coordinated and verified. The Dallas Fire Department is the primary emergency response agency for all facility emergencies, including ammonia releases.\n\n\n\n6. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nThe facility has implemented the components of the Program Level 3 RMP and associated PSM program, which has resulted in improved safety at our facility. Some of these components include ammonia refrigeration system safety training, employee training, management of change policy & procedure, standard and emergency operation procedures, incident investigation policy and procedures, RMP compliance audits, etc.  \n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA) st"
