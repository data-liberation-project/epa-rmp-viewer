It is the policy of Seneca Foods Corporation to conduct all operations (including the ammonia refrigeration system) in a safe manner.  This policy extends to all employees and contractors at the facility.  Seneca Foods Corporation implements this policy towards chemical and general safety through on going employee participation, training, written operating procedures, maintenance, inspections, safety committee meetings, and safety reviews/evaluations.  These programs are in effect at the facility to prevent the accidental release of ammonia.  In the event of an ammonia accident, the facility has an Emergency Action Plan to notify the appropriate authorities and safely evacuate the facility.\r\n\r\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\r\n\r\nSeneca Foods is located at 430 7th Avenue South, in Buhl, Idaho.  The facility is approximately 0.3 miles north of Idaho Highway 30.  The area immediately surrounding the facility is rural with a mixture of residential areas, farmland, and light commercial areas.  \r\n\r\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is a closed system that cycles the refrigerant from liquid to gas and back again. The systems, consisting of vessels, piping, valves, and process equipment, cycle a total of 19,600 pounds of ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, then back to high pressure liquid) in order to accommodate the processing and storage of seasonal canned and frozen vegetables.\r\n\r\nChanges in pressure are directly related to changes in temperature: lowering the ammonia pressure lowers its temperature.  Low pressure (cold) liquid ammonia provides refrigeration by removing heat from the cold rooms.  Transferring heat to the ammonia causes the liquid ammonia (contained within the system) to vaporize.

The Operating Procedures program ensures that the ammonia system is operated in a safe manner.  The Training program ensures that personnel fully understand how to perform their jobs in a safe manner.  The Mechanical Integrity program ensures that the ammonia system is in proper working condition based upon routine testing, inspections, and maintenance according to manufacturer's specifications and industry standards.  The Management of Change program ensures that process modifications are implemented in a safe manner.  The Pre-Startup Safety Review program ensures that adequate safety measures are in place before ammonia is introduced into a process.  The Safe Work Practices program ensures that Seneca Foods Corporation employees and contractors follow Lockout / Tagout, Hazard Communication, Hot Work (e.g. welding), and Chemical and General Safety Procedures in a safe manner.  The Contractor Safety program ensures that contractors understand the hazards of ammonia and must take specified precautions to safely complete job requirements.\r\n\r\nThe facility also operates in accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrige"

The facility is currently operating a 102,000 square foot frozen storage warehouse.  As a result of this change, the amount of ammonia on site has been reduced from previous levels.  Approximately 19,600 pounds of anhydrous ammonia is currently used as a refrigerant for the cold storage warehouse.\r\n\r\nIt is policy of Seneca Foods Corporation to assure safe and healthful working conditions for every employee and to comply fully with all applicable laws and regulations including OSHA Process Safety Management and Federal Emergency Planning and Right-to-Know Act.  Seneca Foods Corporation will provide adequate safeguards against health and safety hazards by providing a safe work environment, job training and instruction on safe procedures, making personal protective gear available, and proper administration of safety programs and activities.  To reduce the risk of accidental ammonia release there are engineering and mechanical safeguards in place including physical barriers to protect ammonia lines and vessels, high level cutoff controls, relief valves, and a PLC based monitoring and operating system with built in alarms and controls.\r\n\r\nThe facility has two (2) operational separate and independent (they do not share/exchange ammonia between each other) refrigeration systems.  The original and primary system was the largest and held over 50,000 pounds of ammonia.  This system is no longer operational and has been taken out of service.  The second system (an expansion freezer) was added in 1995 and holds approximately 9,800 pounds of ammonia.  The third system is another expansion freezer and it also holds approximately 9,800 pounds of ammonia.  The two expansion freezers are similar in design, but not exactly the same.

This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:  \r\n\r\n\t1. save lives;\r\n\t2. minimize and avoid injuries;\r\n\t3. protect the environment; and\r\n\t4. minimize property damage.\r\n\r\nThe Plan provides the notification procedures and evacuation routes for emergencies that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year to ensure compliance with the PSM/RMP regulations.  Facility personnel receive annual training regarding the emergency procedures.\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nA Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) was performed on June 21-23, 2016.  These studies generated mitigation measures (recommendations) to improve safety at the Seneca Foods Corporation facility in Buhl, Idaho.  The mitigation measures include additional training, key maintenance-related tests/inspection, and enhanced emergency response policies and procedures.  The Seneca Foods Corporation safety committee is planning to complete several items, including the recommendations, over the next year, as a continual effort to provide a safe work environment for their employees.  These changes include the following items:\r\n\r\n1. \tContinue to train all employees in the facility Safety Plan/Programs.\r\n\r\n2. \tContinue to have employee involvement in Safety Plan Development.\r\n\r\n3. \tContinue employee involvement through safety team participation.\r\n\r\n4. \tContinue internal and external safety audits/inspections and implement changes as needed."
