This process consists of up to three ammonia railcars on a single siting, decoupled from the switch engine, and awaiting spotting and hookup for unloading.  A total of six leased railcars are dedicated to this service with a maximum of three full cars allowed within the Pontchartrain stationary source at anytime. Some prevention programs are shared with other processes on the stationary source.  No modification to the railcars is preformed on the stationary source and, therefore, some aspects of the prevention program do not apply to this pseudo process.
