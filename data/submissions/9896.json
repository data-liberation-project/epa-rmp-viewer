Hydrogen sulfide is not stored in the refinery, and the quantity in any single process does not exceed the EPA RMP threshold quantity.\n\nOther substances used in the refinery that appear on the EPA RMP toxic substance list include chlorine, anhydrous ammonia, and aqueous ammonia. However, the quantity of these substances in any process is also below the EPA RMP thresholds.\n\n3.0\tHAZARD ASSESSMENT RESULTS\n\nSince Convent Refinery does not currently contain any RMP-listed toxic materials above the threshold quantity in any single process, no offsite consequences relating to toxics are reported.\n\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with a release of flammable substances at the refinery is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) involving the full inventory of the largest storage sphere containing butane. No administrative controls are in place to limit the storage inventory in the tank; therefore, the full tank inventory of 2,529,000 pounds is assumed to release, completely vaporize, and ignite, resulting in a VCE. This scenario is expected to have offsite impact. Although Convent Refinery has numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for passive mitigation measures was taken into account in evaluating this WCS.\n\nThe alternative release scenario (ARS) for flammable substances at the refinery is a VCE resulting from the release of 32,056 pounds of a flammable mixture containing pentane vapor, released over a 10-minute period, from a two inch diameter hole in or around 91F-302, Hydrogenation Reactor. The release is expected to be isolated by the operators within 10 minutes (active mitigation). The endpoint for this scenario is expected to be offsite; however, no offsite impact is expected. \n\n4.0\tGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at Convent Refinery.

Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team or incident investigation team. Employees have access to all information created as part of the refinery accident prevention program. Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in the employee participation plan, entitled Standing Instruction 5.19 - Employee Participation, that is maintained at the refinery. \n\nIn addition, the refinery has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and employee safety issues. These initiatives are implemented by teams and include VPP participation, the Quality Process, and Behavioral Based Safety. The teams typically are made up of members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and management.\n\n4.2\tProcess Safety Information\n \nConvent Refinery maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address the hazards of the chemicals in the processes, the technology of the processes, and the equipment used in the processes. Specific departments within the refinery are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information. \n\nEmployees and contractors are informed of the location of process safety information that is relevant to their work.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment consider"

MSDSs are readily available through Convent Refinery's computer system. \nConvent Refinery also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of  construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical area classifications, piping and instrument diagrams (P&IDs), etc. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the processes are not compromised.  \n\n4.3\tProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nConvent Refinery has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled. Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify reasonably foreseeable hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these potential hazards.\n\nConvent Refinery uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations. HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques. The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates potential hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and  mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nThe PHA teams findings are entered into a computer data base and assigned to appropriate departments for resolution. \n\nImplementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.

The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures. In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process equipment.\n\nMaintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their job in a safe manner. Applicable written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training. Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended, and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels). If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), unless special approval is given to use of the equipment, after it is determined what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment. \n\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance. Convent Refinery incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs. This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\n4.9\tHot Work Permit\n\nConvent Refinery utilizes a comprehensive work permit system to safely manage all work performed at the facility. In addition to hot work, the work permit system also includes requirements for entry into confined spaces, as well as requirements for other than hot work.

This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology, (including process operation conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented. Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change. Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes, in addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change. \n\n \t4.11\tIncident Investigation \n\nConvent Refinery promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury. The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and enters the information into a computer data base for tracking. Each recommendation is promptly assigned to an appropriate department for resolution. The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented in the data base, available for review by all employees and contractors who could be affected by the findings. Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidations.\n\n4.12\tCompliance Audits\n\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, audits are periodically conducted to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.

The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or  process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original process hazard analysis, Convent Refinery periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating. The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained. Once again, the team findings are entered into a computer data base, assigned to appropriate departments for resolution. Final resolution of the findings is also documented in the data base.\n\n4.4\tOperating Procedures\n\nConvent Refinery maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate. The procedures are maintained current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process. Operating procedures are readily available to operators and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\nUpper and lower operating limits, consequences of deviation, and steps required to correct or avoid deviation for critical parameters, such as pressure, temperature, level, etc., are included in the operating procedures. \n\nIn addition to Operating Procedures, Convent Refinery has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and proces"

Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous materials before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work), and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space. These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\n4.5\tTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, Convent Refinery has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process. New employees receive basic training in refinery operations if they are not  already familiar with such operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator receives on the job training to learn process-specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. \n\nSkills are maintained through refresher training. The operating procedures are grouped into modules, and each operator is expected to review the assigned modules and pass the prescribed tests over a period of three years. Thus, refresher training is a continuing effort. All operator training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\n4.6\tContractors\n\nConvent Refinery uses contractors for routine maintenance activities, maintenance during shutdown periods, and for construction activities. Convent Refinery also uses contractors for less safety sensitive work, such as, security, janitorial, ground maintenance, engineeri"

This is accomplished by: (1) evaluating the safety programs and performance of prospective contractors, (2) basic safety training of contract employees by approved outside agencies, (3) site specific orientation training of contract employees, (4) prework conference with contractor supervision, (5) providing contractors with process overview information, and (6) monitoring contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.  \n \n4.7\tPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\nConvent Refinery conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a significant change in the process safety information. The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service. This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready. The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness. A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented. \n\n4.8\tMechanical Integrity  \n\nConvent Refinery has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps an"
