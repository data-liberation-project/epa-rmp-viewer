This reduces our cost and allows the gas company to maintain a higher line pressure in extremely cold weather. It also acts as a backup should anything happen to the gas line. \n\n7 Quantity: We have three 1000-gallon tanks that are connected in one process.\n\n7 Scenario: Failure of the storage system containing 12,760 pounds of propane; 10-minute release.\n\n7 Distance to end point: under the worst case the explosive overpressure of 1 psi would reach .19 miles.\n\n7 Accidental release prevention program: The system is built to comply with the NFPA/ANSI 58 Standard for the storage and handling of liquefied petroleum gases. Our preventive maintenance program has a safety check and test firing of this system once a month. To prevent any fire from spreading to close to the tanks, plastic sheeting was put down and covered with rock prior to the tanks being brought in. This area is fenced with a 6-foot storm fence and barbwire to keep unauthorized people out. The fenced area is marked with warning signs and the pipes outside the fence are buried.\n\n7 The five year accident history: There has never been and accident involving this system. \n\n7 Emergency response program: The Emergency plan that is being used at HTI states that we do not try to fight a fire, we evacuate the area and call the local emergency services and the fire department. The building that is nearest does have fire alarms that will notify the county communication center if the sprinkler system starts to use water. The emergency plan also specifies the person responsible for calling emergency help and a system of replacement should"
