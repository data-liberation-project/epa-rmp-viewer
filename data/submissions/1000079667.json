This release, if ignited, would have an off-site industrial impact, but no impact on residential populations, as determined by the use of the RMP Comp software.  The ignition of this release is unlikely because the tank is located in a remote location versus normal ignition sources.\r\n\r\nALTERNATIVE TOXIC RELEASE SCENARIOS\r\n\r\nVinyl acetate monomer (VA) - A pipe leak in either the Vinyl Acetate railcar unloading, transfer piping or storage tank was assumed.  A release duration of 60 minutes was assumed.

Because of the possibly remote location, a release duration of 60 minutes was assumed.  Since a release would vaporize quickly, no mitigation was assumed.  This release has an off-site industrial impact, but no impact on residential populations, as determined by the use of the RMP Comp software.\r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nThe Dow Victoria Site follows the requirements of corporate standards for Process Safety Management.  These standards include the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.119 and 40 CFR Part 68.\r\n\r\nOur Safety Programs include:\r\n\r\nDesigning for Safety ...\r\n   - A documented process technology system covers hazards of materials, equipment design basis, and process design basis.\r\n   - Extensive accident prevention and mitigation systems are strategically located.\r\n   - Applicable codes and standards are met or exceeded.\r\n   - Materials of construction are chosen to provide mechanical integrity.\r\n   - Quality Assurance ensures fabrication in accordance with design specifications and proper assembly."

We have implemented a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public, as well as to protect the environment.  These programs include both internal Responsible Care  requirements and governmental requirements, such as the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) rule and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.\r\n\r\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION\r\n\r\nThe Dow Victoria Site consists of 38 acres, located approximately 9 miles south of the city of Victoria, in a rural setting south of SH 185.  The plant functions as a tenant on the larger INVISTA Victoria Plant site.\r\n\r\nThe plant consists of one manufacturing process producing Ethylene Copolymers (low-density Polyethylene resins).  In the production of these products, the following regulated substances are used as raw materials (except for minor transfer of ethylene waste streams to another on-site company):\r\n- Vinyl Acetate monomer (VA)\r\n- Ethylene\r\n- Propane\r\n- Propylene\r\n\r\nWORST-CASE TOXIC RELEASE SCENARIO\r\n\r\nThe worst-case release scenario for a toxic chemical is failure of a Vinyl Acetate Railcar during unloading, with no mitigation assumed.  This release has an off-site impact, as determined by the use of the RMP Comp software.  This release is unlikely due to operator attendance during unloading and the preventive maintenance program on the railcars and unloading facilities.\r\n\r\nWORST-CASE FLAMMABLE RELEASE SCENARIO\r\n\r\nT"
