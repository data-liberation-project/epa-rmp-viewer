This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention (e.g., training of personnel, considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility, etc.).  Our approach is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances as well as other substances.  If a release does occur, our trained personnel will take steps to control and contain it, until local emergency organizations arrive.  Additional details are included in the other sections of this plan.\r\n\r\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances  \r\n\r\nThe Hawkins Gas Plant, located about 1.5 miles northeast of Hawkins, TX, consists of one Program Level 3 process that utilizes several operations (e.g., compression, dehydration, separation, cryogenic) to produce petroleum products (e.g., natural gas liquid mixture, methane) from a naturally occurring hydrocarbon gas mixture.  \r\n\r\nThis plant could contain regulated flammables but no regulated toxic inventories in excess of threshold quantities established in the regulation.  Transportation into and out of the facility is handled via pipelines and trucks.  The adjacent oil treating station for the field operations handles produced water and condensate (i.e., no regulated flammables) and is not considered part of the covered process.  This plant is located in a rural setting surrounded by pasture and woodlands.\r\n\r\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results \r\n\r\nIn accordance with special security guidance provided by the USEPA, data addressing the facility's Offsite Consequence Analyses (Worst Case Scenarios and Alternate Release Scenarios) are not detailed in this section.

Processes at this plant regulated by EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) are also subject to OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.  This summary addresses each of the EPA RMP elements and describes the management systems in place to implement the accident prevention program.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\n\r\nThis plant provides for and encourages employees to participate in process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating/compiling technical information and drawings to participating on process hazard analysis (PHA) or incident investigation teams.  Employees have access to information related to the accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are detailed in an Employee Participation Plan that is maintained at this plant and addresses each program element.  In addition, this plant has other initiatives that address process and employee safety issues (e.g., hazard reporting/resolution process and numerous safety meetings [daily, monthly, pre-job], etc.).\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information (PSI)\r\n\r\nThis plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the process.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, safe operating limits for key process parameters, specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  The Plant Supervisor is responsible for coordinating the PSI updates.\r\n\r\nChemical-specific information (including exposure hazards, emergency response, and exposure treatment considerations) is provided in safety data sheets.

This information includes the materials of construction, design pressure, temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for inspection/maintenance activities and the evaluation of proposed process or facility changes.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\r\n\r\nThis plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\r\n\r\nIn the most recent PHA cycle, the plant utilized a PHA delta revalidation process, an industry-accepted hazard evaluation technique for RMP and PSM-covered processes.  The analyses are conducted using a team of facility operations/maintenance personnel, facility engineers, and technical consultants (as necessary).  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the processes as well as the accident prevention and mitigation measures.  \r\n\r\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to management to coordinate further evaluation and resolution.  This process involves field level business teams, which include engineering, operations personnel, and management.  Operations personnel are also involved in the evaluation of resolution options.  Implementation of the resolutions is prioritized for accomplishment based on relative risk.  Resolution plans are tracked until completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\r\n\r\nTo help ensure the process controls and/or hazards do no"

The results of these updates are also documented and retained.  Similarly, the team's findings are forwarded to management to coordinate further evaluation and resolution, and the final resolution of findings are documented and retained.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\n\r\nThis plant maintains written procedures that address the various modes of process operations (e.g., startup, normal, temporary, emergency shutdown, normal shutdown) and provide guidance on how to respond to upper/lower limit exceedances for specific equipment or process parameters.  Procedures are readily available to operators and other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.  These procedures provide a consistent basis for training new operators and are annually reviewed and validated.  The Learning Management System (LMS) provides guidance and electronic tools to ensure the procedures are maintained.  Revisions to procedures are made through the Management of Change (MOC) process.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\n\r\nThe Learning Management System (LMS) provides the framework to ensure operators and other employees achieve minimum required competencies to safely perform their work.  The CAS system guides development and maintenance of written operating and maintenance procedures to provide a comprehensive training program to employees involved in operating and maintaining process equipment.  New employees receive basic training in facility operations (e.g., process overview, applicable procedure reviews, etc.).  New operators are then paired with experienced operators to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After the new operators demonstrate (e.g., written tests, hands-on skills demonstration) that they have adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they are certified and allowed to work independently.

Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, procedures are in place to help ensure contractors: perform their work in a safe manner, have the appropriate knowledge and skills, are aware of the hazards in the workplace, understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, understand and follow safety rules, and inform plant personnel of any hazards they find during their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors an orientation prior to working in this plant which includes: a process overview, information about safety and health hazards, applicable emergency action plan provisions, and information on safe work practices.  Also, a job safety analysis (JSA) is reviewed/updated or developed by the contractors (with facility personnel assistance as needed) prior to maintenance/construction tasks.\r\n\r\nPlant personnel routinely monitor contractor job performance to help ensure they are fulfilling their safety obligations.

The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations, and forwards these results to management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings are tracked until completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and investigation results are reviewed with employees (including contractors) who could be affected.  Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that reports can be reviewed during the next PHA revalidation.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits\r\n\r\nTo help ensure the accident prevention program is functioning properly, an audit is conducted at the plant at least once every 3 years to determine whether the program's procedures and practices are being implemented.  An audit team consisting of both facility and technical personnel evaluate the implementation/effectiveness of the processes in this accident prevention program and develop findings that are documented and forwarded to management to coordinate resolution.  Corrective actions are taken in response to the audit team's findings, and resolution status is tracked until actions are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and the two most recent audit reports are retained.\r\n\r\nChemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nThe processes at this plant have hazards that are managed to help ensure continued safe operation.  The following is a description of existing safety features applicable to the prevention of accidental releases of the specific regulated substances.\r\n\r\nUniversal Prevention Activitie"
