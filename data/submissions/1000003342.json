Raw materials received are beef, pork franks, turkey franks, corn, flour, sugar, cooking oil, sticks, and packaging materials.  The corn dogs are processed, cooked, frozen, packaged, and stored for shipment.  The facility processes beef franks from frozen beef, but does not handle live animals or carcasses.  The facility is located at 3900 Meacham Blvd. Haltom City, Texas 76117.  The NAICS code is 311612 (meat processed from carcasses.  Normal hours of operation are 5:45 a.m. to 11:15 p.m. six days per week.  Normal hours for sanitation operations are 11:15 p.m. to 5:45 a.m. six days per week.  The facility currently has 650 full time employees onsite, including plant and administrative personnel.\n\nThe facility operates an ammonia refrigeration system as part of the process to keep products and raw materials fresh and preserve food safety standards.  40 CFR 68.130 lists anhydrous ammonia as a hazardous chemical subject to RMP regulation with a threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds.\n\nThe current anhydrous ammonia inventory in the system exceeds the 10,000 pound threshold.  Anhydrous ammonia recirculates in the system as a liquid and gas depending on system operating pressures and temperatures.  The refrigeration system is designed, installed and operated in accordance with the applicable guidelines and standards of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), the American National Standards Institute (ANSI), the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR), the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-conditioning Engineers, Inc. (ASHRAE).  \n\nThe facility has developed and implemented a Process Safety Management Program (PSM) in accordance with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Standard, 29 CFR 1910.119.  Qualified outside contractors are used for construction and major repairs or modifications to the system."

      "SummaryText": "  The facility's PSM program includes provisions for process hazard analyses, management of change, pre-start up safety reviews, safe work practices, inspections, testing, maintenance, compliance audits, and contractor qualifications.  The PSM program is reviewed annually and updated as necessary.  All significant changes to the system are reviewed in accordance with the PSM / RMP management of change provisions in the facility's plan.  This process is a program level 3 as defined by the Risk Management Program rule (40CFR68). \n\nThe system is continuously monitored and inspected by technicians that are trained, qualified, and experienced in ammonia refrigeration in accordance with the facility's PSM program.  The system is inspected periodically for proper operation 24 hours per day.  Walking inspections are conducted on intervals not longer than 8 hours.  System parameters are logged in a permanent record, as are routine maintenance activities.\n\nThe system is equipped with a series of redundant failsafe devices, sensors, ammonia detectors, and overrides.  In the event a malfunction occurs that could result in an ammonia release, these protective devices shut the system down.  The system can't be restarted until the cause of the shutdown is identified and corrected.  The system is equipped with a shutdown system that is triggered by the presence of ammonia in the engine room.  The system shutdown can be manually operated using a kill switch located outside the engine room.\n \nThe facility has made arrangements with the local fire department and outside contractors to respond to emergencies involving ammonia.  The facility conducts periodic drills.  The facility has never experienced an ammonia release that resulted in any onsite or offsite injuries or any offsite environmental damages.\n\nSara Lee Corporation--Haltom City has complied with the requirements of section 302 and 303 of the Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act (EPCRA) by notifying the State Em"
