Therefore, this Facility is subject to the Risk Management Plan (RMP) requirements codified in Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations Part 68 (40 CFR 68) administered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). \r\n\r\nThe Pelican Plant is also subject to Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29 CFR 1910.119) and public receptors are located within the worst-case release scenario for the plant. Therefore, the Pelican Plant is subject to Program 3 requirements as stated in 40 CFR 68.10. OSHA's PSM standard closely parallels requirements outlined in USEPA's RMP Rule. All elements required by USEPA's 40 CFR 68 - Program 3 Prevention Program are also required by OSHA's PSM. \r\n\r\nThe Pelican Plant has not had an accidental release of a regulated substance where exposure to the substance, its reaction products, overpressure generated by an explosion involving the substance, or radiant heat generated by a fire involving the substance led to any off-site death, injury, or response or restoration activities for an exposure of an environmental receptor.  \r\n\r\nThe Pelican Plant employs 13 full-time employees on-site who ensure the proper operation and maintenance of the Facility.  \r\n\r\nEnLink Midstream Operating, L.P. (EnLink) last submitted a complete RMP 5-year update to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) in February 2012 for the Pelican Plant.  The current RMP includes administrative updates associated with the change from Crosstex Energy to EnLink.  \r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\r\n\r\nThe Pelican Plant maintains a policy of safe NGL extraction operations, re"

NGL is a regulated flammable mixture that is an aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbon mixture. The regulated flammable chemicals contained in the NGL mixture include methane, ethane, propane, isobutane, N-butane, isopentane, and N-pentane. The maximum inventory of NGL at the Facility at any given time is 130,304 gallons (510,766 lbs).  The largest vessel containing NGL at the Facility is 68,000 gallons (266,546 lbs).\r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe Pelican Plant maintains a consistent accidental release prevention program to eliminate or minimize releases of NGL or propane. As previously indicated, the Prevention Program required under 40 CFR 68 is identical to the prevention program required under OSHA's PSM. The Pelican Plant's Prevention Program 3 elements, as required under 40 CFR 68 Subpart D, are included in the Facility's PSM Plan, which is kept on-site as a separate document. Required elements include:  \r\n\r\n\u00bf\tEmployee Participation, \r\n\u00bf\tProcess Safety Information, \r\n\u00bf\tProcess Hazard Analysis, \r\n\u00bf\tOperating Procedures, \r\n\u00bf\tTraining, \r\n\u00bf\tContractors, \r\n\u00bf\tPre-startup Review, \r\n\u00bf\tMechanical Integrity, \r\n\u00bf\tHot Work Permits, \r\n\u00bf\tManagement of Change, \r\n\u00bf\tIncident Investigation, and \r\n\u00bf\tCompliance Audits.\r\n\r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nThe Pelican Plant has had no accidental releases of flammable materials regulated under the RMP program that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on-site, or off-site deaths, injurie"

The Emergency Response Program required under the RMP and PSM Rules must be site-specific and comprehensive, including the following elements: \r\n\r\n\u00bf\tPublic and emergency response agency notification procedures; \r\n\u00bf\tProper first aid and emergency medical treatment; \r\n\u00bf\tEmergency response measures; \r\n\u00bf\tProcedures for inspecting, testing, and maintaining emergency response equipment; \r\n\u00bf\tEmployee training; and \r\n\u00bf\tProgram review procedures. \r\n\r\nThe Pelican Plant maintains written Emergency Shutdown and Startup Procedures (ESSP) that provide guidance for emergencies expected at the Facility. Further safety information is also detailed in the ESSP. In addition, operating procedures and equipment design codes and standards associated with the operations at the Facility are maintained. Furthermore, the Facility has coordinated the emergency response plan with the St. Mary Parish Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and the Patterson Fire Department. The Patterson Fire Department is designated as the first responder in the event of NGL release.  For these reasons, the Pelican Plant meets the exceptions listed in 40 CFR 68.90(b) and therefore the facility is not required to have the Emergency Response Program as described in 40 CFR 68.95.  \r\n\r\nA site map, MSDSs, and a list of chemicals kept on-site are maintained at the facility. Complete details on the Emergency Response Program required under the PSM Rules are included in the Pelican Plant's PSM Plan, which is kept on-site as a separate document.  \r\n\r\nSAFETY IMPROVEMENTS\r\n\r\nEnLink has a continued commitment to update equipment and improve safety pertaining to the covered process when necessary.
