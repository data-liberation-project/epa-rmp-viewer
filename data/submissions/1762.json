('68.155(a) ).\n\nSigma International, Inc. prevents accidental releases through on the job training of refrigeration personnel and ongoing inspection and maintenance of the refrigeration system.  Refrigeration system components are located in areas that are not as likely to become damaged (i.e., tanks placed away and protected from forklift and truck traffic).\n\n2.0  Source and regulated substances handled ('68.155(b)).\n\nApproximately 14,000 lbs. of anhydrous ammonia is contained within the refrigeration system on site at Sigma International, Inc.  The EPA requires a Risk Management Plan be developed and maintained when the total amount of anhydrous ammonia exceeds the threshold quantity of 10,000 lbs.  No other substances, in quantities subject to EPA RMP certification requirements, are located at the Sigma International, Inc. facility.\n\n3.0  Worst Case and Alternate Case Release Scenarios ('68.155(c)).\n\n3.1  Worst Case Scenario (WCS)\n\nThe high pressure receiver, located inside the new equipment room, contains the largest quantity of anhydrous ammonia, on site, on a predictable worst case basis.  This tank holds approximately 10,800 lbs. of anhydrous ammonia when 75% full, under an internal pressure and temperature of approximately 181 psig and 95 0F, during plant shutdown or partial operations. This tank is typically 30% to 50% full during normal operations.  The Worst Case Scenario as required by EPA, assumes that the tank's contents are fully released as a gas/vapor over a 10-minute period.\n\nThe dispersion model, Screen3, predicted, with a wind speed of 3 mph and atmospheric stability class F, the anhydrous ammonia release may travel 1.1 miles from the point of release (See: Appendix B).  Approximately 17,600 people, in the surrounding community, reside within the radius to the toxic endpoint (level of concern = 200 ppm, anhydrous ammonia).  A lis"

Anhydrous ammonia (at approximately 250 psi and 113 0F) was estimated to have a flow rate from the relief valve (inner orifice diameter: 0.75 inches) of approximately 92 lbs./min., determined from an ammonia gas release table.  It is estimated that the relief valve could be isolated, or the overpressure condition corrected, in approximately 10 minutes by trained operators onsite, with a corresponding anhydrous ammonia quantity released of approximately 920 lbs.  The Screen3 air dispersion model predicted, with a wind speed of 6 mph and atmospheric stability class D, that the anhydrous ammonia release may travel approximately 0.1 miles.  Approximately 110 people reside within the radius to the toxic endpoint (level of concern = 200 ppm, anhydrous ammonia).  A list of schools, churches, parks, etc. that are located within the radius to the toxic endpoint are listed in Section 9.0. \n\n4.0  Accidental release prevention program ('68.155(d)).\n\nSigma International, Inc. standard policy requires daily monitoring and inspection of the anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system by trained employees, or contracted services personnel, in accordance with OSHA and IIAR  guidelines.  Accidental release prevention practices at Sigma International, Inc. include:\n\n7 Wonderware. software monitoring program which continuously operates the refrigeration system and is capable of automatically shutting down the system.\n7 Refrigeration system repairs made in a prompt, safe manner.\n7 Annual operator refresher training.\n7 Labeling of all ammonia system pipes and components.\n7 Improved housekeeping.\n\n5.0  5 year accidental history ('68.155(e)).\n\nNo releases or accidents, involv"

Check Point Limited security monitoring company ((352) 326-9111) also receives an alarm whenever an emergency plant shutdown occurs.\n\n6.2  Red Cross shelter resources in the St. Petersburg area consist of pre-arranged service agreements with the local school board and some local churches.  Schools and churches that would serve as a Red Cross shelter would have food, cots, and first aid supplies on site and reserve supplies would be shipped in.  The local Red Cross office warehouse is capable of supplying extra food, cots, basic first-aid supplies, and blankets, with access to the Tampa Red Cross supplies if needed.  An emergency management official (HAZMAT Team, Fire Department, Police Department, etc.) would decide if sheltering in place or evacuation and sheltering is required in a given emergency.  The OEM (Office of Emergency Management) would then direct the Red Cross to activate the shelter(s) determined to be located at a safe distance from the hot area.  Those in need of medical attention would be taken to a nearby hospital.
