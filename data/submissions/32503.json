The scrubbing system disallows chlorine gas to escape to the outdoor atmosphere.\n\nWater Treatment Plant #3 has been also incompliance with OSHA 1910.119 \u00bfProcess Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemical\" for the Chlorine system since October 1995.\n\nRisk Management Program rule allows the facility to incorporate the requirements of OSHA Standard and in effect, provide a facility plan that manages a formal prevention program and emergency response program. The Facility meets compliance with both Risk Management Plan Rule and OSHA's PSMP.\n\n\nProcess Description Overview:\n\nThis facility is designed to safely treat and provide 30 million gallons of safe drinking water to its customers each day meeting the requirements of SDWA with enough pressure for regular usage and fire demand. Chlorine gas is delivered in 1 Ton steel containers ( 2,000 Lbs of Chlorine).A bridge crane and hoist are used  to off-load the containers from the truck and place them inside the chlorine building in holders called trunnions. This prevents containers from moving. Empty containers are removed from the trunnions and placed on the truck to be returned to the supplier. \n\nChlorine gas process is operated such that only four containers are in use at any time and another four containers are on-line in reserve. The containers being used and reserve containers are placed on scales. The scales are used to measure chlorine container contents and system usage. \n\nA vacuum regulator is connected to each 1 ton container and in turn is connected to piping that leads to the chlorinators. The chlorinators are connected to piping then to injectors. The Chlorination process begins when process water flowing through the injector induces vacuum that is maintained throughout the entire chlorine feed system. The chlorinator is set to allow a spec"

The vacuum allows the vacuum regulators on the chlorine containers to open and allow the chlorine gas to enter the piping system. In any situation that decreases the vacuum in the pipelines, the vacuum regulators on the containers will close. This safety feature prevents Chlorine from escaping any part of the system.\n\nThere are chlorine gas detectors inside the chlorine building. The detectors are set to alarm at 1ppm (parts per million) and 3 ppm and activate an audible and visual alarm. At 3 ppm the chlorine gas scrubber unit that is interlocked with the detector will activate. The scrubber system will maintain a negative pressure inside the chlorine building and draw the chlorine gas to where it will be neutralized. No chlorine gas is expected to be emitted to the outside of the chlorine building. \n\nThe chlorine gas feed system has many built-in safety features that minimizes a chlorine gas release to the atmosphere. They are:\nVacuum feed system instead of a pressurized system\nVacuum regulator closes when vacuum is lost (broken pipe)\nVacuum regulator at each container\nChlorine detector and alarm system\nEnclosed chlorine gas system-building\nChlorine gas scrubber system\nOperational procedures\nEmergency action Plans\n\nChlorine is used as a disinfectant in the water treatment process to eliminate the risk of exposure to waterborne diseases such as cholera, typhoid, and dysentery. Chlorine is an approved chemical by EPA and has been used as a disinfectant for almost a hundred years, and today Chlorine is safely used in 98% of all water systems.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program:\n\nBoth EPA RMP and OSHA PSMP requires accidental release prevention program. The release prevention program in the Risk Management Plan for WTP #3 complies with the requirements of both agencies. \n\nThe goal of release prevention program is reduce risk to the employees and the community of injury or death and protection of the environmen"

The following is an overview of the release prevention elements at WTP #2\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis :( PHA)\n\nA PHA is a method of identifying, evaluating and controlling any risks associated with the chlorine process. Hazard and Operability study was used to review the entire chlorine process. Essentially it is a method where all parts of the system (from delivery of chlorine containers to endpoint of chlorine injected into the processed water) are looked at. Any equipment or existing operational procedure that reveals a potential of a release is scrutinized and recommendations are made that will lessen or eliminate the risk of a release. These recommendations are instituted where appropriate.\n\nIt should be noted that the Hazard and Operability Study is a multidisciplinary team approach that allows participants to review risk utilizing their  expertise. Some team members include a Process Hazard Analysis Team Leader, Plant Engineer, Plant superintendent, and Project engineer, Facility Chief Operator, Industrial Electrician, and Utility Plant Mechanic.\n\nOperating Procedures:\n\nWritten operating procedures are in place for all the stages of chlorine system. The facility uses Job Safety Analysis format. This format describes steps to be taken in a job task in proper sequence and integrates critical safety precautions and personal protective equipment necessary to safely perform the task. As example, there are operating procedures for unloading new chlorine containers, system emergency shutdown, initial startup, chlorine scrubber test, chlorine detector test etc. Operators are trained and tested in these procedures.\n\nTraining:\n\nThe purpose of the training is to ensure that personnel working on or near the chlorine process are adequately trained and understands the inherent hazards and appropriate responses.
