Seven of the DuPont Policies, Standards, and Guidelines will remain in effect at the site since DuPont continues to be landlord for the facility.\n  \nDuPont Policies, Standards, and Guidelines are available in hard copy at the facility.  In addition the Sabine River Works site Emergency Manual lays out the complete Emergency Response Program for the site.\n\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION\n\nThe INVISTA Sabine River Works Plant is located approximately 2 miles South of the city of Orange in a rural setting on FM 1006.  The site is located on 72 acres and the facility is secured by a chain-link fence, video cameras, controlled entry, and a 24 hour security force.\n\nThe site consists of manufacturing processes to produce Nylon Intermediates (hexamethylenediamine (HMD), adipic acid(Adipure), and Adiponitrile (ADN)).  In the production of these products, the following regulated substances are used as raw materials, intermediates, or by-products:\n- Ammonia (anhydrous)\n- Chlorine\n- Hydrocyanic Acid (HCN)\n- 1,3-Butadiene\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe INVISTA Sabine River Works Plant processes currently follow the requirements of DuPont Corporate SHE Standard S21A, ?Process Safety Management.?  This Standard includes and embraces the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.119 and 40 CFR Part 68.\n\nOur Safety Programs include:\n\nDesignin"
