Micron works vigorously to continuously improve in support of these commitments.\r\n\r\nMicron is committed to maintaining a safe, healthy, and secure workplace by working to prevent occupational illnesses, injuries, and property losses. Micron also strives to minimize the impact of our operations on the environment by working to identify opportunities to reduce air, water, land and energy impacts at the earliest stages of planning and production.\r\n\r\nMicron holds managers and supervisors responsible for leading, implementing and maintaining safe, secure, and compliant work areas. Management, employees, and contractors are expected to help identify, eliminate, and control environmental, health, safety, and security (EHSS) hazards and risks. All employees and contractors will follow relevant EHSS procedures and applicable legal requirements, including those contained in Micron's Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (found at www.micron.com).\r\n\r\nTHE FACILITY AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCE HANDLED: \r\nThe covered process is a bulk chemical distribution system that supplies high purity White grade gaseous anhydrous ammonia through distribution piping to manufacturing and R&D equipment for metal organic chemical vapor deposition which is a basic step in LED manufacturing.\r\n\r\nContainers:\r\nThe system uses two 20 foot long ammonia International Organization for Standardization (ISO) containers (ISO container) that are owned, filled and maintained by Air Products and Chemicals, Inc (Air Products). The ISO containers are connected to the fixed distribution piping at the specially designed pad with a flexible pigtail.  Each ISO container has approximately 26,000 lbs of liquid anhydrous ammonia when completely full.  Although both ISO containers are connected to the piping system, only one supplies"

When the container reaches its low level, it is disconnected from the piping system and returned to Air Products in Hometown, Pennsylvania to be serviced and filled after being replaced with a full ISO container.\r\n\r\nThe ISO containers come equipped with electric heaters on the bottom of the ISO containers that are plugged in as part of an ISO container change to keep the anhydrous ammonia at a specified temperature to support delivery pressure.\r\n\r\nBulk Ammonia Pad:\r\nThe bulk ammonia pad is a specially designed structure that includes ISO container scales, flexible connections to distribution piping, electrical connections, purge gases, flow controllers, ventilation, safety shower and other safety and support equipment.  The structure at the pad provides safe worker access to the connections at the top of the ISO container and environmental cover for the ISO containers.\r\n\r\nDistribution System:\r\nGaseous ammonia is delivered from the ISO container through a 1 inch heat traced stainless steel pipe along a utility trestle to the building housing process tools. Once inside the building, the pipe goes through a manual distribution box and then a valve manifold box where it is split into eight \u00bd inch pipes for distribution to the equipment after going through a purifier box.\r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS:\r\nMicron utilizes the required PSM/RMP for the anhydrous ammonia regulated process to prevent and minimize the consequences of catastrophic release of anhydrous ammonia. The goal of the PSM is to protect on-site employees and the RMP protects the health and safety of the environment and the community. Components of the PSM/RMP document include:\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information:\r\nInformation pertaining to the hazards of ammonia (toxicity information, permissible exposure limits, physical, reactivity, corrosivity, thermal and chemical stability data, and hazardous effects"

At least every five years the analysis will be updated and revalidated by a team with representation from appropriate groups. A preventative maintenance (PM) work order has been entered in Micron's asset management software (Maximo) to trigger this event.  The work order will dispatch to the safety team who will initiate this effort. All future findings will be promptly addressed with corrective action and completion dates recorded in the analysis.  All process hazard analyses, updates, revalidations, and corrective actions and resolutions will be kept for the life of the process.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures:\r\nWritten operating procedures for the process equipment have been developed, implemented, and are maintained in Micron's document management (MDM) system.  The procedures for ammonia delivery include the following:\r\n\r\n* Steps for each operating phase;\r\n* Operating limits;\r\n* Safety and health considerations; and\r\n* Safety systems and their functions.\r\n\r\nThe operating procedures are available to those that operate and/or maintain the equipment electronically. The operating procedures will be reviewed to ensure they reflect the current practice, including any changes that may have occurred. The existing Periodic Document Review process with Facilities will be used to initiate this review.

All training will require a 3 year recertification which will be obtained through classroom training, computer based assessment or direct supervisor evaluation depending on the complexity of the task. \r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity:\r\nInspection and testing schemes are established for all equipment in the process to ensure on-going integrity and that equipment is installed properly and maintained within design specifications.  The testing and inspections align with manufacturers recommendations and are tracked in Maximo as PM events performed by trained employees. The Maximo record will capture the date, person performing the inspection/test, the serial number or other identifier of the equipment, a description of the inspection/test performed, and the results.

Names of approved companies will be maintained on the PSM Approved Contractor spreadsheet by Safety.\r\n\r\nThe following requirements apply to contract partners involved in the program prior to work being performed on or near the covered PSM/RMP process:\r\n\r\n* Micron evaluates safety performance of the company through the use of the Micron's Independent Contractor EHSS Questionnaire.  Completed forms are stored in MDM after evaluation by Safety;\r\n* Micron informs contractors of the hazards related to the contractors work and the process and the emergency action plan though training on the PSM Training Che"

      "SummaryText": "cklist. This training is conducted during the weekly Facilities contractor training session.  Hosts or other PSM/RMP trained team members may conduct this training if contractor is unable to attend the general orientation prior to beginning work.  Records of the training are maintained in Micron's Train system;\r\n* Micron periodically audits contractor's performance through Micron's existing EHSS auditing processes.  A minimum of one PSM/RMP contractor audit will be performed per year; and\r\n* Contractor injury and illnesses associated with work on or near the covered PSM process will be maintained in a log.  All injuries and illnesses records are maintained in the company SAP database.  For investigation tracking purposes a SharePoint site has been established (alias ICAT - restricted access) to track investigation closure and causal factors.  Events associated with the PSM/RMP covered process will be indicated by the Safety investigator as such, creating a sortable log to distinguish between those related to the covered process. \r\n\r\nMicron's contract partners are expected to do the following:\r\n\r\n* Assure contractor employees are trained in applicable work practices;\r\n* Assure contractor is instructed in the hazards related to their job and the process;\r\n* Document that training was delivered and understood;\r\n* Ensure contractors follow the safety rules of the facility; and\r\n* Advise Micron of any unique hazards presented by contract employer's work.\r\n\r\nMicron has communicated expectations in writing to those contracting companies advising them of their responsibilities associated with potential work on or around the covered process as part of the contractor evaluation process.\r\n\r\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\r\nThe system is new as of the initial filing of the PSM/RMP documents.  There is no accident history associated with this PSM/RMP covered process.\r\n\r\nIn the event that an accidental release from the covered process occurs resulting in deaths, injuries, or signific"

Micron personnel will respond to accidental releases of ammonia. The Boise Micron site is included and participates with Ada City-County Emergency Management, the local emergency planning committee (LEPC). In addition to Micron's existing emergency response team (ERT) system, Micron has completed the following activities applicable to the bulk ammonia distribution system:\r\n\r\n* Received training from the supplier (Air Products) around ERT response methods, hazards and conditions to avoid associated with potential leaks at the ammonia ISO container pad (Air Products ERT Training);\r\n* Conducted training and orientation with the local Fire Department;\r\n* Developed specific response procedures for response to a potential release from the bulk ammonia distribution system; and\r\n* Trained ERT technician level employees on specific response procedures associated with emergency shutdown and containment, evacuation and PPE.\r\n\r\nAll incidents or near misses that occur in the PSM area will be called into Security"

      "SummaryText": "Control.  The caller or responding team members will identify an incident in the ammonia pad area as occurring in a \"PSM Area\".  Responses to gas releases may also be initiated by readings on the toxic gas monitoring system.\r\n\r\nSecurity Control will make the proper pages and phone calls to begin the response and investigation. Local agencies responding to an accidental release receive information through the initial dispatch as well as ongoing information to the Incident Commander via the Incident Command System.  Information is passed between Micron and local responding agencies through this command system.  Information to the public is provided through a PIO (Public Information Officer).  This may be a Micron representative or a representative of the responding agency.\r\n\r\nIn the event of a catastrophic release, the ERT captain will assure that employees involved in an evacuation exit the building away from the ammonia pad.\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\r\nThe covered process is new as of the initial filing of the PSM/RMP documents. As a result, Micron has initiated a new PSM/RMP program associated with this covered process. Micron is committed to maintaining environmental quality and protecting employee health, safety, and security. Micron works vigorously to continuously improve in support of these commitments."
