As a responsible member of the local community, it is the City of Austin's desire to minimize the risks posed by the WWTF.  To this end, the City of Austin submits it's Risk Management Plan to communicate with the public and responders and to assist in the preservation of public safety and environmental protection.\n\n\nThe Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at Our Facility:\n\nIt is the policy of City of Austin WWTF to provide employees with a work place free of recognized health and safety hazards in an effort to conserve our human, physical and financial resources.  The health and well-being of all personnel is important.  It is our policy that everything within reason shall be done to maintain a safe and healthy workplace for all employees.  \n \nEach employee has a place in our accident prevention program and is expected to cooperate fully in all measures taken in loss prevention.  The ultimate goal of the health and safety program is to prevent and reduce employee injuries and illnesses through the administration of an effective health and safety program.  Elements of this program are:\n\n     Maintenance of safe and healthful working conditions.\n     Ensuring employee adherence to proper operating practices and procedures designed to prevent injuries and illness.\n     Observing and applying Federal, State, and Local safety regulations.\n     Each employee is properly trained and instructed on job procedures prior to job     assignments.\n     Providing safety meetings for all employees as a means of obtaining new and updated information and training.\n     Conducting periodic safety and fire inspections to identify potential hazards in the work "

When engineering controls are infeasible or fail to completely control the hazards, administrative controls will be used to minimize employee exposure.  When these types of controls fail, appropriate Personal Protective Equipment will be issued and employees will be trained in its proper use and required to wear it.\n\nEmployees are required to read all safety rules and to know and follow them. A copy of the safety rules is given to each employee.  New employees receive a copy upon hire. Employees are asked to sign an acknowledgment card which states that they have read the safety rules and understand them. This card is kept in the employee personnel file.\n\nUpon initial assignment to a job, employees will be trained in the chemical hazards of the work and appropriate safe work practices and personal protective measures to be employed as per the Minnesota Employee Right-to-Know act.  This initial training will be provided by the Program Coordinator.  The level of training is relevant to the employee's role and responsibilities and is directed at protecting the employee and the environment.\n\n\nOur  Facility and the Regulated Substances Handled:\n\nThe City operates two separate treatment plants.  The City was awarded the Environmental Protection Agency's 1998 National Award of Excellence for outstanding operation and maintenance.  Clean water has always been a priority for the City of Austin.  \n\nThe City's sanitary sewer system dates back to 1904.  The Domestic plant was constructed in 1925 and has been through five upgrades.  The Industrial plant was constructed in 1958 and has been expanded twice.  \n\nTwo treatment plants serve the residents and businesses of Austin.

Hormel & Company goes through pretreatment tanks which are designed to remove fat, oil, grease, and grit.  A lift station pumps an average of 1.8 million gallons per day of wastewater to a flow equalization tank where the wastewater is stored.\n\nAnaerobic Contact Digestion\n\nTwo million gallon digesters biologically reduce the organic and solids by means of high rate mixing and recirculating.  This process produces high volumes of methane gas which is used as fuel in the boiler to heat the digesters.\n\n90% of the organic matter and 80% of the solids are reduced in this process.  The treated wastewater flows to an aeration tank which strips the methane gas from the liquid prior to flowing into four solids separators.  The settled solids (sludge) are returned to the digesters for more treatment"

Rags and grit are removed in this process area to improve treatability of the wastewater.  A flow equalization tank is utilized to store and distribute the wastewater evenly to the primary treatment process.\n\nPrimary Treatment\nThree primary clarifiers remove over 65% of the suspended solids.  The solids settle and are pumped as \"sludge\" to the anaerobic digesters.  The sludge is biologically stabilized before being land applied on area farmland.\n\nSecondary Treatment (High Rate Filters)\nFour trickling filters biologically remove 85% of the organic matter present in wastewater.  The bacteria consume the organic matter in the wastewater as it trickles over 8 feet of rock media.  The treated wastewater flows to intermediate clarifiers for suspended solids removal.\n\nSecondary Treatment (Clarification)\nTwo final clarifiers remove the remaining suspended solids.  These solids are recirculated to the primary treatment area.  The final\"clarified\" water flows to the chlorine contact tanks for disinfection.\n\nNitrification (Low Rate Filters)\nThis biological treatment process removes ammonia nitrogen.  This process consists of 800 nozzles that spray the wastewater on a 10 foot bed of rocks.  The treated wastewater flows to final clarifiers for more suspended solids removal.\n\nDisinfection\nThe treated effluent from both plants combine prior to being disinfected.

The sulfur dioxide used in this process is also contained in one-ton pressurized cylinders which are stored in the Dechlorination Building.  Here the sulfur dioxide is mixed as a solution and then introduced to the Chlorine Contact Tank.

Here, one-ton pressurized cylinders contain the gas which is introduced into wastewater.  The worse-case release accounts for the release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a single vessel or process that results in the greatest distance to an endpoint.  In this case, the worse-case release accounts for the ten minute release from one chlorine one-ton cylinder.  Using the guidance of the EPA/CEPP manual entitled \"Risk Management Program Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants\", the worse-case release scenario has been estimated as 1.3 miles to endpoint.  This release would impact approximately 22,000 residents and include the public receptors of schools, hospitals, recreation areas, and major commercial or industrial areas.\n\nThe dechlorination process utilizes sulfur dioxide contained in one-ton pressurized cylinders which is mixed into the effluent to effectively dechlorinate"

This release would impact approximately 22,000 residents and include public receptors of schools, hospitals, recreation areas, and major commercial or industrial areas.\n\nAlternative Release Scenarios\nThe more plausible scenario that would have a greater likelihood of occurrence would be failure, or break away, of the one-inch diameter valve body located near the center of the cylinder head.  This scenario is likely to occur for both for chlorine and sulfur dioxide since their containers and handling procedures are identical.  Since the chlorination and dechlorination (storage and handling) is conducted in two separate buildings, it is reasoned that this accident would most likely occur within these enclosures.  As such, the release-rate-multiplicative factor of 55 percent has been factored in as a passive mitigation.  \n\nUsing the EPA/CEPP guidance manual \"Risk Management Program Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants\", the distance to endpoint for chlorine has been calculated as 0.6 miles.  This release would impact approximately 18,000 residents and include public receptors of schools, hospitals, recreation areas, and major commercial or industrial areas.\n\nUsing the EPA/CEPP guidance manual \"Risk Management Program Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants\", the distance to endpoint for sulfur dioxide has been calculated as 0.5 miles.
