      "SummaryText": "The Tulsa Product Supply Center is a 750,000 square foot food distribution warehouse that contains refrigerated areas for perishable items.  The 131,000 square foot refrigerated areas of the warehouse is cooled by an anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system.  Anhydrous ammonia, a substance regulated by EPA, is one of the most economical refrigerants available.  However the properties of ammonia makes it necessary to observe certain safety precautions while operating the refrigeration system to prevent t employee exposure, and to reduce the threat of exposure to nearby members of the community.\n\nThe Tulsa Product Supply Center has chosen to follow the EPA?s Chemical Accident Prevention Rule, Program Level 3, to prevent a release of ammonia from the refrigeration system.  The amount of ammonia estimated to be contained inside the refrigeration system is 50,000 pounds.  \n\nThe Tulsa Product Supply Center complies with EPA?s Accidental Release Prevention Rule, and applicable state codes and regulations to prevent a catastrophic release of ammonia.  The ammonia refrigeration system has been constructed according to the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration guidelines (IIAR).  The operators of the systems are required to complete a training and certification program to operate the ammonia refrigeration systems. \n\nThe Accidental Release Prevention Rule does not guarantee against an accidental release.  An offsite consequence analysis was completed using a computer model to simulate a release of the ammonia from the refrigeration system.  The worse case scenario considered the loss of the total charge of 50,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia in the refrigeration system over a 10-minute period.  The analysis showed that the ammonia vapor could travel approximately 6,336 yards (19,008 feet).  There are approximately 13,756 residents within the potentially affected area.  There are other public receptors (schools, hospitals, daycare centers, and industrial/commercial buil"

In this event, a release of 2,000 pounds of ammonia is postulated to occur through a two inch line, 300 feet long, over a ten minute period of time at ground level with no mitigation factors considered.  It was determined that a release could travel approximately 369 yards (1,107 feet).  There are public receptors (industrial/commercial buildings) in the potentially affected area.  \n\nNo administrative controls or mitigation measures were used to limit the chemical release distances for either scenario. \n\nThe Tulsa Product Supply Center has an established Emergency Response Plan to respond to emergencies.  The plan was developed in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.120 Hazardous Waste Operations Emergency Response (HAZWOPER).  The plan requires Fleming associate to exit the facility during a fire or ammonia release to a safe area.  The emergency agencies will be notified of the emergency.  The emergency agencies will notify any potentially affected neighbors.  Fleming maintenance associates will be available as a resource during an ammonia release emergency.  The plan also addresses natural hazard emergencies, fires, bomb threats, civil disturbances, and utility outages.  \n\nThis location has not experienced an ammonia release in the past 5 years. \n\nThe Tulsa Product Supply Center wanted to evaluate the potential failures of the refrigeration system, and if the safeguards were sufficient to prevent a catastrophic release of ammonia.  A Process Hazard Analysis update was completed on the refrigeration system on July 11, 2002.  Planned changes to improve safety resulting from this analysis are documented in the Process Hazard Analysis report in the Accidental Chemical Release Prevention Rule.  Also, the guidelines form the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigera"
