To prevent and/or minimize any potential future release of anhydrous ammonia, DPI  Facility is implementing a detailed Process Safety Management program (Preventive Program 3).\n\n6. The emergency response program\n\nEmergency response is discussed in Section 5 of the RMP.  DPI  Facility has an Emergency Response Plan (ERP) for their facility.  The purpose of this plan is to provide the means for rapidly determining the appropriate response for any emergency that may develop at the facility.  DPI  Facility conducts drills of the emergency response plan. The Emergency Response Program is written, includes specific actions to be taken in response to an emergency, includes procedures for informing the public and local agencies responsible for responding to an accidental release.\n\n\n7. Planned changes to improve safety\n\nDPI  Facility is incorporating and addressing any recommendations resulting from the Process Hazard Analysis, Offsite Consequences, and program audits.  The flexibility of the program allows DPI  Facility to respond effectively to prevent or minimize any potential exposure of DPI  Facility employees, the surrounding public, and/or the environment to a release of anhydrous ammonia. Specific actions taken to improve safety are the implementation of the Program 3 Prevention Program described above, improved operator training, administrative controls, and computerized system controls."

The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the stationary source\n\nTo address concerns of an accidental release, prevention and emergency response, personnel are trained in ammonia emergency response procedures and use of appropriate protective equipment.  Refresher training and emergency response drills are conducted on a periodic basis.  \n\nAs a result of information gathered during preparation of this Risk Management Program, DPI  Facility is committing additional resources to further increase employee awareness and equipment reliability and to establish operator training and preventive maintenance programs.  As a demonstration of DPI  Facility\u00c2\u00bfs degree of commitment to public safety and service, DPI  Facility is taking action to decrease the risk of ammonia exposure to the public by implementing recommendations made during the Process Hazards Analysis, Compliance Audit and Off-site Consequence Analysis.\n\n2. The stationary source and regulated substances handled\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is used as a refrigerant in the DPI  Facility refrigeration system.  The liquid is circulated as needed to the heat exchangers where heat is absorbed and removed from freezers and coolers.  The anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system is a closed loop industrial refrigeration system.  The ammonia is not used or mixed in any manner"
