(KIK) (formerly CCL Custom Manufacturing, Inc.) operates a warehouse in Danville, Illinois which is subject to U.S. EPA regulations governing Accidental Release Prevention Requirements:  Risk Management Programs (RMP) under Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act (40 CFR Part 68).  This Risk Management Plan has been developed in accordance with the requirements specified under 40 CFR part 68, Subpart G.  The Risk Management Plan certifies that KIK has instituted a Risk Management Program at the Danville, Illinois warehouse that is in compliance with U.S. EPA RMP requirements.\n\nThe Risk Management Plan follows the format provided by the RMP Data Elements published by U.S. EPA.  In addition to identifying the applicable corporate policies and risk management systems, including comprehensive accident prevention and emergency response programs, the Risk Management Plan establishes that the warehouseA?s worst-case release and five-year accidental release history qualifies the warehouse for Program Level 1 status under the RMP regulation.  This signifies that the KIK Danville warehouse does not pose an off-site hazard to the public.\n\nKIK initially submitted a Risk Management Plan in June 1999 and updated the plan in June 2004.  Under 40 CFR 68, Risk Management Plans must be updated at least once every five years.  KIK has updated the plan for 2009 in accordance with EPA guidance and has made minor changes; however, no conclusions have changed.  This document presents the updated Risk Management Plan for the KIKA?s Danville Warehouse.\n\n1.1    Corporate Statement\n\nKIK Custom Products recognizes and believes in the importance of safeguarding both our natural resources and our environmental heritage.  As such, we are committed to our customers, employees, and the various communities in which we operate to protect the health of our environment through the development and maintenance of programs which:\n\n"

      "SummaryText": "nagement regulation identifies three levels of requirements for industrial processes.  Program 1 can be applied to any process which has not had a A?significantA? release of a regulated substance over the previous five years and for which the worst-case release does not affect A?public receptorsA? (e.g., residences, parks and recreation areas, commercial/industrial facilities, hospitals).  Because the KIK warehouse meets these criteria, it qualifies for Program Level 1 status according to 40 CFR 68.  RMP Program 1 requires a review of the five-year accident history and evaluation of a worst-case release to verify that public receptors would not be affected, and procedures to notify off-site emergency response agencies (e.g., fire department) of the on-site hazards associated with the regulated substance.\n\nKIK operates a warehouse at 714 West Ross Lane in Danville, Illinois that can store up to seven million aerosol cans.  These aerosol cans contain various amounts of flammable hydrocarbon propellants to provide the pressure to force the product from the container.  Combinations of up to four regulated flammable chemicals used as propellants may be present in quantities exceeding the 10,000-lb threshold for flammable substances established by the regulation.  The regulated substances include isobutane, n-butane , 1,1-diflurorethane, and dimethyl ether (DME).  With an average amount of 40 grams of propellant per can, the total amount of propellant stored in the warehouse is estimated to be up to 617,300 pounds.   According to the RMP regulation, a vapor cloud explosion of the flammable material inside a single vessel (which in the case of the KIK warehouse is a single aerosol can) is considered the worst-case release in the storage process.\n \n3.0     ACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThere are no specific accidental release prevention program requirements for Program 1 processes under 40 CFR 68.  KIK operates its warehouse in a manner that promotes safety and has systems in p"

The fire department is aware of the presence of flammable substances in the warehouse.\n \n4.0    FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nDuring the past five years (June 2004 to June 2009), KIK Custom Products has not had a release of regulated flammable substances from the Danville warehouse that has caused onsite or offsite injuries, emergency response, offsite evacuations, or damage to property or the environment.  \n"
