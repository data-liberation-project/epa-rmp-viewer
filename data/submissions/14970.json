THE FACILITY IS DESIGNED AND MAINTAINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ALL LOCAL, STATE AND FEDERAL RULES AND REGULATIONS.  THE KANSAS DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE INSPECTS OUR FACILITIES ON AN ANNUAL BASIS AND WE COMPLY WITH ALL THEIR REQUEST FOR PLANT IMPROVEMENT.\n\nTHE WORST CASE SCENARIO WOULD RELEASE OUR LARGEST TANK OF 131,000 POUNDS WITH A DISTANCE TO ENDPOINT OF 1.5 MILES WHICH HAS THE POTENTIAL TO AFFECT APPROXIMATELY 2500 AREA RESIDENTS.\n\nTHE EMPLOYEES WHO WORK IN THE AMMONIA PLANT ARE TRAINED ON A REGULAR BASIS IN THE SAFETY INFORMATION, HAZARDS, OPERATING PROCEDURES AND MAINTENANCE PRACTICES.  WORKERS IN THE AMMONIA PLANT ALWAYS USE GOGGLES AND WEAR THE APPROPRIATE GLOVES WHILE FILLING NURSE TANKS.  CLEAN SAFETY WATER IS ALWAYS PRESENT DURING AMMONIA OPERATIONS.\n\nTHE SAFETY RECORD OF THIS COMPANY IS VERY EVIDENT, AND ALLOW S US TO REPORT THAT NO INJURY ACCIDENTS OR PROPERTY DAMAGE HAVE OCCURED AT THE STORAGE FACILITY WITHIN THE LAST FIVE YEARS.\n\nTHE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN HAS BEEN SHARED WITH THE LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENT AND THEY'VE TOURED OUR FACILITY TO MAKE THEM MORE AWARE OF THE DANGERS OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA.  THEY'VE ALSO, AGREED TO ASSIST US IN THE EVENT OF AN ACCIDENTAL RELEASE OR ANY OTHER TYPE OF ACCIDENT THAT MAY OCCUR."
