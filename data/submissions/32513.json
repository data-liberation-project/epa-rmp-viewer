This objective will never be compromised and is the most basic obligation of all personnel at the plant. In fulfilling this commitment, we ensure that all Corporate Environmental, Health and Safety Policies and Principles are strictly followed. \n\nCollectively we have the responsibility to provide a positive impact on the Kankakee Community. This is accomplished by the elimination of hazardous exposures, injuries, fires, environmental releases, or damage to property. We are firmly committed to the protection of the health and welfare of our employees and the surrounding community. This objective is accomplished by using a hierarchy of controls, which emphasize engineering controls followed by administrative controls and personal protective equipment.\n \nThe plant\u00bfs emergency response plan is based upon a combination of governmental and company requirements. Local response capabilities have been reviewed to ensure a coordinated response with all appropriate agencies. The emergency response plan includes procedures for the notification of the local fire and police departments, governmental agencies, as well as any potentially affected neighbors.\n \nKankakee Facility and Regulated Substance Handled:\n \n\u00b7 The primary purpose of the Rohm and Haas Kankakee Plant is to produce emulsions.  One of the raw materials used for the production of these emulsions is Vinyl Acetate, which is regulated under the EPA RMP Rule.  The finished product leaving the plant contains very low concentrations of this chemical, such that they no longer present a toxicity hazard.\n\u00b7 Vinyl Acetate is transported to the plant in both railc"

The unloading and manufacturing systems have all the necessary equipment for the safe unloading of railcars into the storage tanks.\n\u00b7 Access to the Rohm and Haas Kankakee Plant is restricted to authorized employees, and authorized contractors.  All persons seeking to enter the plant are required to undergo training in the plant safety rules before they are allowed entry.\n   \nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program And Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:\n \nThe Rohm and Haas Kankakee Plant complies with both the OSHA PSM, and the EPA RMP Rules, as well as with all applicable governmental codes and regulations.  Included in the Kankakee Plant\u00bfs accidental release prevention plans are  automated processes with level and flow measurement and control, minimum inventories of chemicals,  automatic emergency shut-off valves, redundant safety interlocks, preventative maintenance programs, chemical detectors, remotely operated valves to isolate and minimize a release, annual training of employees, and multiple layers of site security. A comprehensive training and testing program has been developed for all plant employees to ensure that all equipment is operated in a safe and efficient manner.\n\nIncluded in the Kankakee Plant\u00bfs emergency response program are trained Incipient Fire Responders, trained Technician Level HAZMAT Responders, trained Industrial Medical Responders, trained Incident Commanders, onsite fire and spill response foam capability, onsite HAZMAT response equipment, fixed water spray fire protection systems, strategically located chemical sensors, onsite fire water containment basin(s), plant notification systems including alarms, phones, and radios, and neighbor/community notification procedures.  This personnel and equipment is maintained ready for use throughout all plant operations.\n\n\nFive-Y"

      "SummaryText": "ear Accident History:\n \nDuring the past five years, no releases of Vinyl Acetate with off site consequences has occurred. \n \nEmergency Response Program:\n \nThe Rohm and Haas Kankakee Plant has an emergency response plan that has been coordinated with the community plan. The plan includes procedures for public notification of emergencies that may affect the surrounding community.  Our responders have participated in training and drills with the local fire department. Site HAZMAT plans are also coordinated with a private outside contractor. The site emergency response plan has been designed to meet the requirements of all relevant regulations requiring emergency response plans.  The plan is intended to prevent hazardous material spills, protect the health and well-being of Rohm and Haas employees and neighbors, protect the assets Rohm and Haas and its neighbors, protect the environment, and serve as a reference to responders in the event of an emergency.\n \nPlanned Changes To Improve Safety:\n\nThe Rohm and Haas Kankakee Plant has conducted numerous risk analysis studies on the processes that involve Vinyl Acetate.  As a result of these studies, a large number of process safety improvement projects have been completed to ensure the continued safe operation of this equipment in the plant. Currently, the plant is considering the effectiveness of possible changes in the following two areas: fire protection and site security. A decision will be made in the future as to whether specific changes will be made in these two areas. Additionally, the Kankakee Plant will continue past practices of periodically reviewing this processes to ensure continued safe operations."
