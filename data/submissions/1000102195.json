Once the safety orientation is complete, the contractor is responsible for ensuring that each contractor employee performs the assigned work in a manner consistent with the information provided during the safety orientation. If the contractor assigns new employees to the job after work has commenced, the contractor must also ensure that each new employee receives a safety orientation prior to starting work on plant. Failure of the contractor or any contractor employee to abide by these requirements is grounds for immediate dismissal from the plant.\n\n4. The Five Year Accident History:\n\nNone\n\n5. The Emergency Response Plan:\n\nAn Emergency Response/contingency Plan has been developed to provide a formal emergency preparedness program that protects human health and property for both the employees and surrounding community in the event of an emergency such as: fire; explosion; release of highly hazardous chemicals (HHC); transportation emergency; criminal acts; and natural emergency.  This plan also formalizes the arrangements with local police, local neighbors, fire departments, hospitals, and emergency response contractors, and all governing state and federal agencies in case of an emergency.  A copy of this plan is available to each employee and is intended to meet the mandates of the Occupational Safety & Health Act, 29 CFR 1910.119 (Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals), and all other applicable state, federal, and local governing authority requirements.\n\n6.

Hot Work Permits\nIngredion Moses Lake has established a hot work permit system. Under the system, a hot work permit must be issued prior to commencing hot work operations. Hot work operations may include burning, welding, torch cutting, or any spark-emitting equipment/activity. The hot work permit indicates the type and method of hot work to be conducted, the equipment the hot work will be performed on, the date, time, and location authorized for the hot work, the presence of fire prevention and protection systems meeting the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.252(a), and signatures of the supervisory employees authorizing the hot work. A separate hot work permit must be issued for each hot work operation, and a separate hot work permit must be issued for each day. A copy of the hot work permit must be displayed at the job location while hot work is in progress, and the permit is maintained on file after the completion of the hot work.\n\n3l. Contractors\nPrior to retaining contractor services for work in the process area, the contractor's safety performance and program is evaluated. This includes a 3-year review of the contractor's Total Case Incident Rate (TCIR), review of OSHA recordable injuries and illnesses and corrective actions, review of Lost Work Day Cases Away (LWDCA) and corrective actions, review of the contractor's safety program including safety policies, training, and medical monitoring, and review of any applicable plant-specific health and safety plan prepared by the contractor.\n\u00a0\nPrior to commencing work at the plant, each contractor employee receives a safety orientation provided by Ingredion.

Incident Investigation\nAll incidents that resulted in, or could have resulted in, a release of phosphorous oxychloride are investigated promptly.  The incident investigation starts with the completion of an Incident Investigation Report prepared by the supervisor on duty at the time of the incident, and is distributed to the incident investigation team. The incident investigation team is made up of employees having experience and knowledge of the processes affected by the incident, and knowledge of completing incident investigations. Following the incident investigation, a report is prepared to include the following information: (a) date, time, and location of the incident; (b) employees involved in the incident, and their roles; (c) date of the incident investigation; (d) names of employees on the incident investigation team; (e) description of the incident, including a chronology of events; (f) root causes and contributing causes, including conditions at the time of the incident; and (g) recommendations to prevent a recurrence.

Mechanical Integrity\nIngredion Moses Lake maintains the mechanical integrity of equipment used to process and handle phosphorous oxychloride. Such equipment includes pressurized vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, pressure relief and vent systems, emergency control devices, pumps, and valves. Written procedures are established to define the scope and requirements of the mechanical integrity program. Maintenance employees engaged in carrying out the mechanical integrity program are trained to complete the required tasks in a safe manner.\n\u00a0\nOne component of the mechanical integrity program includes inspection and testing of process equipment. Equipment inspection and testing is conducted in accordance with manufacturer's recommendations and generally accepted good engineering practices. Records of inspections and testing are maintained to show the date, equipment identification, inspector, type of test or inspection performed, and test results or observations. If deficiencies are noted during equipment inspection and testing, corrective actions are taken in a timely manner to assure safe operation of the process. In some cases, equipment inspections are driven by permit requirements as well as the mechanical integrity program. For example, process pumps are inspected visually on a weekly basis, and quantitatively for leaks on a quarterly basis, in accordance with specific air permit requirements.\n\n3f.
