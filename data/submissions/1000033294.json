The facility incorporates safe work practices on a daily basis. In the event of an emergency, Chemstar will activate an immediate and organized action plan coordinated with the City of McPherson, with its main objectives, to protect the surrounding community, its employees and the environment. \n\n\n\nThe current design and location of the propylene oxide storage vessel minimizes the distance-to-end-point radius and reduces the impact to the surrounding community in the event of an emergency.\n\n\n\nThe prevention plan includes Employee Participation for developing PHA's and employee awareness of the covered process. Process Safety Information has been developed for all propylene oxide equipment to ensure specific industry standards are followed. Process Hazard Analysis is conducted every 5-years or as changes are implemented to the system. Operating Procedures are updated and certified annually. Maintenance and Operator Training is conducted every 3-years or as changes are made to the system. Contractor qualification is required for any work that is conducted on the system. Pre-Startup Safety Review is conducted prior to new equipment startups.  Mechanical Integrity is conducted on an annual basis and periodically. Hot Work Permit and Line Opening Permits are required for contractors and employees to work on the system. Management of Change is required to make a change to or add equipment to the system and is the road map for updating other PSM programs. Incident Investigations are conducted in event of an injury, a fatality, a release/spill, shelter-in-place event or community evacuation. Emergency Action Plans are implemented and coordinated with the LEPC and Fire Department. Compliance Audits are performed every 3-years to verify compliance for the prevention program.\n\n\n\nThere has not been an accident in the l"
