The Worst-Case Release Scenario and the Alternative-Case Release Scenario for\n      Each Regulated Substance:\n\nToxic:\n\nAmmonia\nThe worst-case scenario for the release of ammonia is a catastrophic failure in the ammonia storage tank.   The full capacity (250,000 lbs) of the tank is assumed to be released and vaporized.  This would have off-site impact.  Even though safety controls such as alarms, a concrete dike to contain releases, and water monitors to absorb any NH3 vapors are in place, no credit was taken for these active mitigation measures to evaluate this worst-case scenario.\n\nThe alternative-case scenario is the release of ammonia through a pressure relief valve\nlocated on the ammonia column.  A reflux failure or cooling loss causes the column to over-pressure and the relief valve to lift.  This results in a release of  17,700 lbs of ammonia, which  would have an off-site impact.\n\nFlammable:\n\nIsopropylamine\nThe worst-case scenario for the release of isopropylamine is a catastrophic failure in the storage tank.   The full capacity (8,800,000 lbs) of the tank is assumed to be released and vaporized, causing a vapor cloud explosion. This would have off-site impact.  However, no credit was taken for the active mitigation measures in place, such as safety controls and a containment dike, to evaluate this worst-case scenario.\n\nEthylamine\nThe alternative-case scenario is the release of ethylamine through a pressure relief valve located on the storage sphere, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  This tank over-pressure is caused by an external fire.  This results in a release of 12,500 lbs of ethylamine, which would not have off-site impact. However, ignition sources are limited near the storage tank and the containment d"

Compliance is maintained for all applicable Federal and state rules and regulations.  This facility is ISO 9002 certified for the quality of the process and is re-audited every six months.  Employees help incorporate safe work practices through extensive health and safety training.\n\nThis facility\u00bfs emergency response program is compliant with OSHA\u00bfs HAZWOPER regulation.  This facility communicates regularly and works closely with the Louisiana Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), the Iberville Parish Office of Emergency Preparedness (OEP), and other community responders.  Detailed emergency response plans incorporating the OEP, the local police and fire departments, are in place at this facility.\n\n\n2.Hazardous Chemicals Used and Produced in Quantities Greater than the EPA Threshold Limit:\n\nThe Taminco Higher Amines Inc. St. Gabriel Plant is a highly automated manufacturing facility of alkyl-based amines, located on approximately 160 acres 12 miles south of Baton Rouge, LA.  Anhydrous ammonia and alcohols are reacted to produce amine products, such as ethylamines and isopropylamines.  These amines are then used by other companies to produce a variety of products, such as pharmaceuticals, detergents, automobile coatings, carpet fiber, particle board, plastics, clothing dyes, latex rubber gloves, herbicides, and pesticides. \n\nAmmonia,  hydrogen, ethylamine, and isopropylamine are stored in quantities greater than the EPA threshold limit for hazardous chemicals.  The maximum storage capacities of these regulated substances at this facility are:\n\n                         Storage Tank 1        Storage Tank 2      Total\nAmmonia:             2"

All worst-case release scenarios assumed an atmospheric stability class of F and a wind speed of 1.5 m/s.  All alternative-case release scenarios assumed an atmospheric stability class of D and a wind speed of 3 m/s.  Endpoints were calculated for an urban topography.\n\n \n4. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Specific Prevention Steps:\n\nThe St. Gabriel facility of Taminco Higher Amines Inc. takes a pro-active role regarding accidental release prevention:\n*This facility is ISO 9002 certified and is re-audited every 6 months.  \n*This facility is compliant  with the Process Safety Management Program and the OSHA 1910 Process Safety Management Guidelines.\n*Hazard reviews are conducted for all new processes and procedures.\n*All government standards for permits are met and maintained.\n*Safety controls, such as warning alarms and interlocks, provide an active defense.\n*Automatic shut-off valves and pressure relief devices protect against unexpected changes in temperature or pressure.\n*Equipment is routinely inspected through a Mechanical Integrity Program.\n*Standard operating procedures and engineering practices are kept updated and online.\n*Employees and contractors receive extensive health and safety training.\n\n\n5. Five Year Accident History:\n\nThis facility has had one accidental release in the past five years.  It occurred on June 15, 2000 during normal operating conditions.   A pipe failure that resulted in a  6 inch by 11 inch hole, caused  total of  10,538 lbs of chemicals, including water, to be released.   A total of 6,518 lbs of ammonia, ethane, ethylamine, hydrogen, methane, and propane were released to the air and, in addition, 4,019 lbs was contained by emergency procedures and actions. There was no off site impact as a result of this accide"
