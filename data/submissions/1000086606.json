Occidental Chemical Corporation (OxyChem) is a wholly owned subsidiary of Occidental Petroleum Corporation.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at the Stationary Source (A\u00a7 68.155(a))\r\n\r\nOccidental Chemical Corporation has established a system for the safe operation of the processes at this facility that includes the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  One component of this system is a program to manage the risks of accidental releases at the Deer Park VCM facility.  This program conforms to the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirement Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule) and requirements of OSHA 1910.119.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMP plan requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at the Deer Park VCM facility.\r\n\r\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled (A\u00a7 68.155(b))\r\n\r\nThe Deer Park VCM facility consists of a single chemical production plant that is owned and operated by OxyChem.  A single process has been defined for this stationary source: Vinyl Chloride Process.  The facility handles six substances that are regulated by the RMP rule.  These substances are -\r\n\r\nChlorine\r\nChloroform\r\nEthyl Chloride\r\nHydrogen Chloride\r\nPropylene\r\nVinyl Chloride\r\n\r\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Specific Prevention Steps (A\u00a7 68.155(c))\r\n\r\nThe Deer Park VCM facility's prevention program has been prepared so that it conforms to both the OSHA Process Safety Management and the EPA Risk Management Plan regulations.  The program consists of the following elements:\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Mechanical Integrity, Management of C"

These manuals are routinely updated.\r\n\r\nFive-year Accident History (A\u00a7 68.155(d))\r\n\r\nThere was one RMP accident within the Vinyl Chloride Process during the past 5 years.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program (A\u00a7 68.155(e))\r\n\r\nThe Deer Park VCM facility has established a written emergency response plan and maintains an emergency response team (ERT) trained in these emergency response procedures.  All plant personnel are trained in evacuation procedures and in-plant drills are conducted periodically.  The drills are used to test the response time of the Emergency Response Team, to test the plant employee accountability program, and to activate the plant's Emergency Operations Center (EOC).  In addition, the Deer Park VCM facility has developed a Special Situations Plan (SSP) which is a program designed for responding to emergencies that may have impacts beyond the immediate plant and is a supplement to the Emergency Response Plan.  The Special Situation Plan links the local response to the OxyChem Corporate Emergency Response Center located in Dallas, Texas.\r\n\r\nThe facility is a member of the Deer Park Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), which includes industrial and public entities.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety (A\u00a7 68.155(f))\r\n\r\nThe Deer Park VCM facility constantly tries to improve the safety of the processes through annual reviews of our plant procedures, near misses and incident investigation programs, and a program soliciting safety and environmental suggestions from the plant employees."
