              "Description": "The Panola Gas Processing Facility is committed to worker safety, protection of the public and of the environment. In addition to a facility-specific Emergency Response Plan, Marlin Midstream has prepared and implemented a Spill Prevention, Control and Countermeasure (SPCC) Plan, for implementation in the event of a release of oil. A public liaison has been established with the local LEPC to facilitate integrated contingency planning and coordinated response efforts in the event of an emergency.\n\n\n\nIt is Marlin Midstream?s policy is to establish reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. Facility design and installation processes demonstrate this commitment, and plant personnel receive training commensurate with their job responsibilities during normal operations, as well as for emergency response.  However, if a release does occur, the Emergency Response Plan will be initiated and trained gas plant personnel will respond to control and contain the release as well as notify local emergency response agencies for assistance.\n\n\n\nThe processes at the Panola Gas Processing Facility are regulated by the EPA's Risk Management Program regulations as well as OSHA's PSM Standard.  Below is a summary of the elements of these programs.\n\n",

This RMP is intended to work in synergy with the facility's Emergency Response Plan prepared for this area, and maintain a liaison with the local emergency responders.\n\n\n\nThe Panola Gas Processing Facility (PGP) is located in Panola County, Texas, east of the town of Carthage.  This facility is located at the global position of 32.1838? N and -94.2563? W, WGD84 datum.  The facility is owned and operated by Marlin Midstream, LLC.\n\n\n\nThe plant processes natural gas from various oil and gas production facilities in the vicinity. The acid gas components (carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide) are removed from the gas using an amine unit.  The sweetened gas is then dried using a glycol dehydrator.  The gas is further dried in molecular sieve dehydrators. The dried gas is then routed to a cryogenic skid, in which the gas is expanded from higher pressure to lower pressure causing the natural gas liquids (NGL) to separate from the gas stream.  The refrigeration system contains propane stored in a 30,000 gallon pressurized steel tank.  NGLs are contained in a separate 28,843 gallon insulated, pressurized steel tank.  The components of NGL (ethane, propane, butane, iso-butane and pentane) are classified as regulated flammable substances and are present in the product in an amount greater than the threshold quantity of 10,000 lbs.  Less than 10,000 lbs of hydrogen sulfide is present in the inlet gas, and thus not included in this RMP review.\n\n\n\nThe PGP is qualified in the Level 3 Program for risk management.  The worst-case scenario for plant release is identified as a gas vapor cloud explosion (VCE), and is projected to reach offsite receptors with an endpoint of 0.40 miles from th"

The plant's Process Hazard Analysis team has conducted the \"HAZOP/WHAT IF\" methods of process hazard review.
