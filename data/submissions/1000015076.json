      "SummaryText": "Section 1\tExecutive Summary\n\nThe Five Star Water Supply District (hereinafter Five Star) has developed a Risk Management Plan (RMPlan) for a new water treatment facility in an effort to protect human health, to protect the environment and meet applicable federal regulations.  This facility produces drinking water for the Prattville Water Works Board of the City of Prattville, Water Works Board of the City of Wetumpka, Tri-Community Water System, City of Millbrook, and the Holtville Water System.  The facility is located at:\n\nFive Star Water Supply District\n251 Lakeview Drive\nWetumpka, AL   36092\n\nThis RMPlan has been developed to meet the standards published in the 40 Code of Federal Register (CFR) part 68.  In order to meet the accidental release prevention provision under the Clean Air Act \u00c2\u00a7112(r)(7), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), promulgated these regulations.  The provisions require facilities that exceed the cited threshold quantities for certain chemicals to develop a RMPlan.  The goal of a RMPlan is to focus on reducing the risk of accidental releases of certain chemicals; thereby, preventing harm to employees as well as potentially catastrophic impacts to the public.  Over 60 accidental releases of regulated chemicals at water treatment plants (WTP\u00c2\u00bfs) and wastewater treatment facilities in the United States were reported between 1986 and 1995. \n\nChlorine is currently stored and/or used in the water treatment process at these facilities and the quantities stored on site exceed the 2,500-pound threshold for coverage under the RMP Program.  Currently, chlorine is delivered to the facilities in 1-ton cylinders.  Typically, four, 2,000-pound cylinders are on-site.\n\nIn order to illustrate the areas that could be impacted from a release of the chemicals into the atmosphere, a hazard analysis was conducted to determine the offsite consequences.  Two analyses were performed in order to estimate the offsite consequences from two release scenarios.  The"

      "SummaryText": "first release scenario is the case defined by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as the \u00c2\u00bfworst case\u00c2\u00bf scenario.  This scenario assumes that the largest vessel is full and it releases the entire contents of the containers during a ten-minute period.  The second scenario (or alternative scenario) is based on a situation more likely to occur which will cause a release of chemicals at the facility.  The radius of impact was determined based on the guidance provided in Chapter 4: \u00c2\u00bfOffsite Consequence Analysis\u00c2\u00bf of the General Guidance for Risk Management Programs dated October 27, 1998 and the Compliance Guidance and Model Risk management Program for Water Treatment Plants.  The distance to the end point concentration was determined with the aide of the Computer Program Aerial Locations of Hazardous Atmospheres, version 5.2.1 (ALOHA).  The National Safety Council developed this program for emergency planners.  ALOHA works in conjunction with the Computer-Aided Management of Emergency Operations (CAMEO) database and Mapping Operation for Response, Planning and Local Operational Task (MARPLOT) program.\n\nIn all release scenarios, the toxic end point concentration remained the same.  The toxic end point for chlorine is three parts per million (ppm) or 0.0087 milligrams per liter (mg/l) which is the endpoint concentration published in the CFR Part 68.  The American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) has listed these concentrations as the \u00c2\u00bfmaximum airborne concentration\u00c2\u00bf, at which nearly all individuals could be exposed to for up to one hour without experiencing or developing life threatening health effects.  This level is referred to as the Emergency Response Planning Guideline (ERPG-2) concentration.  \n\n\nThe key to a successful risk management program is to first define hazard, risk and undertake a comprehensive approach to prevention.  The Center for Chemical Process Safety has defined hazard as:\n\nA chemical or physical condition that has the potential for cau"

The Water Treatment Plant operates in accordance with the procedures outlined in the plant\u00c2\u00bfs Operation and Maintenance Manual.  The manual sets forth inspections and maintenance requirements of the equipment.  Throughout this RMPlan, the emergency readiness procedures and regular training schedules are emphasized.  One of the goals of implementing these procedures and schedules is to minimize the chance of a release occurring.  If the plant employees practice preventative maintenance and are well trained in emergency procedures, if a release occurs, they will be successful in preventing and minimizing personnel injury.\n\nAll employees who perform work at the water treatment facilities are required to know the locations of the emergency telephone numbers and names of individuals to contact in case of a release.  If an emergency occurs, each employee will have an assigned task.  This risk management plan enhances the standard operating procedures because it provides a clear checklist that identifies predetermined individuals and agencies that require notification and coordination in case of an emergency.  This RMPlan details which individuals will respond to the release to contain it and it outlines the agencies that will be responsible for evacuating the appropriate areas, and for sounding the \u00c2\u00bfall clear\u00c2\u00bf once the leak is contained.  The plan also includes procedures for the periodic review of readiness.\n\nNo releases have occurred at the facility.
