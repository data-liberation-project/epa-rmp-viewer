TPC manufactures 1,3 Butadiene at this site, which involves processing millions of pounds of flammable substances in the 3, 4, and 5 carbon number range (propanes, butanes, and pentanes).  In addition, TPC uses chlorine in ton containers to treat cooling water.  Aqua Ammonia is used to assist with neutralization of a reaction in the Polyisobutlyene process.\nIt is the policy of TPC to take all steps necessary to insure the safety of workers and the community.  We are active in the Harris County and City of Houston Local Emergency Planning Committee, Channel Industries Mutual Aid, and East Harris County Manufacturers Association.\nThe flammable worst-case scenario would be the catastrophic failure of a 1,3 Butadiene storage sphere.  This could result in the loss of nearly 10,000,000 pounds of 1,3 Butadiene over a 10 minute period.  If that vapor cloud were to detonate in an unconfined vapor cloud explosion, the impact circle would reach offsite areas and have the potential to impact the public.  A more realistic alternate release scenario would be a failure of the 4 inch line running from a Butene-1 storage sphere to the loading rack.  This could cause the release of 47,000 pounds of Butene-1, assuming that the operator could close the block valves to isolate the failure within 5 minutes.  Ignition of this smaller vapor cloud would be unlikely to detonate, so it was evaluated as a vapor cloud fire which barely has the potential to reach across the property boundary.  Minimal public impacts would be expected from this flammable alternative release scenario.\nThe toxic worst-case scenario involves the catastrophic failure of one ton cylinder of Chlorine, releasing 2082 pounds over a 10 minute period.  This could result in a toxic plume that could extend well beyond the property boundary and would have the potential to impact the public.  A more realistic alternative release scenario for"

      "SummaryText": "chlorine would be a leak around the cylinder valve that would release about 347 pounds per minute.  While this is almost as serious a release as the worst-case, the impact distance when evaluated under typical weather conditions would be expected to reach only the very near neighbors.  \nTPC has another toxic chemical, Aqueous Ammonia.  An alternative release scenario for aqueous ammonia would be a fitting on the ammonia discharge piping coming loose.  It is assumed it would take an operator a maximum of 2 hours to discover and stop this release.  Approximately 442 lbs of ammonia would be released at a rate of 3.68 lbs/minute.  This release scenario barely has the potential to reach across the property boundary.  Minimal public impacts would be expected from this toxic alternate release scenario.\nThe facility is subject to OSHA Process Safety Management and has been operating under PSM for many years.  Release and fire prevention programs are mature and effective.  While all the PSM elements are important, the key elements in our prevention efforts are process hazard analyses, mechanical integrity, and management of change.  PHAs are an exercise in which the potential failures in the system are examined in great detail to try and anticipate every possible failure and to determine how well our safety systems can control that condition.  Mechanical integrity is the combination of inspections, testing, and preventive maintenance that is designed to prevent mechanical failures.  Management of Change is a rigorous process for reviewing the safety implications of any change proposed to the facility.  These key elements are supported by process safety information, operating procedures, training, etc., to provide a comprehensive prevention program.\nTPC has not had an accident over the last five years involving a regulated substance that meets the EPA criteria for the five-year accident history.\nTPC has an emergency response team and a written emergency response plan.
