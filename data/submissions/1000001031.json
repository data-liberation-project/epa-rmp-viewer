The base is \nowned and operated by the United States Air Force Air Combat \nCommand and is home for the 49th Fighter Wing.  The size of HAFB, \ncombined with its primary combat support mission and presence of base \nhousing for permanent party and temporary duty personnel, requires that \nthe base provide services and support an infrastructure similar to those \nthat may exist in a medium-size, non-military municipality.\nThe base operates a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) for treating \nwastewater produced on-site.  The WWTP uses a mixture of chlorine gas \ndissolved in water for chlorinating plant effluent, influent, and an \nactivated sludge stream.  Chlorine, required to perform the chlorination \ntasks, is received and dispensed from standard one-ton chlorine \ncontainers that meet or exceed the U.S. Department of Transportation \nspecifications for design and testing.  The inventory of chlorine exceeds \nthe threshold of 2,500 pounds, specified in the Risk Management Program \nregulation, and therefore, triggers the submission of a Risk Management \nPlan (RMP) at least every five years.  This submission represents the second \nupdate or revision, of the original RMP that was prepared and submitted \nJune 1999.\n2.0    HAZARD ASSESSMENT\nA hazard assessment was performed to determine the endpoint distances \nthat may result from a worst-case and alternative-case (i.e., more likely) \naccidental release of chlorine from a one-ton container and the human and \nenvironmental receptors within the impact area.  The results of the hazard \nassessment are included in attachments to this Executive Summary.  \nEndpoint distances were determined by applying the Environmental \nProtection Agency's recommended approach that is contained in their \nmost current guidance document entitled Risk Management Prog"

Employee participation;\n?    Process safety information;\n?    Process hazard analyses;\n?    Operating procedures;\n?    Training;\n?    Contractors;\n?    Mechanical integrity;\n?    Management of change;\n?    Pre-startup safety review;\n?    Incident investigation;\n?    Hot work permit;\n?    Emergency response program; and\n?    Compliance audits.\nThe major objective of this prevention program is to implement a  \nmanagement system that prevents releases of chlorine, especially into \nlocations that could expose employees and others to serious hazards.  The \nprogram employs a systematic approach to evaluating the whole process \nincluding process design, process technology, process changes, \noperational and maintenance activities and procedures, non-routine \nactivities and procedures, emergency preparedness plans and procedures, \ntraining programs, and other interrelated elements that effect the WWTP \nchlorine system.\nThe various lines of defense that have been incorporated into the design \nand operation of the WWTP system to prevent or mitigate a chlorine \nrelease are evaluated and strengthened through the prevention program \nto ensure their effectiveness.  The prevention program proactively \nidentifies, evaluates, and mitigates chlorine releases that could occur as a \nresult of failures in processes, procedures, or equipment. Some of the key \ncomponents of the prevention program are summarized below:\n?    The development, documentation, and operator availability of \ncritical process safety information regarding the hazards of chlorine \nand the design of the system and equipment.  This information is \nused to fully understand and safely operate the chlorine system."

This program assures that \nemployees that operate the chlorine system and are most \nknowledgeable about it are able to easily, effectively, and regularly \nrecommend changes or improvements which enhance safety.\n?    The performance of a formal initial PHA on the chlorine system \nusing the hazard and operability (HAZOP) study technique, and  \nrevalidation PHAs, that occurred in November 2003(Note: The PHA was actually finalized in February 2004) and January 2009, which also \nemployed the HAZOP study technique.  A team with expertise in \nengineering, operations, maintenance, and safety evaluated the \nexisting system in depth and developed recommendations to \nimprove the safety and operability of the system.  The PHAs \naddressed:  (1) process hazards, (2) previous incidents, \n(3) engineering and administrative controls applicable to the \nhazards, (4) the consequence of control failure, (5) facility siting, \n(6) human factors, and (7) a qualitative evaluation of possible safety \nand health effects of control system failures.  The PHA will be \nupdated and revalidated every five years.\n?    Written operating procedures (OPs) are used to provide the basis \nfor proper and safe operation of the chlorine system.  The OPs \ninclude procedures for normal operations, startup, shutdown, \nemergency operations, and emergency shutdown.  They also \ndescribe safe operating limits for temperature and pressure, the \nconsequences of operating outside these safe operating limits, and a \ndescription of safety systems and how they operate.\n?    Formal authorization systems (i.e., management of change \nprocedure, pre-startup safety review) are in place to ensure that \nsystem changes or expansions are as safe as the original design and \nthat an independent recheck confirms that the changes are \nconsistent with the engineering design and in a condition to be \nsafely operated prior to startup.\n?
