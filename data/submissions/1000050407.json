This commitment extends to employees and the general public.\n\n\n\nThe primary activity at Thatcher Company of Nevada is the production and packaging  of water treatment chemicals including sodium hypochlorite which uses chlorine as a raw material. As chlorine is considered a hazardous chemical, it is is our policy and practice to use several redundant safety systems to reduce the chance of unnecessary exposure to both our employees and to the general public. \n\n\n\nOver the last ten years, the process established by Thatcher Company of Nevada specifically to the handling of chlorine has proven to be very safe.  There have been no reportable incidents involving chlorine.\n\n\n\nDuring the last Process Hazards Analysis (PHA - 10/2008)a number of slight improvements were submitted for consideration/analysis through the Management of Change (MOC) process.  It is our intent to be pro-active in the improvement process.\n\n\n\nOur policy is to fully meet or exceed all federal and state rules and regulations in order to insure the highest practical level of safety."
