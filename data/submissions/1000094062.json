The Compliance Guidelines can be utilized as a tool within the company to assess potential implementation of certain elements. To support the Compliance Guidelines, specific written procedures detailing the method to meet the element requirements have been developed. In addition, the procedures will clearly define responsibilities for element compliance. Implementation of a specific element requires adherence to the corresponding written procedure. \n\nFor any program to be successful, senior leadership is paramount. Leadership alone can make Process Safety a key business goal and provide the necessary resources to achieve both RMP and PSM objectives. Employees within every organization take their cues from administrators, managers and supervisors. If leadership consistently treats Process Safety as a priority, so will the rest of the work-group. At a minimum management commitment to Process Safety must include the following actions: \n\n\n\n1.    Visibly demonstrate leadership commitment to Process Safety \n\n2.    Clearly assign and communicate Process Safety responsibilities to all affected employees \n\n3.    Ensure leadership is aware of relevant Process Safety incidents \n\n4.    Implement system for ensuring Process Safety responsibilities are met \n\n5.    Integrate Process Safety into planning processes \n\n6.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\n\n1.1 STATIONARY SOURCE DESCRIPTION\n\nThe Cape Cod Ice East Providence facility utilizes anhydrous ammonia refrigeration to manufacture ice that is distributed throughout Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, and parts of New Hampshire.  The facility also stores cranberries during the winter months.\n\n \n\nCape Cod Ice's facility is located at 1 Noyes Avenue, East Providence, Rhode Island (East Providence facility). The refrigeration system is located throughout the warehouse building of the East Providence facility with the piping located on the roof.\n\n\n\n1.2 ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nCape Cod Ice relies on written procedures and training to minimize accidental releases.  Every employee must complete awareness training and operating and maintenance training for their particular duties and responsibilities prior to working on any assignment. If any processes change, employees are retrained in the new process before working on an assignment.\n\n\n\nContractors are required to be properly trained in the safety programs before doing any work at the facility.\n\n\n\nAll employees who operate, service, or maintain the ammonia refrigeration systems are trained to understand the safety and health hazards of the refrigerant and the refrigeration system at the facility. This knowledge is necessary for the protection of the individual, the other employees, and the community. \n\n\n\nEmergency Response Policy\n\n\n\nIn the event of an emergency, Cape Cod Ice personnel are expected to cooperate with fellow employees and other support personnel to assure successful resolution of any emergency. Cape Cod Ice employees are trained in emergency response for defensive measures only and rely on outside agencies to provide support in responding to an emergency. Outside support is required for both fire response and response to an ammonia release.\n\n\n\nThe E. Providence Fire Department and HAZMAT team shall notify the local emergency planning comm"

The threshold limit for anhydrous ammonia is 10,000 lbs. Currently, the facility has an estimated 20,550 lbs. of anhydrous ammonia.\n\n\n\n1.4 ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe EPA's RMP prevention program includes the requirements of the OSHA PSM standards. Cape Cod Ice currently has a Process Safety Management (PSM) program in place at the facility. The objective of the PSM program is to prevent accidental chemical releases and minimize their impact if they do occur. The focuses of the RMP and the PSM programs are to protect the employees and surrounding public. The EPA requires twelve (12) of the fourteen (14) elements of the PSM to be included in the RMP. The following twelve (12) elements are incorporated into the prevention programs for Cape Cod Ice:\n\n\n\no Process Safety Information\n\no Process Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\no Operating Procedures\n\no Training\n\no Mechanical Integrity\n\no Management of Change\n\no Pre-Startup Review\n\no Compliance Audits\n\no Incident Investigation\n\no Employee Participation\n\no Hot Work Permit\n\no Contractors\n\n\n\n1.5 FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENTAL HISTORY\n\nThere have been no reportable releases at the facility within the last five years.  \n\n\n\n1.6 EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nIt is the policy of the Cape Cod Ice facility management to implement the requirements of the Emergency Action Plan by managing and operating the facility in accordance with applicable regulations and general good o"

Cape Cod Ice management has\n\ndeveloped the Emergency Action Plan to ensure a fast and efficient response in the event of an accidental hazardous material release, fire or other emergency situation.\n\n\n\nCape Cod Ice personnel are expected to cooperate with fellow employees and other support personnel as directed by the emergency response management to assure successful resolution of any emergency. Cape Cod Ice employees are trained in emergency response for defensive measures only and rely on outside agencies to provide support in responding to an emergency. Outside support is required for both fire response and response to an ammonia release. Therefore, Cape Cod Ice is a non-responding facility and has\n\ndeveloped an Emergency Action Plan to ensure employees safety as required by the RMP regulation.\n\n\n\n1.7 PLANS TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nCape Cod Ice has recently made some management changes in an attempt to better adhere to compliance and regulatory issues, and to improve the safety of employees and the surrounding community.   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
