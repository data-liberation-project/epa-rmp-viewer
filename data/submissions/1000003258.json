The rule (40 CFR Part 68) requires that some 66,000 facilities across the United States in various industries develop a Risk Management Program (RMP). The RMP incorporates various required elements into a program designed to prevent accidental releases of regulated substances and establish emergency response preparedness in the event of an accidental release of such regulated substances. RMPs must be submitted to the USEPA by the owner or operator of any facility that has a process containing more than a threshold quantity of any of the regulated substances that is covered under the RMP rule. Pursuant to the RMP rule, Covanta Lee, Inc. (CLI) has submitted this RMP for anhydrous ammonia for the Lee County Solid Waste Resource Recovery Facility (A?LCSWRRFA? or A?the waste-to-energy (WTE) FacilityA?). \n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is a commonly used chemical with various applications in industry and agriculture. By volume, anhydrous ammonia is the fourth largest industrial chemical produced over 80% of which goes to agricultural fertilizers.  In addition to anhydrous ammonia application as a fertilizer in crop production, some other common uses for anhydrous ammonia include: air pollution control system reagent, food production and processing, textile and chemical manufacturing, refrigeration (such as refrigerated warehouses) and metal treating.   \n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is used at the WTE Facility exclusively as a reagent in the facility's nitrogen oxide (NOx) control system for Units #1 and #2 (Unit #3 utilizes urea as a reagent in Unit #3A?s NOX control system). The NOX control system is an important part of the air pollution control equipment that reduces nitr"

Nitrogen oxide (NO) is a colorless gas produced during high temperature combustion. In ambient air, nitrogen oxide is oxidized to nitrogen dioxide (NO2). Nitrogen dioxide reacts with water in ambient air to form nitric acid, which contributes to the formation of acid rain; and, nitrogen oxides also contribute to the formation of photochemical smog by reacting with sunlight to form ozone (O3) in the atmosphere. Unit #1 and #2A?s  NOX control system reduces nitrogen oxides by the injection of anhydrous ammonia into the furnace section of the boilers. In the boilers, a reaction takes place between the anhydrous ammonia, nitrogen oxide and oxygen. The resulting products of this reaction are the major components in the air we breathe, nitrogen gas (N2), oxygen and water. A significant environmental benefit is achieved through the use of anhydrous ammonia in the operation of the NOX control system.\n\n\n\nThe facilityA?s third municipal waste combustor (MWC) unit, which was constructed from 2006 through summer of 2007 in order to expand the LCSWRRF, uses urea as the reagent in its NOX control system. Urea is not a regulated substance under the RMP rule and, therefore, is not included in this RMP.\n\n\n\nCLI operates the WTE Facility, located in Fort Myers, Florida in a manner that is protective of the health and safety of Facility employees, contractor employees, the public and the environment. In addition, CLI is committed to operating the WTE Facility in full compliance with applicable Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) requirements, federal regulatory requirements and applicable state and/or local requirements.\n\n\n\nCLI previously developed an OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Program for anhydrous ammonia. The OSHA PSM rule guides employees in the preventive maintenance, safe management and operation of processes that use regulated sub"

The USEPAA?s RMP regulation builds and expands upon the OSHA PSM program by requiring facilities to evaluate offsite impacts to public and environmental receptors, in the event of an accidental release. Key elements of the OSHA PSM program have been incorporated into the USEPA RMP regulation.\n\n\n\nAs part of the USEPA RMP effort, CLI has updated the PSM program for anhydrous ammonia and the associated Process Hazard Analysis (PHA). Among the other important components of the RMP are systems of policies and procedures for operation and maintenance of the facility, and the facility-specific Emergency Action Plan (EAP). CLI has operated the regulated process for a number of years now without a release due to these solid preventive maintenance programs, safe design and operating practices, and established training programs.  \n\n\n\nThe Facility Manager has the primary responsibility for this RMP and its implementation.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.2    STATIONARY SOURCE DESCRIPTION\n\n\n\nThe Lee County Solid Waste Resource Recovery Facility is a waste-to-energy (WTE) facility that burns municipal solid waste and recovers steam to produce electricity. Each day, this WTE facility converts approximately 1,800 tons of Lee and Hendry Counties' municipal solid waste into electricity. In addition, the Lee County Solid Waste Division management office and the following County-run operations are located on-site:  materials recovery facility; yard waste processing facility; tire processing facility; household hazardous waste collection facility and the County transfer station.\n\n\n\nOne process at the WTE Facility involves the use of a substance regulated under 40 CFR Part 68, thereby requiring the preparation and implementation of an RMP. This covered process is the NOx control system for Units #1 and #2 (discussed in Section 1.1 above), which utilizes anhydrous ammonia injection for NOx control (Unit #3 utilizes urea). The "

Administrative controls are used to limit the tank capacity to 85%.\n\n\n\nBoth passive and active mitigation measures are used by the WTE Facility to limit the likelihood and/or severity of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia. Passive mitigation systems do not require human, mechanical or energy input, such as the concrete dike that surrounds the storage tank area. Conversely, active mitigation systems do require human, mechanical or energy input for initiation. Leak detectors and alarms, excess flow valves, pressure relief valves and emergency shut-off devices are examples of the active mitigation systems in place at the WTE Facility. \n\n\n\n\n\n1.3    WORST CASE AND ALTERNATIVE CASE ACCIDENTAL RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\n\n\nA summary of the off-site consequence analysis (OCA) for the worst-case and alternative release scenarios is no longer required to be included in the executive summary.  While the RMP rule originally required that the executive summary briefly describe the OCA for the worst-case and alternative release scenarios, the USEPA amended the RMP rule in 2004 to remove this requirement because of security concerns.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.4    ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe WTE Facility has an accidental release prevention program that is based upon a foundation of employee awareness and proactive system maintenance.

Compliance audits are used to evaluate the need for revising or updating the procedures related to the processes.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.5    FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nFor the five years prior to the submission of this RMP, there have been no accidental releases, as defined in 40 CFR Part 68.42(a) at the WTE Facility, which resulted in injuries or death to onsite (i.e., Facility or contractor employees) or offsite (i.e., the public).  Since there has not been an accidental release, there has not been a need for sheltering in place or evacuation; nor has damage to property or environmental receptors ever occurred as a result of an accidental release. In fact, Covanta has operated the WTE Facility in the safest possible manner since it has commenced operations.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n1.6    EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe WTE Facility has an Emergency Action Plan (EAP) that defines the sequence of actions to be taken by Facility employees in the event of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia. This EAP has been communicated to the Fire Department and Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). Individuals who are likely to witness or discover a release have been trained to initiate an emergency response sequence by notifying the proper authorities. It is currently Covanta's policy that individuals that have received the requisite training will attempt to secure a release of anhydrous ammonia if the action can be taken without significant risk of injury or death. The Fort Myers HAZMAT Team is presently responsible for determining when sheltering-in-place or evacuation of off-site areas is necessary, and also for public notification.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.7    PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nThis RMP incorporates existing Facility procedures, which are designed to improve employee safety awareness and enhance safe operati"
