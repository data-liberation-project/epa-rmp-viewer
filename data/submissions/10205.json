      "SummaryText": "Crown Paper Co., Berlin-Gorham facility is an integrated Pulp and Paper mill producing 350 T/D of Bleached Market Hardwood  Pulp and 550 T/D Uncoated Freesheet Papers.  The plant has maintained a fully operational Hazmat team for the control of hazardous chemical releases for 10 years.  This team is on call 24 hrs per day, participates in monthly training and conducts annual emergency response drills with the City of Berlin, Berlin Fire Department and local police and ambulance personnel.  All hazardous chemicals used at Berlin-Gorham have emergency response SOP's that instruct operators in the control of unplanned releases following OSHA 1910.120 Hazwoper STD.  Annual emergency response drills are conducted in each department every year.\n\n     Two hazardous chemicals with inventory levels above the RMP threshold quantity level are required for operation of the Berlin mill.\n     - Aqueous ammonia at 30% concentration is stored in quantities to 12,789 gals.  Secondary containment is provided.  It is used in the pulp mill wastewater treatment process to maintain BOD discharge levels within the permit limits.  This facility is located in a remote location and has no public receptors within the worst-case (tank rupture and subsequent evaporation) toxic (200ppm) endpoint of 0.10 miles.  End points were established in the Offsite Consequence Analysis developed by Woodward-Clyde Consultants in February of 1998.  There was one incident in the last 5 years, when the tank roof was ruptured, however no injuries resulted.  Actions to prevent recurrence were implemented following an incident investigation.  This chemical is eligible for the RMP level 1 program.\n     -Propane, stored in quantities up to 64,000 lbs. in a supplier owned storage tank, is used for startup fuel in the Chemical Recovery Unit and the Lime Kiln, and as a primary fuel for the Thermal Oxidizer which is a backup NCG (non-condensable gas) incinerator.  This process has not had  any serious incidents i"

      "SummaryText": "n the last 5 years but has public receptors within the worst case (rupture which causes the entire contents to vaporize and ignite instantaneously) overpressure (1psi) endpoint of 0.32 miles and the alternate case scenario of a rupture with dispersion that reaches an ignition point downwind at a concentration above the LEL of 2% is 0.12 miles.   This requires an RMP level 3 program process with all prevention elements.\n\n     The Berlin pulp mill uses chlorine dioxide (stored as a solution at less than 1% by weight) in the bleaching process.  Since this chemical is stored at a concentration below the RMP guidelines, it is not included in our RMP plan.  However, this chemical is covered by the OSHA 1910.119 Process Safety Management standard.  As a result, all of the prevention elements including, incident investigation, management of change, pre-startup review, control of contractor activities, hot work permits and participation of employees,  have been in place at this facility for several years.  \n\n     The same procedures for PSM were extended to cover Propane under RMP.  Process Safety Information and Operating procedures were developed in preparation for the HAZOP performed on the propane system.  An outside resource, Glenn Mahnken-Loss Control Specialist from Factory Mutual, participated in the HAZOP along with Company hourly and salaried personnel from Operations and Maintenance.  The propane supplier ensures the mechanical integrity of the storage tank using ANSI Z223.1, NFPA 54-National Fuel Gas Code and NFPA 58-Standard for the storage and Handling of Liquefied Petroleum Gases along with any referenced ASME or API standards.  The Mill maintains the distribution system.  All Operations and Maintenance employees involved in the process have been trained on the hazards of the process and safe work practices.\n\nAlthough not required in program level 1, the company Hazmat team will respond to emergencies for ammonia.
