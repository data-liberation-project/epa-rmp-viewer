Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies.\n\nThe Cherokee County Cogeneration Partners, L.P. facility is an 80 megawatt combined cycle cogeneration facility.  The facility generates electricity which is sold through a power purchase agreement to the host utility.  The qualifying facility is a potable ice manufacturing facility which produces, stores and markets ice to retail customers.\n\nThe refrigeration systems utilized at the facility contain anhydrous ammonia which is considered hazardous by the EPA.  A specific refrigerant charge is solely contained within the piping, heat exchangers, and equipment that comprise the system.  The systems that monitor and control the refrigeration systems contain state of the art technology that initiates alarms, as well as protective shutdowns, to ensure the safe operation of the system.\n\nThe personnel who manage, operate, and maintain the facility are trained to observe all precautions required to safely handle ammonia at the facility.  This not only minimizes their exposure to a hazardous chemical, it also minimizes the threat to nearby members of the surrounding community.\n\nThe facility is staffed 24 hrs a day and the personnel are trained in the use of emergency response equipment to minimize a chemical release at the facility.  Our emergency response and preparedness plan includes procedures for notifying the County Emergency Preparedness Center in the event that a chemical release many affect the surrounding community. \n\n2.  Stationary Source and regulated substances handled.\n\nThe primary purpose of the facility is to produce, store and market potable quality ice.  The refrigeration system is a closed system that requires periodic makeup on a minimal basis.  Ammonia detentions systems alert personnel of leaks in process areas.  Periodic leak checks are performed to ensure a tight, leak free system is maintained.  The total inventory of ammonia within these systems is 35,000 pounds.  Ammonia is not stor"

Worst case and alternative case release scenarios.\n\nWorst Case Scenario-Failure of ammonia storage tank used for maintenance activities at the facility.  This scenario assumes the 10,000 pounds of ammonia stored as a liquid under pressure is released due to a catastrophic failure of the storage tank.  The distance to the toxic endpoint would be 1.2 miles assuming the worst case conditions assumed in RMP*Comp.  The likelihood of this scenario is minimal for several reasons.\n    1.This is the maximum amount that is allowed to be stored in the tank through plant administrative procedures.\n    2.The tank is located in a concrete containment area that allows limited accessibility from outside influences (i.e. forklifts, cranes, vehicles) that could compromise the integrity of the tank.\n    3. The tank is used only during maintenance or emergency situations to evacuate ammonia from affected systems.\n\nThe facility also modeled this scenario utilizing atmospheric conditions more usual for the site and the resulting toxic endpoint is reduced to .2 miles (Class D stability, wind speed 3 meters/sec)\n\nAlternative Case Scenario-Several scenarios were modeled for flange leaks, transfer line failures.  The amount of ammonia released over a ten-minute period at rates 100 lbs./min down to 10 lbs./min resulted in distances to toxic endpoints of .1 miles.  This distance would not affect the surrounding community.\n\n4. General accidental release prevention and specific prevention steps.\n\nThis facility complies with all state and federal codes and regulations.  The facility complies with the OSHA Process Safety Management standard.  The facility is constructed with materials and equipment designed for ammonia refrigeration use in accordance with all applicable codes and standards.\n\n5.  Five year accident history\n\nThere has been one accident reportable under 40 CFR 68.168.  This involved a release of aqueous ammonia on 4/24&25/01 tha"

Emergency Response\n\nThe facility emergency response and preparedness plan is coordinated with the Cherokee County Emergency Preparedness Center.  All facility personnel that would respond to accidental releases are trained under the requirements of 29CFR Part 1910.120 Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response.  Drills are conducted to simulate spills and practice recovery techniques.  Our Emergency Response an Preparedness plan includes a notification plan to contact required agencies in the event of an accidental release from the facility."
