              "Description": "Process Safety Information (?68.65) - The process capacity is 36,000 lb of ammonia.  The MSDS for ammonia is available to all employees associated with the process.  The process is not only designed in compliance with good engineering practices and with Federal and state regulations, it is also maintained within safe operating ranges.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (?68.67) - The process hazard analysis (PHA) for Ixion Ceramics, Inc.Company's Chattanooga, TN facility indicates that the facility was properly designed and is following procedures which minimize the probability of a release. The elements of the PHA include those hazards associated with the chemicals use, equipment malfunctions, human errors that may result in an accidental release, safeguards to prevent accidental releases, and detection and monitoring steps. The PHA is performed by qualified personnel knowledgeable in the process and in the PHA methodology.\n\nOperating Procedures (?68.69) - The process is operated by trained personnel using safe operating practices.  Specifically, there are written operating procedures for each operating phase including initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, normal shutdown, startup, correction of deviations and equipment inspections.  These written operating procedures are regularly reviewed and are readily accessible to the operators.\n\nTraining (?68.71) - All employees presently operating or assigned to the process have been trained or tested in the skills and duties necessary to safely operate the process.  Furthermore, all employees who are newly assigned to the process are thoroughly trained and tested proficient before operating the process.  A list of the trained employees is maintained.  Refresher training is provided at least every three years, or more frequently if needed to maintain safe operating practices.\n\nMechanical Integrity (?68.73) - All process equipment is properly inspected and serviced either by trained employees or maintenance contractors.  Any maintenance contractor shall ensure that each contract employee is properly trained in the maintenance procedures to be performed.  All identified equipment deficiencies are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change (?68.75) - Written procedures are in place to manage process changes, including changes in equipment and procedures.  All personnel affected by these changes are promptly informed of the changes and trained to deal with the modification.\n\nPre-Startup Review (?68.77) - Whenever a change is made to the process necessitating a change in the process safety information, Ixion Ceramics, Inc. confirms the completeness of the Prevention Program revision.  This includes confirming that a PHA has been performed for the correctly installed equipment, procedures are in place for operations, maintenance, and emergency response, and the employees trained in the new procedures.\n\nCompliance Audits (?68.79) - The procedures and practices of the RMP Prevention Program for the process at Ixion Ceramics Chattanooga, TN facility comply with the requirements of 40 CFR 68 and are currently being followed.  Compliance audits are conducted at least every three years to determine if current procedures are appropriate and being followed.  The two most recent compliance audits that are less than 5 years old are available.\n\nIncident Investigations (?68.81) - All incidents which resulted in or may have resulted in a catastrophic release are investigated in order to correct any safety deficiencies that have the potential to result in a future release. Investigations begin less than 48 hours after the occurrence of the incident.  The findings of the investigation are reviewed with all affected personnel and corrective action is taken to prevent future releases.  The summaries of all of the incident investigations from the past five years are available. \n\nEmployee Participation (?68.83) - Ixion Ceramics Company's employees have participated in the development of the PHA, operating and maintenance procedures.  All employees are made aware of the hazards associated with the process, as well as the effort to assess and minimize the probability and effect of a release.    \n\nHot Work Permit (?68.85) - Ixion Ceramics Company has in place procedures to safely conduct hot work.  These include procedures for initiation, hot work area review, safe hot work methods, and fire watches.\n\nContractors (?68.87) - In order to minimize the risk associated with the use of contractors working on the process, Ixion Ceramics Company reviews the safety history of each potential contractor.  All contractors working on the process are informed of the process hazards and emergency procedures.  Procedures are in place to limit and control contractor movement on site.",

      "SummaryText": "Ixion Ceramic,Inc. - Chattanooga Operations has a unique process involving anhydrous ammonia.  Ammonia storage consists of a storage facility to keep the ammonia on site for its continuous use as a fuel for the firing of the furnaces and the kilns.  The ammonia is first piped to a preheater to warm the liquid and then to a unit where it is converted into elemental hydrogen and nitrogen.  The hydrogen is piped into the kiln for use as a fuel, while the nitrogen is used as a purge gas to prevent oxygen from entering the system.  This process has been operated in its current configeration for 22 years.\n\nAmmonia is stored and used on site by Ixion Ceramics, Inc. at the Chattanooga, TN facility in quantities that exceed the threshold quanity for ammonia as defined by the Risk Management Program regulations.  Ixion Ceramics, Inc. has diligently developed and implemented a comprehensive Risk Management Program, assessing the hazards associated with the process, as well as implementing procedures which minimize the the probability and severity of an ammonia release.\n\nWe have not had an accident in the past five years involving ammonia that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or shelterings in place.  An OSHA Process Safety Management Program is currently implemented for the ammonia process.  Furthermore, the facility complies with the EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.\n\nOur worst-case scenario is the unlikely failure of the ammonia storage tank during a time in which the maximum amount of ammonia is stored in it.  The resulting distance to the endpoint extends offsite, and public receptors are within the distance to the endpoint.  Our alternative release scenario is a valve leak.  The resulting distance to the endpoint extends offsite, and public receptors are withihn the distance to the endpoint.  \n\nIn the event of an emergency involving the ammonia process, it is our policy to notify"
