We at Hydrite Chemical are strongly committed to employee and public safety and environmental responsibility.  It is our policy to control our processes to prevent the accidental release of harmful or noxious materials that could endanger or irritate our employees, plant visitors, or neighbors.  This commitment is integrated into our design standards, equipment installation and maintenance practices, operating procedures and training programs.\n\nHydrite Chemical has developed and trained written emergency response procedures in the event of an accidental release from any of our processes.  These written plans have been provided to the local emergency response agencies including local emergency response personnel, hospitals, state and federal agencies.\n\nHydrite uses two chemicals regulated by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management Program and the Environmental Protection Agency Risk Management Program.  These chemicals are Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide.   These materials are stored as liquids under pressure.  Additionally, Hydrite distributes both Hydrofluoric acid 70% and Ethylenediamine which are covered by Risk Management but not OSHA's PSM program.  All storage containers are designed to comply with National Standards including the U.S. Department of Transportation, National Fire Protection Association (NFPA), OSHA, and the Chlorine Institute. \n\nHydrite Chemical has multiple release prevention programs integrated into all phases of operation from design through maintenance.  Each chemical is reviewed for physical hazards, health hazards, environmental hazards and process hazards.  Both processes are subject to the OSHA PSM program and as such, undergo a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA).  Written operating procedures have been developed and are reviewe"

Employee training procedures have been developed and are implemented ensuring the employees understand the hazards of the chemicals, know how to operate the equipment, know how to shut down the process and how to respond to a release.  Pre-start up safety reviews are performed prior to operation of new equipment or receipt of new chemicals.  Equipment maintenance procedures have been developed and implemented, including routine inspections and scheduled maintenance.  Hydrite Chemical believes that every incident has the potential for serious impact and completes Incident Investigations to determine root cause and corrective action for all releases whether they resulted in injury or impacted away from our plant or not.\n\nA review of the previous five year accident history indicated no releases with community impact.\n\nHydrite Chemical has developed and maintained an Emergency Response Plan (contingency plan) for a number of years.  This plan includes\n    ? individual assignments in case of an emergency for on-scene control of the situation, \n    ? response personnel, \n    ? appropriate response actions, \n    ? resources available at the plant for use in responding such as \n    ? chemical resistant suits, \n    ? self-contained breathing apparatus, \n    ? two way radios for communication, \n    ? gas monitors, and  \n    ? repair kits for leaking cylinders and tanks.  \n\nHydrite Chemical is strongly committed to employee and public safety and environmental responsibility and continually works to improve processes or procedures that advance our goal of zero releases."
