Accidental Release prevention and emergency response policies:\n\nIn this facility we use Toluene 2,4-diisocyanate, and toluene 2,6-diisocyanate in amounts which are cosidered hazardous by the EPA. We observe safety precautions in handling these materials sufficient to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personnel health as well as our co-workers and to reduce the reduce the threat to nearby members of the community. It is our policy to adhear to all applicable Sate and Federal rules and regulations\n\nOur emergency response program  is based on information provided to us by our suppliers of these regulated materials. The emergencyresponse plan is coordinated with the Senatobia Fire Department and Ferguson Harbour Incorporated, in whom we have entered into an agreement with htem to to be our primary responder in the event of accidental hazardous material release. The emergeny response plan procedures for the notification of these agencies as well the local Emergency Planning Committee in the event of an accidental release. \n\n2. The stationary source and regulated substances handled.\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is the manufacturing of residential dinette furniture and contract office seating. Toluene 2,4 2,6-diisonate are used in the molded foam manufacturing process for our seating. The 2, 4 and the 2,6 TDI mixture is stored in 6,000 gallon closed tank located inside the plant in the foam building section. Access to the site is restricted to authorized  facility employees, authorized management personnel, and authorized contractors.\n\nThe regulated substances used at this facility are Toluene 2,4-diisocyanate, and Toluene 2,6-diisocyanate.\n\nThe maximum amount of  Toluene 2,4-diisocyanate that is stored at this plant is 43,555 lbs..\nThe maximum amount of  Toluene 2,6-diis"

The worst-case release scenarios and the alternative release scenario, including;\n\nToluene 2,4-diisocyanate;\nWorst-Case Scenario- Failure of the TDI storage tank would result in a release of 43,555\nlbs. of Toluene 2,4-diisocyanate. The release would be into a diked area of 918 square \nfeet and a building floor area of 854 square feet. The release rate to the outside air would be less than .0008 lbs.per minute making the estimated distance to toxic endpoint of 0.1 miles.\n\n\nToluene 2,6-diisocyanate;\nWorst-Case Scenario- Failure of the TDI storage tank would result in a release of 10889\nlbs. of Toluene 2,6-diisocyanate.
