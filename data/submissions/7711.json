THE FACILITY HAS THREE 11,000 GALLON TANKS WITH A TOTAL CAPACITY OF 144,000 POUNDS.  THE TANKS  ARE DESIGNED AND MAINTAINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ALL APPLICABLE  LOCAL, STAE AND FEDERAL RULES AND REGULATIONS.  THE KANSAS DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE INSPECTS OUR TANKS ON AN ANNUAL BASIS AND WE COMPLY WITH ALL OF THEIR REQUEST FOR FACILITY IMPROVEMENT.\n\nTHE WORST CASE SCENARIO WOULD HAVE A TOXIC GAS RELEASE OF 48,000 POUNDS OF AMMONIA WITH A DISTANCE TO ENDPOINT OF 1.5 MILES AFFECTING APPROXIMATELY 400 AREA CITIZENS. \n\n THIS COMPANY'S POLICY HAS BEEN TO TRAIN EMPLOYEES IN THE SAFE HANDLING OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA ON A REGULAR BASIS.   THE EMPLOYEES WHO WORK IN THE AMMONIA PLANT ARE TRAINED IN THE SAFETY INFORMATION, HAZARDS, OPERATING PROCEDURES AND THE MAINTENANCE PRACTICES OF THE TYPICAL FACILITY.  THE EMPLOYEES ALWAYS WEAR GOGGLES AND THE APPROPRIATE GLOVES WHILE FILLING NURSE TANKS.  ABOVE ALL, THEY MAKE SURE TO HAVE CLEAN SAFETY WATER ON HAND DURING  AMMONIA OPERATIONS.   OUR SAFETY RECORD  ALLOWS US TO PROUDLY REPORT THAT THERE HAVE BEEN NO INJURY ACCIDENTS AT THIS PLANT IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS.\n\nOUR EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN IS SHARED WITH OUR LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENT.  THEY'VE TOURED OUR FACILITY AND ARE AWARE OF THE DANGERS OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA.  THEY'VE ALSO, AGREED TO ASSIST US IN THE EVENT OF AN EMERGENCY."
