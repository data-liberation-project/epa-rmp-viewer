      "SummaryText": "Owens Sausage Comany is located at 1109 E Industrial Dr. Sulphur Springs, TX 75482 just north of IH-30.  The facility's ammonia systems is used for refrigeration and are split into 2 systems.  A small one that was existing that had less than 8,000# and the new addition which holds nearly 22,000#.  The ammonia was installed complete for the new facility on Aug. 7th, 2009. Both systems are monitored using electrochemical ammonia detection and connected to a control system that shuts down zones and initiates an alarm distinct to ammonia release.  There are emergency cutouts on the exits of the engine rooms which shut off the power to the rooms and start exhaust systems.  Both systems meet IIAR-2 and ASHRAE-15 requirements for ammonia systems. The high side was tested to 300# and the low side is tested to 150#.  The normal operating pressures are 30# on the low side and 130# ont he high side. There are 3 levels of safety which must be compremised prior to a release outside of the system. Pressure rises and control system shuts down the process, if the pressure continues to rise, equalization valves direct excess pressure to lower pressure parts of the system. If both of those fail to lower pressure, the relief valves will open and release ammonia into a diffusion tank. Worst case scenario is calculated using RMPCOMP and is .7 miles to toxic endpoint.  An elementary which is oppisite of prevailing winds is at .6 miles from the site.  A plan for shelter in place has been discussed with the local fire department should winds change and a severe leak occur.  The local fire department will be assisting the plant personnel trained in the emergency response program.  Both ER personnel and the Fire department have taken part in a dress rehearsal scenario at the facility.  This facility utilizes some of the most advanced technology and controls to prevent releases and ammonia being introduced into the atmosphere."
