This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility's processes.  The policy at Regency Gas Services (RGS) is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances.  \n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOUCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nRGS operates the Lisbon Gas Plant located in Claiborne Parish, Louisiana.  The Lisbon Gas Plant is a cryogenic natural gas processing plant designed for the extraction of liquid (LPG) Y-grade product from a gas stream.  The cryogenic extraction plant recovers ethane in addition to propane, butanes, and gasoline from the inlet gas.  Mixed liquids product from the liquids extraction plant is delivered via a pipeline.  Based on criteria outlined in the Accidental Release Prevention Program (ARP), the Lisbon Gas Plant is a Program 3 process.\n\nThe Lisbon Gas Plant was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances were present in the process and if they exceeded the threshold quantity.  All equipment and vessels are considered to be connected and/or co-located; consequently, for the purposes of the ARP Program, all equipment and vessels are part of a single process.  The identification of even a single vessel exceeding threshold quantities of a regulated flammable or toxic substance would subject a process to threshold determination for offsite consequence analysis.\n \nRGS identified two regulated flammable substances (LPG and natural gas) and zero regulated toxic substances along with the largest single vessel quantity stored.  It was determined that a single vessel of flammable mixture (LPG) exceeded threshold quantity. The identification of this exceedance indicates that the Lisbon Gas Plant is a covered process wi"

Because plant processes are subject to EPA's RMP regulations and to OSHA's PSM standards,  this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nRGS and the Lisbon Gas Plant actively encourage all levels of employees and contract employees to participate in creating a safe work environment.   This participation begins with well established mechanisms of communication with all employees regarding covered process information.  Employees are involved in maintaining PSM rule compliance based on their knowledge, skill, job responsibilities, and experience.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the plant. \n\nProcess Safety Information \n\nThe Lisbon Gas Plant maintains written information intended to provide a foundation for identifying and understanding the process hazards.  This information addresses chemical properties, inventories, and associated hazards, as well as for key process parameter limits and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Specific departments within the plant are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.  \n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure "

This information is supplemented, when required, by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  In addition, the plant has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters and ensures limit maintenance by using highly trained personnel, process controls, and monitoring and protective instrument systems.\n\nThe plant also maintains documentation that provides information about the design and construction of process equipment.  Equipment information includes construction materials, design pressure, and temperature and electrical ratings.  This information  provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nThe Lisbon Gas Plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe Lisbon Gas Plant primarily uses the \"What If\" and checklist methods to perform these evaluations. Combined, these techniques provide a highly structured approach where process parameters such as flow and temperature are examined for deviations from their intended design. Deviation effects are considered in order to determine resulting potential hazards while preliminary recommendations for improvement are proposed.\n\nThe PHA team findings are promptly and systematically addressed.  The Lisbon Gas Plant assures that the recommendations are documented and resolved in a timely manner. This documentation includes the actions to be taken and a written schedule of  "

These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years by the PHA team.  \n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe Lisbon Gas Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1)  initial startup, (2)  normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4)  emergency shutdown, (5)  emergency operations, (6)  normal shutdown, and (7) startup following a turnaround or after an emergency shutdown.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a consistent training basis for new operators. Operating procedures are periodically reviewed and certified as current.  When a process change occurs, operating procedures are revised as necessary through the management of change process. \n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written process operation procedures, the Lisbon Gas Plant has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees. New employees receive job specific basic training in plant operations. Employee training includes emphasis on safety and health hazards, emergency shutdown operations, and safe work practices. Operators demonstrating adequate knowledge to safely perform duties and tasks are allowed to work independently.\n\nHot Work Permit\n\nThe Lisbon Gas Plant issues a hot work permit for all hot work operations conducted on or near a covered process.

The emergency plan also includes procedures for handling small releases.\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is properly functioning, the Lisbon Gas Plant periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.  Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years.  The audit team  includes those knowledgeable in the process, operations personnel, and at least one person trained in audit techniques and practices.  The audit team develops findings and corrective actions are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.
