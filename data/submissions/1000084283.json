The Risk Management Plan for the Sabra Dipping Company facility has been prepared for the storage and use of anhydrous ammonia in the facility's refrigeration system.  Each part of the RMP is submitted to the Environmental Protection Agency, meeting or exceeding the requirements of Title 40 Code of Federal Regulations Part 68.  \r\n\r\nThe submission is due to the need to fulfill the requirements mandated by the EPA for a new submission or an update to occur every 5 years. The RMP was resubmitted in accordance with the 5-year update requirement.  The RMP resubmission was completed on December 23, 2019.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response or Emergency Action Policies\r\nThe Sabra Dipping Company facility recognizes management's responsibility in protecting the public, its employees, the environment, equipment and property.  The safety and health of all personnel are very important.  The controls of accidents have been and will continue to be a basic responsibility of all personnel in the Sabra Dipping Company facility.\r\n\r\nTo accomplish the company's goal in controlling accidental losses, the facility has established an Emergency Action Plan.  The objectives of the Emergency Action Plan are to: maximize safety performance, eliminate human suffering and the economic burden resulting from injuries and accidents and reduce losses associated with damage of property.\r\n\r\nOne of the activities associated with the Plant Safety Program has been the development and implementation of accidental release prevention and emergency response or action programs which are designed to comply with OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard and EPA's Risk Management Program regulation.  Jeff Connelly, the Director of Virginia Technical Operations, is responsible for implementation of the Risk Management Program.\r\n\r\nThe pu"

      "SummaryText": "rpose of the accidental release prevention and emergency response or emergency action programs is to prevent the occurrence and minimize the consequences of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents.  Overall, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses, environmental impact and avoid physical property damage.\r\n\r\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response or emergency action programs help prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures and practices which govern individual processes, activities or pieces of equipment.  These rules are detailed and are improved as necessary.  They are also communicated to and accepted by all employees at the facility.\r\n\r\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled \r\nThe Sabra Dipping Company facility includes two ammonia refrigeration systems (OBED and BOAZ) to provide process cooling and freezing capabilities.  The amount of anhydrous ammonia (CAS #7664-41-7) contained in each of the systems is in excess of 10,000 pounds.  The maximum quantity of ammonia held during the calendar year in BOAZ is 8,600 lbs. of ammonia, the maximum quantity of ammonia held during the calendar year in OBED is 13,188 lbs. Rounded, this equals 22,000 lbs. total of ammonia. Since an ammonia release from the systems could pose a risk of offsite public and/or environmental impact and the system regulated, the systems are subject to the Program 3 requirements of the EPA's RM program.\r\n\r\nThe Prevention Program: \r\nThe Accidental Release Prevention Program focuses on efforts at the Sabra Dipping Company facility to contain the refrigerant inside the systems.  The goal is to reduce the risk of injury and promote safer practices at the Sabra Dipping Company facility. The following items are included in the Prevention Program in relation to requirements for Program Level 3.\r\n\r\n1.\tEmployee Participation (EP)\r\n2.\tProcess Safety Informatio"

A blank copy of the incident investigation form is kept with the process safety management files.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\nThe Sabra Dipping Company facility's employees has a trained Emergency Response Team (ERT) to respond to minor emergencies, such as small spills, fires, first aid and leaks. The facility has developed an Emergency Action Plan and is included in the community's emergency response plan.\r\n\r\nThe Emergency Action Plan is kept with the Process Safety Management Files.  \r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\nBased upon ColonialWebb Contractor recommendations, the facility has begun the following plans to improve safety.
