Additionally, Phibro-Tech, Inc. is an active member of the Chlorine Institute.  Phibro-Tech recycles waste that results from electroplating and etching.  Chlorine and anhydrous ammonia are utilized as additives to the recycled material that is sent to our customers.  Recycling the waste into a useable product prevents these materials from being disposed of as a waste.  Phibro-Tech's policy is to implement reasonable measures to prevent a release of the regulated substances from occurring, provide early detection of a release via fixed point monitoring systems, and to have in place a contingency plan to respond safely and promptly to such a release. \n\nRegulated Substances:\nThe Risk Management Plan has been prepared to address the handling of the regulated substances located at 10 Industry Avenue, Joliet, Illinois 60435.\n\nSpecifically, the regulated substances processed at the facility include anhydrous ammonia and chlorine.  The following are the maximum quantities of the regulated substances stored on-site:\n\nSubstance                Quantity        Storage Vessel\n\nChlorine:                 180,000 pounds            Railcar\n\nCAS # 7782-50-5\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia:            100,092 pounds        Above Ground Storage Tank\n\nCAS # 7664-41-7\n\nChlorine and anhydrous ammonia are used as additives to turn waste into a useable product.  Specifically, for the manufacturing of specialty etchants that are utilized in the circuit board industry.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExecutive Summary Page 2\n\nFacility Description and Operations\n\nPhibro-Tech, Inc. has been an inorganic chemical processing plant since 1972, predating the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA).  Manufacturing operations involve the reclamation and refining of metal salts and the reconstitution of etchant solutions.\n\nWhen RCRA was enacted, some of the materials which the facility utilized as raw materials in its man"

Other materials accepted for recycling have remained classified as solid wastes rather that hazardous wastes.  In addition, virgin chemicals are purchased as raw materials for manufacturing operations.\n\nThe facility has received a RCRA Part B permit in 1993 for operations which include the storage and treatment of hazardous wastes generated from, but not limited to various etching and electroplating processes.  The operating process is currently exempt from RCRA.  Phibro-Tech's manufacturing and hazardous waste operations are physically and functionally separate entities located on the same site as shown on the Site Plot Plan.\n\nThe facility is located on a 1.6 acre parcel (T35N, R10E, Sec. 4, NE1/4) in the City of Joliet, Will County Illinois, within the old Joliet Industrial District.  The facility is located approximately 1,000 feet east of IL Route 53 (Broadway Street). Land used immediately north, west and south are industrial.  The facility is bordered on the east by the Elgin, Joliet, and Eastern (EJ&E) Railroad right-of-way and the DesPlaines River. \n\nWorst Case Scenarios:\n\nThe United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) has defined the Worst Case Scenario as a the hypothetical rupture and full release of all contents of the facilities largest storage vessel in a ten minute time period, assuming all safeguards have failed, during extremely stable weather conditions.  \n\nChlorine:  The worst case scenario would involve the release of the contents of a ninety ton chlorine railcar that results from the structural integrity of the railcar becoming compromised. The release rate would be 306.2 lbs/s and the distance to the toxic endpoint would be 8.43 miles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExecutive Summary Page 3\n\n\nAdministrative Controls: All operators undergo extensive training in accordance with the Process Safety Ma"

The railcar is inspected upon receipt, prior to shipment and on a daily basis while on location.  Any discrepancies are immediately reported to the chlorine distributor for evaluation.  All chlorine system piping and storage vessels are inspected on a monthly basis by qualified maintenance personnel and any discrepancies (i.e. damaged piping, etc...) are repaired.\n\nMitigation Measures: Phibro-Tech also has a chlorine fixed point monitoring system that is linked to the process and will shut it down via a pneumatic closure device connected to the chlorine railcar.  The fixed point monitoring system is linked to the process and will shut down the chlorine car and evacuate the chlorine lines, via the scrubbing unit, at .5 parts per million chlorine.  The pneumatic closure device is equipped with a back up air system that will operate in the event of a pressure or power loss.  The chlorine railcar is equipped with a safety valve that will stop the release of chlorine in the event of the valve becoming damaged.  An emergency Type C kit has been acquired to repair damaged valves and contain releases resulting from valve damage.\n\nAlternative Case Scenarios:\nThe USEPA has also specified in the Risk Management Rule that each facility define a specific Alternate or Realistic Scenario that could have off site impact, based on plant operations.  The Realistic Scenario are to be modeled using the actual active and passive mitigation systems that are in place if they are capable of withstanding the event of a triggered release.  \n\nAnhydrous Ammonia:   The alternative case scenario would"

The employee was immediately sent to the local emergency room and was treated for chemical inhalation.  The employee was removed from work for one day, but suffered no chronic adverse health effects.  There was not any other injuries, deaths or significant property damage on-site.

The valve was immediately shut off and the flow of anhydrous ammonia vapors was discontinued.  The duration of the release was less than thirty seconds and the total amount of anhydrous ammonia released is estimated at less than one half of a pound (less than .06 gallons).  The flow indicator was replaced and as a result of a regular inspection schedule, has not malfunctioned since. \n\nEmergency Response\nPhibro-Tech has a comprehensive emergency response program that includes the installation of detection and shutdown systems to halt and/or mitigate a release.
