      "SummaryText": "The facility name is City of Borger Wastewater Treatment Facility.  The facility is located at 1302 W. Third Street, Borger, Texas, 79007.  The  primary activity of this facility is to treat municipal wastewater.  Approximately 4,000 lbs. of chlorine in two one ton cylinders is stored at the site.\n\nThe City of Borger Accidental Release and Emergency Response policies have been established to insure the safety and health of each employee and/or the general public.  Management's goal is to constantly strive to eliminate all accidental chemical releases.  Management urges recognition of safety objectives in all proceedures during the operation of chemical processes.  The elimination of operating deficiencies which, if allowed to continue, might eventually produce an accident is highly stressed.\n\nThe facility has a Chlorine Handling and Emergency Response Procedures Manual for use as a guideline.  To prevent accidental releases, the facility has implemented an operator training program to minimize the risk of an accidental discharge due to operator error.  Employees who handle chlorine have training which is either provided on site or obtained through association schools.  The facility also has an inspection schedule to reduce the risk of a discharge due to faulty equipment.\n\nTher have been no chlorine related accidents at the facility in the past ten years.\n\nThe emergency response program is in the hands of the Hutchinson County Local Emergency Planning Committee.  They have an evacuation plan in place.  The Borger Fire Department has a B kit which could be used to seal leaking or ruptured cylinders.\n\nThere are no planned changed in the safety program at this time."
