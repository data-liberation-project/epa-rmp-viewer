This Executive Summary meets the requirements for Risk Management Plans (RMP) under the Clean Air Act 112( r ).  The Facility has the potential to contain volumes of Chlorine gas in excess of 2,500 lbs.  The normal operating volume of Chlorine gas on site is 2,000 lbs, however, during long Holiday weekends the volume on site may be 3,600 lbs. due to the inability to obtain adequate supplies of chlorine to meet NPDES permit requirements for disinfection.\n\nThe RMP includes maps of the area with corresponding maps illustrating the possible hazard zones in the event of a Chlorine gas release under the Worst Case Scenario as required by the Clean Air Act section ( r ) for Program 3 Facilities.  The maps dilineate the areas that are considered hazard zones under each scenario requiring \"evacuation\" or \"shelter in place\".\n\nVWNAOS takes many precautions to prevent releases of Chlorine gas that could affect their employees, nearby businesses, and the public.  The precautions include:\n*  On site alarm systems and monitors to warn employees of a Chlorine release\n*  An automated communication device that notifies emergency standby personnel during unmanned hours\n*  A written Emergency Action Plan that notifies emergency respone personnel, HAZMAT, local Fire, local Police, and                emergency response support from the chemical vendor.\n*  An enclosed storage facility to assist in the containment of the release\n*  A ventilation system to protect workers and ,when approriate, disperse the chlorine gas in a controlled manner for neutralization. \n*  Training of emergency response personnel in the specific response to a Chlorine release\n*  Training in the use of emergency response equipment, Chlorine \"B\" kits, SCBA's, Level A PPE, and repair or containment of \"minor\" leaks.\n*  Combined training"
