These programs include both Union Carbide\u0012s Responsible Care. requirements and governmental requirements, such as the Environmental Protection Agency\u0012s (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) rule and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration\u0012s (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.\n2\tSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\nThe Union Carbide South Charleston Plant is a manufacturing facility that annually produces more than 500 different specialty chemicals and plastics in its various operating units.  Most are intermediates used in other Union Carbide processes, or sold to customers who convert them into finished products.  The RMP rule requires that if a facility, such as theSouth Charleston Plant, has a specific amount (threshold) or more of any one of 140 toxic and flammable chemicals, the facility must follow the RMP rule requirements.

Unless otherwise specified, no credit was taken for administrative controls or mitigation measures in evaluating the off-site impact of the scenarios.  Chemical-specific steps to prevent these scenarios from occurring, and to mitigate their effects should they occur, are shown immediately after the scenario description.  The plant's general accident prevention program is described in Section 4.\n\nA)  Regulated Toxic Substances\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario\n\nThis scenario assumes an over-pressure and rupture of a storage tank, releasing 39,000 lbs. of allyl alcohol as a gas to the atmosphere. According to EPA\u0012s Off-Site Consequence Analysis (OCA) Guidance Table, this release could impact off-site public receptors.\n\nSpecific steps to prevent this scenario from occurring, and to mitigate its effects should they occur, include:\n7 Hose Hook-up Design:  Transfer hose connections are designed to prevent connection to an incompatible material, which might cause an uncontrolled reaction in the tank.\n7 Material Analysis:  A certificate of analysis must be reviewed to confirm transfer of material to the allyl alcohol storage tank is allyl alcohol and not an incompatible material.\n7 Fire Water Spray Monitors:  Area fire water spray monitors can be used to help suppress allyl alcohol vapors.\n7 Surveillance: Operators routinely monitor the process.\n\nAlternate-Case Release Scenario(s)\n\nAllyl Alcohol:  This scenario assumes an uncontrolled reaction causes a process vessel to fail and release allyl alcohol as vapor to the atmosphere at a rate of 2300 lbs. per minute for 15 minutes.  According to the OCA Guidance Table, this release could impact off-site public receptors.\nThe following active mitigation measures are used in this analysis:\n7 Emergency Shutdown System:  The system is designed to shut down the process and activate cooling when the process reaches high pressure, high temperature, l"

This scenario assumes that the emergency shutdown devices detect, shut down, and isolate the process, but the vessel failure (crack) continues to release material over a 15 minute period.\n\n\n\n\nIn addition, specific steps to prevent this scenario from occurring, and to mitigate its effects should they occur, include:\n7 Pressure Relief Device:  This device is designed to relieve pressure at a predetermined set point and prevent over-pressure of the process vessel.\n7 Deluge System: A water spray system is designed to help suppress allyl alcohol vapors.  It can be manual or heat activated \n7 Fire Water Spray Monitors: Area fire water spray monitors can be used to help suppress allyl alcohol vapors.\n7 Surveillance: Operators routinely monitor the process.\n\nEthylene Oxide:  This scenario assumes a 1-inch drain valve on the ethylene oxide pipeline is damaged by heavy equipment during maintenance, causing a 1/32-inch wide x >-inch long crack to develop in a weld.  The result is a release of ethylene oxide at a rate of 125 pounds per minute for 20 minutes. According to the OCA Guidance Table, this release could impact off-site public receptors.\nThe following active mitigation measures are used in this analysis:\n7 Low Pressure Alarm and Shutdown System:  This shutdown system is designed to sound an alarm when a drop in pressure occurs, which is indicative of a leak and shuts the ethylene oxide distribution system down.\n7 Remote Actuated Valves on Header:  This valve can be remotely actuated by an operator to isolate a leak on the ethylene oxide distribution piping.  This quick action can minimize the amount of material released.\n7 Manual Shut-Off Valve:  This valve can be closed by an operator to isolate ethylene oxide flow to plant ethylene oxide distribution system.\nThis scenario assumes the emergency shutdown device detects and shuts down the ethylene oxide distribution system and the operator activates remote a"
