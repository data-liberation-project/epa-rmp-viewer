The goal of this policy is to provide safe working conditions for employees as well as protect the public and the environment.\n\nThe stationary source and regulated substances handled:\n\n      The subject source is the Tar River Regional Wastewater Treatment Plant located on Highway 97 East in Rocky Mount, North Carolina.  The facility is a 21 MGD pure oxygen activated sludge treatment facility serving Rocky Mount and surrounding communities.\n   \nThe process at the wastewater treatment plant subject to the RMP regulations is the disinfection system, which manages greater than threshold quantities of chlorine and sulfur dioxide.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario(s) and the alternative release scenario(s) and associated offsite consequence analysis are not described here in detail for reasons of confidentiality per EPA guidance.\n\n             The general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\n        The accidental release prevention program at the Tar River Regional Wastewater Treatment Plant is focused on the safe management of chlorine and sulfur dioxide used in the disinfection system.  The first step in the prevention program at the Plant was the establishment of a management system to assign overall responsibility and responsibility for the individual program elements. Additional steps include: ensuring process safety information on the disinfection system is accurate, complete and up-to-date; ensuring the system is designed and modified safely by periodically conducting process hazard analyses; ensuring the system is operated and maintained in a safe manner by developing, maintaining and "

In addition, the Plant has in place an emergency action plan than includes procedures to be followed in the event of an accidental release of chlorine or sulfur dioxide.  The procedures cover the following: emergency action procedures; coordinating personnel; emergency reporting; evacuation plan; first aid procedures; notifying local emergency response agencies and the public; emergency response contacts; emergency response equipment; reportable release quantities; emergency alarm system; training and drills; and pre-emergency planning."
