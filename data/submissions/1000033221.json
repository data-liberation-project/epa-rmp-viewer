Williams Ohio Valley Midstream LLC is committed to the safety and health of its employees, contractors and visitors.  This commitment is demonstrated in the design, installation, operation and maintenance programs developed and implemented specifically for this facility.  Operation and maintenance personnel are trained in the appropriate emergency response procedures to follow in the event of an accidental release.  However, accident prevention is the ultimate goal and as such a site specific mechanical integrity program is being implemented and maintained.\n\n\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Fort Beeler Gas Plant is located approximately 4 miles Northwest of Cameron, West Virginia; Marshall County.  It is a cryogenic expander plant that is designed to extract liquid petroleum products (ethane, propane, butane, pentane, and heavier hydrocarbons) from raw natural gas and at the same time produce pipeline quality (primarily methane) gas.  The plant contains an above threshold quantity of regulated flammable substances, including methane, ethane, propane, butane, and pentane (liquid petroleum products).  Much of the inlet gas is of the \"wet\" variety containing ethane, propane and butane in addition to methane.  The liquids are collected and filtered to remove moisture and to separate the natural gas liquids from the residue gas.  A discharge pipeline carries the natural gas liquids from the Fort Beeler site to the Moundsville Fractionation Facility on the Ohio River.  The residue gas is further processed and compressed to be discharged to the natural gas pipeline for sales.  There are no above threshold quantity toxic substances present at the Fort Beeler Gas Plant.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe Fort Beeler Gas Plant h"

The mechanical integrity program was developed under the guidelines of manufacturer written recommendations, recognized/generally accepted good engineering practices, industry/regulatory standards and past operation history.  Employee training was designed to ensure/document employee understanding of facility operation and maintenance requirements. \n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe Fort Beeler Gas Plant has had no accidental releases in the past 5 years that have resulted in offsite consequences.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe Fort Beeler Gas Plant has developed and maintains a site-specific Emergency Response Plan (ERP) that includes actions to take in the event of an uncontrolled release of a hazardous substance.  The ERP includes the names and phone numbers not only of company personnel but also the names and phone numbers of support services (contractor, police departments, fire departments, medical services/hospitals, regulatory agencies, LEPC, etc.) that may be called upon for assistance. Liaison with these agencies is maintained to ensure timely and proper responses. Employee understanding of their responsibilities during an emergency situation is high priority.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nWilliams Ohio Valley Midstream LLC believes safety is an issue that can always be improved upon.  Williams continues to look for, develop, and implement programs that will improve an employee's ability to identify and correct potential workplace hazards. Williams also endeavors to ensure policies, programs and procedures are developed and implemented to meet applicable laws, rules and regulations.  Employee understanding of these policies, programs and procedures is high priority.  \n\n"
