Box 399\nLockport, LA 70374\n\n\nRisk Management Plan\n\n\nExecutive Summary:  North Treatment Plant\n\n8170 LDEQ Facility ID Number\n\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at your site\n\nDue to new regulations under the Chemical Accident Prevention Program, the District has developed a Risk Management Plan for chlorine gas.  The requirements involve instituting a prevention plan to avoid unnecessary chlorine leaks in addition to revising its existing emergency response procedure.  The expectations of the above mentioned requirements are to allow minimal injury and damage to occur, as well as to provide aid and guidance for other responders in the event of an accident.\n\nThe prevention plan, developed by the District, has been designed to ensure that all precautions are taken so as to prevent and mitigate any possible chlorine release.  One element of this plan is to assess the chlorine process for potential hazards that could contribute to a leak then correct the problems immediately.  Another essential component is written operating procedures for all duties associated with chlorine, while another is to provide proper training to employees involved in those duties.  From now on, all training and inspection information will be documented for future reference.\n\nThe revised emergency response plan has been implemented with the intention that plant personnel will respond, contain and repair all chlorine leaks.  One reason for this is because we feel our employees are properly trained and experienced enough to resolve the problem in a timely manner.  Another reason is because plant policy allows chlorine cylinders to be handled only during normal working hours. Consequently most releases will occur at this time while enough qualified people are present to initiate a response.  Nonetheless, it is possible to have a release after hours, but because two people are on site at all times they will be able mitigate t"

Location of Facility:\nThe Lafourche Parish Water District No. 1 - North  Treatment Plant is located on LA Highway 1 just south of the Country Club Subdivision in Thibodaux.  The physical address is 1052 Highway 1, Thibodaux. \n\n2. Background Information:\nThe Lafourche Parish Water District No. 1- North Treatment Plant is a potable drinking water production facility.  The District purifies water taken from Bayou Lafourche and distributes the water to customers throughout Lafourche Parish.\n\nChlorine gas is used as a disinfectant in the treatment process and is fed continuously.  The District has one (1) ton chlorine cylinders on site.  Plant personnel remove the one (1) ton cylinders when empty and replace them with full cylinders.  This involves transporting cylinders with a forklift, lifting the cylinders with a hoist, and mounting a regulator onto the cylinder valve.  These chlorine cylinders are only replaced during normal working hours due to safety concerns.\n      \nDistrict personnel can deal with most emergency response and repair situations; nonetheless, outside assistance may be necessary depending on the severity of the leak.  \"B\" repair kits, self-contained breathing apparatuses, and extra air bottles are stored in an emergency response and repair cart, which is available for quick response.  Containment suits and gloves can also be found in the cart.   \nSugarcane surrounds the plant on two sides with LA Highway 1 and the Country Club Subdivision on the other two.  The closest residence is located approximately 600 feet north of the plant.\n\n\n The Worst Case scenario and the Alternative Case scenario\n\n1. Worst Case Scenario\nThe worst case scenario for a chlorine gas release is when the total content of a one ton cylinder is expelled within ten minutes.  In this event, the total quantity released is 2000 pounds with the release rate being 200 pounds per minute.  The variables used in deter"

Also, passive mitigation can be considered because all cylinders are stored within an enclosed building.  When these conditions exist, the toxic endpoint is 3.5 miles according to the look up tables in the \"Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance\" model.  The population affected by this scenario is approximately 3,033 people.  No environmental receptors would be affected in such a case; however, schools, a prison, recreational areas, businesses, residences, and a hospital are within the 3.5 mile endpoint.  For this reason it is crucial that extreme precautions be taken to prevent this from ever occurring.\n\n2. Alternative Case Scenario    \nThe most likely case scenario of a chlorine gas release for Lafourche Parish Water Dist. #1 is a malfunctioning valve on the cylinder itself.  When a chlorine cylinder is put into service, the valve is never open more than <\" which is approximately 0.05 square inches.  Using this information, the release rate of a jammed valve is calculated to be 9.63 pounds per minute (information acquired from chlorine supplier).  Because this scenario will tend to occur during normal working hours, as explained above, the time taken to repair the leak will be minimal.  It is estimated through drills that it takes approximately ten (10) minutes to repair a leak such as this.  Accordingly, a fifteen (15) minute release at 9.63 pounds per minute allows 145 pounds of chlorine to be expelled.  The variables used in determining the distance that the gas travels is an urban topography, an F-stability class (atmospheric conditions), and a wind speed of 1.5 m/s.

It will also aid other emergency response personnel by providing guidance in the event of an accident.  Some of the elements of this plan are referenced to below.\n\n1. Alarm:\nOne method of determining that a leak has occurred is by the chlorine leak detector alarm, while another is by general observation.  This chlorine leak detector sounds an alarm when elevated chlorine levels are found.  It continues for the duration of the abnormal concentrations; consequently the alarm will not silence until the chlorine leak is repaired.  If concentrations are not high enough to trip the alarm, the leak should be minimal; therefore, an employee may find a leak before the leak detector does.  In any case, all plant personnel should immediately report to the primary assembly area, which is the lab/control room. If it is inaccessible, they should then report to an area in the yard that is upwind of the leak.  There, all other personnel shall be notified of the situation, and a code response will be initiated. \n\n2. Overall Emergency Response Coordination:\nAfter gathering as much information as possible from the staff, the Ranking Supervisor will be responsible for coordinating the emergency response.  He will have to manage the following:\n\n7 Determine the severity by information gathered and initiate a code response.     (Code \"Yellow\" or \"Red\")\n7 Notify all employees on site of leak via telephone and intercom.\n7 Make sure all personnel are accounted for.\n7 Appoint duties to available personnel.\n7 Determine the need to notify appropriate agencies for outside response assistance (greater than 10 pounds released).\n\nUntil state police responders arrive, the ranking supervisor will continue to command the response.\n \n 3.

Generally, a major chlorine release will last at most, 30-40 minutes, therefore shelter in place will more than likely be used in an emergency situation.  Nevertheless, personnel will be prepared to evacuate the premises on short notice.  Evacuation will be utilized if there is a massive quantity of chlorine released or if the wind direction requires it.\n\n7. Public Notification:\nWhen outside assistance is required, the fire department, sheriff's office, and the local emergency planning office will be informed of the situation.  Together a decision will be made on whom to notify.  The most likely case will require sheltering residences within = mile of the plant for precautionary purposes.  As a result residences will be asked to shut windows, close any ventilation system, and listen for further advisories.\n\n8. Emergency Treatment:\nA section in the emergency response plan is designated for emergency treatment for victims for chlorine exposure.
