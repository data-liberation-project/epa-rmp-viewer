Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Agland Co-op in Gaylord, Minnesota are strongly committed to employee, public, and\nenvironmental safety.  This commitment is an inherent part of our comprehensive accidental release\nprevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance,\nand employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement\nappropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  We coordinate our\nresponse efforts with the Gaylord Fire Department, which provides additional emergency response\nexpertise.\n\n  2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities include support services for crop production.  We have anhydrous\nammonia stored in two interconnected 30,000-gallon tanks, thirty-seven1,000-gallon nurse tanks and\nsix 1,000-1,000-gallon nurse tanks at our facility in Gaylord, Minnesota (Figure 1).  The maximum\namount stored at 85% standard maximum storage capacity is 109,000 gallons (476,776.9 pounds)\nincluding the capacity of the on-site nurse tanks.   The largest single storage vessel at our facility\ncontains 262,446 pounds at  85% standard maximum storage capacity.\n\n  3. Worst Case Release and Alternative Release Scenarios\n  4. General Accidental Release Prevention Program\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the EPA's accidental release prevention\nrequirements as set forth in 40 CFR part 68.  The following sections briefly describe the elements\nof the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nAgland Co-op maintains a detailed record of safety information"

Any findings from the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely\nmanner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nAgland Co-op maintains written operating procedures to ensure that activities within our covered\nprocesses are conducted safely.  These procedures address various modes of operation; the\ninformation is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes\n(Appendix B).\n\nTraining\nAgland Co-op has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are\noperating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nAgland Co-op conducts documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper\noperation.  Maintenance checks are conducted by qualified personnel with previous training in\nmaintenance practices.  Examples of process equipment that would receive maintenance checks\ninclude:  pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency\nshutdown systems, controls, and pumps.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance\nchecks are corrected in a safe and timely manner (Appendix C).\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at Agland Co-op to manage changes in process chemicals,\ntechnology, equipment, and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or other\nemployees whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly notified\nof the modification and offered training to deal with it.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nAgland Co-op routinely conducts pre-startup safety reviews related to new processes and\nmodifications in established processes.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction,"

Any non-compliance issue\ndiscovered during the audit is promptly corrected.\n\nEmployee Participation\nAgland Co-op truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team\neffort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident\nprevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all\ninformation created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP, particularly information\nresulting from process hazard analyses.\n\n  5. Five-year Accident History\nAgland Co-op has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years. \nDue to our stringent release prevention policies, no accidental release has occurred during this\nperiod.\n\n  6. Emergency Response Plan\nAgland Co-op maintains a written emergency action plan to deal with accidental releases of\nhazardous materials.  The plan addresses all aspects of emergency response including first aid and\nmedical treatment, evacuations, and in the event of an accidental release, Agland Co-op will contact\nlocal emergency response agencies and the public (Appendix A). Agland Co-op maintains a written\nemergency action plan which is coordinated with the local fire department and the LEPC.
