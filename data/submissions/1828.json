Our facility has one 25,000 gallon tank for storing anhydrous, and two atmospheric-pressure 50,000 gallon tank for storing aqua.  We also have equipment for receiving anhydrous by truck, equipment for converting anhydrous to aqua, and equipment for transferring anhydrous and aqua from storage to trucks for delivery to customers.  It is our policy to meet, or exceed, all local, state, and national standards relating to handling ammonia.\n\nIn the past five years, we have not had any accidents or releases with off-site consequences.\n\nSpecific safety features that we employ to minimize the impact of an accidental release include:\n\n1. Excess flow valves to prevent flow from the tank if any anhydrous hose or line breaks.\n2. Pressure relief valves on the anhydrous storage tank to prevent overpressuring and rupture of the tank.\n3. Annual inspections by an insurance loss control specialist to ensure that our equipment is maintained in a manner that ensures safe operation and prevents releases.\n\nTo further ensure safe operation of the facility, our employees are trained in procedures for safe handling of hazardous materials, and in safe operating and maintenance procedures.  We have also coordinated with the Grangeville Volunteer Fire Department to respond in the unlikely event of an emergency.\n\nAs required by the EPA, we have analyzed the worst-case release scenario defined by the EPA. This scenario involves a release of the entire contents of the anhydrous storage tank.  According to information supplied by the EPA the impact from this scenario would extend 3.9 miles from our facility, and would impact the city of Grangeville and its schools.\n\nIt is extremely unlikely that an event such as EPAs worst-case release scenario will ever occur.
