      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe Mandan Water Treatment Plant (WTP) has submitted a Risk Management Plan (RMP) to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) to comply with the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68, the Chemical Accident Prevention Rule, herein referred to as the \"Rule\".  As such, the Mandan WTP staff have completed a comprehensive review of the risk associated with the regulated process, water chlorination, at its facility.  Additionally, the Mandan WTP has completed an Offsite Consequence Analysis and has developed and implemented a prevention program to promote safe operation of the regulated process.  The facility has also updated emergency response procedures and initiated communication with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and Fire Department to form a cooperative response procedure for potential releases from the facility.  The prevention program focuses on training employees in safe operating and maintenance procedures and to recognize the potential hazards associated with the regulated chemical and processes.\n\nBackground\n\nThe Mandan water works was established in 1911 along the banks of the Missouri River approximately 2 miles northeast of the City.  The facility is owned and operated by the City of Mandan and currently has a design treatment capacity of approximately 12 million gallons per day (MGD).  The facility is a conventional filtration plant that incorporates pre-sedimentation, pre-treatment, lime softening, recarbonation, fluoridation, stabilization, and chlorine disinfection.  Gaseous chlorine, contained in one-ton chlorine containers, is introduced into the water using a vacuum feed system.  The facility stores a maximum of two one-ton containers onsite, for a combined total of 4,000 pounds of chlorine.  According to the Rule, any facility with greater than 2,500 pounds of chlorine onsite is required to develop and implement a RMP.  Therefore, the Mandan WTP chlorination system is a Risk Management-regulat"

The Mandan WTP operates daily until the reservoirs are filled.  The chlorine room and its components are visually inspected at least once per day during operation.  When the system is not in operation, the chlorination system equipment and all related process valves are disabled.  The door to the chlorine room is kept locked at all times.\n\nChlorine is a toxic gas stored as a liquid under pressure.  Its boiling point is -29.40F.  Chlorine is irritating and corrosive to the eyes, skin, and respiratory tract and reacts violently with easily oxidized materials.  Contact with evaporating chlorine or equipment releasing flashing chlorine can cause frostbite burns.  Chlorine gas is heavier than air and will travel along the ground and fill low spaces and pits by displacing air.  One-ton chlorine containers are welded steel tanks with removable steel protective caps over the container valves.  They are built to meet Federal specifications, and are regularly inspected and pressure tested in accordance with Federal regulations.\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis\n\nThe Mandan WTP staff have studied their chlorination system and the potential hazards it presents onsite and offsite.  The results of this analysis are presented in the Offsite Consequence Analysis (Hazard Assessment section of the RMP), which is composed of a Worst Case and Alternate (most likely) Case Scenario.\n\nWorst Case Scenario\n\nAlthough the USEPA acknowledges that the Worst Case Scenario is not a likely scenario, the Mandan WTP staff have formulated such a scenario to alert the public to the worst possible release.  The Worst Case Scenario for this facility involves the release of 2,000 pounds of gaseous chlorine (the entire contents of one container) directly into the atmosphere over a 10-minute period.  Due to the location of the facility in a rela"

      "SummaryText": "tively rural setting (with few trees or buildings nearby to dissipate the release), the analysis estimated that a release of this magnitude would create a radius of influence of 3.0 miles.  The radius of influence represents the distance the chlorine plume would travel from the facility, under assumed meteorological conditions, before the concentration is reduced below the Emergency Response Planning Guideline 2 (ERPG-2) level, the \"toxic endpoint\".  The USEPA's RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance states the ERPG-2 concentration \"is that below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms that could impair an individual's ability to take protective action.\"  A population of approximately 12,000, including most of the City of Mandan, resides within this radius.  The USEPA requires that the radius of influence be calculated considering a wind speed of 1.5 meters per second, or 3.4 miles per hour.  Historically, average wind speed in the vicinity of Mandan is 10.2 miles per hour; thus, a release would likely disperse at a faster rate than estimated under the RMP assumed conditions.\n\nAlternate Case Scenario\n\nThe Mandan WTP staff have also selected an alternate, or most likely scenario as part of the RMP.  This scenario involves a release occurring inside the chlorine room.  As stated, the Mandan WTP utilizes a vacuum-operated chlorination system.  The vacuum system is, for all practical purposes, virtually fail-safe.  A pressure regulating valve is installed directly onto the chlorine container, between the container and the chlorinator.  For this valve to open, a vacuum must be present on the chlorinator side of the valve.  The vacuum is created by water passing through the ejector on the chlorinator.  When a vacuum is present and the valve is open, gaseous chlorine may be drawn from the container, through the valve, into the chlorina"

In the absence of a vacuum on the chlorinator side of the valve, the valve closes and chlorine cannot escape through the valve on the container.  In the event of equipment failure on the chlorinator side of the valve, the valve is designed to immediately close due to the absence of a vacuum.  Because the regulating valve is attached directly to the chlorine container, the most likely potential escape route for chlorine gas from the container is between the valve stem on the container and the pressure-regulating valve.\n\nThe Alternate Scenario modeled for this facility involves a leak from the lead gasket between the regulating valve and the chlorine container.  Each time a new container is connected to the system, a new gasket is installed.  Although the gasket is checked for leaks immediately after installation, the Alternate Scenario assumes a small leak is not detected prior to shutdown of the system at the end of the day.  The leak continues throughout the night and the entire contents of the vessel is released over a period of 855 minutes (14< hours).  Because the vessel is inside the building with the door closed, the room acts as a passive mitigation measure and contains the release.  The radius of influence for this release is 0.1-mile, which includes only the residential properties located on the Mandan WTP property, and an estimated population of 6.  Environmental receptors affected include the Missouri River, an unnamed stream, and the Amoco wildlife preserve.  In recognition of this potential release, the Mandan WTP will integrate Risk Management Program training with its existing training program.  Increased employee awareness of the consequences of even a small release is expected to further reduce the likelihood of such a scenario occurring.\n\nEmergency Response\n\nAlthough the potential for a release exists, the Mandan WTP has determined that the chlorination system is safe by industry standards and that the potent"

      "SummaryText": "ial for a release from the facility is very small.  The facility is working with the LEPC and the Fire Department to prepare emergency responders in the event of a major release.  The Mandan WTP employees do not respond to releases other than those that can be stopped by closing a valve and will not enter the room to stop a chlorine release if the chlorine concentration is estimated to be above safe levels.  The Mandan WTP relies on the Mandan Fire Department and the Bismarck Fire Department/Hazardous Materials Response Team (HAZMAT), which works closely with the LEPC to plan response procedures in the event of a major chlorine release at the facility.  The results of the Offsite Consequence Analysis have been communicated to the LEPC and the Fire Department.\n\nAccident History\n\nThe Mandan WTP has not had an incident in the past 5 years that resulted in injury onsite or offsite.  The Mandan WTP management is committed to ongoing employee training to increase awareness of the potential hazards associated with the chlorination process and to further reduce the likelihood of future accidents which may result in injury and equipment or property damage.\n\nPrevention Program\n\nThe day-to-day result of the Rule is the mandatory implementation of a prevention program.  The intent of the prevention program is to document procedures within the facility that promote safe operation of the regulated process and reduce the potential for an uncontrolled release of the regulated substance (chlorine gas).  Components of the prevention program include the assembly of safety information, the performance of periodic hazard reviews, the establishment of safe operating and maintenance procedures, updating training policies, conducting routine compliance audits, the development of an incident investigation procedure, and the formalization of a management system.\n\nSafety information, such as Material Safety Data Sheets and equipment specifications, have been compiled and attached to the RMP f"

The facility has committed to comprehensive employee training and communication with offsite responders in the event of a major chlorine release.  The facility has examined the hazards associated with the regulated process, identified additional safety measures, and set a schedule for implementation of those safety measures.  The Mandan WTP staff intend to use the Risk Management Program as a means to operate more safely and efficiently and to communicate more effectively with offsite responders and the public it serves."
