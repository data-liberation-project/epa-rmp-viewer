Introduction\n\nA Risk Management Program has been implemented at the CBQ, LLC a Subsidiary of Carl Buddig and Company (CBQ) facility located at 15600 South Wentworth Avenue in South Holland, Illinois, for the reduction of accidental releases of hazardous materials. This Risk Management Plan (RMP) is being submitted as the five-year RMP update.  This RMP includes the management, administrative, procedural, and technological controls that work together to minimize the risk to site personnel, contractors, visitors, the community and environment at large of hazardous chemical releases. The RMP is organized to correspond with specific U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) RMP, Program 3 of 40 CFR 68, definitions and requirements of Subpart G, including: \n\n?

CBQ Policies To Protect Health, Environment, and Safety\n\nRisk management and safety are important concerns at CBQ; this RMP formalizes and documents these activities. CBQ is committed to conducting its operations in a safe and responsible manner and to reducing risks to human health and to the environment. It is CBQ's policy to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local rules and regulations.\n\n\n\nThis RMP has identified potential hazards and has taken steps to design and maintain a safe facility in order to prevent releases, and minimize the consequences of accidental releases, which could occur. RMP addresses potentially catastrophic chemical releases that could result in immediate harm and acute health effects "

Facility Identification\n\nThe CBQ facility is located at 15600 South Wentworth Avenue in South Holland, Illinois.  CBQ is an importer, manufacturer and distributor of quality pork. Specializing in ribs, both domestic and imported, the company sells to both retail and foodservice customers around the country. \n\n\n\nThe NAICS code for the facility is 311612.  A large portion of the facility is refrigerated to preserve products for processing and distribution.   \n\n\n\nThe facility uses ammonia for refrigeration, and is regulated under 40 CFR Part 68, the EPA RMP Rule. There are two (2) refrigeration systems onsite that are used for refrigerating coolers, freezers, and production areas at the facility. The amount of ammonia in System 1 is approximately 23,000 pounds and the amount of ammonia in System 2 has been calculated at approximately 9,700 pounds, for a total of 32,700 pounds of anhydrous ammonia at the facility. \n\n\n\nAn aerial map identifying the site location is included as Appendix A. \n\n\n\nIV.

The next audit of the PSM program will occur by August 16, 2021, in compliance with the requirement to conduct PSM audits every three years.  The elements of the PSM / Program 3 prevention program and a brief description are listed below.\n\n?    Employee Participation - CBQ has developed a site-specific employee participation plan that ensures employees and their representatives are consulted when conducting and developing process hazard analyses, standard operating proceures, and other information required to be developed under the PSM/RMP regulation.  In addition, the employee participation program will ensure employees and their representatives have access to process hazard analyses and all other information required to be developed under PSM/RMP.  \n\n?    Process Safety Information - CBQ maintains a site-specific PSI program that ensures information pertaining to the hazards, technology, and equipment of the process are properly developed and maintained. Process safety information for the ammonia process has been compiled and was last reviewed on August 23, 2019.\n\n?    Process Hazard Analysis - CBQ has updated a site-specific PHA program that ensures a PHA is conducted initially, at a minimum of every five (5) years, and whenever a change is significant enough to require a change in PSI.  In addition, this program ensures PHAs are conducted in accordance with OSHA and EPA regulations and ensures findings and recommendations of PHAs are properly documented. CBQ completed a thorough PHA study for Systems 1 and 2 on August 23, 2019.\n\n?

      "SummaryText": "nhydrous ammonia is investigated, within 48 hours, by a team of at least one person knowledgeable in the process.  This procedure will also make provisions to ensure a report is prepared at the conclusion of the investigation and findings are promptly addressed. \n\n?    Compliance Audit - CBQ has updated a site-specific compliance audit program that ensures compliance audits are conducted at a minimum of every three years to verify that CBQ PSM/RMP practices and procedures are adequate and are being followed.  The next compliance audit will be conducted by August 16, 2021.  \n\n?    Hot Work Permits - CBQ has updated a best management practice for hot work.  CBQ reviewed their hot work permit procedures for the refrigeration systems on August 16, 2021.\n\n\n\nVII.    Five-Year Accident History\n\nThe CBQ facility has experienced one (1) accidental anhydrous ammonia release, in the past five (5) years, which resulted in an evacuation of the facility. An incident investigation report was conducted and prepared for the release. This incident investigation report outlines the details (date of incident, description of incident, contributing factors, recommendations for prevention, etc.) of the anhydrous ammonia release. \n\n\n\nVIII.    Emergency Action Program\n\nCBQ has developed an Emergency Action Plan (EAP) to ensure that in the event of an emergency the facility personnel are aware of the appropriate actions to take and authorities to contact in order to mitigate the effects of a release. \n\n\n\nCBQ has conducted training for facility employees on proper evacuation procedures and has interacted (i.e. onsite inspections) with the South Holland Fire Department. \n\n\n\nCBQ has coordinated their EAP with the South Holland Fire Department.  This coordination effort has included providing the agency with a copy of our EAP, and providing a site diagram and hazardous material information, meeting with South Holland Fire Department personnel to discuss the facility's operations/processes, and encouraging p"

      "SummaryText": "eriodic on-site inspections and coordination with South Holland Fire Department personnel.\n\n\n\nCBQ has determined that the South Holland Fire Department will be utilized for response to all accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. \n\n\n\nThe facility has strategically placed windsocks on the corners of the facility buildings for use in determining wind direction in the event of an ammonia release and evacuation of the building.  \n\n\n\nThe current Safety Data Sheet (SDS) for anhydrous ammonia is included in Appendix E. \n\n\n\nIX.    Emergency Communications\n\nThe telephone numbers of agencies and plant personnel that may be contacted in case of an emergency are available onsite.\n\n\n\nX.    Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nChemical safety is an important part of CBQ operations. CBQ is currently implementing their Process Safety Management Program. Continuous improvement in safety is an important goal for CBQ. \n\n\n\nXI.    Management Program\n\nCBQ has updated a management system to oversee the implementation of the risk management program elements.  This system has assigned qualified person(s) (or position) to assist in the development, implementation, and integration of the risk management program elements.  If any portion of the program is delegated to others, the names or positions of those individuals will be documented and the lines of authority defined through an organization chart or similar document.  Currently, David Streeter, Director-Occupational Safety and Security, is responsible for implementation of the overall Risk Management Program.\n\n  \n\n"
