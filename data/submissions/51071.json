The facility handles quantities in excess of the EPA RMP threshold planning quantity for a flammable substance.  The facility is considered a RMP Program Level 3.\n\nThe facility is primarily regulated by the Department of Transportation (DOT), as it is part of our interstate pipeline system.  The DOT-regulated part of the facility includes the large aboveground \"breakout\" tanks and associated piping.  DOT-regulated facilities are exempt from RMP requirements but already have emergency plans in place.\n\nThe facility receives the products mentioned above via a DOT regulated pipeline, stores the propane in a 4,200,000 gallon underground cavern, butane in a 4,200,000 gallon underground cavern, isobutane in a 2,000,000 gallon underground cavern and delivers these products to a DOT regulated pipeline system.\n\nThe worst case scenario (WCS) for the facility is a release from the propane storage cavern due to aboveground piping failure that results in a vapor cloud expolsion.  The estimated amount of propane released in the WCS is 420,000 gallons (1,800,000 pounds).  Under EPA requirements the WCS assumes weather conditions that allow the chemical to travel as far as possible and further assumes that none of the facility's mechanical controls or safety systems are functioning.  Based on these assumptions, the WCS could potentially affect nearby public receptors.  The process controls mentioned in the previous paragraph minimize the potential for the worst case scenario to occur.\n\nThe facility complies with Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) regulations, including the process safety management (PSM) requirements.  Facility personnel undergo operations competency training and testing including emergency response training drills.  Agencies also receive SARA Tier II Chemical Inventory reports annually.  In addition, the facility is inspected p"
