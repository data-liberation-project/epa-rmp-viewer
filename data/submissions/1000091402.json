All employees at CWP are trained in chlorine containment procedures and all are trained in the use of SCBA equipment.\n\n\n\n2-TYPES OF EMERGENCY\n\na. Chlorine Release\n\nIn the event of an equipment or human failure, potential sources for chlorine releases are:\n\n1. One Ton chlorine Container\n\n2. Chlorine supply lines and chlorination equipment.\n\nAt this facility, the loss of any utilities including electricity will not increase the potential for a chlorine release.\n\n\n\n3-SCOPE\n\nThe scope of this plan includes:\n\na. A chlorine release contained within the plant facilities and controllable by\n\nCUWCD personnel and equipment.\n\nb. A chlorine release affecting or with the potential to affect the area surrounding the\n\nCUWCD; such a release would require outside assistance.\n\n\n\n4-PLANNING FOR HANDLING THE EMERGENCY\n\nResponsibility:\n\nThe Plant Manager is ultimately responsible for the implementation of the plan. He is responsible for keeping the plan current and insuring that all plant employees are properly trained.\n\nInitiating the ER (Emergency Response Plan)\n\nThe ERP is initiated by any employee at any time in response to a known or perceived chlorine release. Initiating employee will notify all other personnel at the plant (if any) by best means possible (i.e. intercom, cell phone, two way radio, or in person).\n\n4.2 Assembly Area\n\nPrimary --Control Room\n\nSecondary --Front Gate Area\n\nUpon receiving notification, each employee is to secure his job and report to the primary assembly area (Control Room). If inaccessible, the employee should report to the secondar"

The \"On Duty Operator\" will be responsible for accounting for all employees and visitors.  If not present, the senior employee present will be responsible.  If not present the Plant Manager is to be notified as soon as reasonably possible.\n\n4.3 Overall Emergency Response Coordination.\n\nThe Plant Manager is the responsible overall emergency response coordinator. In the absence of the Plant Manager, the On Duty Operator will be responsible.\n\na. Verify that an actual chlorine release exists.\n\nIf not already known, investigate carefully to verify that the release is real and not a false alarm. Must follow operating procedures for entering the chlorine room. Even the slightest smell of chlorine in the air will verify that the chlorine release is present. Do not proceed into any area that smells of chlorine for any reason without self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA). Notify all CWP employees not present to report to the plant to assist in the containment of a chlorine release.\n\nNotify the Don A. Christiansen Regional Water Treatment Plant that we have a chlorine release and need backup assistance (this is another Central Utah Water Conservancy District (CUWCD) plant and all employees are also fully trained). The fire department has also agreed to respond to a request for backup SCBA equipped personnel to act as a safety backup to our men if needed. DACRWTP will use District employees to contain a chlorine leak if reasonably possible but if needed the fire department is to be used as a secondary backup. To request fire department assistance, call 911 and request SCBA equipped backup to our plant personnel who will be doing the actual chlorine release containment.\n\nb. Determine the need for a rescue team.\n\nRescue team, if needed, will be made up of trained employees present. Rescue team members must wear SCBA and follow training and proper procedures to "

The senior CWP employee present will be the team leader. Team members must wear SCBA and follow proper procedures. This team will investigate to determine the source and extent of the leak. This team will take actions to make an initial containment of the release if determined reasonable to do so.\n\nd. Determine the need for outside assistance and/or notification.\n\nAs overall emergency response coordinator, the Plant Manager, or in his absence the On Duty Operator, is authorized to notify directly or through delegation, the appropriate outside agencies/neighbors. This may include the fire department, police/sheriff department, Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), industrial and/or residential neighbors, and anyone else who might provide assistance in responding to the emergency or who might be affected by it. Notify CUWCD management in Orem as soon as it is reasonably possible to do so.\n\ne. The On Duty Operator (On Call Operator after hours) is designated backup to the Plant Manager and is responsible for performing all the duties in the event of the unavailability of the Plant Manager.\n\n4.4 Telephone Answering\n\nAny requests from the media are to be referred to the emergency response coordinator. If that person is unavailable, take the person's name, organization, and phone number. Persons assigned to answer the phone are not authorized to discuss the incident with the media or with any other callers except people involved with the emergency response. Simply state \"We have had an emergency. We are responding to it now (or it is now ended). Someone from our plant will return your call as soon as possible if you will give me your name, organization, and phone number. I am not authorized to give you any information.\" Give your name if asked.\n\n4.5 Non-Work Hours Procedures.\n\nThe plant is normal"

The computers constantly control and monitor the plant and are connected to sensors in the chlorine storage and process areas. The computers monitor for any chlorine release and will react to a release by going into an alarm condition. The computers are programed to call out to the \"On Call Operator\" during the non-working hours and alert the On Call Operator with a voice message programed to indicate the nature of the plant alarm including a possible chlorine release. Upon receiving a possible chlorine release alarm, the Operator will then proceed to the plant, alerting all other plant employees by cellular phone on the way. All plant employees contacted are to proceed to the plant to give assistance.\n\n4.6 Outside Assistance\n\nThe overall emergency coordinator will meet or will delegate an available person to meet at the front gate and escort any outside responders notified by the coordinator to assist in the response. If the front gate is not accessible, the responders should be met at the public road upwind of the release.\n\n4.7 Media Inquiry\n\nMedia inquiries should be handled, as time permits, by the emergency response coordinator or other CUWCD management personnel. Arriving media representatives should be allowed to wait at the front gate until escorted into the main office when accessible and time permits. Under no conditions is the front entrance allowed to become blocked to hinder the passage of emergency responders and plant employees. No one other than plant employees and emergency responders are allowed access to the plant grounds at anytime during the emergency without prior authorization. When time permits, the media should be given background information on chlorine. When facts are known about the incident and the cause, these should be given to the media.

IF THE CAUSE IS NOT KNOWN, ADVISE THE MEDIA IT IS UNDER INVESTIGATION. NORMALLY THE QUANTITY OF CHLORINE EMITTED DURING A RELEASE IS UNKNOWN UNTIL A THOROUGH INVESTIGATION IS COMPLETE. IF SUCH IS THE CASE, SO ADVISE THE MEDIA.\n\nWhen dealing with the media remember to be honest, courteous, straight forward, and concerned. Do not speculate. Do not give \"off the record\" comments.\n\n4.8 Shelter/Evacuation\n\nEven though this facility will be working closely with the LEPC, Fire Department, and other emergency officials, a decision regarding whether to evacuate or to shelter affected outside persons is a difficult one. Generally for us, a significant chlorine release is likely to last for up to one hour before it is contained.  Therefore, sheltering in place is the normal mode to be utilized during an emergency. While it is unlikely that this facility could have a chlorine release requiring evacuation, nevertheless, we must be prepared for such an eventually. If it is anticipated that a release cannot be soon contained or is of a massive quantity, the evacuation option should be utilized. Call 911 and suggest that sheltering of residences within (indicate immediate area or more as needed) and evacuation of others be implemented.\n\n4.8.1 Neighboring Residences and Facilities\n\nThere are no residences close to this facility.\n\n4.8.2 Responsibility\n\nThese duties are the responsibility of the overall emergency coordinator.

Any injured person suffering from chlorine inhalation should be sent to the hospital. To the extent possible an injured employee should be accompanied by another employee. Notification to the family should be made as soon as practical by the plant manager or his designee, preferably following contact with the Human Resource Manager. As part of training and annual refresher training, all employees are trained in first aid procedures for chlorination contact and exposures, using as a reference chapter 6 of The\n\nChlorine Institute's pamphlet #1, \"The Chlorine Manual\".\n\n5. OUTSIDE REGULATORY AGENCY NOTIFICATION\n\nThis contact is to be made the CUWCD Treatment Operations Manager if available, or if not available, the Plant Manager. If both are unavailable, the ranking supervisor at the facility will give the immediate verbal notification.\n\n5.1 Verbal Notification\n\nThe law requires that this Facility immediately report any releases of chlorine equal to or greater that ten (10) pounds to the following agencies:\n\n1. National Response Center;\n\n2. Local Emergency Planning Committee; and\n\n3. State Emergency Planning Commission.\n\nInformation should include the following:\n\n1.
