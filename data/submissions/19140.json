If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department and law enforcement personnel to mitigate any release to residents and the environment of our community.\n2. Facility Information: The primary activity at the facility is the storage and sales of fertilizers to farm producers in our area.\n      a. Anhydrous Ammonia is is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.\n     b. The maximum quantity stored at this facility 130000 lbs in our 30000 gallon tank.\n3.Worst-case release scenario and alternative release scenario:\n    a. The worst case scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank. The maximum quantity released would be approximately 130000 lbs which represents the volume of the storage tank at 85% capacity as limited by the design standards. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion of 200 ppm) is 4.4 miles.\n    b. The alternative release scenario ( most likely potental incident) is a release from a break in a transfer hose. The distance to the endpoint ( point of dispersion of 200 ppm) is .3 miles.\n4. Accidental Release Prevention Program: The facility has implemented the provisions of \" Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\" published by the American National Standards Institute Inc. and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.\n5. Five-Year Accident History: There has been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage, or environmental damage on or offsite. \n6. Emergency Response Program: Our facility has a written emergency action plan in accordance with OSHA Standard, 29 CFR"
