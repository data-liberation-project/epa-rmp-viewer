Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nWe at the City of Sebring Wastewater Treatment Plant are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, we are completely coordinated with the City of Sebring Fire Department, which provides highly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\n2.  The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nOur facility's primary activities encompass treatment of domestic wastewater.  We have one regulated substance present at our facility, chlorine.  Chlorine is used in the treatment of the wastewater effluent.  The maximum inventory of chlorine at our facility is 3500.00 pounds (2 tanks).\n\n3.  The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and Altenative Release Scenario(s), including Administrative Controls and Mitigation Measures to Limit the Distances for each Reported Scenario.\n\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the look-up tables and equations provide by the EPA in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from two (2) chlorine tanks stored at the Chlorine Tank Storage Building.  The scenario involves the release of 3500 pounds of chlorine in a gaseous form over 10 minutes.  Passive mitigation controls such as enclosures are also taken into account to calculate the scenario.  Under worst case weather conditions, namely "

The scenario involves the release of 3,492.00 pounds of chlorine in a gaseous form over 180 minutes.  Passive mitigation controls such as enclosures are taken into account to calculate the scenario.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maxcimum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L is 0.38 miles.\n\n4.The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68.  The chlorine injection sysytem at our facility is subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.\n\nThe following paragraphs briefly describe the elements of our release prevention program that are in place at our stationary source.\n\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION:  City of Sebring Wastewater Treatment Plant maintains detailed records of written safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nPROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS:  Our facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our process are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analysis is What-if and Checklist Analysis.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of five (5) years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOPERATING PROCEDURES:  For the purposes of safely conducting activities within our cov"

These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency operations, normal shutdown and statrup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved with the process.\n\nTRAINING: The City of Sebring Wastewater Treatment Plant has a training program in place to ensure that employees are competent in the operating procedures associasted with the process.  New employees receive basic training in process operations followed by on-the-job supervision until they are deemed competent to work independently.  Refresher training is provided at least every year and more frequently as needed.\n\nMECHANICAL INTEGRITY:  City of Sebring Wastewater Treatment Plant carries out regular maintenance checks on process equipment to demonstrate proper functions.  Process equipment examined by these checks include among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown ssytems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenacne practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nMANAGEMENT OF CHANGE:   Written procedures are in place at the City of Sebring Wastewater Treatment Plant to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  Process operators, maintenacne personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promtly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\nPRE-STARTUP REVIEWS:  Pre-startup safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular pra"

These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCOMPLIANCE AUDITS:  The City of Sebring Wastewater Treatment Plant conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  These audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nINCIDENT INVESTIGATION:  THe CIty of Sebring Wastewater Treatment Plant promtly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastropjhic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from re-occurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nEMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION:   The City of Sebring Wastewater Treatment Plant believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommed improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation to the RMP rule in particular information resulting from  process hazard analyses.\n\nCONTRACTORS:  On occasion, our plant hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out.  The City of Sebring Wastwater Treatment Plant has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related to the contractor's work and the processes.  Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:  The City of Sebring Wastewater Treatment Plan"

Due to our stringent release prevention policies, there has been no accidental release during this period.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN:  The City of Sebring Wastewater Treatment Plant has written emergency response plan to deal with accidental release of hazardous materials.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.\n\nOur emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.\n\nHighlands County Emergency Operations Center is the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) with which our emergency plan has been coordinated and verified.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:  Several developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program.  Installation of a windsock near the Chlorine Storage Building and installation of a chlorine process monitoring system are some of the major steps we want to take to improve safety at our facility.  These changes are expected to be implemented by in 2000."
