              "Description": "Pawtucket Power Associates (PPA) uses anhydrous ammonia for the Inlet Cooling System that is regulated by OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations.  In 2001, PPA reviewed and updated their PSM Plan to address OSHA requirements, including a majority of the RMP Prevention Program Elements.  The major elements of the prevention program for anhydrous ammonia are summarized below:  PPA maintains documentation on the anhydrous ammonia system that provides information on the equipments' design, configuration and safe operating parameters.  The system is equipped with instrumentation that indicates potential problems.  Pressure relief valves mounted on the process vessels discharge into the header system that vents through a water deluge system and provides mitigation in the event of a release.  In March 2001, PPA updated their PSM Plan and conducted a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA), consistent with PSM requirements.  Using the \"What If\" technique, PPA identified potential malfunctions that could occur, along with the associated hazards, consequences,and controls.  PPA has completed the majority of the corrective actions that were identified or required as a result of the PHA.  PPA maintains proper operating procedures that describe proper start-up, shutdown, normal operating, and emergency actions.  All system operators and lead operators receive training in operating and maintenance procedures, as well as safety information at the start of their employment at the facility.  In addition, continuing on-the-job training is provided to all operators by PPA.  The competency of operators is evaluated by the observations of supervisors and communicated to employees as issues arise and during routine performance reviews.  PPA has certified that all employees currently working at the facility have the required skills, knowledge, and abilities to safely operate the system.  Operators routinely inspect process equipment and monitor system operating parameters throughout their shifts.  Storage tanks are inspected on a daily basis, and the system is inspected on an annual basis and on all system restarts by the contractor.  Preventative maintenance is conducted on an as-needed basis and each year during the facility's annual outage period.  PPA utilizes skilled outside contractors with extensive knowledge and experience with anhydrous ammonia systems to conduct inspections and maintenance whenever such activities may result in potential exposure to ammonia and prior to each system restart.  PPA has established Manangement of Change, Hot Work Permits, Employee Participation, and Contractor Safety Programs, as required by both the OSHA PSM and EPA RMP regulations.",
