The commercial truck or railcar is temporarily parked on the Facility property while the anhydrous ammonia is transferred to the on-site storage tank.  The transfer process from the commercial truck is performed by the commercial truck operator.  Helena does not own or operate the commercial truck.  The vendor is responsible to Helena for complying with relevant operation, maintenance, and training procedures and documentation.  At a minimum, the vendor must (1) have in place and certify compliance with applicable and relevant DOT and OSHA regulations, (2) make available to Helena and EPA upon request any contractor-related documentation necessary to demonstrate compliance, and (3) certify that it has in place emergency shut-down procedures for ammonia unloading operations and that its OSHA and DOT programs comply with federal, state, and local regulatory requirements.  Further, Helena will provide a copy of its Contingency Plan to its vendor for review and a copy of its RMPr Document upon request.\n\nThe transfer process from the railcar is performed by trained and qualified Helena personnel.  When the railcar arrives on the Helena rail spur and while it is temporarily stored, Helena personnel (1) review the bill of lading, (2) inspect the railcar to document that there are no leaking valves or piping, (3) document that the railcar has been marked accordance with DOT requirements, and (4) document that the railcar has not been overfilled.   If it is determined that the railcar is overfilled, leaking, or has not been properly marked, Helena personnel will coordinate the return of the railcar to the owner.\n",

      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nThe Helena Chemical Company (Helena) Paul Facility has submitted this updated electronic RMP in compliance with the provisions of the Clean Air Act 112 (r) as codified by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency at 40 CFR Part 68.  This electronic submittal provides conservative estimates of the offsite consequences of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia from the Paul Facility located at 550 West 75 South, Paul, ID 83347.  The electronic RMP summarizes the policies and procedures implemented by the Paul Facility to minimize the likelihood of an accident.  The electronic RMP also summarizes the actions that the Paul Facility has taken to ensure that a response to a release (even though a release is unlikely) will be implemented in a proper and timely manner.\n\nPURPOSE FOR UPDATING RMP\n\nHelena is resubmitting this RMP as a 5-Year update. Helena has updated this RMP to include two different covered processes: (1) an on-site Tank Storage and Filling process, and (2) a temporary ammonia storage process (Railcar or Commercial Truck).  Both covered processes meet the requirements of Program 2.  As part of the update, Helena updated the off-site consequence analysis for the worst case and the alternative case release scenarios for each covered process.\n\nFACILITY\n\nThe Paul Facility is a retail agricultural chemical facility.  Anhydrous ammonia is transported to the Facility via commercial truck and possibly railcar.   Anhydrous ammonia is either (1) temporarily stored in the transportation container (i.e. Railcar or Commercial Truck) until it is transferred and stored in the onsite 12,000-gallon storage.  From the storage tank, the anhydrous ammonia is transferred into 1,000-gallon nurse tanks or Water Set tanks (of varying sizes) and sold as fertilizer to the end user.  \n\nThe on-site tank storage and transfer of anhydrous ammonia to nurse tank process is performed by qualified and trained Facility personnel.  The transfer of anhydrous ammonia from t"

      "SummaryText": "he railcar to the storage tank is also performed by qualified and trained Facility personnel.  Facility personnel conduct the storage and transfer procedures in accordance with its Operating Procedures.  The transfer of anhydrous ammonia from the commercial truck is performed by the truck operator.\n\nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\n\nWorst case and alternative case offsite consequence analyses were completed for each covered process (i.e. Tank Storage & Filling, and Railcar & Commercial truck Storage).  The worst case scenario release for the Paul Facility assumes that all the contents of the largest single vessel (a storage tank or single railcar) are released.  The release was modeled as if the storage tank or railcar was punctured on the side at the ground level. The resulting release of ammonia was modeled as a ground level horizontal jet.\n\nThe alternative (or more likely to occur) scenario for the Railcar covered process assumes that a vapor valve is leaking or is not fully closed.  (The scenario actually assumes the valve is only 50% closed.)  The alternative scenario for the Tank Storage & Filling covered process is the same and assumes that a liquid transfer pipe up to 2-inches in diameter is severed during the filling process.  \n\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe Warehouse Manager implements the risk management planning process at this Helena facility.  The Warehouse Manager is assisted by other Helena staff, as directed.  The ammonia storage prevention program is implemented by Helena employees.  Helena employees inspect the markings on transportation containers (Railcar or Commercial Trucks) to ensure that the containers are operated within the U.S. DOT required inspection requirements and they inspect the Bill of Lading to ensure that the containers are not overfilled.  Helena employees also conduct inspections of railcars, commercial trucks, and its on-site storage tank for leaking valves and fittings in accordance with the accident program detailed in the R"

      "SummaryText": "isk Management Program document.  \n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nHelenaA?s Paul Facility is a non-responding facility. Helena has coordinated emergency response activities with its local emergency response agency and local fire department.  Helena has a written Contingency Plan that includes procedures to notify local emergency response agencies in event of a significant ammonia release.  Helena employees will not, under any circumstance, serve as first responders to a significant release of ammonia.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no on-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage; or off-site deaths, injuries, property damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place, in the past five (5) years because of the ammonia operations at the Paul Facility.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThe Risk Management Plan implemented by Helena Chemical Company at the Paul Facility complies with the requirements of the Clean Air Act, Section 112(r). The RMP will be updated as the Paul Facility adds, deletes, or changes processes. The Emergency Response Program has been coordinated with the Minidoka County LEPC.\n\nNOTE: Sections 4, 5, 6, and 7 of the standard RMP produced by EPAA?s RMP Submit Program are not applicable to the Paul Facility.\n"
