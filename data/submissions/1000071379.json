This commitment is demonstrated by the resources it has invested in accident prevention and training, as well as considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility.  MRE's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent release of regulated substances.  However, if a release occurs, MRE personnel may respond to contain and control the release.\n\n\n\nStationary Source Description and Regulated Substances\n\nThe plant is located about 2 miles east of Sutherland, Nebraska and operates 24 hours per day, 7 days a week manufacturing fuel grade ethanol from corn.  Denaturant (natural gasoline) is stored in an 18,500-gallon aboveground storage tank.  Denaturant contains greater than 1% of a regulated substance (butane, isopentane, and pentane) and is regulated as a Flammable Mixture.  This RMP is submitted to cover denaturant stored at MRE.\n\n\n\nOff-Site Consequence Analysis Results\n\nThe worst case scenario at the facility is release of the entire contents of the 18,500-gallon denaturant storage tank followed by ignition of the resulting vapor cloud.  The worst case vapor cloud explosion generates a 1 psig over-pressure endpoint about 0.3 mile from the tank.  There are no public or environmental receptors or population centers within this distance.  The Alternative Release Scenario (ARS) evaluated release of a flammable substance because of a hose break.  This ARS generates a dispersion distance of 0.1 mile to the lower flammabilit limit (LFFL) for a vapor cloud fire.  There are also no public or environmental receptors or population centers within this distance.\n\n\n\nAlthough MRE has numerous controls in place to prevent such a release and to manage potential consequences, no credit for administrative controls or passive or active mitigati"

MRE experienced a spill of denatured ethanol onto the ground when a railcar was overfilled due to an employee bypassing a safety shutoff procedure to prevent overfill over railcar. However the spill contained only 16 gallons of natural gasoline and 1500 gallons of ethanol and did not have any off-site impacts. Also discovered during the investigation, a corn oil railcar was being loaded instead of a denatured ethanol car. Denatured ethanol railcar hold more liquid than a corn oil railcar. As a result of the spill, a major cleanup effort was conducted to include removal of contaminated soil and underground water testing. Railcar operating procedures were reviewed, changed and affected employees were trained. Disciplinary action was taken against the employee for by passing safety shutoff procedures. MRE is in the process of designing and building a railcar containment system to catch spills in the future.     \n\n\n\nPrevention Program Information\n\nThe plant prevention program includes safety information (Safety Data Sheets, chemical inventory, and equipment and process specifications), perodic review, written operating procedures consistent with safety information, training, maintenance schedules and procedures, and compliance audits.\n\n \n\nEmergency Response Program Information\n\nMRE's Safety Compliance Manual and Spill Prevention Countermeasure and Control (SPCC) Plan incorporate emergency response requirements.  These documents are updated as necessary.  The Safety Compliance Manual includes Emergency Notification and Contingency Planning, Emergency Fire Protection & Prevention Plan, and Spill Prevention/Reaction Plan sections.  The SPCC Plan addresses spill prevention and response activities.  Employee training is required.  May 13, 2013 a join"
