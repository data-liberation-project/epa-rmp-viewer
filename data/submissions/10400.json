      "SummaryText": "The County of Los Angeles Fire Department has requested that a California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program be prepared for the Zynolyte Products Co., facility at 2320 E. Dominguez Street in Carson, CA.  The CalARP Program satisfies the requirements of the Fire Department and the Federal Risk Management Program (RMP) requirements under 40 CFR Part 68 of the Clean Air Act.  The Zynolyte Products Co. facility handles a Regulated Substance (propane) in excess of the threshold quantities under 40 CFR Part 68 and Article 2, Chapter 6.95 of the California Health and Safety Code and Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5 of the California Code of Regulations.  Based on the amount of propane handled at the facility and the facility's PSM requirements, Zynolyte Products Co. has determined that the facility is subject to the Program 3 requirements for the RMP.\n\nTo satisfy the CalARP Program requirements, Zynolyte Products Co. is submitting this RMP and CalARP Program.  Zynolyte is also submitting a RMP as required under the Federal guidelines using the RMP Submit program.  The program summarizes the processes involving the RS handled at the facility and the potential hazards associated with the handling of the RS.  The approach and technical evlauation methods used to review the RS-handling processes and mitigate the potential hazards are also presented. \n\nThis Program is based on a Process Hazards Analysis, Offsite Consequence Analysis, and Seismic Assessment that were completed to evaluate the processes involving the RS.  The Program also documents recommendations arising from the evaluations and a schedule for implementation of the recommendations.  In accordance with the RMP program guidelines, the Program contains the following elements:\n\n7 Hazard Assessment, including a worst case analysis, an alternative release analysis, and a five-year accident history;\n7 Management Program, including a document management system;\n7 Prevention Program, including process safet"

      "SummaryText": "y information, a process hazard analysis, operating procedures, training programs, maintenance programs, incident investigation programs, documentation of compliance audits, management of change procedures, pre-startup review, contractor requirements, employee participation programs, and hot work permit requirements; and\n7 Emergency Response Program, including development of a plan and program.\n\nThis RMP and CalARP Program documents all of the required information and provides a summary of Zynolyte Products Co.'s plans and programs to manage risks associated with the handling of propane at the facility.  This RMP covers the facility's existing risk management systems, including the implementation of written standard operating procedures, employee training programs, contractor requirements, and mitigation systems.  The facility has not had a reportable release or incident in the past five years.  The facility conducted a Process Hazards Analysis in July of 1998 and incorporated the recommendations from the Process Hazards Analysis into its RMP. All employees upon hire and annually undergo safety orientation, including review of the Emergency Action Plan, Injury and Illness Prevention Plan, and hazard communication program.  There is also specialty training in Process Hazards Analysis.  Zynolyte has requested training documentation from contractors.  Zynolyte Products Company is committed to maintaining a safe working environment for its employees and a safe facility for the community."
