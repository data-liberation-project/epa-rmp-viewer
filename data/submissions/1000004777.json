All process hazard analysis teams\ninclude an experienced unit operatorand unit engineer. Employees \nare also members of teams formed for compliance audits,  \nincident investigations, and pre-startup safety reviews. The \nplant emergency  response team is comprised of qualified employees\nwho receive specialized training and participate in\nemergency drills. Employees are expected to report incidents\nthat may occur, as well as any safety concerns they may\nhave.  Employee assistance is enlisted to develop training\nprograms and operating procedures and compile other critical\nprocess information. Additionally, LAR has various safety\nprograms designed to increase plant safety by encouraging\nemployee involvement.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nLAR maintains key technical documents that contain information\nessential to safe operation of the various processes. This information \nis accessible to employees to facilitate the identification and \nunderstanding of hazards posed by chemicals used or produced in the\nprocesses and includes chemical hazard, process technology, and equipment\ninformation.\n\nMaterial Safety Data Sheets (MSDSs) have been compiled for all\nchemicals used onsite, whether or not they are deemed\nhazardous.

The procedures address  aspects  of\nemergency  response, including proper first-aid and  medical\ntreatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for\npersonnel  after  an  evacuation,  notification   of   local\nemergency  response agencies, the public, and post  incident\ncleanup  and  decontamination procedures. In  addition,  the\nrefinery    has   procedures   that   address   maintenance,\ninspection,   testing,   and  use  of   emergency   response\nequipment. Employees receive training in these procedures to\nperform  specific emergency response duties.  The  emergency\nresponse  program  is  updated  based  on  modifications  to\nrefinery   processes  or  other  refinery  facilities.   The\nemergency  response program is reviewed on an annual  basis.\nAffected  personnel are informed of and/or  trained  on  any\nchanges.\n\nThe  overall emergency response program for the Los  Angeles\nRefinery is coordinated with several agencies. This includes\nlocal   emergency   response  officials,  local   government\nofficials,  and industry representatives.  The refinery  has\naround-the-clock communications capability with  appropriate\nofficials including the Fire Department and Law Enforcement.\nThis  provides  a  means  of  notifying  the  public  of  an\nincident, as well as facilitating appropriate response to an\nincident.   The  Los  Angeles  Refinery  conducts   periodic\nemergency  drills that involve the local emergen"

      "SummaryText": "cy  response\norganizations  and  provide information to  local  emergency\nresponders  regarding  hazards and  locations  of  regulated\nsubstances in the refinery. The refinery is also a member of\nthe Southern California Industrial Mutual Aid Organization.\n\nLAR,  with  full  support from Corporate,  has  completed  a\nsecurity  vulnerability  study.  Recommendations  from  this\nstudy  have been implemented.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nSafety enhancing projects underway at LAR include structural\nmember fireproofing upgrades and deluge systems upgrades.\nExtensive facility  siting  studies have also been conducted with an\nemphasis on ensuring the safety of non-essential personnel during non-routine \noperations such as start-ups and shutdowns. In addition, a more robust evaluation of \nportable building placement has been implemented to assure worker safety.\n\nSeismic reviews of the facility have been conducted to\nevaluate  the need for retrofit structural strengthening  to\nensure  safety  during  an  earthquake.  Retrofit  work  was\ncompleted per LAR's 1999/2004 studies. A new seismic review was \ncompleted in May 2009 to validate the previous study and identify  \nany new issues that may have arisen.\n\nSafety  is  a  priority at LAR. The safety program  includes\nvarious  elements aimed at continuous improvement, including\nannual  computer-based  training for all  employees,  annual\nrefresher  training  classes, safety meetings  conducted  at\nleast  monthly, employee required safety audits,  and  safety\nbulletins to alert personnel when a safety concern is noted.\n\nContinuous   improvement  is  also  an   operational   goal.\nRecommendations   from  process  hazard  analyses,   audits,\nincident   investigations   and   employee   input   provide\nopportunities to enhance the safety of the refinery."
