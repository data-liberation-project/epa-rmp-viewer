(Lang Ice) facility located at 3600 West 59th Street in Chicago, Illinois, for the reduction of accidental releases of hazardous materials. This updated, five (5) year Risk Management Plan (RMP) summarizes the management, administrative, procedural, and technological controls that work together to minimize the risk to site personnel, contractors, visitors, and the community and environment at large of hazardous chemical releases. The RMP is organized to correspond with specific U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) RMP, Program 3 of 40 CFR 68, definitions and requirements of Subpart G, including: \r\n\u00b7 Introduction;\r\n\u00b7 Lang Ice Company policies to protect health, environment, and safety;\r\n\u00b7 Facility identification and regulated substances covered processes;\r\n\u00b7 Hazard Assessment;\r\n\u00b7 Prevention Program;\r\n\u00b7 Five-Year Accident History;\r\n\u00b7 Emergency Response Plan; \r\n\u00b7 Emergency Communications;\r\n\u00b7 Spill Reporting / Environmental Release Procedures;\r\n\u00b7 Planned changes to improve safety; and\r\n\u00b7 Management Program\r\n\r\nII. Lang Ice Company Policies To Protect Health, Environment, and Safety\r\nRisk management and safety are important concerns at Lang Ice Company; this RMP formalizes and documents these activities. Lang Ice Company is committed to conducting its operations in a safe and responsible manner and to reducing risks to human health and to the environment. It is Lang Ice Company\u00bfs policy to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local rules and regulations.  This updated risk management plan is being submitted to comply with EPA 40 CFR 68 requirements to submit a risk management plan, every five (5) years.\r\n\r\nThis RMP has identified potential hazards and has taken steps to design and maintain a safe facility in order to prevent releases, and minimize the consequences of accidental releases, which could occur.

Lang Ice Company has developed an Emergency Response Plan (ERP) that contains procedures designed to maximize the safety of all employees, contractors, and visitors in the event of an emergency and also guard against environmental consequences.\r\n\r\nIII. Facility Identification\r\nThe Lang Ice Company facility is located at 3600 West 59th Street in Chicago, Illinois.  The facility is a producer, distributor, and retailer of ice for the Chicagoland area.  \r\n\r\nThe NAICS code for the facility is 312113. Ammonia refrigeration is used at the facility to make and store ice.   \r\n\r\nThe facility uses ammonia for refrigeration, and is regulated under 40 CFR Part 68, the EPA RMP Rule.  The amount of ammonia currently present in the refrigeration system is approximately 20,000 pounds.\r\n\r\nA topographic map identifying the site location is included as Appendix A. An area map is included as Appendix B. \r\n\r\nIV. Hazard Assessment \u00bf Worse Case Scenarios (WCS)\r\nAppendix C consists of the RMP*Submit Printout and contains additional information on the worst-case scenario.
