Through a series of PHAs, the entire process at the Markham Cryogenic Plant has been reviewed, and PHA action items are addressed and tracked by management.

The approach addresses the process design, process technology, process changes, operational and maintenance activities and procedures, non-routine activities and procedures, emergency preparedness plans and procedures, training programs, and other elements that affect the process. All procedures are considered in the evaluation.  \r\n\r\nThe Markham Cryogenic Plant operations employees receive 24 Hour HAZWOPER training initially, and subsequent 8 hour HAZWOPER Refresher training annually. Employees also receive OSHA training annually. Training curriculum is periodically reviewed and updated to meet any new requirements or changes to regulations. \r\n\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program Information:\r\n\r\nMarkham Cryogenic Plant maintains a written emergency response program to protect employees, contractors, public and the environment from hazards associated with accidental releases of regulated substances. The program consists of procedures for responding to releases of regulated substances, including the possibility of associated fires and/or explosions. The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including evacuation plans, accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, if a release occurs. Employees receive periodic training in these procedures to perform emergency response duties. The program is updated annually due to possible modifications made to the gas plant. These changes are administered through the Management of Change (MOC) process and our Tulsa office.  The overall emergency response program for the Markham Cryogenic Plant is coordinated with Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). This coordination includes atte"

      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\n\r\nAccidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\r\n\r\nThe Markham Cryogenic Plant is strongly committed to EMPLOYEE, PUBLIC and ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY.  This commitment is demonstrated by implementing all the elements of a Program 1 Risk Management Plan (RMP) and all the elements of OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) Program and various resources invested in accident prevention. MOCK emergency drills are conducted periodically, and specific training of our personnel is conducted in order to reduce the risk of possible hazards.  These goals are achieved with every project design, installation, operation and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement the appropriate controls to prevent any possible release of our regulated substances to the surrounding public domains, existing waterways and/or animal habitats. The Emergency Response Plan (ERP) utilized at the Markham Cryogenic Plant includes designated procedures mandated by the Williams Midstream System Integrity Plan (SIP). These specific procedures are for the notification of agencies, evacuation of public receptors and response of trained personnel to control and contain the release. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated substances:\r\n\r\nThe Markham Cryogenic Plant is located in a rural area of Matagorda County, Texas I&GN AA Co. Survey A-329.  The plant is located 1-1/2 miles northeast of Markham, Texas on County Road 403. The Markham Cryogenic Plant processes raw natural gas into pipeline quality natural gas and natural gas liquids. The raw material is received by pipeline. The processed products are delivered to pipeline.\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program:\r\n\r\nSTEPS\r\nThe Markham Cryogenic Plant is a facility that is covered by Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations (OSHA 1910). The essential provision of PSM is Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) - a careful review of what could go wrong and what safeguards must be implemented to prevent releas"
