This executive Summary includes a discussion of the various Risk Management Program elements as follows:\n\n1. Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies\n2.

Five-year accident history\n7. Emergency response program\n8. Planed changes to improve safety\n9. Summary\n\n1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nIt is General Mills? Policy to comply with all of the requirements of the EPA Accidental Release Prevention Program regulation as well as all other applicable Federal and State rules and regulation.  The Joplin Plant has developed an OSHA Process Safety Management Program (PSM) Manual that document safety and risk management policies pertaining to the prevention of accidental releases and emergency response.  In addition to the PSM Manual, the Joplin Plant had developed a Risk Management Program that includes the OSHA PSM elements, a description of the risk management system, the Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA), and the five-year accident history.\n\n2. Stationary Source Activities\n\nThe Joplin Plant is located in Jasper County, Missouri.  The facility produces frozen dough products, such as biscuits and pizza crusts.  The dough is processed, flash frozen, packaged and stored in a frozen goods warehouse prior to shipment.  Ammonia is used to provide refrigeration for flash freezing and for the frozen finished goods storage.\n\nThe plant was previously owned and operated by The Pillsbury Company and was acquired by General Mills Inc. effective 10/31/01.\n\n3. Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe ammonia for the refrigeration systems at the Joplin Plant is a regulated substance under the EPA?s Risk Management Program rule.  The ammonia systems are closed loop that reci"

The systems consist of compressors, receivers, evaporators and condensers and have maximum intended inventories of 34,000 pounds of ammonia for Engine Room # 1, 36,000 pounds of ammonia for engine Room # 2 and 42,000 pounds of ammonia for Engine Room # 3.\n\n4. Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nFor the worst case and alternative release scenarios, the EPA Model Risk Management Program and Plan for Ammonia Refrigeration (May 1996), the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) Risk Management Guidelines for Ammonia Refrigeration (1998) and the EPA Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration (November 1998) were used for guidance.  The Ammonia Guidance tables were used to derive the hazard distances for worst-case and alternative release scenarios.\n\nReleasing the contents of the recirculator in the Engine Room 3 system, which can contain up to 38,000 pounds (83.5% at ?52F) of ammonia, represents the worst-case scenario.  The resulting distance to the endpoint extends offsite, and public receptors are within the distance to the endpoint.  The alternative release scenario was chosen as a quarter-inch hole, which would be representative of a pump seal leak or a gasket rupture.  The resulting distance to the endpoint also extends offsite, and public receptors immediately adjacent to the facility are within the distance to the endpoint.\n\nDiscussion\nThe results included in this analysis indicate that the worst-case release for the ammonia process can extend offsite and reach public receptors.  However, it is important to emphasize that a worst-case release is extremely unlikely to occur because of the many safety features inherent in the design and operational systems for the plant.\n\nOn the other hand, the alternative release scenario is based on credible assumptions.

As mentioned in the Ammonia Model RMP, this scenario would be representative of a gasket leak or a pump seal leak.\n\n5. Prevention Programs\n\nFor the Joplin Plant?s ammonia systems, General Mills followed the ANSI/IIAR 2 ? 1992 Standard for Equipment Design, and Installation of Ammonia Mechanical Refrigeration Systems and implemented an RMP Program 3 Prevention Program which is the equivalent to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) program.  This is one of the most important ways for preventing ammonia releases and for minimizing the impacts of any release that does occur.  Some of the elements of the Prevention Program are summarized below.\n\n\nProcess Safety Information (PSI) ? A comprehensive set of process safety information has been compiled for the ammonia system.  The PSI includes data on the chemicals, the equipment and the technology of the process.\n\nProcess Hazards Analysis (PHA) ? Initial PHAs were conducted to satisfy the PSM requirements in 1993 and were revalidated in 1998.  There were no new recommendations.  In March of 2001 a PHA was conducted on the Engine Room # 3 system for equipment installed for the freezer expansion.  In March of 2002 a PHA was conducted on the Engine Room #1 system for the replacement of some older equipment.  Recommendations from that PHA will be completed by June of 2002.\n\nOperating Procedures ? An Operations and Maintenance Manual provides detailed written operation procedures for the ammonia system and for safe work practices.\n\nTraining ? Training is provided to each operator and maintenance person before they are certified to operate the system.\n\nMaintenance ? All of the covered ammonia equipment is included in the Joplin preventive maintenance program.  Equipment inspections, testing and preventive maintenance activities are performed following a structured schedule according to IIAR Bulletin 109.\n\nManagement"

      "SummaryText": " of Change (MOC) ? An MOC procedure has been developed and is implemented for all changes made to the ammonia system, including the safety systems.\n\nPre-Startup Review (PSR) ? PSRs are conducted whenever a change results in a change to the PSI.  Checklists are used to direct the PSR process.  The checklists are used to ensure that all essential elements of the prevention program (i.e. engineered systems and documentation) were in place prior to startup.  A PSR was conducted prior to startup of the new equipment installed into the Engine Room # 1 system in March of 2002.\n\nCompliance Audits ? Compliance audits have been conducted on the Engine Room # 1, 2, and 3 systems, the latest in April 2001.  Action items from the audits were addressed and completed by December of 2001.\n\nIncident Investigation ? General Mills routinely investigates any ammonia related incident or accident that occurs at the Joplin Plant. An Incident Investigation procedure has been developed to help the investigation team determine the root cause of incident and to help them develop measures to prevent a recurrence.\n\nEmployee Participation ? An employee participation program (for safety and risk management) is in place and training in PSM has been conducted for all affected employees.  Employee involvement in PHA studies and review of operating procedures in an important way in which employees take and retain ownership of the risk management programs.\n\nHot Work Permit Program ? A hot work permit program is being used at the Joplin Plant whenever hot work is conducted in and around the ammonia systems.\n\nContractor Safety ? Contractor Safety Procedures have been developed and are being used whenever outside contractors are on site.\n\n6. Five-Year Accident History\n\nIn the last five years there have been no releases of ammonia from the Joplin Plant that meets the RMP reporting criteria.\n\n7.

This plan includes procedures for evacuation, notifying response agencies and adjacent businesses, emergency equipment list with maintenance schedule, and procedures for responding to any release that may occur.  The plan also includes first aid procedures to toxic exposure to ammonia.  The ERP is coordinated with the Joplin Fire Department and the Joplin-Jasper County Emergency Preparedness Committee. \n\nThe Joplin facility has conducted risk management plan communication meetings with employees and has notified immediate offsite receptors.  A public communications meeting was held in 1999 in cooperation with the Joplin Fire Department and the Joplin ? Jasper County Emergency Preparedness Committee. \n\n8. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nAll recommendations form previous PHAs, MOCs and PSRs are being addressed.  However it is General Mills policy to review operating, maintenance and emergency response procedures on a routine basis to ensure they are always applicable.  The continuous review process does generate further recommendations for improved safety during the course of operations, but these measures are typically addressed in a very short time frame.\n\n9. Summary\n\nThe design, operation and maintenance of the ammonia system according to IIAR Standards and Guidelines and the implementation of the PSM and RMP programs provides a high level of assurance that the hazards and risks associated with the use of ammonia are being managed in an appropriate manner.  The likelihood of a release is minimized through the implementation of these programs.  General Mills has developed an Emergency Response Plan which is coordinated through the local response agencies and has communicated the information in this Risk Management Plan to the local community."
