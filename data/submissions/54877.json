This commitment is inherent to our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with our regulated process. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible accidental releases of regulated substances. However, if such an accidental release does occur, we are coordinated with the Portsmouth City Fire Department and the Rockingham County Local Emergency Planning Committee for emergency response support.\n\n\n- The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nPresently Anhydrous Ammonia is the only RMP regulated substance present at this facility above a threshold quantity.  Ammonia is utilized as the primary cooling media in our closed-loop refrigeration system. The system\u00bfs purpose is to provide refrigeration and cold storage capabilities for High Liner Foods processing operations.  Due to the size and characteristics of our ammonia refrigeration system, as well as Process Safety Management (PSM) applicability, High Liner Foods is covered under Program 3 of the RMP regulations.\n\n- Offsite Consequence Analysis \n\nThe Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario have been completed as stated in Section 2 and 3 of the RMP Submit text.\n\nTo evaluate both the worst case and alternative release scenarios, EPA's RMP Comp Hazardous Release software was utilized exclusively. The RMP Comp models are referenced in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance as an acceptable model for the release scenario mathematical approximation process.\n\nAs specified in the RMP Guidance, the worst case and alternate case release scenarios ha"

Public and environmental receptors that could possibly be affected by the release scenarios were determined through the use of LANDVIEW VI mapping system software and US Census Bureau 2000 data. \n\n- The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nHigh Liner Foods has taken all necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set forth in 40 CFR Part 68.  To meet these necessary requirements High Liner Foods has implemented their Process Safety Management program through the written guidelines stated in the OSHA PSM Standard, 29 CFR 1910.119. \n\n- Accident History\n\nThere have been no ammonia related incidents at the High Liner Foods facility within the last five years that have resulted in on, or off site property damage, injuries or deaths.\n\n\nTHE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nA process release would be detected by ammonia sensors located in the engine room, cold storage, and above the accumulators in the production area.  A \u00bfhorn\u00bf evacuation signal is triggered and would sound throughout the facility.  An alarm is also activated at ADT.\n\nIn the event of a process release, ADT calls the facility maintenance department, which would in turn contact the Portsmouth Fire Station if any of the following conditions are present:\n\n\u00b7Upon investigating the incident, High Liner Foods determines that the release is severe enough to require response assistance; \n\u00b7Reportable quantities of ammonia are released; and\n\u00b7A potential for fire exists (in this case, ADT directly notifies the Fire Department).\n\nThe Portsmouth Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC, or Portsmouth Fire Department) is trained and equipped to respond to ammonia releases at High Liner Foods.\n\n- Planned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\nHigh Liner Foods currently has no changes planned for the amm"
