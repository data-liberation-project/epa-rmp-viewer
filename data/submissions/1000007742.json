The Water Works Water Treatment Plant stores chlorine in quantities in excess of the 2,500 pound Risk Management Program threshold.\n\nPursuant to 40 CFR A? 68.150, the Water Works Water Treatment Plant is required to submit a single Risk Management Plan (RMP) that includes the information required by A?A? 68.155 through 68.185.  The Water Works Water Treatment Plant is also required to provide an executive summary in the RMP.  The following is a brief description of various elements of the facility's Risk Management Program, as required by 40 CFR A? 68.155:\n\n(a)    THE ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES AT THE STATIONARY SOURCE\n\nThe Detroit Water and Sewerage Department (DWSD) operate five water treatment plants in the Southeast Michigan area.  While the production of potable drinking water is vital to the welfare of the community, DWSD recognizes that the safe handling of the chlorine used in the water disinfection process is also critical to the welfare of the community.  DWSD recognizes that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency lists chlorine as a regulated toxic substance pursuant to the Accidental Release Prevention and Risk Management Program regulations.\n\nDWDS is committed to the implementation of stringent safety precautions for chlorine handling at all of its water treatment facilities.  These safety precautions are necessary to prevent accidental releases of chlorine that could threaten the health of DWSD employees, DWSD contractors, and the members of the community DWSD serves.  To this end, DWSD implements routine equipment maintenance and process improvements, operational procedures, employee training programs, and emergency response procedures, and is committed to compliance w"

      "SummaryText": "ith all applicable state and federal regulation.\n\n(b)    THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nThe Water Works Water Treatment Plant treats water from the Detroit River to produce potable drinking water.  The plant typically produces 100 to 180 million gallons per day (MGD) of treated water. The plant also pre-chlorinates raw water for use at two other water treatment plants.\n\nThe plant adds aluminum sulfate (alum) to the water to aid in the removal of particulate matter.  The alum produces a precipitate that binds to fine particles; the resulting larger particles settle out.  On an as-needed basis, the plant uses its carbon system to add activated carbon to the water.  Activated carbon can remove tastes and odors that may exist in the influent water.  The plant uses its fluoride system to add fluoride to the water.  The fluoride provides water consumers with protection against tooth decay.  The plant also adds phosphoric acid to the water to minimize the leaching of lead from water distribution piping.  The plant's alum, carbon, fluoride, and phosphoric acid systems do not contain chemicals that are designated as regulated toxic or flammable substances pursuant to the Accidental Release Prevention and Risk Management Program regulations.\n\nWater disinfection occurs at the beginning of the treatment process (pre-chlorination), and as a final treatment step (post-chlorination).  The primary method of pre-chlorination for water used at the Water Works Park Water Treatment Plant is ozonation. Chlorine can be used as an alternate method of disinfection if required. Chlorine is used for post-chlorination at the facility.\n\nThe primary components of the plant's chlorine system include a maximum of one hundred (100) 2,000 pound containers of chlorine, ten (10) evaporators, ten (10) chlorinators, and the associated chlorinated water distribution components (e.g., polyvinylchloride piping).  The facility is also equipped with a chlorine abatement system (scrubbe"

The Water Works Water Treatment Plant has more than the threshold quantity (2,500 pounds) of chlorine in its water disinfection process; therefore, the attached Risk Management Plan addresses this single covered process.\n\nThe ozone is produced on-site and the amount on-site does not exceed the threshold quantity (100 pounds). Therefore, the ozone process is not subject to the requirements of the Accidental Release Prevention and Risk Management Program regulations.\n\n(c)    THE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe Water Works Water Treatment Plant stores, handles, and uses chlorine in its water purification process.  The Water Works Water Treatment Plant has established a Process Safety Management Plan (PSM).  The information contained within this PSM Plan establishes the protocols needed to safely handle and use chlorine.  The plan is designed to prevent and minimize the effects of an unplanned, sudden or non-sudden incidents involving chlorine.  This plan is designed to meet the regulatory requirements of MIOSHA, Rule #40819102 Process Safety Management Program.\n\nSpecifically this plan protects the community using a combination of operating procedures and safe work practices, equipment design, emergency operations and shut-down procedures, building design, containment, chlorine scrubbing equipment, and employee training and education.\n\nThe requirements of the Process Safety Management Plan will be implemented as an on-going compliance policy to ensure that chlorine is safely stored, handled, and used by the Water Works Water Treatment Plant.  This plan provides direction for the current and future use and handling of chlorine, and ensures that any release of chlorine can be safely "

It was estimated that chlorine did not reach locations off the property at significant concentrations. No one offsite was injured during the incidents. One onsite worker required medical attention after the incident. The worker fully recovered from their injuries and returned to work. Training and operating procedures were reviewed and updated after the incidents to reduce the likelihood of future incidents.\n\n(e)    THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe Water Works Water Treatment Plant has a documented Chlorine Emergency Response Plan.  The Water Works Water Treatment Plant is also included in an Emergency Response Plan that was developed for all Detroit Water and Sewerage Department (DWSD) facilities.  The DWSD Emergency Reponses Plan has an appendix that specifically addresses accidental releases of chlorine.  The plans address the notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, emergency first aid and medical treatment, response strategies and incident command, and specific procedures for responding to chlorine releases.\n\nWater Works Water Treatment Plant personnel that have the potential for responding to accidental releases of chlorine have received formal emergency response training (e.g., 40-Hour HAZMAT training).  In addition, the personnel receive 8 hour HAZMAT refresher training annually.  \n\nThe Water Works Water Treatment Plant is equipped with electronic chlorine detectors.

Three operators are on site at all times to respond to an alarm.  During off shifts, a fourth person is on call. The external notification of local emergency response agencies and the public would be conducted on an as-needed basis, in accordance with the facility's Emergency Response Plan.\n\nIn the event of a release, the Water Works Water Treatment Plant is equipped with a scrubber that is capable of neutralizing the contents of one 2,000 pound container of chlorine.  \n\n(f)    PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe Water Works Water Treatment Plant completed a major renovation of its chlorine system in 2002; therefore, no major process changes are expected at the plant in the near future."
