The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the facility:\n                                                                                \nThe Linde Gas facility located in Southaven, Mississippi complies with OSHA and NFPA requirements for acetylene gas manufacturing, transfer, and storage. It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  If an emergency accidental release were to occur involving our acetylene gas manufacturing, storage, or transfer systems, it is our policy to immediately notify the Southaven Fire Department/LEPC and the Linde Gas Emergency Response Team, who will respond to the emergency.  In addition we have monthly joint management and employee safety training.\n\n2. A description of the facility and the regulated substance handled:\n\nThe Linde Gas - Southaven facility manufactures, stores, and transfers acetylene gas.  The facility generates acetylene gas in an acetylene generator mixing calcium carbide and water.  In addition the facility has chemical acetylene gas stored in cylinders on two trailers.  The trailer cylinders are filled offsite and then piped to the facility compressors and in turn to the cylinder fill manifold. Each trailer contains 5,500 pounds of acetylene gas for a possible total of 11,000 pounds, if the trailers are full and connected at the same time.  The generator system contains a maximum of 50 pounds of acetylene gas at any one time.  The generator system will be idle and disconnected from the cylinder fill system while the trailers are being used.  The facility fills individual cylinders of acetylene gas for shipment from the facility.  Filled customer cylinders stored on the dock may contain up to 1,000 pounds of acetylene gas.\n\n3. The general accident release prevention program and specific steps:\n\nThe Linde Gas - Southaven facility complies with USEPA's accident prevention rule as well as OSHA's Process Safety Management standard and all appl"

The emergency response program:\n\nIn the event of an emergency accidental release involving our covered process, it is the Linde Gas policy to immediately notify the Southaven Fire Department/LEPC and the Linde Gas Emergency Response Team.  The Emergency Response Team would respond equipped with personal protective gear including level A.  We have communicated this policy to the local Southaven Fire Department.  All members of the Linde Emergency Response Team are properly trained to respond to emergencies at the facility.\nAll employees have access to the facility emergency action plan.  Emergency response training is conducted annually.\n\n6. Planned changes to improve safety:  None"
