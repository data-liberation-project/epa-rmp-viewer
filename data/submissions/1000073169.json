This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the processes. EnLink's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release. \r\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nNatural gas is gathered from wells in the surrounding fields and sent to the MidMar East Gas Plant for processing prior to being sold for domestic consumption. This gas contains impurities in the form of carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrogen (N2) and water. These impurities must be brought into specification before residue companies will purchase this gas. The MidMar East Gas Plant inlet gas contains enough natural gas liquids that extraction is desirable.\r\n\r\nThe facility is designed for 100 MMSCFD. The plant consists of the following: inlet gas separation and filtration, inlet compression, dew point system, condensate stabilization, amine treatment unit, dehydration, RSV system, cryogenic processing unit, refrigeration system, residue compression, flare system, and all associated utilities and ancillary systems. Stabilized condensate recovered from inlet gas is stored in five 472-barrel atmospheric tanks located within secondary containment areas and loaded into tanker trucks for shipment. NGLs from the cryogenic unit and natural gas from residue compression are sent offsite via pipeline without intermediate storage. \r\n\r\nThe processes at the station are interconnected by piping and fit the EPA's definition of a stationary source in 40 CFR part 68. The facility contains one source of a regulated s"

The following is a description of existing safety features applicable to the prevention of accidental releases of the regulated substance in the facility.  \r\n\r\nSpecialized Safety Features\r\n\r\nThe MidMar East Gas Plant has safety features on many units to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release.  The following types of safety features are used in the covered process:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRelease Detection\r\n\r\n1.\tTanks/vessels are equipped with level and pressure sensors\r\n2.\tHigh/Low alarms and shutdowns\r\n3.\tHydrocarbon LEL detectors and alarms\r\n4.\tFire detectors and alarms\r\n5.\tFacility is staffed 24-hours a day, 7-days a week \r\n\r\nRelease Containment/Control\r\n\r\n1.\tBerms around tanks\r\n2.\tProcess relief valves venting vapors to the atmosphere or flare to prevent vessels from rupturing\r\n3.\tValves to permit isolation of the process (manual and automated)\r\n4.\tAutomated shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high temperature)\r\n5.\tRedundant equipment and instrumentation (e.g., uninterruptible power supply for process control system)\r\n6.\tTotal plant emergency shutdown (ESD) system \r\n\r\nRelease Mitigation\r\n\r\n1.\tTrained emergency response personnel\r\n2.\tPersonal protective equipment (e.g., chemical protective clothing)\r\n3.\tSPCC Plan\r\n4.\tFire extinguishers\r\n\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program Information\r\n\r\nThe MidMar East Gas Plant is included in the written community emergency response plan for Martin County which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment. The program consists of procedures for responding to the release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released."

      "SummaryText": "The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  In addition, the facility has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment. Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties. The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to facility processes.  The emergency response program changes are administered through the Management of Change (MOC) process, which includes informing and/or training affected personnel in the changes. Periodic drills or tabletop exercises are conducted to test the response plan.\r\n\r\nThe overall emergency response program for the MidMar East Gas Plant is coordinated with the Martin County LEPC. The Martin County LEPC can be reached at (432) 607-3557. The MidMar East Gas Plant has around-the-clock communications capability. In the event of an emergency, the operator will call the appropriate emergency response organizations (e.g., Volunteer Fire Department, Martin County Sheriff Office). This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident. EnLink conducts periodic emergency drills that involve emergency response organizations and the MidMar East Gas Plant offers training to local emergency responders regarding the hazards of regulated substances in the facility.  \r\n\r\nFive - Year Accident History\r\n\r\nAccording to EnLink personnel the MidMar East Gas Plant has had no accidents in the last five years; therefore the accident history has no bearing on the program determina"
