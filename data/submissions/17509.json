The PSM/RMP Coordinator, acting with the authority delegated directly from the Site Manager, has the responsibility for the development, implementation, and integration of the EPA RMP elements and the elements of OSHA's PSM program (where applicable) as required under Section 68.15 of the RMP rule.  \n\nThe PSM/RMP Coordinator oversees the implementation of the PSM, and the risk management program. This is done by giving responsibilities to select employees to develop and manage specific elements of our risk management and process safety management programs.  The members of this group are assigned by the Site Manager based on recommendations from the PSM/RMP Coordinator and the Environmental Engineer.  Currently, the members of the PSM/RMP group include the following: \n\nRMP members\n *  PSM/RMP Coordinator - Jesse L.
