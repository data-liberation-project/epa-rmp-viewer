The Merck Stonewall accidental release prevention policy is a unified approach, integrating technology, procedures, and management practices.  The Merck Stonewall emergency response policy involves the preparation of response plans that are tailored to each covered chemical at the facility and to the emergency response services available in the community.  \r\n\r\nb.  Merck Sharp and Dohme is a worldwide research-intensive health products company that discovers, develops, manufactures and markets human and animal health products.  Merck Sharp and Dohme Stonewall Plant, located near Elkton, Virginia, was established in 1941.  Currently, the plant employs approximately 725 people in a range of pharmaceutical manufacturing activities such as fermentation, biologics, solvent extraction, organic chemical synthesis, and finishing and packaging operations.  The facility's products include broad spectrum antibiotics, an antifungal drug, a cholesterol lowering drug, medicines for the treatment of the human papilloma virus, and Parkinson's disease.  The manufacturing of the latter product requires the use of anhydrous hydrogen chloride (aHCl) and is subject to 40 CFR Part 68.  Anhydrous hydrogen chloride is charged to process vessels from a tube trailer.  \r\n\r\nc.  The Stonewall accidental release prevention program is based on the following process safety management key elements including:\r\n     \u00bf\tAggressive and thorough Hazard Analysis (HazOp) performed on all covered processes\r\n     \u00bf\tProcess Specific and safety training for operators\r\n     \u00bf\tUse of best industry practice for the safe handling of highly toxic and hazardous materials\r\n     \u00bf\tUse of accurate and effective operating procedures\r\n     \u00bf\tImplementation of both a corporate and local audit program\r\n     \u00bf\tPreventative and predictive maintenance program\r\n     \u00bf\tFully trained and active site emergency response team\r\n     \u00bf\tContractor safety program\r\n\r\nChemical speci"

      "SummaryText": "fic prevention steps include the presence of hydrogen chloride detectors and awareness of the hazardous and toxic properties of anhydrous chloride.\r\n\r\nd.  No accidental releases of anhydrous hydrogen chloride meeting the definition of 40 CFR 68.42 have occurred at this facility in the past five years.\r\n\r\ne.  The facility has an emergency response program, including an on site emergency response team that provides Hazardous Materials response, Fire & Specialized rescue and Emergency Medical Services.  The facility has a mutual aid agreement with the Rockingham County Fire and Rescue Department, City of Harrisonburg Fire Department, Shenandoah Vol Fire Department and Shenandoah Vol Rescue Squad .  These agreements extend the service of the facility's emergency response program teams to the community in the event that additional assistance or equipment is needed.  This program includes emergency response guidelines and procedures for the covered chemical (aHCl) and a notification plan.  Emergency response drills and evaluations are conducted annually and emergency operation and response procedures are also reviewed at this time. Additionally, an emergency notification system continues to be operated and maintained by the  Harrisonburg Rockingham Emergency Communications Center (HRECC).  This system  is operated by  HRECC and allows dispatchers to highlight the area in which emergency notifications are needed and to activate the system automatically to call residents in the affected area to inform them of emergency situations.  In order to more quickly notify nearby neighbors as well as those at the facility, a shelter in place siren has been installed at the facility to provide warning of events including shelter-in-place.     \r\n\r\nf. The aforementioned emergency response program teams have monthly training programs. This training is determined using the criteria set by the Virginia Department of Fire Programs, Virginia Department of Emergency Management and all team me"

As part of the mutual aid agreement, the facility partners with Rockingham County to provide the appropriate levels of training as exemplified below.  The training for the Emergency Response team includes HazMat A and C Kit Applications training, Detailed Action Plan reviews, HazMat Offensive and Defensive Techniques Training, Size up, Strategies and Tactics Training for HazMat and Characteristics of Hazardous Materials, Information Resources and Detection and Monitoring Training.   Training for specialized rescue includes Confined Space Entry Training for Equipment and Electrical Vault Entry and Equipment inspections.  The Fire training includes fire hoses, standpipes and sprinkler training, foam operations training and fire, strategy and tactics training for structural firefighting and engine evolutions.  The Emergency Response team training also includes ropes training, search and rescue training and working in enclosed space training.  The emergency response team also receives training in  CPR/AED, Incident Command and Emergency Response Pre-incident planning."
