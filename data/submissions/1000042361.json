Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nThe ExxonMobil Torrance Refinery has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety and protecting the environment. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. The objective is to implement effective controls to prevent releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, the refinery's trained personnel will respond to control, contain, and mitigate the release.\n\n\n\nExxonMobil Corporation enhanced its safety programs in 1991 by implementing a set of structured safety management systems entitled Operations Integrity Management Systems (OIMS). In 1997, Lloyds Register Quality Assurance reviewed OIMS and evaluated it against an international standard for Environmental Management Systems (ISO 14001) to determine if OIMS is equivalent to the requirements of ISO 14001. After an extensive review, which included a number of audits of various ExxonMobil Corporation facilities, Lloyds concluded that the environmental components of the OIMS are consistent with the intent and meet the requirements of the ISO 14001 Environmental Management Standard. They went on to say, \"We further believe ExxonMobil Corporation to be among the industry leaders in the extent to which environmental management considerations have been integrated into its ongoing business processes.\"\n\n\n\n2. Description of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nThe ExxonMobil Torrance Refinery, located in Torrance, California, U.S.A., operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products (e.g. propane, butane, gasoline products, jet fuels, diesel fuels, asphalt and coke) from crude oil. The refinery contains a threshold quantity of several regulated flammable substances, a"

No employees or contractors sustained a CalOSHA Recordable injury as a result of the event. Emergency response by ExxonMobil personnel was immediate.\n\n\n\n2)    10/23/15 - A leak of primarily steam from an outlet header of Coker Heater 21F-8 was discovered. No employees or contractors sustained a CalOSHA Recordable injury as a result of the event. Emergency response by ExxonMobil personnel was immediate.\n\n\n\n4. General Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program Steps\n\n\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the ExxonMobil Torrance Refinery.

These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. Specific groups within the refinery are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.\n\n\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment consideration, is provided in safety data sheets (SDSs). This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals. For specific process areas, the refinery has identified Operating Envelopes; i.e. documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters such as temperature, level, and compositions. The refinery ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using computerized process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems, alarm systems, pressure relieving systems).\n\n\n\nThe refinery also maintains numerous documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. These documents include information such as materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\n\n\nThe ExxonMobil Torrance Refinery has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associa"

HAZOP analysis is recognized as a systematic and thorough hazard evaluation technique. These analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating experience and engineering expertise on the process to be evaluated.\n\nThe PHA team identifies and evaluates hazards on the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nThe ExxonMobil Torrance Refinery maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as;\n\n\n\n(1) Startup,\n\n(2) shutdown,\n\n(3) normal, \n\n(4)  temporary\n\n(5)  maintenance\n\n(6)  safety standards and\n\n(5) emergency operations.\n\nThese procedures are used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a consistent basis for training of new operators. The procedures are kept current and accurate by reviewing them periodically, and revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process. These procedures are annually certified as current and accurate.\n\n\n\nThe refinery has identified Operating Envelopes; i.e. documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters such as temperature, level, and compositions. This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\n\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the ExxonMobil Torrance Refine"
