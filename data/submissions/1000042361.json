The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post incident cleanup and decontamination requirements. In addition, the ExxonMobil Torrance Refinery has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment. Employees receive training in these procedures as\r\nnecessary to perform their specific emergency response duties. The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to refinery processes or other refinery facilities.\r\n\r\nThe overall emergency response program for the ExxonMobil Torrance Refinery is in conformance with NIMS, and is coordinated with the City of Torrance Fire Department, and conducts periodic emergency drills with the city fire department. The refinery has around-the-clock communications capability with officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., City of Torrance Fire Department). This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.\r\n\r\n7.

Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended, and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels). If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or else the equipment use will be reviewed to determine what actions are necessary to ensure the continued safe operation of the equipment.\r\n\r\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance. The ExxonMobil Torrance Refinery incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs. This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used and available when repairs are made.\r\n\r\nSafe Work Practices\r\n\r\nThe ExxonMobil Torrance Refinery has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.

These practices, along with related procedures and training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure operations and maintenance activities are performed safely. These practices are primarily documented in three locations: the Safety Manual, the Refinery Maintenance Procedures, and the Safety Practices Manual.\r\n\r\nManagement of Change\r\n\r\nThe ExxonMobil Torrance Refinery has a comprehensive system to manage changes to process. This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology, procedures, and other facility changes are properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented. Changes are reviewed to:\r\n\r\n(1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and\r\n(2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.\r\n\r\nAffected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures are updated to incorporate these changes.

Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years. The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to refinery management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete. The resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.\r\n\r\nIn addition, a periodic internal assessment of refinery management systems is conducted to ensure they are functioning as intended.

Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nThe ExxonMobil Torrance Refinery has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety and protecting the environment. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. The objective is to implement effective controls to prevent releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, the refinery's trained personnel will respond to control, contain, and mitigate the release.\r\n\r\nExxonMobil Corporation enhanced its safety programs in 1991 by implementing a set of structured safety management systems entitled Operations Integrity Management Systems (OIMS). In 1997, Lloyds Register Quality Assurance reviewed OIMS and evaluated it against an international standard for Environmental Management Systems (ISO 14001) to determine if OIMS is equivalent to the requirements of ISO 14001. After an extensive review, which included a number of audits of various ExxonMobil Corporation facilities, Lloyds concluded that the environmental components of the OIMS are consistent with the intent and meet the requirements of the ISO 14001 Environmental Management Standard. They went on to say, We further believe ExxonMobil Corporation to be among the industry leaders in the extent to which environmental management considerations have been integrated into its ongoing business processes.\r\n\r\n2.

These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. Specific groups within the refinery are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.\r\n\r\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment consideration, is provided in safety data sheets (SDSs). This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals. For specific process areas, the refinery has identified Operating Envelopes; i.e. documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters such as temperature, level, and compositions. The refinery ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using computerized process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems, alarm systems, pressure relieving systems).\r\n\r\nThe refinery also maintains numerous documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. These documents include information such as materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis\r\n\r\nThe ExxonMobil Torrance Refinery has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associa"
