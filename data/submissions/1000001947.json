Specific processes include: 1) manufacture, formulation and packaging of s-triazine herbicides, 2) manufacture of hydrogen cyanide, a raw material, 3) manufacture, formulation, and packaging activities for various other pesticides, herbicides and specialty chemicals, and 4) supportive activities for the above, which include effluent treatment systems, maintenance, utilities, and analytical and quality control.\nSafety in Syngenta Crop Protection's St. Gabriel Plant site is incorporated into all aspects of plant operation and is foremost in the design, maintenance and operation of every process.  The facility is guided by an operational philosophy that \"safety shall not be compromised for economy\".  Syngenta is proud to be certified as an OSHA VPP STAR facility.  We have verifiably achieved a level of safety performance far surpassing our industry counterparts.\n  \nThe following information fulfills the requirements of 40 CFR 68.155;\n\n(a) The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the stationary source;\n\nSyngenta is committed to safety.  This commitment is supported from the corporate senior management down to the plant workers.  Employees at Syngenta participate in several groups committed to safety at the plant.  These include a Unit Health and Safety Committees and the Total Safety Team.\nSome of our awards and recognitions that reflect our strong safety and environmental commitments include:  Award for Pollution Prevention Activities (LaDEQ), Environmental Leadership Program Pilot Program (DEQ/EPA), Gold Medal for Corporate Environmental Achievement (World Environmental Center), Total Quality Management Award (Malcolm Baldridge) and the National Award for Environmental Sustainability (Renew America).   A major award the facility received in 2008 is the Platinum Award for Continued Excellence (PACE) from the Manufactu"

      "SummaryText": "ring Extension Partnership of Louisiana.\nThe Syngenta St. Gabriel Plant site instills a strong site level commitment to health safety and the environment.  These are evident in several plant policies and procedures, including Plant Procedure A-1, which is the Statement of Policy.  This procedure states that \"safety is a primary concern and a core value\" and that \"it is the policy of the St. Gabriel Plant management that safety is a definite job requirement at every level of the organization\".   \n More relevant to the Risk Management Program is Plant Procedure C-8 which is entitled Process Safety Management Standard Compliance Procedure.  The purpose of this procedure is \"To establish measures (per Process safety Management standard 29 CFR 1910.11 and Risk Management Program 40 CFR 68) to ensure that accidental releases of toxic, reactive, flammable, or explosive chemicals are minimized and procedures are in place to lessen the consequence should a large release occur. \n\n(b) The stationary source and regulated substances handled;\n \nSyngenta has separated the facility into several processes.  Of these, the processes subject to RMP and the regulated substances handled by these processes are as follows:  \n MPF Unit - methylamine\n HCN/ HPF and associated Tank Farms - anhydrous ammonia; sulfur dioxide; hydrocyanic acid; chlorine; isopropylamine; ethylamine\nMMU A? Toluene 2,4-diisocyanate, Toluene 2,6-diisocyanate\nNote that in completing Section 7.0 of the RMP, the description of the prevention programs for these units, Syngenta separated the HCN/ HPF and associated Tank Farms into two sub-processes.  This was done because the Process Hazard Analysis for each of these is done independently of the others.  Also note that the information provided for each of these represents the entire unit and associated chemicals as opposed to describing only the regulated compounds. \n\n(c) The general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps; \n\nSyngenta "

These analyses are conducted on unit equipment as well as processes and procedures. \nSyngenta also has comprehensive procedures for inspection and maintenance of equipment.  The Syngenta Maintenance Department maintains a Preventive/Predictive Maintenance (PM/PDM) Manual.  This comprehensive manual documents the system used to ensure that maintenance and inspections are conducted effectively and efficiently and that closure is attained on recommendations resulting from these activities.  The PM/PDM incorporates inspection plans designed to \"enhance safety, environmental integrity, operational reliability, and protection for plant personnel and the surrounding community\".\n Syngenta also conducts extensive employee training.  Some of this training is done via a Computer Aided Training System (CATS) allowing on demand training around the clock.  The Training Records Information Management System (TRIM) electronically records this training.\n \n (d) The five-year accident history;\n\nSyngenta has had one incident since the last submission and within the last five years that qualifies as an accident reportable under the RMP Five-year Accident History.\nThe HCN Storage tank 2101-FA, located in the HCN production unit, is internally inspected every three years as part of the Syngenta preventative maintenance program.  Preparation of the tank consists of transferring all HCN from the tank to another tank, blinding all lines on the tank, and rinsing the tank to remove all residual HCN prior to vessel entry.  While conducting the blinding activity on March 28, 2007, the two employees inserting the blinds were exposed to HCN vapors.  The exposure was low and the individuals were treated by the on-site medical department and released.\n                                                                                          "

The facility is part of the community emergency response plan and has a facility emergency response plan.  Both plans include specific actions to be taken in response to accidental releases of regulated substances.\n\nIn the event of an emergency, Syngenta, in conjunction with the LEPC, has several mechanisms in place to notify the surrounding community including an automated dial-up phone system, activation of a televised public announcement and a strategically placed community siren system.  Syngenta also has on-site first aid and emergency medical responders, a hazmat team as well as emergency response equipment including a fire truck and ambulance.\n\n(f) Planned changes to improve safety.\n\nThe site has developed and is in the process of implementing a new Incident Management System which will enhance ease of reporting, completing root cause analysis, tracking associated actions, and trending and communicating data.  The same data management tool will be utilized to replace existing MOC, and HSE Audit systems.\nA new position of Technical Training Coordinator was added to the site in January of 2009 in order to enhance training systems.  The site has a mature workforce so much effort is being placed on early development of new Technicians so that the plant maintains its current skill level into the future.  Development of new employee training curriculum and systems for auditing of existing SOPA?s are two of the current 2009 projects for this position. A new electronic work permit system has been developed to make permits easier to create, implement, and track to completion.\n\nThe following supplemental information is provided as supporting information to the preparation of this "

This material has not been manufactured since 2007 and there are no plans to manufacture it in the near future.  The date of the last PHA provided in Section 7.4.a. is in regards to this chemical and was last conducted in April 2004.  Syngenta is aware that this date exceeds the 5 year update requirement and does not intend to conduct this PHA until this process is to be run again. \n\nAs recommended by EPA, Syngenta obtained the information on the potentially affected population from LandView VI.  This software is based on the 2000 census and provides two methods of determining the population within a given area. Syngenta chose to use the Block Group Uniform Density as opposed to the Block Group Centroid Method as it is felt that this method gives better estimations.  However, due to the calculation technique used in this method, it was found populations were given in areas that clearly have no residents.  For instance, when the impact area was only over industrial areas.  In these cases, Syngenta did not rely on the LandView VI population information.\n"
