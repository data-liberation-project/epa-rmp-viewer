Comprehensive safety rules exist for all employees, contractors and visitors.  The Riverdale Mill Safety Rules state that all employees must comply with all safety policies/practices established by the company.  Any violations can result in disciplinary action up to and including discharge.  The Riverdale Mill Safety Standards published by the Riverdale Mill manager cover the following:  Safety Principles, Safety Expectations, Role of Safety Leaders and Safety as a Value.  A common message in our various safety publications is our commitment that International Paper will never put production above the safety of people, that no employee, contractor or visitor will get hurt, and that everyone will learn and follow safety procedures.\r\n\r\nThe Riverdale Mill and the Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nInternational Paper owns and operates the Riverdale Mill, an integrated pulp and paper mill, located in central Alabama about 10 miles east of Selma.  The original mill was built in the mid-60's by Hammermill Paper Company.  International Paper acquired the facility in 1986.  Having undergone several major expansions over the years, the Riverdale Mill developed into a world class leader in the manufacture of pulp and paper.  Today, the mill produces virgin and recycled grades of white reprographic paper (copy paper) and offset paper rolls.  The Riverdale Mill employs about 750 people, making it Dallas County's largest employer.   \r\n\r\nThe paper making process begins with a woodyard where about 5,000 tons of tree length wood is received each day.  These trees are chipped by species (hardwood and softwood).  The chips are then cooked in a series of digesters which turn the wood chips into brown pulp.  The brown pulp undergoes some additional refining, then bleached to turn the pulp white.  The bleaching process requires the use of chlorine dioxide w"

A sheeting operation cuts the large rolls of paper into copier size sheets which are packaged into reams, boxed, palletized and sent to the warehouse for shipment by truck and rail to destinations throughout the U.S.  Supporting operations at Riverdale include a deinking plant that converts recycled paper into clean, recycled fiber used in making recycled grades of paper, a power plant operation that generates electricity and steam which derives 75 percent of its energy needs from renewable fuels (black liquor and waste wood fuel), and other chemical recovery operations.\r\n\r\nAs previously stated, a bleaching process is required to convert brown pulp into a white or bleached pulp in order to make a paper acceptable to the consumer.  At Riverdale, this is accomplished through the use of chlorine dioxide.  As part of our commitment to environmental stewardship, in the 1990's, International Paper converted the pulp bleaching process from elemental chlorine (i.e., chlorine gas, or Cl2) to the more environmentally friendly elemental chlorine free (ECF) bleach using chlorine dioxide (ClO2).  The Riverdale mill has two chlorine dioxide generators that create chlorine dioxide solution at 9.5 grams per liter (g/L) to 10.5 (g/L).  The U.S. EPA Risk Management Program regulates ClO2 when it is stored in solutions above 10 g/L (i.e. one weight percent) with a total mass of ClO2 greater that 1,000 pounds.  Even though the ClO2 generated is often below 10g/l, International Paper took a conservative approach and entered the program in good faith to ensure compliance and protection of public health and the environment.  The generated ClO2 is stored in three tanks prior to use in the bleaching process.  Because the Riverdale mill is a pulp and paper mill and the worst-case modeling predicts the potential for off-site impacts, Program 3 of the RMP"

Both analyses are included in our plan.\r\n\r\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nThis facility is subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) rule for highly hazardous chemicals designed to prevent unwanted releases of these chemicals.  An effective process safety management program requires a systematic approach to evaluating the entire chemical process.  At Riverdale, a comprehensive PSM program was developed to ensure compliance.  The Riverdale program covers 14 elements that include employee involvement, process safety information, process hazard analysis, management of change, pre-startup safety review, operating procedures, incident investigation, mechanical integrity, hot work, emergency planning and response, contractors, training, compliance audits and trade secrets.  The entire PSM program is audited every three years.  All operators and maintenance personnel in PSM process areas receive initial training on these elements and refresher training at least every three years.
