      "SummaryText": "AVANZAR INTERIOR TECHNOLOGIES, LTD. SAN ANTONIO, TEXAS\n\n1.    EXCUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nAvanzar Interior Technologies, Ltd., owns and operates a foam seat manufacturing facility located in San Antonio, Texas. This facility is a joint-venture with Adient, LLC. The San Antonio facility operates a process that uses MONDUR; 8020 ISOCYANATE, a liquid chemical that contains two toxic substances regulated under EPA's Risk Management Program (40 CFR Part 68), toluene-2,4-diisocyanate and toluene-2,6-diisocyanate referred to here as Toulene diisocyanate (unspecified isomer) [Benzene, 1,3-diisocyanatomethyl-] TDI. TDI is delivered to the plant via tank truck which fill up two 6000-gallon storage tanks located inside of the plant within a specially designed containment room. The threshold quantity for the Risk Management Plan for TDI is 10,000 lb. With a density of 10.2 lb per gallon the maximum amount of Mondur that can be stored at the plant is 123,000 lbs, which corresponds to about 98,400 lbs of TDI.\n\nSince the quantity of TDI exceeds the threshold quantity, this facility is required to implement a Risk Management Program (RMP). The San Antonio facility is subject to Program Level 1 requirements. This submission of RMP*eSubmit presents the details of the RMP compliance measures conducted by the San Antonio facility. \n\n\n\n1.1    Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nAt the San Antonio facility, certain precautions, such as implementing engineering controls, and wearing appropriate personal protective equipment, including respiratory protection if exposure limits may be exceeded, are taken when handling TDI itself or equipment that has been in contact with the chemical. In order to prevent accidental release of the chemical from various sources, numerous safety procedures have been enacted to ensure the maximum safety of the employees working with TDI and the population surrounding the plant. Employees of the plant have been trained in the proper handling of TDI an"

These procedures also summarize the actions that need to be taken in response to a chemical release.\n\n\n\n1.2    Description of the San Antonio facility and the Regulated Substance Handled\n\nThe San Antonio facility, an ISO-14001 certified facility, produces molded polyurethane foam for automotive seating applications. Foam production is a result of a specific blend of chemicals, including TDI, which are poured into specially designed molds. Once the foam is inspected for imperfections it is used to build complete seats for Avanzar's customers.\n\n\n\nThe regulated substance handled at this facility is toluene-2,4-diisocyanate and toluene-2,6-diisocyanate (TDI). The maximum amount of TDI that can be stored in the plant is 98,400 pounds.\n\n\n\n1.3    Worst Case and Alternate Release Scenarios\n\nA worst-case consequence analysis has been conducted in accordance with RMP requirements. The RMP regulation defines a worst-case release of a liquid as an instantaneous spill of a single vessel accounting for passive mitigation including physical barriers that prevent the spread of the resulting pool and enclosures which would limit the rate of evaporation. The temperature of the release is the maximum daily temperature over the past three years of the process temperature, whichever is higher. The release to the atmosphere is assumed to be at ground level and dispersion conditions are set to atmospheric stability category F (very stable) and surface (3 m) wind speed of 1.5 m/sec.\n\n\n\nGiven that the tank truck is covered under DOT regulations, it is not considered part of the RMP regulated process unless the tank is disconnected from the motive force. In this case the tank truck remains connected to the motive force and therefore, is not part of the regulated process. If it is conservatively assum"

      "SummaryText": "ed that a storage tank is filled to its 6000 gallon capacity, the worst-case release involves 61,200 lb of Mondur. This release will be entirely contained within the 20' 0\" x 21' 6\" containment room. The effective spill area is 430 sqft. The room is maintained at a temperature of about 80 F to 90F and the process temperature, which is greater than the average recorded outdoor temperature in Texas over the past three years, is used in the assessment. The containment room is ventilated by a 4 ft x 4 ft exhaust fan in the roof near the southwest corner of the room and a 4 ft x 4 ft vent in northeast corner of the room. Also an additional exhaust system will be activated in the event of a spill.  Although the roof vent is more than 22 ft above the ground, in accordance with the RMP definition of a worst-case release the release is conservatively assumed to be at ground level. Without active mitigation, which is not considered for a worst-case release, the rate of release of TDI to the atmosphere from will eventually equal the rate that it is emitted from the exposed floor area of the containment room.\n\n\n\nBecause TDI has a higher molecular weight with respect to air, worst-case dispersion was molded with ALOHA that was applied assuming a ground level release from a 4 sqft area. The ambient temperature and humidity was set to 86 F and 50%, respectively and the surface roughness was set to Open Country, indicative of the combination of industrial and rural dispersion environment. ALOHA was used to estimate the distance at which the worst-case ground level concentration would fall below the RMP toxic endpoint for TDI of 0.007 mg/liter (0.51 ppmv). The worst-case endpoint distance was estimated to be 14 yards.\n\n\n\nThe closest property boundary from the containment room vent is approximately 62 yards to the east. Given that the modeled worst-case endpoint distance is 14 yards, no off-site receptors will be affected and as such the Avanzar Interior Technologies San Antonio faci"

All chemical storage tanks are located indoors, above ground with secondary containment. Tanks critical to the process have level sensors to prevent any tank from being overfilled. Fill duration is also monitored during the transfer of TDI to the process lines and if not satisfied within a set time period, auto filling ceases and an alarm is activated. Chemical wet systems are equipped with high and low-pressure switches to shut down in the event of a line rupture. Critical valves are monitored electronically as to open/closed positioning.\n\n\n\nThe San Antonio facility has a preventative maintenance software program in place to address maintenance of all vital parts of the plant's day to day operations.  Specific environmental issues are also addressed with this computer driven program.\n\n\n\nThe San Antonio facility has established an Air Monitoring Program that monitors the airborne concentration of TDI within the production facility.\n\n\n\nProperty Conservation and Risk Management audits are conducted annually by Factory Mutual Risk Appraisers as well as Environmental audits by a 3rd party company known as Westin Solutions.\n\n\n\n1.5    Five-Year Accident History\n\nIn the past five years, there have been no accidental releases of TDI at the Avanzar Interior Technologies San Antonio facility.\n\n\n\n1.6    The Emergency Response Program\n\nThe Avanzar's facility emergency response policies have been designed to comply with all applicable state and federal regulations.

If necessary, the appropriate outside facilities, such as the other on-site businesses in the complex, will be notified. Employees are and will be trained in the safe handling and management of hazardous materials, respiratory protection, confined space entry, transportation of dangerous goods, and in the emergency response procedures to be taken in the event of an accidental release.\n\n\n\nAll spills that take place at the San Antonio facility must be documented and reported to the appropriate personnel.  The reporting allows the number and type of spills that occur to be tracked. This in turn allows measures to be implemented to prevent similar spills from occurring in the future.  Spills exceeding reportable quantity must be reported to certain regulatory agencies.\n\n\n\nIf a release of 10 gallons or more of TDI has occurred, Avanzar Interior Technologies will inform Covestro, the supplier of TDI, of the accidental release and inquires about the assistance and advice.\n\n\n\n1.7    Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe San Antonio facility is committed to continual improvement in all aspects of its operation, including safety. As such, the facility strives to take a proactive approach to ensure employee safety, health and wellness and to protect the environment.\n\n\n\nThe facility conducts routine inspections and audits to ensure safe work conditions and compliance to applicable regulations.
