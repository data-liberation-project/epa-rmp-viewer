      "SummaryText": "n processes are emulsion sizes and wet-strength resins.  The sizes prevent wetting and penetration of the pulp fibers and are used in a variety of products from writing paper to food packaging.  The wet-strength resins are used in paper tissue and towels, so that they will not come apart easily when they get wet. \n\nEpichlorohydrin is a raw material for the Kymene process and is consumed in a chemical reaction to make the wet-strength resin.  The plant receives epichlorohydrin in tank trucks and railroad tank cars and stores the material in a gallon storage tank that holds a maximum of 206,000 pounds.  The storage tank is provided with a containment dike to minimize the adverse impacts from any leaks or spills.  Spill containment capability is also provided for the area where tank trucks are unloaded.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release and Accident Prevention Program:\n\nThe Chicopee plant is subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management standard (29 CFR 1910.119) and has a complete process safety management system in place.  This includes the use of process hazards analysis to identify and address potential hazards, management of change procedures to control modifications, mechanical integrity procedures for minimizing mechanical failures, detailed operating procedures for process control, and operator training for the personnel involved in the process.\n\nFive Year Accident History:\n\nIn the past five years, the Chicopee Plant has not had any accidental releases of epichlorohydrin that have resulted in on-site injuries or damage or any off-site impacts.\n\nEmergency Response Program:\n\nThe Chicopee Plant has written emergency response plans and coordinates emergency response matters with the Chicopee Fire Department and the District Hazmat team.  The plant provides ongoing emergency response training for all plant employees.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\nIn 2003 Hercules Incorporated completed site security surveys at it?s US manufacturing facilities.
