L-lysine is just one of the many amino acids that are building blocks of proteins.  Other value added amino acids such as: Tryptophan, Threonine, Arginine, Glutamine and others are currently being produced at BioKyowa.   The production of amino acids is accomplished through a fermentation process that requires the use of many other chemicals to successfully manufacture these products.  These chemicals are stored and used in varying concentrations and amounts at BioKyowa.  From small bottles that contain chemicals used for analytical testing, to large storage tanks that contain chemicals for product formulation, purification and cleaning.    \r\n\r\nSome of these chemicals if not handled properly, or released to the environment could under certain circumstances pose a threat to both our employees and the community.   With the usage and storage of such chemicals comes a large responsibility, the responsibility of safety.  This is a responsibility that BioKyowa has always taken seriously and has been committed to since operations began.        \r\n\r\nThere are many programs and regulations that are issued by government agencies, such as the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and the Missouri Department of Natural Resources (DNR) that help industry with providing safe working conditions and protecting the environment.  BioKyowa has always, and will continue to comply and adhere to these policies for making a safe work environment for our employees and the community.  The \u00bfRisk Management\u00bf program enacted by the EPA sets forth certain criteria that must be followed when storing and handling a chemical that appears on the qualifying list. BioKyowa stores and uses one chemical,"

Ammonia is a colorless gas with a very sharp odor.  The odor is familiar to most people because ammonia is used in household cleaners and window cleaning products in low concentrations.  \r\n\r\nBioKyowa uses Anhydrous Ammonia at its full concentration, 99-100%, the ammonia is stored in 2 storage tanks in a segregated part of the plant known as a tank farm.  The maximum amount stored in the ammonia tanks is limited to 80% to allow adequate vapor space.  A concrete containment wall surrounds the storage tanks, which in the event of a tank rupture would reduce the risk of different chemicals mixing. This also limits the pool area, which reduces the square footage of surface area for vaporization.  An earthen dike, to further limit and contain an accidental spill or tank rupture also surrounds the entire tank farm.  The ammonia storage tanks and piping system were constructed using all applicable engineering standards for the construction of this type of process.  The facility was also designed to take into account the possibility of an earthquake, and was built to seismic zone 3 standards.    \r\n\r\nAnhydrous ammonia is stored in the tanks as a liquid under pressure.  As the temperature of ammonia increases, the vapor pressure will also increase, as the temperature decreases the vapor pressure is reduced.  Because of this characteristic of ammonia, the tanks and piping are fitted with pressure safety valves.  These valves are designed to relieve excessive pressure on the tanks or lines, thus reducing the chance of a rupture and an uncontrolled release.  \r\n\r\nBioKyowa has many programs, administrative measures, maintenance and engineering criteria that have been developed to reduce the risk of accidental exposure.

      "SummaryText": "ocess safety management program, which was enacted in 1995, deals specifically with chemical safety.   This program established guidelines for the safe storage and handling of certain chemicals, of which ammonia is one of, by requiring certain procedures and elements to be met.  BioKyowa has met all of the requirements of this program and continues to look for ways to improve upon chemical safety.  Our chemical storage facilities are inspected regularly to determine if there is a potential problem or repairs are needed to prevent any release.  Along with scheduled and preventative maintenance, we feel our chemical storage area is kept safe for both our employees and the public.   \r\n\r\nDespite all of the considerable effort that goes into the prevention of a chemical release, there is still a possibility of an ammonia release.  It is this possibility that is the basis for the environmental protection agencies, risk management program.  It is also a possibility that BioKyowa had already considered and planned for, by developing emergency response plans, training our employees for emergency response activities, purchasing and maintaining equipment to deal with a release, and installing systems to help with mitigation in the event of a release. \r\n\r\nIf an anhydrous ammonia release were to occur, a significant portion of it would vaporize (changing from a liquid state to a gaseous state) as it was released into the atmosphere.   A white cloud of ammonia vapor would form and be carried in the direction of the prevailing wind.  The concentration and size of the ammonia cloud would be dependent on the amount of the release, duration, wind speed, humidity and temperature.  It is impossible to calculate every possible release scenario that exists, with that in mind the environmental protection agency set criteria to use as a standard, such as wind speed and temperature.  It also established that industry should calculate at least 2 scenarios, a worse case, which would be the ru"

Both the worst case and alternative scenarios have been calculated using air dispersion modeling, and the results plotted on a geographical map to represent the potential distance of travel a release.\r\n\r\nThis modeling takes into account the wind speed, temperature, and amount of release and duration of the release to determine to what distance it would be carried.  This does not take into account any response activities that may be used, but rather an uncontrolled release.  For an alternative release scenario, a break in a branch pipeline was used.  An uncontrolled release for 30 minutes was used to calculate the alternative release distance; the direction that a release would be carried would be dependent upon wind direction.  These distances were also determined using a wind speed of 3.4 mile per hour and a temperature of 77 degrees F.  With a stronger wind speed, the ammonia cloud would disperse more rapidly thus reducing the distance to the endpoint.\r\n\r\nAlthough, with preventative measures we believe that there is only a faint chance of a release of anhydrous ammonia, it is a remote possibility.  BioKyowa maintains specialized equipment necessary to deal with this type of situation and trains employees how to respond to a release.  We maintain self-contained breathing apparatus\u00bf and total encapsulating suits that allow response personnel to enter an area of a release fully protected and stop a leak if it were to occur.   Firewater hydrants located throughout the plant and water cannons with fog nozzles located around the tank farm are maintained, to aid in the dispersion of an ammonia vapor if a release were to occur.    Employees are trained on how to use this equipment and how to respond to an incident, if one should occur.
