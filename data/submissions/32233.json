      "SummaryText": "\nThe Risk Management Plan for Safe Chlorine Handling at the Long Cane Creek Water Pollution Control Plant (WPCP) addresses all applicable procedures of 40 CFR 68.170.  As intended under the Clean Air Act, the procedures contained in the Plan were developed to minimize the risk of accidental releases of chlorine.  Hazard assessment and coordination with local emergency responders provide for enhanced safety of employees and the general public. \n\nLocated in the central portion of Troup County, the Long Cane WPCP is a wastewater treatment facility owned and operated by the City of LaGrange, Georgia.  The plant uses chlorine for the disinfection of treated effluent before discharge into the Chattahoochee River and for cleaning effluent filters.  One ton chlorine cylinders are the primary source of chlorine.  One hundred fifty pound cylinders are used for backup chlorination.  The chlorination process includes chlorinators, vacuum regulators, and auxiliary equipment.  \n\nThere have been no accidents with chlorine in the last five years that have had onsite or offsite consequences.  The facility is not covered by OSHA standards; however, there are public receptors within a distance to endpoint worst-case release.  The Long Cane WPCP is therefore subject to Program 2 requirements.\n\nThe City of LaGranges Long Cane Plant complies with all generally accepted practices for the design, construction, operation and maintenance of a wastewater treatment plant and all applicable state and federal laws.  The chlorine storage area and chlorinator room are equipped with chlorine release detectors that alarm both locally and through the plants central computer system.  Operator training, a preventative maintenance program, and safety equipment are in place to minimize the potential for accidental releases.\n\nOur employees are trained to respond to minor (incidental) chlorine releases.  Should a major release occur, it is our written policy to inform the LaGrange Fire Department through 9"
