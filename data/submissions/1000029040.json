The facility utilizes two Natural Gas Liquid (NGL) tanks to support oil and natural gas liquids.  The tanks are 18,000 and 12,000 gallon horizontal cylindrical pressure vessels.  The 18,000 gallon tank is used only as a surge tank to support offshore lines.  This CalARP focuses on the 12,000 gallon tank which contains product trucked weekly from another lease.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION POLICIES\n\nHellman Properties, located at 1 Pacific Coast Highway, Seal Beach, CA 90740, has a long standing commitment to worker and public safety. This is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the NGL tanks. Hellman Properties policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. \n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nAlthough NGL cannot be found in RMP*Comp as a regulated substance, Propane, Butane and Pentane are main components of NGL and are considered regulated substances. Hellman Properties utilizes two NGL, 18,000 and 12,000 gallons. Both tanks are horizontal cylindrical pressure vessels. The 18,000 gallon tank is a surge tank. This tank is normally empty and will only operate during an upset on the offshore lines. If they are inspecting the offshore line via an internal pipeline inspection device (pig), any remaining NGL in the pipeline would be pushed out and into this tank. This natural gas would be considered to have a large amount of methane as it would not have gone through the treating process. From this surge tank, the natural gas would be sent on via pipeline to the processing facility slowly to avoid any upsets. The max fill for the 18,000 gallon tank is about 80%. The 12,000 gallon tank is a storage tank. This tank a maximum operating volume of 9,000 gallons; the max fill is about 75%. The NGL has little"

Both tanks are protected by an atmospheric pressure relief valve. The total amount of natural gas flowing through the 18,000 gallon tank is 18,000 MCF in 30-day period (416.67 SCFM). The total amount of NGL processed from Hellman Properties is 1,029 gal per day.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nBecause there is no offsite accident history in the last 5 years, no public receptors within the worst-case circle and coordination with local responders, Hellman Properties is under Prevention Program 1 when the CalARP program was administrative control of the Orange County Fire Authority. Common industry standards, policies, and procedures are currently utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed.\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no CalARP-applicable releases of NGL at the facility in the past five (5) years.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nHellman Properties has filed a Business Emergency/Contingency Plan with the Orange County Health Care Agency.  This plan contains the facilities emergency response program.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nSeveral studies have been conducted to examine mitigation measures to improve safety at the facility. These studies include the following: Process Hazard Analysis, Seismic Assessment, and Hazard Assessment (Offsite Consequence Analysis). The planned changes to improve safety are listed as recommendations or remediation in these reports. Any outstanding recommendations from these studies will be addressed by the dates agreed to with the Orange County Health Care Agency.\n\n\n\nSUPPLEMENT TO CalARP ORIGINAL SUBMITTAL\n\nThis facility was regulated under CalARP Program Level 1 under the authority of the Orange County Fire Authority.
