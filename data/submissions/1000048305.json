      "SummaryText": "Facility Description\r\nThe Voyager Ethanol, LLC facility (d/b/a POET Biorefining-Emmetsburg) is located on the southeast side of Emmetsburg, Iowa, approximately 1 mile south of Iowa Highway 18 and on the south side of 380th Street in Palo Alto county.  POET Biorefining-Emmetsburg's main product is denatured ethanol for use as motor vehicle fuel.  The facility also produces vegetable (corn) oil and dried distillers grain.  Ethanol production\r\nat the facility was initiated in March 2005. POET Biorefining-Emmetsburg produces ethanol using the dry mill\r\nmethod. Corn meal is mixed with water and a digestive enzyme to produce starch, which is cooked and\r\nliquefied. The resulting mash is cooled and a secondary enzyme is added to convert the liquefied starch to\r\nfermentable sugars. Yeast is added to the mash to ferment the sugars to ethanol.  The fermented mash (beer) contains about 10% alcohol and is distilled, then passed through a dehydration system to produce 200-proof anhydrous ethanol. After final dehydration, the ethanol is collected in two 2,000,000-gallon storage tanks.  During product load-out a denaturant (natural gas condensate, NGC) is added to make the ethanol unfit for human consumption, per federal and state requirements. NGC is blended in-line with the ethanol and transferred to vehicles for transport off-site. The denatured ethanol motor fuel may be shipped from the facility in tank trucks or rail cars.\r\n\r\nChemicals Regulated Under EPA's Chemical Accident Prevention Program\r\nThe NGC denaturant is the only CAPP/RMP regulated chemical which exceeds the CAPP quantity thresholds\r\nfor applicability of the regulation. The CAPP/RMP regulated process consists of one NGC denaturant storage\r\ntank and the associated transfer/blending equipment and piping. The denaturant is added to the ethanol to\r\na concentration of 2% to 5%. The greatest CAPP regulated quantity of denaturant in a tank, vessel or piping\r\nsystem is the quantity in the denaturant storage tank, located i"

As recommended by U.S. EPA's RMP Information Office on June 10,  2013, Line 4.4 of the Worst Case Scenario submission is taken as QR (Eq. D-1; Risk Management Program Guidance for Off Site Consequence Analysis, EPA 550-B-99-009, March, 2009.), i.e., pounds released per minute and multiplied times ten minutes to reflect the quantity that is estimated to evaporate and participate in an un-contained vapor cloud explosion.   Similarly, line 5.4 of the Alternative Case Scenario submission is taken as QR for one minute to reflect the quantity that is estimated to evaporate and participate in an un-contained vapor cloud fire.

The company has developed an Emergency Action Plan (EAP) as per 29 CFR 1910.38(a).  In the event of a chemical \r\nemergency, POET Biorefining-Emmetsburg's Emergency Coordinator will direct internal response activities to\r\nthe extent they are within the qualifications and capabilities of company personnel, taking reasonable\r\nprecautions to prevent or minimize the extent of release or the co-mingling of materials. There is no facility\r\nemergency response team. Employees within their designated work areas will respond to small releases, if\r\nsuch response does not pose a danger to their health or safety. In the event of a larger release, it is the policy of POET Biorefining-Emmetsburg to notify the Emmetsburg Fire Department, evacuate all employees at the\r\nfacility, and provide technical an"

Computer based maintenance software (Maximo) is utilized to implement automatic scheduling and work order generation for covered process  preventative maintenance inspections and tests.  Public access to the facility from the highway is restricted by a gate. Much of the property is fenced, limiting vehicle access. The plant is fully lighted. Personnel are typically on-site 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. There is a multi-camera video surveillance system installed at the property, and a general computer based alarm system. The alarm system includes monitoring of the storage tank(s) and denaturant blending system (level control and overfill monitors). The alarm system is monitored in the control room for abnormal conditions, which trigger visual control panel alarm lights and audible alarms. The covered process  storage tanks have secondary containment and are included in the facility Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasure (SPCC) Plan.\r\n\r\nFive-Year Accident History\r\nThe facility has an excellent record with regard to minimizing recordable and reportable accidents.
