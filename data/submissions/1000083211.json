The Jeffrey Energy Center is a responding facility for releases of the RMP-listed chemicals, so the site utilizes an Emergency Response Plan.  \n\n\n\n<>The stationary source and regulated substances handled [40 CFR 68.155(b)]:\n\n- Stationary Source:\n\nCommissioned in 1978, the Evergy Jeffrey Energy Center is a 2,178 megawatt coal plant located in St. Marys, Kansas. The Jeffrey Energy Center is located northwest of the city of St. Marys, Kansas at 25905 Jeffrey Road. The property surrounding the Jeffrey Energy Center is rural.\n\n\n\n- Regulated Substances Handled & Covered Process:\n\nThe Jeffrey Energy Center maintains one substance, anhydrous ammonia, on site in amounts exceeding the Risk Management Program (RMP) threshold quantities. Anhydrous ammonia is used at the Jeffrey Energy Center as an air pollution control additive, to reduce the nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions to the atmosphere from Unit #1 with a selective catalytic reduction (SCR) device. \n\n\n\nThe ammonia storage tanks are filled by a tanker truck at a dedicated loading station. For the NOx control systems, liquid ammonia from the storage tanks is forwarded to a vaporizer skid, regulated for pressure, mixed with air, and injected into the Unit 1 flue within the ammonia injection grid. In combination with the catalyst in the selective catalytic reduction unit, nitrogen oxides are "

The required elements of the RMP prevention program are listed below:\n\n - Employee Participation\n\n - Process Safety Information\n\n - Process Hazard Analysis\n\n - Operating Procedures\n\n - Training\n\n - Contractors\n\n - Pre-startup Safety Review\n\n - Mechanical Integrity\n\n - Hot Work Permit\n\n - Management of Change\n\n - Incident Investigation\n\n - Compliance Audits\n\n\n\nIn addition, the facility meets the requirements of the RMP Emergency Planning and Response element as detailed below. These items, their specific requirements, and how the Jeffrey Energy Center complies with the requirements are addressed in the individual procedural documents.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Assessment have been performed using a 'What If/Checklist' type analysis for the Unit #1 ammonia system. This analysis utilized a brainstorming approach, in which a team of people familiar with the process asks questions about possible undesirable events. The What If analysis results in a listing of undesirable events with their consequences, safeguards, and recommendations for risk reduction. Checklists were completed to cover Facility Siting and Human Factors scenarios. Comments and recommendations are summarized in the Process Hazard Assessment section of the Risk Management Program. \n\n\n\nThe Jeffrey Energy Center has operation, maintenance and inspection procedures for the anhydrous ammonia system. There are Operation and Maintenance manuals for each major piece of equipment, and personnel receive training before being allowed to work on the systems.\n\n\n\nThe ammonia systems are visually inspected on a periodic basis.

Ammonia sensors and alarms are in place to detect an ammonia release. A fogging system is in place to mitigate the impact of an anhydrous ammonia release.\n\n\n\n<>The five-year accident history [40 CFR 68.155(d)]:\n\nThe Jeffrey Energy Center has had no ammonia releases in the past five years that which need to be reported in the five year accident history.\n\n\n\n<>The emergency response program [40 CFR 68.155(e)]:\n\nJeffrey Energy Center (JEC) will respond to ammonia-related emergencies as a responding facility at the First Responder Operations level when a full team of release response personnel, as detailed in the site Emergency Response Plan, is on duty and ready to respond. The Incident Commander in the event of an ammonia release must be trained in the Incident Command structure and be trained to the HazMat operations level. In the event of an ammonia release where personnel rescue is required, JEC Fire Brigade members will function at the First Responder Operations level by isolating or stopping the leak without exposing personnel to hazardous levels of ammonia. If no personnel are trapped in the hot zone of the ammonia release, the response will involve evacuating personnel from the path of the ammonia release and allowing the ammonia to dissipate.\n\n\n\nIf an ammonia release occurs at a time when a full team of response personnel is not on duty and there are personnel in the immediate area of the release, the Operations Supervisor will call 911 notifying the appropriate local emergency response organizations per Section 5.1. The Operations Supervisor will call out additional JEC Fire Brigade personnel. During this time, on duty response personnel can set up equipment outside of the hot zone and prepare for a response, but they cannot initiate the response until a full response team consisting of the"
