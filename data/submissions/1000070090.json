The company stores\n\nand distributes anhydrous ammonia in pressure vessels.\n\n\n\nCHS believes that the health, safety, and preservation of our environment are critical components of\n\neffective management and business success. As a company, we are committed to:\n\n-Providing a secure and health conscious work environment for employees and visitors\n\n-Conducting our business with always having value for the communities in which we operate and in\n\nthe spirit of a good neighbor\n\n-Meeting or exceeding the requirements of the environmental, health, & safety laws and regulations\n\n-Training employees on the environmental, health & safety requirements of their jobs\n\n-Working with government and other stakeholders to identify and solve problems\n\n-Anhydrous ammonia is stored in rail cars that are temporarily brought onto the property for a third\n\nparty vendor to use in a reaction process to make a liquid fertilizer blend.\n\n\n\nThe worst-case release scenario is created to show how far a plume of ammonia with a\n\nconcentration greater than 200 parts per million (PPM) would travel before being dispersed to a safe\n\nexposure level.\n\n\n\nA complete discharge of the railcar would be a very unusual event. We are also required to create\n\nan alternative or more likely release event. Although we will continue to do what we can to ensure\n\nno accidental release occurs, we have chosen a 2-inch pipe or hose rupture to meet this\n\nrequirement. Again, calculations show the extent of the plume with an ammonia concentration\n\ngreater than 200 PPM.\n\n\n\nWe have used RMP Comp to calculate the area these types of releases would impact. RMP Comp\n\nis supplied to us by the EPA. It tends to over exaggerate the plume, which in turn adds a good\n\nsafety factor into the planning process. Our written programs are continually updated and are\n\navailable for review at the ammonia storage location"

      "SummaryText": "s.\n\n\n\nIn the event of a release from a rail car that could impact the community, we advise those in the\n\naffected area to shelter in place until the plume dissipates. Shelter in place involves everyone in the\n\naffected area seeking shelter indoors, shutting the windows and turning off the air conditioning and\n\nother ventilation systems.\n\n\n\nCHS operates over 100 ammonia storage sites across the country. In the past five years we have\n\nhad very few releases from fixed storage facilities. Vandalism and theft from nurse tanks has\n\naccounted for the some of our releases.\n\n\n\nOur employees are trained in the characteristics and proper handling procedures for anhydrous\n\nammonia. They are equipped with the proper personal protective equipment for routine handling of\n\nthe product. The training also covers the basics in responding to emergencies involving ammonia\n\nreleases and is available to assist the community first responders with technical information and\n\nadvice.\n\n\n\nCHS provide training, training material and emergency response information to each fire department\n\nwith jurisdiction over our locations. We also meet with concerned citizens and other interested\n\nparties about our risk management program and anhydrous ammonia safety in general.\n\n\n\nCHS continually updates the training provided to its employees. Employees are trained in proper\n\nhandling, facility inspections, ammonia characteristics; emergency procedures and must review the\n\nemergency response plan, emergency action plan, and site security plan annually.\n\n\n\nCHS is proud of its past safety performance and its anhydrous ammonia safety program.
