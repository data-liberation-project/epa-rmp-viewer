The \nlargest process group (e.g., storage tanks or group of interconnected \ntanks) has a storage capacity of 12,000 water gallons (56,000 pounds).  \nThe total stationary storage capacity is 56,000.  The facility also \nstores numerous smaller transportable tanks(nurse tanks) that are \nactually used in the fertilizer application process.\n\nThe facility is required to complete one worst-case release scenario \nper 40 CFR 68.165(a)(2) to determine program applicability.

Release Rate - 60 lb/min \n    4.   Release Duration - 10 min\n\nThe alternative scenario chosen for this facility involves a release \nbecause of a sudden split in the hose during transfer.  While this \nscenario is still unlikely because the transfer hoses used have \nmultiple layers of rubber and a layer of braided stainless steel wire \nunderneath the outer sheath (to prevent abrasions, cuts, and splits) it \nis more likely than the worst-case as required by 40 CFR 68.28(b)(i).  \nThis scenario is also the\nmost likely to occur, since overfilling is prevented by a return vapor \nline to the tank truck making the delivery.  The transfer hose rupture \narea is assumed at 0.5 square inches.  Because personnel are always \npresent at the facility during transfer, Circle T Fertilizer personnel \nwill respond within 10 minutes.  Release rate was calculated using the \nOCAG tank release equation (Section 8.1.1).\n\nInput of the preceding data into DAGADIS+ revealed an alternative \nrelease scenario impact of 0.23 miles for the facility.
