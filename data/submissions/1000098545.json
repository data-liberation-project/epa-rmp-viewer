Braskem's programs satisfy or exceed all applicable requirements under both the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard and the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP). In order to ensure that our programs remain fully compliant, we periodically re-validate our Process Hazard Analyses (PHAs) for covered processes to ensure that process hazards remain properly identified, understood, and adequately mitigated.  We also utilize these PHA revalidations to identify opportunities for further safety enhancements as needed. Braskem also conducts periodic compliance audits to ensure maintenance of administrative policies and mitigation controls to help prevent accidents and releases. The facility manager retains primary responsibility for safe operation of the facility.  In addition, all employees participate in safety related teams, projects, audits, and other activities and are trained to adhere to established policies and procedures.
