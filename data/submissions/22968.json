      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\n\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nLucich Farms utilizes anhydrous ammonia in the refrigeration system at their \r\nJovista Cold Storage facility northeast of Delano, California.  As it is Lucich \r\nFarms' policy to comply with all applicable governmental regulations, the cold \r\nstorage facility was designed and constructed in accordance with the applicable \r\nUniform Building and Uniform Mechanical Codes at the time of construction.  \r\nConformance with these code requirements ensures that the building and \r\nrefrigeration system meet specific design and installation requirements that \r\nreduce the risk of accidental releases.  \r\n\r\nPersonnel from Lucich Farms monitor the daily operation of the refrigeration \r\nsystem at the Jovista Cold Storage facility.  All major service, maintenance, and \r\nrepairs to the ammonia refrigeration system are contracted to a qualified licensed \r\nrefrigeration contractor specializing in ammonia refrigeration.  Utilizing an \r\nexperienced qualified contractor to perform major service, maintenance, and \r\nrepairs ensures that the equipment is in excellent operating condition. \r\n\r\nWhile it is Lucich Farms' objective to be a responsible citizen of the community in \r\nall of its business activities, the limited staff at the cold storage facility precludes \r\nemergency response operations.  As such, an emergency action plan has been \r\nprepared for the Jovista Cold Storage facility and a chain of command to respond \r\nto emergencies has been established.\r\n\r\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances \r\n\r\nLucich Farms owns and operates the Jovista Cold Storage facility located at 369 \r\nRoad 176.  Delano is the closest city to the Jovista Cold Storage facility.  The \r\nrural plant was originally constructed during 1978 utilizing all new equipment at \r\nthe time of construction.  In 1985, five additional cold storage rooms were added \r\nto the Jovista Cold Storage facility.  \r\n\r\nAnhydrous a"

For purposes of the offsite consequence analyses, the RMP \r\nregulations define the toxic endpoint for anhydrous ammonia as 0.14 mg/l (200 \r\nppm).\r\n\r\nThe worst case release is defined by the U.S. EPA as the total release of the \r\ncontents of the single largest vessel or pipe within 10 minutes.  For liquefied \r\ngases stored under pressure, the entire contents of the vessel or pipe are \r\nassumed to be released as a vapor.  A total vapor release is highly unlikely.  \r\nHowever, this standardized worst case scenario was developed for emergency \r\nresponse agencies to use for planning purposes.\r\n\r\nAn alternative release scenario is a release that is more likely to occur than the \r\nworst case release scenario.  For Lucich Farms, the alternative release scenario \r\nwas selected based on the results of the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) for the \r\nammonia-based refrigeration system.  A credible release event with a high \r\ndischarge rate would potentially have the greatest offsite impact.  A leak from a \r\nvalve packing was identified in the PHA as having a medium probability of \r\noccurrence with a discharge rate high enough to cause an offsite consequence, \r\nand therefore, was chosen as the alternative release scenario.    \r\n\r\nLucich Farms has analyzed the offsite consequences of the worst case and \r\nalternative release scenarios.  For the worst case release scenario, the release \r\nof 20,447 lbs. of ammonia over a 10 minute period, the plume would travel 1.7 \r\nmiles at concentrations at or above the endpoint.  Using 1990 Census data, the \r\npopulation potentially affected within the worst case release scenario circle is 81 \r\npersons.  Due to the rural location of this facility, the population potentially \r\naffected by this worst case release may be substantially overstated by the 1990 \r\nCensus data.  There were no environmental receptors within the worst case \r\nrelease scenario circle.\r\n\r\nIn the alternative release scenario, a packing leak from an isolatio"

As such, there would be no population impacts from the alternative \r\nrelease scenario.
