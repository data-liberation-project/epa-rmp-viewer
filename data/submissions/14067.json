THERE IS AN EMERGENCY PLAN TO RELY ON  ON OUTSIDE CONTRACTORS IN THE EVENT OF A MAJOR VESSEL RUPTURE.  THERE HAS BEEN NO HISTORY OF ANY ACCIDENTS OR RELEASES AT THIS FACILTY. THERE HAS BEEN NO INJURIES  RELATED TO AMMONIA  AT THIS FACILITY.  IT IS THE MANAGENENT PLAN  TO MINIMIZE STORAGE VOLUMES AND LENGTH OF TIME STORED OF NH3 AT THIS FACILITY.  THERE IS A PREVENTATIVE MAINTAINCE PROGRAM FOR MAINTAINCE AND REGULAR INSPECTION OF EQUIPMENT, INCLUDING PIPING , VALVES AND POPOFFS , WITH DAILY INSPECTION IN SEASON,  AND OPERATOR TRAINING OF ALL EMPLOYEES .  DKCS IS IN COMPLIANCE WITH STATE  NH3 RULES AND STANDARDS  WITH AN ANNUAL REVIEW OF SAFETY INFORMATION AND OPERATIONAL PROCEEDURES. THE LAST HAZARD REVIEW AT THIS FACILITY WAS  TUESDAY, MARCH 30, 1999.  DKCS HAS AMMONIA STORED IN 2 TANKS, A 30,000 AND A 18,000  VESSEL, WHICH HAVE INDEPENDENT PLUMBING. A WORST CASE RELEASE WOULD INVOLVE 60,000 LBS 0F NH3. AT 15,000 LBS A MIN. WITH A ENDPOINT DISTANCE OF 1.2 MILES EFFECTING A POPULATION DENSITY OF 2500 PEOPLE IN FOUR MINUTES WITH A WIND SPEED OF 1.5 MILES AN HOUR. THE MAJOR HAZARD WOULD BE TOXIC  GAS RELEASE DUE TO ONE OF THE FOLLOWING OVERPRESSURIZATION, CORROSION, OVERFILLING, OR EQUIPMENT FAILURE . THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE WOULD INVOLVE 6,000 LBS OF NH3 AND EFFECT1250 PEOPLE IN A RADIUS OF .56 MILES WITH A WIND SPEED OF 3 MPH IN 2 MINUTES   IN SUMMARY THERE IS A POTENTIAL FOR A MAJOR NUMBER OF INJURIES AND POSSIBLE RESULTING DEATHS IN A WORST CASE PROBLEM AND A POTENTIAL FOR A NUMBER OF INJURIES IN A ALTERNATIVE RELEASE EVENT. EMPLOYEE AWARENESS AND MANAGEMENT IS THE KEY TO LIMITING EXPOSURE TO TOXIC FUMES.  IT IS NOTED THAT A MAJOR RELEASE OF 60,000 LBS  OF NH3 WOULD REQUIRE OUTSIDE CONTRACT HELP AND LOCAL EMERGENCY RESPONSE TO LIMIT INJURIES AND DEATHS."
