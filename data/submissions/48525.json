Thus, our emergency response plan is fully coordinated with the community emergency response plan.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nAt the West Virginia American Water Huntington Water Treatment Plant we constantly strive to improve the safety of our operations through periodic safety reviews, our incident investigation program, and a program for soliciting safety suggestions from our facility workers. We resolve all findings from our reviews of proposed changes to facilities, equipment, and operations and from analyses of process hazards.

The container storage room area can hold up to 20 one-ton containers. Three containers are connected to the same piping manifold at a time. An alternate supply arrangement consists of two additional ton containers connected to a parallel, but normally isolated, feed piping manifold. Chlorine is stored as a liquefied gas under pressure, fed as a gas to chlorine vacuum regulators, and injected as a vapor at the outlet of the chlorinators into the water stream. Currently we store the reserve containers of chlorine inside. The chlorine process is classified as a Program Level 3 process, and we implement a complete accident prevention program.\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis\n\nWe performed an off-site consequence analysis to estimate the potential for an accidental release of chlorine from our facility as a regulated toxic substance that could affect the public or the environment. The off-site consequence analysis consisted of evaluating both a worst-case scenario (WCS) and an alternative release scenario (ARS) following identification of the appropriate ARS. We do not expect a worst-case release scenario to ever occur. An ARS represents a release that might occur during the lifetime of a facility similar to our water treatment plant. ARS\u00bfs can be used to help the Cabell/Wayne (local) Emergency Planning Committee (C/WEPC) improve and prepare an effective community emergency response plan.\n\nWe have submitted release scenario analyses to EPA and have shared that information with C/WEPC and other organizations involved in emergency response activities. It is also available to local residents, schools, hospitals, and businesses. For these events, we have emergency mitigation systems that should help reduce the consequences of the events if they occur.

The paragraphs below briefly describe the scenarios we have included in our risk management plan (RMPlan), including information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures we have put in place to limit the exposure distances for each scenario.\n\n\t\tWorst-case Release Scenario for Chlorine\n\nThe worst case scenario at our water treatment facility involves a failure of a ton container holding approximately 2000 lbs of liquefied chlorine gas under pressure, resulting in a release with vaporization of the entire contents of the container. In this scenario, the chlorine is released as a vaporizing liquid outdoors of our water treatment building. Since this facility is located in a populated area, \tthe toxic cloud formed by the evaporating chlorine would reach off-site end points and nearby public receptors.\n\t\nCurrently, the Huntington Water Treatment Plant has a new State-of-the-art facility including a chlorine feed/storage area. The new facility contains a chlorine scrubber and other updated controls and computerization. \n\nNumerous administrative controls are in place to prevent a release of this type and should one occur, to provide for effective emergency response. Controls include container design, storage, operation, maintenance and inspection; container repair and emergency response equipment; and personnel training conducted in accordance with regulatory requirements, chlorine industry standards and practices, and our company\u00bfs corporate policies and procedures, which are strictly enforced at the water treatment plant.\n\n\tAlternative Release Scenario for Chlorine\n\n\tOur alternative release scenario for chlorine involves a chlorine release of \t\t\tapproximately 4000 lbs through a broken flexible connection (pigtail) between \t\teither of two connected chlorine containers and a common supply manifold in the \t\tliquid piping to our chlor"

A break in a pigtail connecting one of \t\tthe containers to the piping manifold will permit three connected containers to \t\tvent their respective contents (about 2000 lbs each) through the open ends of the \t\tsevered pigtail. Credit is taken in accordance with EPA's simplified approach for \t\tthe partial containment of chlorine vapor by the room/building enclosure, which \t\tmitigates the release. Such building confinement reduces the release rate of \t\tchlorine vapor directly to the outdoors. Since this facility is located in a populated \tarea, the toxic cloud formed by the evaporating chlorine would reach off-site end \t\tpoints and nearby public receptors.\n\n\tAs in the WCS, we have taken a very conservative approach to determining the \t\tARS endpoint distance off-site. Therefore, in determining the ARS endpoint \t\tdistance we have not taken credit for active mitigation provided by engineered \t\tsafeguards that include chlorine monitors/detectors. The chlorine leak detection \t\tsystem is calibrated to\tinitiate alarms at very low concentrations of chlorine (i.e., \t\tlower than industry recommended settings).
