      "SummaryText": "The City of Broken Arrow Risk Management Plan for the Water Treatment Plant (WTP) involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures and management practices.  All applicable procedures of the U.S Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Prevention Program/Risk Management Program are adhered to.  The City of Broken Arrow Emergency Operations Plan addresses mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery procedures for toxic chemicals and hazardous material releases.  The plan takes into account community wide coordination with other responding agencies.\n\nThe purpose of the Water Treatment Plant is to treat the flow of potable drinking water for the City of Broken Arrow.  This water serves as the primary source of potable water to the City of Broken Arrow citizenry.   The chlorination station is located on the north side of Kensoha Street in Wagoner County.  The station includes a chlorination room, which contains liquid chlorine containers, a chlorinator, and various electrical panels, and additional safety equipment.  The amount of chlorine handled is two one-ton containers.  There have been zero accidental releases of chlorine in the last five years.  The facility is manned twenty- four hours a day, seven days a week, with employees living on the property site.  An on call system is also in place.  The Fire Department is the official first responder when dealing with significant chlorine leaks.\n"
