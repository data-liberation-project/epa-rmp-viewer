      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nGLOBITECH INC.\nSHERMAN TEXAS\nJULY 2003\n\n\n\nFacility Description\n    GlobiTech Incorporated is a 120,000-square-foot semiconductor facility located in Sherman Texas.  Sherman is located 60 miles north of Dallas Texas in Grayson County.  Construction began in February 2000 and the plant was occupied in July 2001.  The facility consists of a two level administration area located between two wafer fabs.  The fabs are made up of three levels.  The first level contains the chemical delivery systems and related support equipment for the process tools.  The middle level of the wafer fab is an 8000-square-foot class 1 clean room environment containing the manufacturing process equipment. The third level houses the air handling system for the facility.  Behind the administrative area on the first level is more support equipment such as chiller, boiler, and deionized water manufacturing.  Behind the administrative area on the second level is the main frame computer room and wafer stock room.  Located outside are storage tanks for the deionization water process, Acid Waste Neutralization system, hydrogen, and nitrogen storage tanks (both cryogenic).  Also located outside are the bulk supply and distribution systems for anhydrous hydrogen chloride and trichlorosilane.  Both of these chemicals are scheduled to be located on site in quantities above threshold limits thus prompting implementation of OSHA?s PSM and EPA?s RMP.  At this writing, Fab 1 has been completely facilitated and is in production status to approximately 30% volume capability.  Fab 2 is built to the basic structure level (iron and concrete) but no clean room construction, support equipment, or air handling equipment is in place.  The product is epitaxial deposited silicon wafers.  Production began in late 4Q2001.  \n\n\nProcess Description\n    A thin (2-30 micron) single crystal layer of silicon is deposited on a silicon wafer.  The end product is an ultra pure starting substrate for use by integrated de"

      "SummaryText": "vice manufacturers called wafer fabs to build integrated circuits commonly referred to as chips.  Trichlorosilane is the source material for the \nsilicon deposition.  The deposition process takes place at elevated temperatures high enough to separate the silicon atoms from the chlorine atoms contained in trichlorosilane. The process takes place in what is known as an epi reactor.  Hydrogen chloride is used on a periodic basis to remove silicon that has deposited on equipment piece parts during the reaction. Hydrogen chloride is the major byproduct of the deposition process and the periodic cleaning.  It must be scrubbed (treated) to state mandated levels before emission into the atmosphere.   An air permit from the state regulatory body, Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ), was obtained prior to construction of the facility (permit 42019).  GlobiTech is labeled a ?minor source? in regard to emissions due to the very small amount of HCl emitted after scrubbing.   Other processes associated with the deposition are wet cleaning of the wafers and parameter measurement such as electrical resistivity and thickness. \n\n\nRegulated Substances Handled\nAnhydrous hydrogen chloride and trichlorosilane will be the regulated chemicals handled on this site.  Hydrogen chloride in quantities above threshold limits will not be present onsite until all PSM and RMP elements are completely in place.  This is anticipated to be 3Q2003.  Trichlorosilane (TCS) is not anticipated to be onsite until 4Q2003 at the earliest.  However, all program elements of PSM and RMP are being implemented in anticipation of both chemicals being present. \n\n\nWorst Case Disaster Scenario \n    Worst-case disaster scenarios for both hydrogen chloride and trichlorosilane have been performed. An independent environmental consulting firm with extensive expertise in dispersion modeling performed the analysis.  The techniques used were consistent with the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality and The U.S. "

      "SummaryText": "Environmental Protection Agency procedures. They are based on the U.S. EPA RMP Guidance for Offsite Consequence Analysis, which defines the worst-case scenario as the release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a single vessel or process line failure that results in the greatest distance to an endpoint that serious injury from short-term exposure will no longer occur.  \nHydrogen Chloride (HCl) is received in anhydrous bulk form via truck.  The HCl is contained in seven separate pressurize tubes with each tube containing 3000lbs.  The IDLH (Immediately Dangerous to Life and Health) value for HCl is 50ppm and was used as the value to calculate the endpoint for the rupture of one of the tubes.  Other parameters utilized in the worst-case scenario analysis are in the following table.\n\nParameter    Value\nRelease duration (min)    10\nStability class    F\nWind speed (m/s)    1.5\nAnemometer height (m)    10\nAmbient temp (oF)    109\nRelative humidity (%)    65\nSurface roughness (m)    0.3\nReceptor height (m)    0\n  \nThe distance to the endpoint in this scenario is 1,573 meters, which has off site impact and is indicated on the supplied map.   Using the EPA?s ?level of concern? (LOC) value of 0.03 mg/liter for HCl which equates to 20ppm the end point for the release would be between 3,900 and 5,500 meters.  \nAn alternative toxic scenario for HCl was performed using the 500 lb ?Y? cylinder.  The ?Y? cylinder is used as the HCl source during change out of the tube trailer.  Besides the amount of HCl released, the other input parameters changed were stability class from F to D and wind speed from 1.5 to 3 m/s.  The distance to endpoint for this scenario is 485 meters, which also has off site impact.  (see map) \nTrichlorosilane (TCS) is also received in bulk form via truck.  The TCS is in liquid form and is contained in a 3800gallon (43,000lbs) ISO container.   A worst-case flammable release scenario of the full amount using an overpressure of 1psi to determine the endpoint distance was p"

The model predicted a vapor cloud explosion of 1psi overpressure reaches a distance of 196 meters, which is within the confines of the GlobiTech Facility.  The alternative flammable release scenario using a pool fire instead of a vapor cloud explosion was preformed and also  predicts the release to be within the confines of the facility. \n\n\nAccident Prevention Program\n    An Environmental Health and Safety specification titled Accident Prevention has been written and communicated to all employees.  It addresses the following issues; creation of a Safety Committee and its responsibilities, accident investigation procedures, outlines authority, training, inspections, and audits. Other written specifications include; Lock out/Tag out, Haz Com, Confined Space, Contractor Safety, Emergency Eyewash and Showers, Emergency Egress, Chemical Safety and Storage, Hot Work Permit, Toxic Gas Monitoring, Chemical Spill and Release Response Procedures, Hazardous Waste Management, Blood Borne Pathogens, Reporting and Recording Injuries and Illnesses, Slug Control, Hazardous Work Permit, and all fourteen elements outlined in OSHA? PSM.  Both TCS and HCl bulk delivery systems are equipped with detection sensors connected to a site wide Toxic Gas Monitoring (TGM) system with shutdown capabilities in the event of a leak. In addition to the TGM, restrictive flow orifices and excess flow detection, low-low and high-high detection systems are in place with shutdown capabilities. The TCS bulk delivery area is further equipped with an AFFF foam suppression system and 110% secondary containment.  Any loss of exhaust detected at any gas cabinet or the process tool (reactor) shutdown of the source gas will occur.

Mandatory annual training for the team is ongoing.  An Environmental Health and Safety specification titled Emergency Response and Planning, has been written and addresses such issues as; creation of an Emergency Response Team and the organizational structure, team membership criteria and responsibility, action guideline in the event of an incident, control of the hazard area, medical action plan, fire extinguisher training, decontamination plan, and SCBA respirator plan.   \n \n\nFive Year Accident History\nGlobiTech is a new company with a start up date of July 2001.  Therefore the accident history is 2 years and not 5 years as requested.  GlobiTech has had no accidental releases of any regulated or non-regulated chemicals in its history.  \n\n\n\n\n\nSummary\n    The partnership of GlobiTech and Air Products and Chemicals consists of significant knowledge and experience from both companies.  A checks and balance system between the two companies insures the safest approach to chemical handling and processing is followed, maintained, and reviewed on an ongoing basis.  The purity levels needed for an epitaxial deposition process demand the absolute highest quality materials, workmanship, and procedures.  This fact was known long before the initial design and was followed all the way through to commissioning the facility.
