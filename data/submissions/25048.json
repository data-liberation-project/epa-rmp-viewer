The facility complies with 29 CFR 1910.110 requirements for storage and handling of liquefied petroleum gases, and we strive to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local laws, regulations and codes.  This Risk Management Plan has been prepared and implemented to meet the accidental release prevention and emergency response requirements of 40 CFR 68 (Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions) and 29 CFR 1910.119 (Process Safety Management).  \n\n    If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the Sigel Volunteer Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.  Facility personnel are trained to identify problems, resolve minor issues, and as necessary, notify emergency responders, shutdown the facility, and evacuate.     \n\n\n\n2) Stationary Source:\n\n  \n\n      The Heath Compressor Station is located along the Clarion River in a remote, sparsely populated area of northwestern Pennsylvania. The purpose of the facility is to withdraw field gas from a nearby production well gathering system, remove hydrocarbon liquid and moisture from the gas, raise the pressure of the gas, and deliver it into a natural gas transmission piping system.  The facility was upgraded in 2001, and the system was restarted on August 13, 2001.\n\n      Two interrelated, but distinct, processes carry out the operation. The process that is covered by this Risk Management Program (RMP) is a secondary function at the facility. This is a process for extraction and storage of hydrocarbon liquid (liquid product) which is stripped from natural gas, and stored under pressure in on"

The other process, which is the primary process at this facility, is a natural gas compression process, which is covered by Department of Transportation regulations. In this other process natural gas is withdrawn from gathering system wells, compressed and delivered to a high-pressure transmission system.\n\n    Prior to delivery to the transmission system the natural gas is passed through extraction system vessels.  Water is removed and absorbed by ethylene glycol that is sprayed into, and later removed from, the gas stream.  In the extraction process the gas is refrigerated by the Joule-Thompson effect which leads to condensing the heavier hydrocarbons to product.  The hydrocarbon liquid product is used in heat exchangers to partially cool the incoming gas, and then is piped to the storage tanks.\n\n    The storage system consists of piping and three tanks including two that have a capacity of 30,000 gallons each and a third with an 8,000-gallon capacity.  A high level shut off limits the tank maximum permitted filling volume to 86% for a process total of approximately 58,000 gallons of liquid hydrocarbon product.    \n\n3) Regulated Substances:\n\n  \n\n    The liquid product is a flammable liquid, and consists of an approximate a mixture of:\n\n  \n\ni. Propane -      37.7% by weight\n\nii. Butane -       23.3%\n\niii. Iso-Butane -   13.3%\n\niv. Iso-Pentane -   9.3%\n\nv. Pentane -       7.4%\n\nvi. Ethane -        4.7%\n\nvii. Methane -       0.003%\n\n\n\nThis represents the design composition of the liquid product, but the exact composition varies depending on the gas mixture extracted from the production field. This product is stored at approximately 175 pounds per square inch pressure in the liquid product storage tanks.\n\n    \n\n4) Worst Case Release Scenario:\n\n  \n\nThe worst-case release scenario, as defined by the EPA, was developed based on a release of the greatest quantity of liquid that the largest storage tank is"

The EPA software package, RMP*Comp Ver. 1.07, was used to estimate the distance to 1 psi overpressure. \n\nIn this scenario there is a release of 25,800 gallons (120,118 pounds) of liquid product, total evaporation, and explosion of the vapor cloud with an effective radius of 0.4 miles for 1 psi over pressure. The scenario is estimated to affect an offsite population of 25, a campground, and National Forest lands.\n\n\n\n5) Alternative Release Scenario:\n\n\n\nThis alternate scenario is a release of a quantity of the regulated substance from a vessel or process line failure, which is more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario. This release is assumed to result in a vapor cloud containing the total quantity of the substance between the Upper and Lower flammability limits, which explodes and impacts offsite receptors. The EPA software package, RMP*Comp Ver. 1.07, was used to estimate the distance to 1 psi overpressure\n\nThe alternative scenario was based on a release from a broken liquid product transfer pipe.  It is a 3\" diameter, approximately 300' long pipe that can hold about 480 pounds of the liquid product.  The vaporization and explosion of this material results in a 1-psi overpressure at a radius of 0.06 miles.  This scenario is estimated to affect a nearby campground, and National Forest lands.\n\n\n\n6) General and Chemical -Specific Accidental Release Prevention Program:\n\n    \n\nAll personnel are trained in proper operation procedures of all equipment.  Training and testing are conducted on-the-job. Any individual who works in this process must have extensive mechanical abilities, and is thoroughly tested and evaluated in the processing operations as part of the accident release prevention program.  Valves and other equipment are maintained, tested and replaced in-kind if necessary.  Maintenance is performed on all compressors and systems based on written manufacturers'"

The operational systems have general monitoring, maintenance and inspection performed to ensure optimum performance.\n\n    This facility normally runs continuously while operations personnel are present 8 hours per day Monday through Friday.  Additional inspection visits are conducted on Saturdays and Sundays.  Automatic dial-out alarms are installed to notify operators in the event there is a malfunction which shuts down the system when operators are not present.  Sensors continually monitor numerous operating parameters and will activate controls to stop the gas compressors if readings are not acceptable.  Personnel monitor system operating parameters and equipment several times during each shift.  Detailed visual inspection of the storage process for equipment leaks or other possible failure is conducted on both a daily and monthly basis.\n\nThe storage tanks are equipped with level indicators, a high level shutdown, and pressure relief valves.  The liquid product storage tanks, which have a maximum water capacity of 68,000 gallons can be only be filled to a maximum intended inventory of 57,672 gallons.  The design production rate is 933 pounds of product per hour.  Weekly shipments of approximately 30,000 gallons of liquid product via tank truck (Elkhorn Field Services) are expected when the facility is in full operation.  The tank truck driver follows specific written loading/unloading procedures to prevent releases.  A site employee monitors the truck driver as he conducts all product transfers.\n\n    The site layout and protective fencing minimize the potential for motor vehicles to accidentally impact the liquid product storage tanks or extraction process vessels. All personnel entering the facility first must check in with the site operations personnel.   \n\n    \n\n7) Five Year Accident History:\n\n  \n\nTo date this facility has had no releases of liquid product, or other related incidents, which caused off-site injuries, public evacuations, or a"

The plan includes procedures, requirements and recommendations for the control of emergency occurrences including, but not limited to natural gas leaks, fires, accidents or injuries.  This Emergency Response Plan is intended to establish a controlled and orderly means of response and control of emergencies in order to avoid unnecessary panic, injury, or death.
