The\r\nanhydrous ammonia (ammonia) refrigeration system is\r\nused to control the temperature for cheese and curd\r\nprocessing and packaging.  The entire system contains\r\napproximately 35,000 pounds of ammonia in various\r\nphysical states (gas, liquid, and saturated vapor).\r\nThe largest vessel is the high pressure receiver that\r\noperates at 130-185 psig and can contain as much as\r\n23,000 pounds of liquid ammonia, assuming a 90 percent\r\nfill volume.  However, during typical operation, the\r\nvessel holds only 10,400 pounds.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.0     POTENTIAL RELEASE SCENARIOS\r\n\r\nAs required by the RMP rule requirements, two\r\nspecifically defined release scenarios (a worst-case\r\nrelease and an alternative-case release) were analyzed\r\nto determine the maximum distance to an endpoint where\r\nthe ammonia concentration is 200 parts per million in\r\nair, or 0.02 percent.  The release scenarios analyzed\r\nare based upon the guidance contained in the USEPA's\r\nModel Risk Management Program and Plan for Ammonia\r\nRefrigeration (the Model Plan), dated May 2000.\r\n\r\n2.1     Worst-case Release\r\n\r\nThe worst-case release is considered to be defined by\r\nthe catastrophic rupture and complete loss of the\r\ncontents of the largest vessel and associated piping\r\n(approximately 23,000 pounds of ammonia) over a 10-\r\nminute period.

Within the worst-case\r\nrelease, there are apartments and houses with a total\r\npopulation of 10,512, schools, a hospital, a park, and\r\na commercial/ industrial area. There are no\r\nenvironmental receptors within this worst-case release.\r\n\r\nAlthough the worst-case consequence analysis is\r\nrequired by the RMP, it should be considered a highly\r\nunlikely event.  Design, construction, and operation of\r\nthe high pressure receiver is such that catastrophic\r\nfailure is extremely remote.  The receiver was designed\r\nand constructed in strict accordance with the American\r\nSociety of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Boiler and\r\nPressure Vessel Code (Section VIII), and was certified\r\nand stamped by the National Board of Pressure Vessel\r\nInspectors (National Board).  Third party and state\r\nmandated inspections of the vessel's condition occurred\r\nprior to start up by Refrigeration Valve and Specialty\r\nCompany.\r\n\r\nThe vessel is operated well below the design pressure\r\n(i.e., maximum allowable working pressure) and because\r\nof the safety factors built into the ASME Code, a\r\nfourfold pressure excursion would have to occur before\r\ncatastrophic vessel failure.  If this were to occur,\r\nthe vessel is equipped with dual safety relief valves\r\n(SRVs) set to relieve internal pressure at 250 psig.  A\r\nhigh pressure excursion would not occur as long as the\r\nSRVs continued to function.  Actuation of the SRVs\r\nwould result in an ammonia release similar to that\r\ndescribed in Section 2.2 for the alternative release\r\nscenario.  The SRVs are replaced every five years, in\r\naccordance with the International Institute of Ammonia\r\nRefrigeration (IIAR) guidance contained in IIAR\r\nBulletin Number 109, Minimum Safety Criteria for a\r\nSafety Ammonia Refrigeration System, to ensure that\r\nthey will function properly when required.\r\n\r\nThe worst-case release scenario is unlikely for the\r\nfollow"
