We have 3 storage tanks and when they are at max capacity they hold a total of 265200# of propane. Very rarely are the tanks at max capacity as we move the product daily.\n\n\n\nSafety is very important at Welch Inc. We have biannual inspections to help us regulate new laws and safety procedures we need to implicate. All new employees that will handle propane go to all required schooling and refresher courses.\n\n\n\nWelch's has an emergency action plan in place and has worked with local fire dept and Sheriff's office on what steps we need to take in case of an emergency. We have also gone over the plan with all employees and have designated a \"safe zone\" to meet at.\n\n\n\nWe send all employees that deal with propane to refresher classes every summer. \n\n"
