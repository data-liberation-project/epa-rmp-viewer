The Stanley Booster Station is an RMP Program I facility.  This station qualifies as Program because there has not been an accidental release in the past 5 years, the distance of the endpoint in the worst-case scenario does not reach a public receptor as defined in the RMP regulations, and emergency response activities have been coordinated with the local LEPC.   \r\n \r\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the stationary source [40 CFR 68.155(a)]:\r\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response policies are addressed in the individual   RMP / PSM procedures which detail the RMP / PSM program requirements as well as how MPLX will comply with the applicable requirements. The site is not a responding facility for releases of the RMP listed chemicals, so the site utilizes an Emergency Action Plan.  \r\nThe stationary source and regulated substances handled [40 CFR 68.155(b)]:\r\n\r\nLocation:\r\nThe Stanley Booster Station is located approximately four miles south-southeast of Stanley, North Dakota at the intersection of County Road 22 and 80th Avenue in Mountrail County (Section 14, Township 144N, Range 91W), which is classified as in attainment or unclassifiable for the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS).\r\n\r\nProcess Description:\r\nThe Stanley Booster Station is located downstream of the Robinson Lake Gas Plant. Gas from the outlet of the Robinson Lake Gas Plant is routed to the inlet of the Stanley Booster Station for further processing, where the pressure is boosted from 700 pounds per square inch, gauge (psig) to 2,000 psig before transferring the gas to various sales outlets. The Stanley Booster Station includes four natural gas-fired compressor engines, a line heater, inlet and utility gas scrubber"
