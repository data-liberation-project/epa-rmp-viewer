Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Polices:\r\n\r\nWe at Sysco Detroit are committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as the design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement the appropriate control measures to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeable, if such a release does occur, our highly trained employees are on hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  We are also completely coordinated with the Canton Township Public Safety Department, who provides our emergency response services.\r\n\r\n2.  The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled:\r\n\r\nWe have one regulated substance present at our facility.  This substance is Ammonia (anhydrous).  The maximum inventory of Ammonia (anhydrous) that is expected to be present in this facility, based on process and operational requirements, is 22,803 pounds (23,000 lbs. rounded to 2 significant digits for EPA RMP reporting purposes).\r\n\r\n3.  The General Accidental Release Prevention Program And The Chemical Specific Prevention Steps:\r\n\r\nOur facility has taken the following steps as required by 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA.  Our Ammonia (anhydrous) process is subject to the OSHA PSM Standard 29 CFR 1910.119.  Our facility is also subject to the EPA EPCRA Section 302 reporting requirements.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our facility.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis:\r\n\r\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our process are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is the What-if/Checklist.  The studies are undertaken by a team of q"

Any findings related to the hazard analyses are addressed in a timely manner.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures:\r\n\r\nSysco Detroit maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial start-up, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and start-up after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the process.\r\n\r\nTraining:\r\n\r\nSysco Detroit has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  New employees receive basic classroom training in process operations, followed by on-the-job supervision until they are deemed competent to work independently.  Refresher training is provided at least annually and more frequently as needed.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity:\r\n\r\nSysco Detroit carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operation.  Process equipment examined by these checks include pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Qualified personnel carry out maintenance operations with special training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are given specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a timely manner.\r\n\r\nManagement of Change:\r\n\r\nWritten procedures are in place at Sysco Detroit to manage change in process chemicals, technology, equipment and processes.  Process operators, maintenance personnel, or any other employees whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process operations, are promptly made aware of, and given, training to deal with the m"

These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe start-up prior to placing equipment into operation.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits:\r\n\r\nSysco Detroit conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP Rule are being implemented.  These audits are carried out at least every three years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and timely manner.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation:\r\n\r\nSysco Detroit promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably have resulted in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading up to the incident, as well as any corrective actions to prevent the incident from recurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation:\r\n\r\nSysco Detroit believes that process safety management and accident prevention require a team effort.  Company employees are strongly urged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP regulation; including information resulting from the Process Hazard Analyses, in particular.\r\n\r\nContractors:\r\n\r\nOn occasion, Sysco Detroit hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.
