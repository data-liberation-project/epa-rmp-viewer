We produce the pesticide, Metam Sodium under the \ntrade name of Sectagon 42.  The raw materials used in the process are \nwater, Monomethylamine,Carbon Disulfide, and Sodium Hydroxide. The water \nis pumped from the ground, treated to make it suitable for the process, \nand added as needed.  The Carbon Disulfide and Monomethylamine arrive at \nthe site by rail car, while the Sodium Hydroxide may arrive by either \nrail car to tanker truck.  The finished product is shipped from the plant\n by either tanker truck or railcar.\n\n     The plant is divided into three separate areas.  To the east is \nthe receiving and storage area for the raw materials.  Here the material \nis received in rail cars, or tanker trucks carrying the Sodium Hydroxide.   \nThe cars are spotted at the appropriate tower for the unloading.  We use\ntwo towers, one for Carbon disulfide, and one for the amine and Sodium \nHydroxide. This separation of unloading towers allow us to fit each tower \nwith fittings and equipment specific to each type of chemical.  This \nprevents any possible mixing of chemicals in the storage tanks.\n\n     Upon arrival, the tank cars are spotted at the proper tower for \nunloading.   Grounding straps are attached and checked to prevent any \nsparking from static electricity while unloading is occurring.   The \nsystem is also configured such that the transfer pumps will not start \nunless the grounding is complete.  The fittings are attached to the cars, \nand tested for tightness.  All tools used in the opening and closing are \nspark-less, thus again preventing accidental ignition of any flammable \nvapors.  The system is pressure checked with an inert gas, nitrogen, and \nthe cars pressurized with the same gas.  This again prevents any \naccidental ignition.\n\n     The cars are unload"

We have the \ncapability of storing over 328,000 gallons of Carbon Disulfide at any one \ntime.  Similarly,  we have the capacity for 65,000 gallons of the amine, \nbut there is rarely this much on hand at any one time.\n  \n      There is never any cross mixing of storage chemicals.  All tanks \nare grounded, held under an inert gas atmosphere, and monitored.  The \nthickness of the metal is checked on an annual basis with a non-\ndestructive technique to verify that the chemicals are not corroding \nthe walls, leading to a hazardous situation.  All tanks are equipped with \npressure relief devices and rupture disks set to release before a \npressure increase would rupture the tank.  These devices are checked \non a routine basis.\n\n     A computer modeling program was used to assess the possible damage \nto the area and the environment from an accidental release of the stored \nchemicals.  There were two scenarios ran for both Carbon Disulfide and \nMonomethylamine: A 'worst case' scenario, and a secondary, more realistic \none.  \n\n     The \"Worst Case\" scenario for Carbon Disulfide was the total failure\nof a storage tank, releasing the entire amount of 54,000 gallons into \nthe containment berm.   For this scenario, it was assumed that the entire \nspill occurred within ten minutes, the air temperature was the highest \nrecorded in the area for the last five years (100 F), and the wind was \nblowing at 3 yards per second.  Under this scenario, the area of concern \nstretched for 11 miles.  This would include the entire town of Burley, \nprovided the wind direction was correct.   \n\n     A secondary scenario was ran using the same atmospheric conditions, \nonly using the actual conditions that would occur under our control and \nresponse plans.  Under this scenario, the area of concern was only 0.6 \nmiles. Another scenario was ran, using the conditions of a small leak \nfrom a broken"

The main \ndifference between the two was that the Carbon Disulfide is considered \na toxic liquid, while the amine is considered to yield an explosive \ncloud that ignites.  Under the \"Worst Case\" scenario, the release of an \nentire tank of 32,000 gallons, with the resultant explosion, the area \nof influence of the explosion, or the area of damage was 0.2 miles.   \nSimilarly, the scenario of a leaking pipe, with the resultant \nfire ball gave an area of damage of 0.1 miles.\n\n     To mitigate these types of damages, the storage areas are equipped \nwith a number of safety devices to monitor and prevent any release of \nthe chemical.  The storage tanks are enclosed in concrete berms that \nwould contain any spill from the tank in a small area, thus limiting \nthe surface area of the liquid, and thus slowing down the amount \nreleased.  In addition, both storage areas have the capability of being \nshowered with copious amounts of water to knock down, and contain \nvapors that may be released.  \n\n     The storage area for the Carbon Disulfide has one additional \nsafety feature.   Since the chemical is heavier then water, the \ncontainment berm has had installed a deluge system and monitoring \ndetectors.  If the detectors sense the chemical above a set amount, \nwell below any danger level, but signaling a possible leak, they set off \nan alarm in the central computer system. This alarm opens the deluge \nsystem flooding the containment area to a depth of over ten inches\nof water in less then ten minutes.  The Carbon Disulfide will be \nsubmerged by the water, limiting the amount of vapors that are \nreleased from the site.   \n\n     The raw materials are brought into the central processing area under \nredundant computer control and inert gas blanket where they are combined \nto produce the product.

All operators at the site are \ngiven extensive training in response to both chemical spills and safety \nhazards. All operators are trained to a Hazmat Technician level by \nschooling certified by the State of Idaho Bureau of Emergency Response.  \nIn addition, all are trained in CPR and First Aid.

These programs include, regularly scheduled \nsafety meetings, tail-gate safety meetings, Hazard Communication, Safety \nSuggestion Forms, \"near-miss\" reporting, and special training programs \n(emergency response training, first aid, etc.). \n\nThe Burley Facility actively seeks employee involvement in the \ndevelopment and conduct of all accident prevention activities through \nthe appropriate existing safety programs.  Accident prevention is \ndiscussed at the regularly scheduled safety meetings and/or during \nspecial training sessions if necessary.  Employees are encouraged \nto discuss accident prevention with their supervisors if they have \nquestions, comments, or suggestions.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nComplete and accurate written process safety information (PSI) \nconcerning process chemicals, process technology, and process equipment \nis essential to effective PSM and RMP programs and to completing and \nmaintaining a process hazard analysis (PHA).  The PSI will be useful to \nthe operators; the team performing the PHA; those in charge of training; \ncontractors; those conducting pre-startup safety reviews; and those in \ncharge of updating the emergency preparedness plans.

Eye exposure may cause degeneration of the retina and optic nerve. Pupils may\n  be dilated.\n \n  Emergency Life-Support Procedures: Acute exposure to carbon disulfide may require\n  decontamination and life support for the victims. Emergency personnel should wear protective\n  clothing appropriate to the type and degree of contamination. Air-purifying or supplied air\n  respiratory equipment should also be worn, as necessary. Rescue vehicles should carry supplies\n  such as plastic sheeting and disposable plastic "
