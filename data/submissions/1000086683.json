Executive Summary\n\n\n\nThis program is intended to meet the spirit and intent of the following regulations:\n\n- California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program - Title 19 CCR, Chapter 4.5\n\n- Federal EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) - Title 40 CFR ?68\n\n- California Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 8 CCR ?5189\n\n- Federal Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 29 CFR ?1910.119\n\n\n\nHereafter this program will be referred to as the RMP-PSM program.\n\n\n\nThis program is intended to be a \"living document\". As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible and updated as necessary. To accomplish this, J. Milicic & Son has elected to use PSMWriter, software developed and distributed by Resource Compliance, Inc. This software will assist us with updating, maintaining, scheduling, and tracking RMP-PSM related activities. \n\n\n\n1.1 J. Milicic & Son, Risk and Process Safety Management Program\n\n\n\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that J. Milicic & Son has updated/developed their unified RMP-PSM Program. This program has been prepared to address the risks involved in operating and maintaining the following process which has the presence of hazardous chemicals above threshold quantities: \n\n\n\nProcess Name            | Process Chemical          | Process Quantity(lbs.)\n\nAmmonia Refrigeration     Anhydrous Ammonia           54,000\n\n\n\nOur RMP-PSM program promotes overall plant, worker, and public safety. The program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of hazardous chemicals. Overall, the program is designed to prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, illnesses, and physical property damage.\n\n\n\nOur company has many policies and procedures in place to promote overall plant, worker and public safety. We have: \n\n1. Prepared a unified program based on the PSM regulation to meet CalARP and RMP obli"

The refrigeration machinery is contained within or directly adjacent to the machinery room. A partial list of system components includes:\n\n\n\nMachinery Room\n\n(5) Screw compressors\n\n(5) Oil separators\n\n(1) Liquid transfer vessel\n\n(2) Transfer pumps\n\n(1) Main suction accumulator\n\n\n\nCondenser Area\n\n(2) Evaporative condensers\n\n(2) High pressure receivers\n\n(1) Ammonia diffusion tank\n\n\n\nStaging/Dock\n\n(1) Accumulator\n\n(4) Air-cooling evaporators (bunker-mounted, spiral fin)\n\n\n\nRoom 1\n\n(1) Accumulator\n\n(3) Air-cooling evaporators (bunker-mounted, spiral fin)\n\n\n\nRoom 2\n\n(1) Accumulator\n\n(3) Air-cooling evaporators (bunker-mounted, spiral fin)\n\n\n\nRoom 3\n\n(1) Accumulator\n\n(5) Air-cooling evaporators (bunker-mounted, spiral fin)\n\n\n\nRoom 4\n\n(1) Accumulator\n\n(5) Air-cooling evaporators (bunker-mounted, spiral fin)\n\n\n\nRoom 5\n\n(1) Accumulator\n\n(5) Air-cooling evaporators (bunker-mounted, spiral fin)\n\n\n\nRoom 6\n\n(1) Accumulator\n\n(5) Air-cooling evaporators (bunker-mounted, spiral fin)\n\n\n\nRoom 7\n\n(1) Accumulator\n\n(4) Air-cooling evaporators (bunker-mounted, spiral fin)\n\n\n\nRoom 8\n\n(1) Accumulator\n\n(4) Air-cooling evaporators (bunker-mounted, spiral fin"

From the accumulators, low pressure liquid is circulated through evaporator coils. As heat is absorbed, the liquid ammonia vaporizes to form low temperature and pressure gas which is returned to the accumulator vessels. The suction gas is returned from the accumulators through a suction return line to the main suction accumulator.  From the main suction accumulator, ammonia is piped to the suction inlet on the compressors. The high pressure discharge from the compressors is sent to water-cooled evaporative condensers where the high pressure gas ammonia is cooled, liquefied and returned to the high pressure receiver.\n\n\n\nThe system contains numerous safety devices including sensors which stop the compressors if temperatures or pressures exceed or drop below established limits, and pressure relief valves which vent to the ammonia diffusion tank if the pressure in the system exceeds th"

Each sensor is set at the California OSHA permissible exposure limit of 25 ppm, which will activate an audible alarm and strobe.\n\n\n\nAn emergency control box is installed on the north exterior wall of the refrigeration machinery room, which contains three valves. The high and low side of the system each have a valve that would discharge to the ammonia diffusion tank. The connecting pipe between the high and low side has one equalizer valve that would equalize the system.\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system at J. Milicic & Son Cold Storage consists of vessels, equipment, and valves which are interconnected by piping.  As such, the refrigeration system at J.

During these meeting we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\n\n\n\nJ. Milicic & Son has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the ammonia refrigeration process. These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release. The results of the analyses are reported in PSMWriter and hard copy binders. \n\n\n\n1.3.2 Anhydrous Ammonia\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration process at the J. Milicic & Son facility is an integral part of the overall business and operates most of the year.

Milicic & Son has had no accidental release within the last five (5) years.\n\n\n\n1.5 Emergency Action and Response Plan\n\n\n\nJ.

Under this plan we will call emergency personnel and evacuate the facility. All response activities would be done in coordination with the Local Fire Department and their Hazardous Materials Response Team. \n\n\n\nEvery year we review with our employees our evacuation procedures in the event of an emergency, including a hazardous chemical release.\n\n\n\n1.6 Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nJ. Milicic & Son has implemented many policies and procedures to promote overall plant, worker and public safety. Nevertheless, J. Milicic & Son continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.\n\nBy utilizing PSMWriter software, all necessary employees have access to every aspect of the RMP-PSM program.
