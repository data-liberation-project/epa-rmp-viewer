      "SummaryText": "The Municipal Sanitary Authority of the City of New Kensington sewage treatment plant is designed to treat an avarege of 6.0 MGD.  Wastewater treatment processes include chlorination for disinfecion purposes.  Chlorine usage ranges from 25 to 120 pounds per day, depending on flow conditions.  The maximum amount of chlorine maintained onsite is 8000 pounds.  A total of four, one ton cylinders may be onsite.  A worst case release scenario for the facility involves a rupture of a 2000 pound cylinder releasing chlorine to the atmosphere.  The facility has a risk management policy that requires at least two employees to be present during all chlorine handing procedures including delivery of chlorine cylinders and exchanging of chlorine cylinders at the feed system.  All equipment associated with the chlorination feed system is  inspected daily by employees.  The facility has an Offsite Response Plan prepared in conjunction with the Westmoreland County LEPC.  There have been no reportable accidents involving chlorine at the facility within the past five years."
