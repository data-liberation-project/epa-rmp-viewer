If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department and the Walla Walla County LEPC as well as other entities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people, property and to the environment.\n \nThe primary activity at the Prescott facility is the storage, sale and distribution of fertilizers to growers to enhance crop production.  Anhydrous Ammonia and Aqua Ammonia is received, stored and distributed at this facility for agricultural use.\n.\nThis facility has implemented the provisions of the \"Safety Requirements for Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\" published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc. Initial and refresher training is provided to all employees involved in the processes. A qualified person is in attendance during each transfer.\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at this facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess operations and maintenance procedures at this facility. Monthly inspections are performed and documented. Equipment inspections are completed before each transfer."
