We will not compromise Environmental, Health or Safety Values for profit or production.  \n\nChlorine, being a hazardous compound listed by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), is regulated for the management of hazards during the handling and processing of the chemical at the RMC Massena New York facility.  RMC has established a risk management program for chlorine to comply with these regulatory requirements, and to protect the health and safety of its employees, the surrounding community and environment.\n\nRMC has a written chlorine emergency response plan to ensure that chlorine emergencies are dealt with in a prompt and safe manner.  Only qualified personnel are allowed to assess and contain a leak from a covered process, and trained incident commanders are onsite at all times to coordinate such a response.  The emergency response plan includes a protocol for notifying external agencies as necessary. \n\nDescription of the Stationary Source's Regulated Substances and Processes\n\nRMC uses and stores only one covered chemical, chlorine, in excess of the applicability threshold.  Chlorine has a defined threshold quantity of 2,500 pounds.  There are three separate processes that contain chlorine in quantities greater than the applicability threshold.  These processes are identified as follows:\n\n- raw water treatment;\n- chlorine storage; and\n- chlorine process building.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention\n\nRMC has established a management system meeting the requirements of both the OSHA PSM and EPA RMP standards to help ensure the safe opera"

To identify situations having the potential to release chlorine, RMC analyzed each process for the following: how process elements interact, how the equipment can fail, what happens if it fails, what is in place to prevent it, and what could be done to improve the safety of the process.  In addition, RMC has established facility-wide procedures for the management of hazardous activities such as welding, and process-specific procedures to address unique hazards of operation and maintenance for individual processes.  All personnel who may be required to perform these activities have been trained in the proper procedures.  Employees have been asked to participate in the development of the procedures and other relevant documentation related to these processes so their experiences and knowledge can be utilized.  New equipment is thoroughly reviewed before it is placed in service, and all changes are analyzed before they are implemented to ensure they do not create new hazards.\n\nEach incident that occurs at RMC is investigated, whether or not chlorine is involved in the incident.  If a chlorine incident were to occur, RMC has an emergency response program including facility personnel with training on the proper techniques for handling chlorine releases.  The facility emergency response program contains provisions for coordinating with the St. Lawrence County Emergency Services as necessary.  RMC has conducted chlorine incident response drills in the past.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nThe accident history related to storage and use of chlorine (the covered processes) at the facility is required as a component of the facility's RMP.  The facility has had no accidents involving chlorine within this five-year history that resulted in any on-site or off-site impacts as defined by EPA.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nRMC?s written Emergency Chlorine Response Procedure and its 24-hour Chlorine Emergency Response Team are immediately activated in the event "

Its policies and procedures are continually improved to reduce the safety and environmental risk from its chlorine processes."
