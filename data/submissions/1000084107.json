Executive Summary\r\nThis program is intended to meet the spirit and intent of the following regulations:\r\n- California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program - Title 19 CCR, Chapter 4.5\r\n- Federal EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) - Title 40 CFR \u00a768\r\n\r\nHereafter this program will be referred to as the RMP-CalARP program.\r\n\r\nThis program is intended to be a \"living document\". As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible and updated as necessary. To accomplish this, Shore Chemical Co. has elected to use PSMWriter, software developed and distributed by Resource Compliance, Inc. This software will assist us with updating, maintaining, scheduling, and tracking RMP-CalARP related activities. \r\n\r\n1.1 Shore Chemical Co., Risk Management Program\r\n\r\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that Shore Chemical Co. has updated their unified RMP-CalARP Program. This program has been prepared to address the risks involved in operating and maintaining the following process which has the presence of hazardous chemicals above threshold quantities: \r\n\r\nProcess Name                              | Process Chemical               | Process Quantity(lbs.)\r\nPropylene Oxide Storage and Distribution    Propylene Oxide                  60,000\r\n\r\nOur RMP-CalARP program promotes overall plant, worker, and public safety. The program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences of, significant releases of hazardous chemicals. Overall, the program is designed to prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, illnesses, and physical property damage.\r\nOur company has many policies and procedures in place to promote overall plant, worker and public safety. We have: \r\n1. Prepared a unified program in order to meet CalARP and RMP obligations\r\n2. Organized the program so that it meshes closely with general business practices\r\n3.

The facility is primarily comprised of two (2) warehouses, each with covered and elevated concrete docks where chemicals are stored. Cylinders filled with 375 lbs of propylene oxide are delivered to the loading dock/pit on the north side of the facility. \r\n\r\nProcess Equipment\r\nAll material used in the construction of the propylene oxide process equipment at Shore Chemical Co. is in accordance with 49 CFR \u00a7178.61 and suitable for propylene oxide at the coincident temperature and pressure to which the cylinders are subject. The cylinders have been constructed according to the specification for DOT-4BW240 welded steel cylinders. \r\nSafety Systems\r\n\r\nEach propylene oxide cylinder at Shore Chemical Co. is protected from overpressure with a fusible plug which consists of a brass plug with a fusible metal insert, which will melt at 157\u00b0F to 170\u00b0F (69.4\u00b0C to 76.7\u00b0C).\r\n\r\nEmergency eyewash and safety showers are located in various areas throughout the facility and can be used to decontaminate if chemical exposure occurs.\r\nEquipment associated with the propylene oxide process are clearly marked with tags, labels, and signs.\r\nAll cylinders are stored securely in a designated storage area.\r\n\r\nProcess Classification\r\nThe propylene oxide process at Shore Chemical Co. consists of the storage and distribution of the propylene oxide cylinders. All cylinders are co-located during storage, handling, and on-site movement. As such, the propylene oxide process at Shore Chemical Co. is treated as a single process.\r\n\r\n1.3 General Accident Release & Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\n1.3.1 General \r\n\r\nWe info"

During these meetings we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\r\n\r\nShore Chemical Co. has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the propylene oxide storage and distribution process. These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release. The results of the analyses are reported in PSMWriter and hard copy binders. \r\n\r\n1.3.2 Propylene Oxide\r\n\r\nThe propylene oxide storage and distribution process at the Shore Chemical Co. facility is an integral part of the overall business and operates throughout the year. The maximum intended inventory of propylene oxide is 60,000 lbs which is contained in (160) 375-lb DOT-4BW240 cylinders. Management is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential danger of a propylene oxide leak. \r\n\r\nShore Chemical Co. personnel continuously monitor the propylene oxide storage and distribution process. In addition, the cylinders are checked frequently by the propylene oxide vendor. This vendor also assists in performing the annual mechanical integrity review of our propylene oxide cylinders. \r\n\r\n1.4 Five Year Accident History\r\nShore Chemical Co. has had no accidental release within the last five (5) years.\r\n\r\n1.5 Emergency Action and Response Plan\r\nShore Chemical Co.'s emergency action and response program has been developed to satisfy the following requirements:\r\nCal/OSHA's Emergency Action Plan - Title 8 CCR \u00a73220\r\nU.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Emergency Action Plans - Title 29 CFR \u00a71910.38\r\nCalifornia Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program [Emergency Response Program Requirements] - Title 19 CCR, Division 2, Chapter 4.5 \u00a72765.1-2765.2\r\nUSEPA Risk Management Program [Emergency Response Program Requireme"

Under this plan we will call emergency personnel and evacuate the facility. All response activities would be done in coordination with the Turlock Fire Department and their Hazardous Materials Response Team. \r\n\r\nEvery year we review with our employees our evacuation procedures in the event of an emergency, including a hazardous chemical release.\r\n\r\n1.6 Planned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nShore Chemical Co. has implemented many policies and procedures to promote overall plant, worker and public safety. Nevertheless, Shore Chemical Co. continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.\r\n\r\nBy utilizing PSMWriter software, all necessary employees have access to every aspect of the RMP-CalARP program. This has improved Shore Chemical Co.'s ability to communicate hazardous situations to employees and contractors. In addition, PSMWriter tracks all RMP-CalARP related events so that Shore Chemical Co.'s management team can ensure that the RMP-CalARP program is being implemented.\r\n\r\nShore Chemical Co. has implemented all aspects of the RMP-CalARP program. When a RMP-CalARP program requirement is completed (i.e. mechanical integrity inspection, process hazard analysis, compliance audit, etc.) any specific action items related to that event are entered into PSMWriter, assigned a responsible person, and given a due date. Once the action item has been completed, the resolution can be documented using PSMWriter as well. A list of current or past due action items can be accessed at any time by those with access to PSMWriter.\r\n\r\nIn addition to utilizing PSMWriter to create, schedule, track, and document events, Shore Chemical Co. has also entered into a contract with Resource Compliance to obtain help with RMP-CalARP program implementation.\r\n\r\nFor"
