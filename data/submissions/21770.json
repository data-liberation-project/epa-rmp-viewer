      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n1.    Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nDPC Enterprises (DPCE) is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety. \nThis commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program \nthat covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee \ntraining associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to comply with all \napplicable federal, state, and local regulations as well as implement appropriate controls to \nprevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\nOur emergency response program includes procedures for notification of the local fire \ndepartment; notification of any potentially affected neighbors; and notification of local, state and \nfederal agencies.   Safety is an essential part of our operations, the safety devices built-in to the \ndesign of this facility, the safe handling procedures that we use, and the extensive training of our \npersonnel.\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nDPCE is part of a 52-year-old company whose primary activities encompass distributing and \nrepackaging inorganic chemicals and compressed gases as well as manufacturing water treatment \nproducts. For example, chlorine is used to produce sodium hypochlorite commonly know as \nhousehold bleach.   We are headquartered in Houston, Texas and operate more than 20 plants \nacross the United States.\n \nWe have these regulated substances at our facility: Ammonia (anhydrous), Chlorine, and Sulfur \nDioxide (anhydrous).  DPCE stores these materials in 150-lb. cylinders, 800-lb. containers, and \nton containers for use by our customers.\n\nThe maximum inventories of these substances at this facility are:\n\nAmmonia (anhydrous) ? 10,000 lbs.\nChlorine  - 70,000 lbs.\nSulfur dioxide (anhydrous) ? 10,000 lbs.\n\n3.

      "SummaryText": "easures to \nlimit the distances for each reported scenario\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the EPA's \nRMP Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants Reference Tables or Equations.  The following \nparagraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 3 toxic substances as a class involves a \ncatastrophic release from Chlorine storage.  The scenario involves releasing the entire contents of \na ton container in a gaseous form over 10 minutes.  This release would reach the toxic endpoint \n(0.0087 mg/l or 3 ppm) and public receptors.\n\nOne alternative release scenario (ARS) has been submitted for each toxic substance present in \nProgram 3 processes.  DPCE has assumed the substances would be released in a gaseous form \nover 30 minutes.  First, the ARS for Ammonia is a vessel leak which would reach the toxic \nendpoint (0.14 mg/l or 200 ppm) and public receptors.  Second, the scenario for Chlorine is a \nvessel leak that would reach the toxic endpoint (0.0087 mg/l or 3 ppm) and public receptors.  \nLast, is the ARS for Sulfur dioxide (anhydrous) involving a vessel leak.  This release would \nreach the toxic endpoint (0.0078 mg/l or 3 ppm) and public receptors.\n\n4.    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-\nSpecific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention \nrequirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  A number of processes at our facility are \nsubject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.  Our facility is also subject to \nEPCRA Section 302 notification requirements.    The following sections briefly describe the \nelements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nDPCE maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, \noperating parameters and equipment designs asso"

The methodology used to carry out these analyses is \nWhat If/Checklist (combined).  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with \nexpertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated every 5 years as required or \nas necessary.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, DPCE maintains \nwritten operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as \ninitial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency \noperations, and normal shutdown.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily \naccessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nDPCE has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are \noperating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  \nRefresher training is provided at least every 3 years and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nDPCE carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper \noperations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure \nvessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, \ncontrols and pumps.  Qualified personnel carry out maintenance operations with previous \ntraining in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training \nas needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a \nsafe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at DPCE to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, \nequipment and procedures.

These reviews are conducted to confirm that \nconstruction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior \nto placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nDPCE conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the \nRMP rule are being implemented.  These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any \ncorrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\nDPCE promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a \ncatastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the \nsituation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from \nreoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation\nDPCE truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  \nCompany employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident \nprevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to \nall information created as part of the facility?s implementation of the RMP rule, including \ninformation resulting from process hazard analyses in particular.\n\nContractors\nOn occasion, our company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction \nactivities.
