In order to reach and maintain the temperatures required by the USDA standards, A&J utilizes a closed circuit anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system. The ammonia (anhydrous) (CAS#7661-41-7) is stored entirely within the refrigeration system. Anhydrous ammonia is subject to the requirements of the TCPA, OSHA, PSM, and EPA 112R (40 CFR 68). A&J has identified the EHS stationary source and has prepared its policies and programs accordingly.\n\nI.\tStationary Source Identification\n\nA&J has identified the use of anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant in a closed circuit refrigeration system as the only stationary EHS source at the facility. The facility design was completed in accordance with ANSI/IIAR 2-2008 - Equipment, Design, and Installation of Closed Circuit Ammonia Mechanical Refrigerating Systems. The ventilation design was completed in accordance with ANSI/IIAR 2-2008 and IIAR Bulletin No. 111 - Ammonia Machinery Room Ventilation.\n\nThe design is for a typical anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system consisting of ammonia vessels, an evaporative condenser, compressors, evaporators, chillers, and a gas purger. The system is designed in order to ensure that no offsite impact can occur even in the worst case EHS release scenario.\n\nII.\tEmergency Response\n\nIn the event of a discharge, Al & John, Inc. will follow emergency response protocols which include automatic shut-offs and the use of the emergency ventilation system. The emergency response plan will be coordinated with the Essex County, New Jersey Office of Emergency Management (OEM).\n\nIII.\tFive Year History\n\nThe West Caldwell facility of Al & John, Inc. completed construction of the anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system in December, 2012.

      "SummaryText": "l & John has not had any accidental releases of ammonia (or any other EHS) in the last five years.\n\nIV.\tAccidental Release Prevention and Chemical Specific Prevention Procedures\n\nAl & John, Inc. has developed standard operating procedures (SOPs) and a Risk Management Plan in accordance with NJAC 7:31 and 40 CFR 68. In addition, anhydrous ammonia detectors will be utilized as appropriate. Any one of the ammonia detectors will trigger an alarm in the control room and automatically implement equipment shut-down procedures as necessary.\n\nIn order to eliminate the possibility of an accidental release, all vessels containing anhydrous ammonia will be located in a diked vapor-tight containment room equipped with an ammonia sensor and a ventilation system. The containment room is designed to contain the total capacity of the largest ammonia vessel in the event of a release of anhydrous ammonia within this containment room. Emergency shut-down procedures will be implemented in this event.\n\nV.\tPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nAl & John, Inc. has identified the hazards associated with the handling of anhydrous ammonia and has developed programs and systems to safeguard against these hazards. These procedures are subject to a management of change procedure, which allows the facility management to review and upgrade procedures and programs when necessary. A&J will continue to review the procedures and implement proactive solutions to health and safety concerns. In accordance with 40 CFR 68.96 as applicable to Al & John, it is our plan to conduct an emergency response field exercise prior to March 15, 2027."
