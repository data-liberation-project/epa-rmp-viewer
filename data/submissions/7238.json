The quantity released in dependent upon the timeliness of applying the chlorine kits as active mitigation.  This scenario assumes that the active mitigation will occur within an hour.  These kits are designed to seal leaks at the valve or fusible plug.  The radius of the area affected by the alternative release scenario is approximately 0.1 miles.  Therefore, only the street immediately in front of the facility and the neighboring businesses could be affected by a release under the alternative scenario.\n\nRelease of Sulfur Dioxide: Because of the inherent integrity of the container itself, only the valve and fusible plug present feasible release scenarios.  As explained above, the valve is recessed inside the cylinder and damage could only occur if an object enters the recessed area with sufficient force to damage the valve.  The fusible plug is designed to melt at approximately 157 degrees F.  Because the cylinders are stored outside, away from any combustible materials, this is not a high risk.  This scenario assumes that a Act of God damages a valve inside its recessed compartment.  The facility has the appropriate containment kits for containing releases from sulfur dioxide containers.

Therefore, only the street immediately in front of the facility and the neighboring businesses could be affected by a release under the alternative scenario.\n\nIV.

      "SummaryText": "he worse-case scenario for GW - Nampa is a release of a one-ton container of either sulfur dioxide gas or chlorine gas.  A release of this magnitude would impact receptors within a 1.3 mile radius (as determined by RMP*Comp).  The Company believes that this release scenario is extremely unlikely given the inherent integrity of containers used for chlorine.  Compressed gas ton containers (like those used for both the chlorine and sulfur dioxide) are manufactured to meet stringent U.S. Department of Transportation standards.  These container standards are specifically designed to minimize (if not eliminate) the possibility of accidental release during the rigors of transportation in commerce.  Manufacturing specifications include the use of >1-inch thick steel for the body of the container.  Cylinder weight exceeds 1,500 pounds when empty.  These containers can only be moved at the facility in single units (i.e., one at a time).  This factor, by itself, eliminates the possibility of a release (during onsite movement) of a quantity greater than one container.  Container valves are protected within a recessed compartment to prevent accidental damage during handling/transportation.  \n\nGW - Nampa stores both chlorine and sulfur dioxide containers outdoors. \n\nB.  Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nAlternative release scenarios at GW- Idaho Falls include (1) the accidental release of 300 pounds of chorine from a one-ton container and (2) the accidental release of 300 pounds of sulfur dioxide from a one-ton container.  \n\nRelease of Chlorine: Because of the inherent integrity of the container itself, only the valve and fusible plug present feasible release scenarios.  As explained above, the valve is recessed inside the cylinder and damage could only occur if an object enters the recessed area with sufficient force to damage the valve.  The fusible plug is designed to melt at approximately 157 degrees F.  If the fusible plug melts as a result of fire, it is expected that the chlo"

      "SummaryText": "al environmental and safety rules and regulations apply to this facility to detail in this summary.  The primary legislation affecting chlorine is OSHA's Process Safety Management rule.  There are no rules that apply specifically to hydroflouric acid, although it is covered generally under OSHA and EPA regulations.  A chlorine PSM program has been implemented at the facility.   The uniform fire and building codes also apply to this facility and are enforced by the Nampa Fire Department.  The fire department performs safety inspections of the facility.\n\nThe Company has a formal safety training program designed to meet training requirements promulgated by OSHA, DOT and EPA.  Hazard communication training (OSHA) is the primary method the Company uses to educate employees on the risks associated with these two chemicals.  Emergency response training is performed in accordance with OSHA's HAZWOPER regulations (29 CFR Part 1910.120).\n\nB.  Internal (Company) Release Prevention Program Requirements\n\nGW is a member of the National Association of Chemical Distributors (NACD).  It is actively engaged in the process of becoming certified under the NACD's Product Stewardship/Responsible Distribution Program.  This program requires member companies to prepare policies and procedures that promote the safe use and handling of chemical products by member companies and also by customers who purchase the chemical products.
