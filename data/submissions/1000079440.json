Accidental Release Prevention and Energy Response Policies\r\nEnergy Transfer Mont Belvieu NGLs LLC is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety. This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. If such a release does occur at the Energy Transfer Mont Belvieu NGLs LLC Mont Belvieu Terminal, our response activities are coordinated with Mont Belvieu Police Department and Mutual Aid Mont Belvieu (MAMB).\r\n\r\n2.  The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\r\nThe Mont Belvieu Terminal's RMP-regulated activities are the storage and loading of propane [CAS# 74-98-6], butane [CAS# 106-97-8], and NGL [CAS# 68425-31-0].  Propane and butane are received by pipeline and stored in pressure vessels. Propane is stored in two 30,000-gallon pressurized \"bullet\" tanks. Likewise, butane is stored in two 30,000-gallon pressurized \"bullet\" tanks.  NGL commonly referred to as natural gasoline is stored in a 106,000 gallon pressurized tank which is connected to a pipeline for further shipment.  The propane and butane tanks provide intermediate storage prior to truck and rail loading of both propane and butane.  All loading of LPG products is for purposes of wholesale distribution. Ethyl mercaptan [CAS# 75-08-1] is also stored at the site in quantities potentially above the RMP threshold of 10,000 lbs. Ethyl mercaptan is used to odorize LPG products prior to loading into transport vessels.  Propane, butane, natural gasoline (as a flammable mixture) and ethyl mercaptan are all classified as flammable under 40 CFR Part 68. No other flammable compounds or designated toxic compounds are stored or used at the facility in amounts above their RMP th"

General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release program that is in place at our stationary source.  \r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\nEnergy Transfer Mont Belvieu NGLs LLC maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associated with all processes.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis\r\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  Hazop and What-if hazard analysis methodologies have been used to carry out these analyses. The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of not more than five (5) years. Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\nFor the purpose of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Energy Transfer Mont Belvieu NGLs LLC maintains written operating procedures. These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and startup after a turnaround. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\nEnergy Transfer Mont Belvieu NGLs LLC has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operatin"

Refresher training is provided at least every three (3) years, and more frequently as needed.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\nEnergy Transfer Mont Belvieu NGLs LLC carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations. Process equipment examined by these checks includes, among others: pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls, pumps, valves, gas detectors, flame detectors, and temperature and pressure switches.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices. Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed. Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\r\n\r\nManagement of Change\r\nWritten procedures are in place at Energy Transfer Mont Belvieu NGLs LLC to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures. Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\r\n\r\nPre-Startup Reviews\r\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at Energy Transfer Mont Belvieu NGLs LLC. These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating, and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits\r\nEnergy Transfer Mont Belvieu NGLs LLC will conduct audits on a regular basis to confirm that the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being properly and adequately implemented.
