The plant\u00bfs products are used to make a variety of different types and styles of nylon carpeting.  The one material used by the facility which is on the RMP Rule's list of regulated substances is cyclohexylamine.  The Shaw Industries Plant 8S's storage and use of cyclohexylamine exceeds the specified threshold of 15,000 lbs.as defined by the EPA\u00bfs RMP Rule.  Shaw Industries Plant 8S is committed to managing health, safety and the environment as a core business value. The Plant also integrates health, safety and environment into all aspects of its operations as a competitive advantage in achieving profitable growth and accelerated productivity.  \n\nIn accordance with the requirements of the RMP Rule, a description of the following six elements is provided by the Shaw Industries Group, Inc., Plant 8S, Columbia, S.C.: \n\n1) Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies: \n\nIt is the policy of the Shaw Industries Plant 8S in Columbia S.C. to operate a safe and environmentally sound facility by identifying and controlling health, safety, and environmental risks related to its operations; by designing its processes to protect people, property and the environment; by conducting and continually reviewing and improving programs for safety, health and environmental excellence; and by establishing processes to ensure that all laws and regulations applicable to its operations and products are kn"

The Plant has a written Emergency Response Plan that addresses various types of contingencies including specific actions for responding to an accidental release of cyclohexylamine.  The Plan provides for both internal Plant and external community emergency alerting and notification with established call trees with multiple means of communication.  The Plan addresses emergency health care, \nin-place sheltering, evacuation, and implementation of an Incident Command System to direct and coordinate the Plant's response activities.  The Plan has been coordinated with the LEPC and with the local Fire Department who would direct offsite community response activities.  All members of the local Fire Department visit the Plant annually to receive training on the Site's RMP Program, the source location and hazards of cyclohexylamine, the Site Emergency Response Plan and emergency response resources, and are taken on a tour of the facility.  The last RMP Emergency Response cross training with the local Fire Department was held at the Columbia Plant 8S in April 2005.  The Fire Department's station house is physically located adjacent to the Columbia Plant 8S on adjoining property.  The Shaw Industries Plant 8S maintains its own professionally trained Emergency Response Team that is knowledgeable and prepared to respond to incidents involving accidental releases of cyclohexylamine.  The Plant 8S Emergency Response Team trains monthly and holds annual Plant emergency response drills and exercises.  Joint training exercises are conducted with members of the local Fire Department response group.  In-house testing and audits of the Plant's emergency response alarm and communication systems are performed weekly. \n\n6) Planned Changes to Improve Safety:  \n\nThe Process Hazard Analysis"

The accidental release prevention and emergency response policy associated specifically with the plant's use of cyclohexylamine involves the integration of safety devices and technologies inherent in the design of the process, safe operational procedures and management practices, operator training, the preparation and testing of site emergency response plans, the maintenance of onsite emergency response equipment and a professionally trained Emergency Response Team, coordinating our efforts and resources with local emergency response services, and communicating with the community. \n\n2) Description of the Facility and the Regulated Substance Handled:  \n\nThe Shaw Industries, Plant 8S uses cyclohexylamine as an additive in the manufacturing of nylon.  It is stored and handled in quantities that exceed the threshold quantity specified in the RMP Rule.  The Plant's stationary source of cyclohexylamine consists of bulk storage and process distribution equipment located as part of the Carpet Fibers Polymerization Department on the eastern side of the Plant site.  Cyclohexylamine is purchased from an outside vendor and is delivered to the Plant via tank truck on an as needed basis.  The tanker's contents are unloaded by Plant operators into an above ground bulk storage tank identified as VT-993 which is located in an isolated outdoor area. The maximum capacity of the bulk storage tank is 58,800 lbs.  Cyclohexylamine is pumped from the bulk storage tank through an enclosed piping system into the production areas where it is fed into the nylon polymerization process unit.  \n\n3)  The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:  \n\nThe general accidental release prevention program at Shaw Industries, Plant 8S for the cyclohexylamine stationary source includes the following elements: a) established process safety management system for oversight and control of the cyclohexylamine process; b) development and implementat"

      "SummaryText": "of the Shaw Industries Plant 8S\u00bfs covered process and stationary source of cyclohexylamine was revalidated and updated in July and August of 2003.  As a result of this systematic safety review, several action items were identified and resolved to further improve the existing safeguards of the covered source and to further reduce the potential for an accidental release.  The Process Hazard Analysis for the cyclohexylamine stationary source and covered process will be reviewed and revalidated every five years.  Since 2002 the Columbia Plant has purchased fifteen (15) two way walkie - talkie radios, a foam fire fighting unit, and eleven (11) new self contained breathing apparatus units (SCBAs) units to augment emergency response capabilities for accidental releases of cyclohexylamine.  Even though air dispersion modeling results for the worst case release scenario of cyclohexylamine from the facility's largest container showed that the distance the vapors would travel to reach the toxic endpoint concentration would not exceed the Plant's property line, the Columbia, S.C. Plant 8S in August of 2005 relocated its largest storage container of cyclohexylamine approximately 700 feet further back from its original location in a direction away from the Plant's property line and away from the Plant's predominant employee population and process control operational areas.  The relocation of this bulk container increased the distance from the toxic endpoint to the Plant\u00bfs nearest offsite property line by several hundred feet as calculated in the worst case release modeling.  The relocated cyclohexylamine bulk storage tank and process distribution system became active on March 1, 2006.  Annual training with the local Fire Department will be conducted in 2006."
