We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment. The executive summary provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented and will be included in the RMP submittal. The following management activities include:\n\u0095\tA description of Memphis Cellulose and the use of chlorine, which is regulated by EPA's RMP regulation,\n\u0095\tAn overview of our accidental release prevention programs,\n\u0095\tA five-year accident history for accidental releases of chlorine,\n\u0095\tAn overview of our emergency response programs,\n\u0095\tAn overview of planned improvements at the Memphis Cellulose to help prevent accidental chlorine releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment,\n\u0095\tThe certification that EPA's RMP rule requires us to provide, and,\n\u0095\tThe detailed information (called data elements) about our risk management program.\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\nMemphis Cellulose produces purified alpha cellulose from cotton fibers (linters). Memphis Cellulose mechanically cleans and fluffs raw cotton linters prior to combining with water. The  mixture is then placed in a digester, which uses steam and caustic soda to purify and reduce to raw slurry. The raw slurry is then further purified prior to being delivered to the finishing (drying) operation. In our processes, we use the following chemicals that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant off-site consequences in the unlikely event of a substantial accidental release:\n\u0095\tToxics- Chlorine is stored on-site in up to two 90-ton rail cars. This chemical is used to brighten the cotton linter cell"

On July 6, 2021, approximately one (1) pound of chlorine was released from a transfer hose and resulted in an injury to one employee.  \nFor all incidents, non-reportable releases, or non-routine events, we conduct formal incident investigations to identify and correct the root causes.\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nOur program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations. Furthermore, we coordinate our Emergency Action Plan with the community emergency response plans, including the Memphis/Shelby County LEPC and the Memphis Fire Department HAZMAT Response Team. Joint training and drills have been conducted with each of these response agencies. Our Emergency Action Plan includes procedures for:\n\u0095\tNotifying the Memphis/Shelby County LEPC/EMA, Memphis Fire Department, and the surrounding community of an accidental release that could have off-site consequences,\n\u0095\tSafely evacuating employees, contractors, and visitors,\n\u0095\tInspecting and maintaining emergency response equipment,\n\u0095\tMaintaining a secure perimeter around the release area, and\n\u0095\tTreating individuals exposed to the release.\nFurther, we have implemented a series of Principally Based Operation and Maintenance Procedures (PBOMP) which provide specific and detailed actions for the prevention and control of chlorine releases at the facility.\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nMemphis Cellulose has made several process safety improvements since the last revision. We have several programs designed to review, audit, and test equipment and procedures. These programs function to continually assess and improve hazardous systems. Initiatives are underway to revise the Process Hazard Analysis and to evaluate and implement appropriate recommendations from the internal Compliance Audit.\n5/21/2024"
