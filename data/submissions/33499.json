(GPRI), a wholly owned subsidiary of Georgia-Pacific Corporation, owns and operates a synthetic resin manufacturing facility in Port Wentworth, Georgia, which is referenced as the \u00bfplant\u00bf throughout the remainder of the document.  The facility is located at 130 Crossgate Road. The resin facility consists of a plant that was originally constructed in 1974.  Overall, the facility employs 43 full-time employees.\n\t\n\tGPRI is committed to operating the plant in a manner that is safe for its workers, the public, and the environment.  As part of this commitment, GPRI has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility.  One component of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the plant and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency\u00bfs (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMP Plan) describing the risk management program at the plant. This document is intended to satisfy the RMP Plan requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at the plant.\n\t\n\tThe risk management program at the plant consists of the following three elements:\n\t\n\u00b7\tA hazard assessment to help understand (a) the potential offsite consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and (b) accidents that have occurred during the last five years associated with the use of substances regulated by the RMP rule (regulated substances).\n\t\n\u00b7\tA prevention program to help maintain and safely operate the processes containing more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance (covered processes).\n\t\n\u00b7\tAn emergency response program to help respond to accidental releases of regulated substances from covered processes\n\t\n\tInformati"

In fact, the plant has a comprehensive safety program in place establishing many levels of safeguards against release of a hazardous substance and injuries and damage from a release of a hazardous substance.\n\t\n\t\n\tGPRI limits the use of hazardous substances.  Before using a hazardous substance at the plant, less hazardous alternatives are considered. When a hazardous substance is used at the plant, GPRI considers the potential for this substance to adversely affect plant workers, the public, and the environment and takes steps to prevent any such effects.\n\t\n\tGPRI prevents releases of the hazardous substances used at the facility.  When a hazardous substance is used at the plant, the equipment is carefully designed, built and operated to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release. Industry and government standards are closely adhered to in the design, construction, and operation of the equipment. \n\t\n\tGPRI limits damage from a release, if such a release occurs.  GPRI trains its workers to respond to an accidental release, reducing the consequences of a release if it occurs.  In addition, GPRI works with the local fire department and with the local emergency planning committee (LEPC) to help prevent injuries and/or environmental damage if a release does occur.\n\t\n\tThe safety program at the plant consists of a number of elements, only some of which are required by the RMP rule. This RMP Plan is primarily intended to describe those parts of the safety program at the plant that are required by the RMP rule.\n\t\n\tAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\tGPRI is committed to the safety of workers and the public, and the preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental rel"

These controls include training programs for personnel, programs to help ensure safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of processes at the plant; and programs to evaluate the hazards at the plant.\n\t\n\tIn the event of an accidental release, the plant controls and contains the release in a manner that will be safe for workers and will prevent injury to the public and the environment.  GPRI provides response training to its personnel, designates an emergency response coordinator to oversee response activities, and coordinates response efforts with the local fire department.

These PHAs help to identify process hazards and generate recommendations that might improve the safe operation of the process.  A team composed of personnel with engineering and process operating experience and a leader with process hazard analysis experience is assembled to analyze the hazards of the process.  The plant primarily uses the \u00bfwhat-if checklist\u00bf technique to perform this analysis.  The PHA team prepares a written report describing the results of the analysis, including a list of recommendations.  Responsibility to resolve the recommendations is assigned to unit personnel and, when appropriate, changes to enhance the safety of the process are implemented. Quarterly reports are issued to track progress of PHA findings/recommendations.\n\t\n\t\n\tOperating Procedures\n\tPlant -, operators, and supervisors work together to develop and maintain ope"

The plant assembles an audit team that includes personnel knowledgeable in the RMP and PSM rules and in the process. This team evaluates whether the prevention program satisfies the requirements of the RMP and PSM rules and whether the prevention program is sufficient to help ensure safe operation of the process. The results of the audit are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate enhancements to the prevention program are implemented.\n\t\n\tIncident Investigation\n\tThe Plant investigates all incidents that could reasonably have resulted in a serious injury to personnel, the public, or the environment so that similar accidents can be prevented in the future.  The plant trains employees to identify and report any incident requiring investigation.  An investigation team is assembled, and the investigation is initiated within 48 hours of the incident.  The results of the investigation are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate process enhancements are implemented.\n\t\n\tEmployee Participation\n\tThe Plant developed a written employee participation program for all covered processes to help ensure that the safety concerns of the plant\u00bfs workers are addressed.  The plant encourages active participation of personnel in the prevention program activities of all processes at the plant. Employees are consulted on, and informed about, all aspects of the RMP rule prevention program, including PHAs and operating procedures.\n\t\n\tHot Work Permits\n\tThe Plant manages the  hot work permit program to control spark- or flame-producing activities that could result in fires or explosions in covered processes at the plant.
