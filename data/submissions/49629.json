Ammonia is used as a refrigerant in the cooling and storage process. Ammonia is a colorless gas with a pungent odor that is an irritant to the eyes, nose and throat. It is normally shipped as a liquefied compressed gas and is present in portions of the refrigeration system as a liquid under pressure. Please refer to onsite data for ammonia quantities.\n\nIn order to protect its employees, the public and the environment, Borton & Sons, Inc. has an integrated safety management program to prevent ammonia releases and mitigate the consequences of a release, should one occur. This program is contained in a comprehensive web-based format designed to comply with the OSHA PSM (29 CFR 1910.119) regulations, WISHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standards found in WAC 296-67 and EPA's Risk Management Plan (RMP) regulations found in 40 CFR Part 68.\n\nOff Site Consequence (OCA) data is available for review onsite at the Borton & Sons, Inc. processing plant.\n\nThe Yakima facility has an emergency plan that addresses the response necessary for a release of ammonia from the refrigeration system. Because of the pungent odor of ammonia, any leak is easily detected. The compressor rooms are provided with ammonia detectors that sound an alarm if ammonia is detected. The plant maintains a group of trained refrigeration operators and maintenance personnel who are trained and qualified to respond to leaks of ammonia. The refrigeration system is designed so that major components can be isolated by closing selected valves. In case of a release that could travel off the plant property, calls would be made to the Yakima Fire Department and the Yakima County Disaster Services Coordinator to assist in the response. Other state and federal notifications would be made as required.\n\nThe Yakima plant has recently had no significant ammonia releases either withi"

There is no five year history of reportable releases of ammonia.\n\nAs a result of a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) of the ammonia refrigeration system, conducted in 2005, an already comprehensive operating and maintenance procedure system was expanded to include the addition of ammonia sensors in key areas of the processing facility Windsocks will be installed at various locations so that they can be seen from any oudoor location at the plant. If a release should occur, this will enable employees to quickly determine the wind direction during the release and to assemble in a pre-designated assembly location. It will also provide a quick indication of whether the toxic cloud is traveling towards the area of local receptors (residential areas)."
