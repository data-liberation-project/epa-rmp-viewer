      "SummaryText": "The Pennant Foods facility located in Chaska, Minnesota is a baking goods processing facility that  handles ammonia, which is considered toxic by EPA. The primary purpose of this facility is to prepare bakery goods for freezing and cold storage and / or baking followed by freezing and cold storage.  Flour and other ingredients are mixed and shaped.  Either the material is then baked or frozen.  If, baked, the products are then frozen and held in cold storage.\n\nAmmonia is used at the facility to refrigerate areas to maintain a safe storage and processing of food products.  Ammonia is a valuable chemical used in the facility refrigeration system, providing the means to remove heat from the products being handled.  The main supply of ammonia is stored in steel tanks located at various areas within the facility.  Ammonia is contained in equipment in the facility and is compressed, condensed and evaporated to remove heat from areas within the facility.\n\nSince ammonia is classified by EPA as toxic chemical, it is necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling them to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the health threat to our own workers, and reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is our policy to adhere to all Federal and State rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle ammonia combined with the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility combined with the safe handling procedures that we use and the training of our personnel.\n\nThe majority of the ammonia refrigeration system is new as of 1999 and an accidental release prevention program has been implemented.  The facility was constructed using the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines, and is in compliance with state codes, as available during the time of construction.  Equipment up grades have been scheduled as warranted to maintain the equipment.   This food processing facility complies with EPA's Accident"

      "SummaryText": "al Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations. \n\nAll of our ammonia refrigeration operators are trained using a training program based on materials from IIAR, a nationally recognized authority in ammonia refrigeration.  This program consists of having an effective preventative maintenance program and comprehensive employee training to insure adequate response to equipment integrity.  The facility does replace  Safety Relief Valves on a 5 year interval as recommended by IIAR.  \n\nOur emergency response program is based upon federal guidelines as they apply to this facility.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of the local fire authority, local emergency response agencies, and notification of any potentially affected neighbors. The facility emergency response plan is based on all known applicable regulations and requirements.  The emergency response plan has been discussed with the Chaska Fire Department and other agencies involved with a response.  Representatives of the Chaska Fire Department visited this plant on an annual basis.  \n\nThere have been no reportable accidents in the past 5 years related to the ammonia system  Furthermore, there have been no reportable releases at this facility in the past 5 years.  \n\nIn regards to the worst case release scenario as defined by EPA, the worst case release for ammonia from the high pressure receiver would travel off site.  An alternative, more likely, release scenario would also travel off site.  \n\nIn all cases, of a potential release, the extent of downwind areas affected is dependent on the amount of chemical released, weather conditions, wind speed and direction, etc.."
