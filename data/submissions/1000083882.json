As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible and updated as necessary. To accomplish this, Mt. Whitney Cold Storage has elected to use PSMWriter, software developed and distributed by Resource Compliance, Inc. This software will assist us with updating, maintaining, scheduling, and tracking RMP-PSM related activities. \r\n\r\n1.1 Mt. Whitney Cold Storage, Risk and Process Safety Management Program\r\n\r\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that Mt. Whitney Cold Storage has updated/developed their unified RMP-PSM Program.

Whitney Cold Storage) operates a commercial cold storage for a variety of fruit in Exeter, CA. The facility has an ammonia refrigeration system that provides refrigeration capacity to the following:\r\n\r\n(3) Precoolers\r\n(5) Cold Storage Rooms\r\n\r\nThe refrigerated spaces are equipped with air-cooling evaporators and accumulators as required for flooded operation.\r\n\r\nAll control valve groups are located on the roof to provide easy access. The refrigeration machinery is contained within or directly adjacent to each compressor room. A partial list of system components includes:\r\n\r\nNorth Compressor Room\r\n(3) Reciprocating compressors\r\n(3) Oil separators\r\n(2) High pressure receivers\r\n(1) Main suction accumulator\r\n(2) Evaporative condensers\r\n\r\nSouth Compressor Room\r\n(2) High pressure receivers\r\n\r\nSouth Outdoor Compressor Area\r\n(3) Upright compressors\r\n(2) Evaporative condensers\r\n(1) Main suction accumulator\r\n(1) Oil pot\r\n\r\nPrecooler 1\r\n(1) Accumulator\r\n(1) Air-cooling evaporator (bunker-mounted, spiral fin)\r\n\r\nPrecooler 2\r\n(1) Accumulator\r\n(1) Air-cooling evaporator (bunker-mounted, spiral fin)\r\n\r\nPrecooler 3\r\n(1) Accumulator\r\n(1) Air-cooling evaporator (bunker-mounted, spiral fin)\r\n\r\nCold Storage 1\r\n(1) Accumulator\r\n(4) Air-cooling evaporators (bunker-mounted, spiral fin)\r\n\r\nCold Storage 2\r\n(1) Accumulator\r\n(4) Air-cooling evaporators (bunker-mounted, spiral fin)\r\n\r\nCold Storage 3\r\n(1) Accumulator\r\n(4) Air-cooling evaporators (bunker-mounted, spiral fin)\r\n\r\nCold Storage 4\r\n(1) Accumulator\r\n(4) Air-cooling evaporators (bunke"

From the accumulators, low pressure liquid is circulated through evaporator coils. As heat is absorbed, the liquid ammonia vaporizes to form low temperature and pressure gas which is returned to the accumulator vessels. The suction gas is returned from the accumulators through a suction return line to the main suction accumulator.  From the main suction accumulator, ammonia is piped to the suction inlet on the compressors. The high pressure discharge from the compressors is sent to water-cooled evaporative condensers where the high pressure gas ammonia is cooled, liquefied and returned to each high pressure receiver.\r\n\r\nThe system contains numerous safety devices including sensors which stop the compressors if temperatures or pressures exceed or drop below established limits, and pressure relief valves which vent to the atmosphere if the pressure in the system exceeds their set point. \r\n\r\nThere are two ammonia detection systems located on the east exterior wall of the North Compressor Room. One detection system monitors the North Compressor Room. The sensor is set at the California OSHA permissible exposure limit of 25 ppm, which will activate audible alarm and strobe. The second detection system monitors each refrigerated space (PC 1-3, CS 1-5). Each sensor is set at the California OSHA permissible exposure limit of 25 ppm, which will activate audible alarm and strobe.\r\n\r\nThe ammonia refrigeration system at Exeter-Ivanhoe Citrus (Mt. Whitney Cold Storage) consists of vessels, equipment, and valves which are interconnected by piping.  As such, the refrigeration system at Exeter-Ivanhoe Citrus (Mt. Whitney Cold S"

During these meeting we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\r\n\r\nMt. Whitney Cold Storage has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the ammonia refrigeration process. These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release. The results of the analyses are reported in PSMWriter and hard copy binders. \r\n\r\n1.3.2 Anhydrous Ammonia\r\n\r\nThe ammonia refrigeration process at the Mt. Whitney Cold Storage facility is an integral part of the overall business and operates most of the year. It is extremely important that this process is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner. Management is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.\r\nOur refrigeration personnel monitor the ammonia refrigeration process and keep an active log book of all procedures and transactions that pertain to ammonia. These contractors also assist in performing the annual mechanical integrity inspection of our ammonia equipment.  \r\n\r\n1.4 Five Year Accident History\r\n\r\nMt. Whitney Cold Storage has had no accidental release within the last five (5) years.\r\n\r\n1.5 Emergency Action and Response Plan\r\n\r\nMt. Whitney Cold Storage's emergency action and response program has been developed to satisfy the following requirements:\r\n- California \"Emergency Action Plan\" - Title 8 CCR \u00a73220\r\n- Federal \"Emergency Action Plan\" - Title 29 CFR \u00a71910.38\r\n\r\nStrategically, we will respond \"minimally\" to a release.

Whitney Cold Storage has implemented many policies and procedures to promote overall plant, worker and public safety. Nevertheless, Mt. Whitney Cold Storage continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.\r\n\r\nBy utilizing PSMWriter software, all necessary employees have access to every aspect of the RMP-PSM program. This has improved Mt. Whitney Cold Storage's ability to communicate hazardous situations to employees and contractors. In addition, PSMWriter tracks all RMP-PSM related events so that Mt. Whitney Cold Storage's management team can ensure that the RMP-PSM program is being implemented.\r\n\r\nMt. Whitney Cold Storage has implemented all aspects of the RMP-PSM program. When a RMP-PSM program requirement is completed (i.e. mechanical integrity inspection, process hazard analysis, compliance audit, etc.) any specific action items related to that event are entered into PSMWriter, assigned a responsible person, and given a due date. Once the action item has been completed, the resolution can be documented using PSMWriter as well. A list of current or past due action items can be accessed at any time by those with access to PSMWriter.\r\nIn addition to utilizing PSMWriter to create, schedule, track, and document events, Mt. Whitney Cold Storage has also entered into a contract with Resource Compliance to obtain help with RMP-PSM program implementation.\r\n\r\nFor the future, Mt. Whitney Cold Storage now thinks of the RMP-PSM program as a \"living document\". It is an interactive framework that guides safe action for Mt. Whitney Cold Storage employees, but allows for feedback and continual improvement. Through the RMP-PSM program Mt. Whitney Cold Storage will continue to maintain overall plant worker and pu"
