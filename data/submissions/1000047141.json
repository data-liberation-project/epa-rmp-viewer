      "SummaryText": "tems, and maintenance of equipment are some of the major steps we have taken to improve safety at our facility.  Additional emergency shutdown stations have been added to expedite shutdown of the system in the event of emergency.  Continual modification of existing product equipment such as heat tunnel elevation, protective cages, additional guards, etc. have been implemented to reduce the possibility of injury.  Additional e-stops have also been added outside the aerosol fillers to allow exterior shutdown.  Using desktop scenarios, we continue to find the opportunity for improvements within the facility.\r\n\r\nA camera surveillance system has also been added to the facility to provide additional security and safety of the employees and facility. Security and first aid drills will also be added to the evacuation plan.\r\n\r\nWith the addition of a 10,000 gallon tank we have implemented a modification to the existing deluge system to include coverage for the new tank and have upgraded all piping and sprinkler heads.  Existing facility sprinkler system has also been upgraded according to NFPA recommendations which protects all interior sections of the building.  Local authorities were involved in the process and ensured water flow will suffice in the event of an emergency.  Local fire officials were present during the installation and testing of the new deluge system every step of the way."

      "SummaryText": "General Executive Summary for Manufacturing Facilities\r\n\r\n1.\tAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nWe at Falcon Safety Products are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nOur facility's primary activities encompass the manufacture of a variety of aerosol products. We have 2 regulated substances at our facility.  The first is Difluoroethane (Ethane, 1,1-difluoro-) which is used in our aerosol filling process as a propellant for the manufacture of compressed gas dusters.  The other is Isobutane which is only stored at our facility warehouse in small quantities and filled at a contracted supplier.\r\n\r\n3.\tThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58, NFPA 30B, NFPA 13 standards.    The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\nFalcon Safety Products maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis\r\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is HAZOP"
