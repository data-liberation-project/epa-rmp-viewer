      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\n\n1. INTRODUCTION\n\n\n\nAt the beginning of the 1900s water-borne diseases were a leading cause of death in the United States (U.S.).  Epidemics of typhoid, cholera, dysentery and other water-borne diseases occurred.  After chlorine's introduction into public water supplies, deaths from typhoid in the U.S. dropped dramatically from 25,000 in 1900 to less than 20 in 1960.  Water-borne disease is even still a leading cause of infant mortality in many countries throughout Asia, Africa, and Latin America where infant mortality rates are 10 to 20 times greater than in the U.S.  In the U.S., however, water-borne disease has been virtually eliminated due to an effective public health strategy of utilizing chlorine for drinking water disinfection.  Chlorine disinfection is arguably one of the greatest achievements for public health worldwide in the last hundred years and is credited with increasing the life expectancy of Americans by more than 50 percent.\n\n\n\nThe use of chlorine is not risk free, however.  Historically it is clear that utilities have recognized the risks and have been successful in developing procedures to handle chlorine safely and to protect the off-site public and the environment from potential accidental releases.\n\n\n\nAs an added layer of protection, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) promulgated the Risk Management Program (RMP) rule in volume 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) part 68.  The goal of these regulations is to reduce the risk to employees, the public, and the environment by preventing the accidental release of hazardous chemicals.  The City of Homestead Wittkop Park Water Treatment Plant (WTP) is regulated because it stores chlorine above the threshold quantity defined in these regulations. \n\n\n\nThe RMP Program Level 3 regulations are similar to the requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management Program (PSMP) rule in volume 29 CFR ? 1910.119.

The Wittkop Park WTP's track record is exemplary with respect to handling hazardous chemicals.  Furthermore, the Wittkop Park WTP has taken a comprehensive approach to be in full compliance with the RMP and PSMP regulations.\n\n\n\nThe key element of complying with the RMP and PSMP rules is development of policies, operating procedures, maintenance programs, and emergency response program to ensure the safety of employees and the public.  The City of Homestead is committed to providing a safe and healthy work environment to its employees and protecting the public, on-site and off-site property, and the environment from releases of chlorine.  Hence, the City of Homestead has prepared a comprehensive Program Level 3 RMP.  This Executive Summary briefly describes the following key elements of the Wittkop Park WTP RMP:\n\n\n\n  * Accidental release prevention and emergency response polices\n\n  * General facility and regulated substance information\n\n  * Summary of the accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific  preventive steps\n\n  * Five-year accident history summary\n\n  * Emergency response program summary\n\n  * Planned changes, if any, to improve safety\n\n\n\n2. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n\n\nThe City of Homestead's accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates proven chlorine process technology and safety systems, incorporates staff training, provides detailed information on the hazards of chlorine and process safety management, implements operational and maintenance standard operating procedures (SOPs), trains and plans for emergency response and emergency actions, in"

GENERAL FACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE INFORMATION\n\n\n\nThe City of Homestead owns and operates the Wittkop Park WTP.  The facility's mission is to protect public health by providing safe drinking water.  The Wittkop Park WTP is located at 505 Northwest 9th Street, Homestead, Florida 33030.  The Wittkop Park WTP is located in Wittkop Park which is bounded by Northwest 9th Court to the north, Northwest 4th Avenue to the east, Northwest 9th Street to the south, and Roberts Road to the west.  \n\n\n\nThe Wittkop Park WTP stores chlorine which is a regulated toxic substance under the RMP rule. The chlorine system at the Wittkop Park WTP provides chlorine to the water to maintain required disinfection levels for drinking water.  The maximum quantity of chlorine present at the Wittkop Park WTP at any given time exceeds the listed threshold quantity in the RMP rule. \n\n \n\nChlorine is delivered in 1-ton cylinders to the chlorine storage area.  The cylinders contain chlorine gas that has been liquified under pressure.  The chlorine gas is drawn at a vacuum through polyvinyl chloride (PVC) vacuum lines to the injectors which feed chlorine into the water.  \n\n\n\nThe Wittkop Park WTP chlorine system is provided with a number of safety features to protect the employees and the surrounding community.  Safety features include leak detection systems, alarms, and automatic shutdown systems.  The chlorine system injects chlorine into the water by use of vacuum feed through vacuum regulators.  This system will automatically shut off at loss of vacuum to prevent unwanted escape of gases into the atmosphere. Furthermore, Chlorine \"B\" Kits and personal protective equipment, including self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA), are available in the event of a chlorine release. \n\n\n\nThe leak detection and alarm systems are located at the following location:\n\n\n\n  * Wittkop Park WTP chlorine storage area\n\n\n\nThe le"

INCIDENT INVESTIGATION\n\n\n\nThe Wittkop Park WTP investigates all incidents that could reasonably have resulted in injury to personnel, injury to the public, damage to the environment, or property damage so that similar accidents can be prevented.  An investigation team will be assembled, and the investigation is initiated within 48 hours of the incident.  The results of the investigation are documented, recommendations are evaluated, and appropriate recommendations are implemented.  Information found during the investigation is reviewed by affected staff and used as needed to revise operation and maintenance procedures.\n\n\n\n7. STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES\n\n\n\nThe Wittkop Park WTP has prepared written SOPs for the chlorine system.  Written SOPs include: startup, normal operation, emergency shutdown, startup after emergency shutdown, ordering 1-ton chlorine containers, 1-ton chlorine container delivery, and 1-ton chlorine containers connection.  The SOPs are annually reviewed by the Superintendent Water and Wastewater Treatment to confirm that they are current and accurate.\n\n\n\n8.

TRAINING\n\n\n\nWittkop Park WTP employees presently involved in operating and maintaining the chlorine system are trained in the chlorine process and the applicable operation and maintenance procedures.  The City of Homestead ensures that each employee newly assigned to the chlorine process is trained and tested to be competent in the process safety management, SOPs, consequences of deviation from the SOPs, and chlorine process safety features.  All employees involved in operating and maintaining the chlorine system have been trained in the required knowledge, skills, and abilities to safely carry out their duties and responsibilities.\n\n  \n\nManagement personnel are trained on process safety management and compliance with federal and state regulations pertaining to risk management planning and process safety management.  All on-site facility personnel that are not involved directly with the chlorine system are also trained in process safety management, emergency evacuation, and the Emergency Action Plan.\n\n\n\nProcess safety management refresher training is provided annually to each employee operating the covered process, management personnel, and employees assigned to the facility to ensure that the employee understands and adheres to the current operating procedures.

INTERNAL COMPLIANCE AUDITS\n\n\n\nInternal compliance audits will be conducted every three years to verify compliance with the programs and procedures contained in the RMP.  The City of Homestead will assemble an audit team that will include personnel knowledgeable in the RMP rule and in the chlorine process.  This team will evaluate whether the prevention program satisfies the requirements of the RMP rule and whether the prevention program is sufficient to help ensure safe operation of the process.
