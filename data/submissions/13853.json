Chlorination is considered to be the most important process for preventing the spread of waterborne disease in drinking water.  The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (DWP) also uses chlorine for drinking water disinfection purposes to protect public health per state and federal water quality standards.  Storing and handling large quantities of chlorine can create hazardous situations.  DWP takes safety obligations in storing and using chlorine as seriously as it takes providing safe drinking water.  The DWP Encino Chlorination Station chlorine handling process is subject to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program and Plan and also to the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program.  These Programs require a summary in the Risk Management Plan (RMP) of policies and procedures followed to safely operate the facility, including a description of the possible consequences in case of an accident and the actions which will be taken by the facility in an event of an emergency.  The following information is specifically required in the RMP Executive Summary: \n7 Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies.\n7 General facility and regulated substances information.\n7 Offsite consequence analysis results.\n7 Summary of the accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps.\n7 Five-year accident history summary.\n7 Emergency response program summary.\n7 Planned changes to improve safety.\nThe above information for the Encino Chlorination Station is provided below.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nThe DWP accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates the use of proven technology, trains staff in operation and maintenance practices, and uses tested and proven management"

The Encino Chlorination Station has prepared an Emergency Response Plan for Hazardous Materials to facilitate coordination and emergency planning with offsite response officials and facilities in the event of an emergency.  The emergency response plan has been coordinated with local response agencies (City of Los Angeles Fire Department).  The Encino Chlorination Station has an excellent record in preventing accidents from occurring.\n\nGeneral Facility and Regulated Substance Information\nThe Encino Chlorination Station is located at 4500 Encino Avenue, Encino, California. The station serves to chlorinate up to 125 cubic feet per second (CFS) of water in a 72-in pipeline which carries water to and from Encino reservoir.  The treated water is then piped into the distribution network which serves parts of the San Fernando Valley with potable water. The station consists of a chlorine storage room and an electrical equipment room.   The facility currently stores chlorine, a regulated toxic substance under the EPA and CalARP Program rules A maximum of four one-ton chlorine containers are stored at the Encino chlorine building.  Up to three of the four chlorine containers can be connected to the chlorination process to feed chlorine gas and the fourth is stored as a spare. The one-ton container is the largest vessel (container) on line. The maximum quantity of chlorine present at the Encino Chlorination Station at any given time exceeds the listed threshold"

It also exceeds the listed threshold quantities in the federal and California Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Standards. However, the facility is normally unmanned and water treatment operators visit the facility daily and respond to any trouble alarms which may occur.  Thus, the DWP Encino facility is not subject to federal or California OSHA PSM regulations.\nIn normal operation, chlorine is withdrawn from one 1-ton chlorine containers to supply gaseous chlorine to the chlorinators and up to two additional containers can be connected to the system as backups.  All three containers are equipped with Halogen actuators on the gas valves and will close the valves when a chlorine concentration of 10 ppm is detected in the room.  All three containers rest on load cell scales, which allow the operators to monitor the chlorine weight in the containers.  A fourth ton container sitting on trunions is stored as a spare. \nChlorine gas is discharged from the container through a pigtail which is attached to the gas valve on the ton container.  The chlorine flows under pressure to the chlorine piping header containing two pressure regulating valves which supplies pressurized chlorine gas to the chlorinators.\nA second (and occasionally a third) ton container is connected to the header system and serves as a backup supply which automatically takes over when the primary container is empty.  This is accomplished by adjusting the outlet pressure of the regulators to select one as primary (setpoint 30 psig) or secondary (setpoint 20 psig).  The third container is connected to the header and serves as an overall backup to meet summer demand (two to four weeks per year maximum).  The chlorine gas then flows to any of the three chlorinators where the chlorine flows are regulated.

The solution is piped through diffusers into the reservoir outlet pipeline.\nA chlorine leak detector with two probes is provided to detect chlorine leaks in the chlorinator room.  The detector activates an alarm system which includes:  (1) a flashing red light over the entry door to the building, (2) an audible alarm within the chlorination building, and (3) an alarm at the Los Angeles Aqueduct Filtration Plant (LAAFP) at Sylmar.\nProcess control is by a programmable controller unit which determines the feed rate relative to the water flow rate and the measured chlorine residual after chlorination.  The chlorine piping over the chlorinators contains an automatic actuated ball valve which shuts off the chlorine supply to the chlorinators when the water flow in the 72\" line reverses to flow into the reservoir.  A sensor in the pipeline detects this reverse flow condition.  During this condition, no chlorination is necessary.  There is a differential pressure cell transmitting a flow signal to the controller. \nIn the event power is lost at the chlorination facility, an alarm will alert the LAAFP control room.  Chlorine flow will continue unaffected, with no safety consequences.  An emergency generator will automatically start and supply power to the entire system.\nThe facility is normally unmanned; water treatment operators visit the facility daily.  A response team coordinated from DWP Los Angeles Aqueduct Filtration Plant (LAAFP) responds to any trouble alarms which may occur. Access to the facility is through gates, which are kept locked all the time.\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results\nThe offsite consequence analysis includes consideration of two chlorine release scenarios, identified as \"worst-case release scenario\" and \"alternative release scenario\".

The alternative scenario is defined as \"more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario\".\nAtmospheric dispersion modeling has to be performed to determine the distance traveled by the chlorine released before its concentration decreases to the \"toxic endpoint\" selected by EPA of 3 ppm, which is the Emergency Response Planning Guideline Level 2 (ERPG-2).  This is defined by the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) as the \"maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms which could impair an individual's ability to take protective action.\"  The residential population within a circle with a radius corresponding to the toxic endpoint distance has to be defined, \"to estimate the population potentially affected\".\nThe worst-case release scenario at the Encino Chlorination Station involves a failure of the one-ton container and release of 2,000 pounds of chlorine to the atmosphere over a 10-minute duration, regardless of how improbable this may be.  The chlorine release rate to the atmosphere was defined to be 200 lbs./min. No passive mitigation systems were considered in determining the chlorine release rate to the atmosphere.\nEPA and CalARP regulations require that the models used for dispersion analysis should appropriately account for the density of the released gas.  Since the chlorine cloud formed during the worst-case release scenario would be denser-than-air, the Dense Gas Air Dispersion (DEGADIS 2.1) model was used for performing the air dispersion modeling analysis.\nEPA-mandated meteorological conditions, namely Stability F, wind speed of 1.5 m/sec, highest daily maximum temperature (1110F), and average humidity (63"

The results of the dispersion modeling analysis indicated that the worst-case scenario has offsite impacts. \nRMP and CalARP rules require that a scenario which results in offsite toxic endpoint distance and is more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario should be selected as the alternative release scenario, unless no such scenario exists.  Unlike the worst-case scenario, the alternative release scenario may consider \"active\" mitigation such as automatic shutoff valves, excess flow valves, and containment with scrubbers.  Active mitigation is defined as requiring mechanical, electrical, or human input.\nThe alternative release scenarios must consider the facility accident history and/or failure scenarios identified in the hazard review.  A review of the past five-year accident history data for the chlorination facility pursuant to these rules indicated that there were no chlorine releases, which could have resulted in offsite (outside the Encino Chlorination Station boundary) toxic endpoint distances. \nThe scenarios selected for the Encino Chlorination Station involves the release of chlorine gas from the pigtail connecting the ton containers to chlorination process.  This scenario can occur if the pigtail, which is worn or has a defect, cracks during the withdrawal of chlorine from the ton containers.  Once a leak develops and 10 ppm of chlorine reaches the chlorine detectors, the Halogen actuators will automatically close the gas valves on the ton containers, stopping the flow of chlorine from the containers.  The only chlorine that could leak from the hole would be the vapor in the line between the angle valve and the chlorinator. The length of this run of > inch piping is approximately 40 feet.  It is assumed that the crack developed in the piping (diameter 0.25 inch) corresponds to a hole of 0.0625-inch (1/16 inch) diameter.

It is assumed that approximately 60 minutes would be required for operators or an emergency response team to respond. One passive mitigation system considered was the chlorination building structure which houses the one ton containers. Two active mitigation systems considered were the actuation of a chlorine detector and the actuation of the Halogen shut-off valves installed on the valves on the ton containers.  Based on the calculated chlorine release rate of 0.47 lb/min (EPA, 1998b) and the release duration of 19 seconds, the total quantity of chlorine released inside the building was estimated at 0.15 lb for the alternative release scenario. \nThe alternative release scenario toxic endpoint was also estimated using the Dense Gas Air Dispersion (DEGADIS 2.1) model. The toxic endpoint for chlorine is 3ppm.  The results of the dispersion modeling analysis indicated that the alternative release scenario has offsite impacts.

Description of the work to be performed is included with the printed work order.  The water treatment supervisor is responsible for this task.  \nIn addition, the written maintenance procedure is provided in the General Operation and Maintenance Manual as follows: Preventive maintenance checklists are provided which summarize inspection, test, and maintenance schedules on a daily, weekly, monthly, biannual, annual, every 2 to 10 years, and as-needed basis.  These allow the operator to rapidly review what maintenance is necessary, and provide supervisors with a brief log of maintenance history at the chlorination station.  The schedules are supplemental to the log sheets on-site and provide a summary and quick reference to manufacturer's O&M manuals. \n DWP documents inspection, testing, and maintenance of chlorination equipment and assures the performance is done in accordance with the recommendations of the manufacturer and industry groups (i.e., Chlorine Institute).\n\nInternal Compliance Audits\n The DWP will certify every three years (or earlier) that compliance with Program 2 Prevention Program requirements are met and that procedures and practices developed are adequate and being followed.\nThe compliance audit will consist of separating the RMP program elements or sections, and auditing each element to determine compliance and effectiveness.  For each internal audit, the audit team will complete a Compliance Audit Certification Page and a Compliance Audit Checklist.  The Compliance Audit Certification Page provides process identification, the dates of the audit, team members, and certification by the audit leader and the Plant Manager.  The Compliance Audit Checklist details the requirements of each RMP element and contains questions"

The incident investigation shall be started promptly but no later than 48 hours after the event.  The DWP will promptly address and resolve all recommendations and shall implement the recommendations in a timely manner to prevent an incident recurrence.  All incident investigation reports will be retained on DWP file for at least a period of five years from the date the reports are completed.\n\nFive-year Accident History Summary\nNo chlorine releases that could have caused safety or health hazard (deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place) occurred at the Encino Chlorination Station during the last five years.\n\nEmergency Response Program Summary\nDWP is a first responder, its employees respond to chlorine accidental releases.  Depending on the severity of the accidental release, external resources such as the City of Los Angeles Fire Department may be solicited to aid in handling a chlorine release.  \nAs part of the emergency response program, the DWP has developed and implemented an emergency response plan for the purpose of protecting public health and the environment.
