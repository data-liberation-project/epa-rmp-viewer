There was a small leak from the plate and frame chiller which caused ammonia to be released into the water.  The chiller was isolated and pumped down.

The roof was checked and a leak was found coming from the liquid feed solenoid valve.  The smell was getting into the room through a conduit pipe that goes through the sealing to the shaker room.

      "SummaryText": "cific Ammonia Release Reporting Guidelines have been developed to ensure adequate preparedness and appropriate response to ammonia releases.  These guidelines describe outside agency notification procedures in the event of an ammonia release, evacuation procedures and response procedures for the mitigation of ammonia releases.  This is a non-responding facility thus external emergency response personnel will be called in to assist with any major releases or injuries.  All refrigeration personnel are trained in responding to ammonia releases.\r\n1.6.\tPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\nNumerous updates, modifications and improvements have been made and continue to be made to the ammonia refrigeration system to ensure its continued safe operation.

All documents were updated in the PSM/RMP binder.  Drawings, the ammonia limit and OCA calculations were again updated in 2014 as part of the 5 year certification.\r\n11\tThe follow-up on corrective actions are informally recorded in the PHA binder.
