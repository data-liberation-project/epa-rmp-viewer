      "SummaryText": "INTRODUCTION\n\nthe current active Risk Management Program (RMP) for the Zacate Creek Plant has proven successful for the reporting period of 2009 to 2014. Most of the program's mandated activities were implemented in accordance to schedules. The scheduled implemented program's activities have resulted in a positive understanding of the dangers associated with a chemical spill. The final results of this program exceeded expectations. The personnel increased safety awareness knowledge and their equipment safety component inspections techniques significantly played an important role in the results achieved. All personnel associated with this program have now a better understanding of the risk involved when working with hazardous chemicals. They are now better prepared to deal with any accidental chemical spill or gas released. In essence, we are pleased to report that only one minor chlorine (CL2)gas released incident was recorded during this reporting period. Although the release was insignificant and did not cause serious harm to anyone, it was used as an example to remind all personnel on the seriousness of a chemical release or spill. This only accidental spill, in a way, increased our employees' knowledge of the chemical dangers and their awareness on how to react. It was also used as an example in our continuous safety trainings and improved our safety equipment inspection techniques.\n\n\n\nThe Zacate Waste Water Treatment Plant (WWTP) falls under this regulation because of the onsite storage of chlorine.  The amount of chlorine stored exceeds the threshold limit specified by the USEPA, thereby making the facility subject to compliance with the regulation.  The WWTP personnel have complied with the USEPA Risk Management Program rule and have completed a RMP contains the following required information:\n\nA?    A management system (40 CFR Part 68 Subpart A);\n\nA?    A hazard assessment that establishes the worst-case and alternative release scenarios and their impacts on the p"

A prevention program that includes safety information, a hazard review, operating procedures, training, maintenance, compliance audits, and incident investigations (40 CFR Part 68 Subpart C); and\n\nA?    An emergency response plan (40 CFR Part 68 Subpart E).\n\nThe following subsections discuss details of the plan that has been implemented at the plant.\n\nRELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe plant has an excellent record in preventing and minimizing releases of chlorine.  The emergency response policies at this facility ensure that there will be emergency response coverage 24 hours per day, 7 days per week.  Adequate provisions have been implemented to coordinate response activities with outside agencies, such as the Laredo Fire Department HAZMAT team, in the event of an emergency.   In the event of a release, plant staff will contact the Laredo Fire Department.  \n\nREGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe plant uses chlorine as a disinfectant in the water treatment process.  \n\nPROCESS DESCRIPTION\n\nThe plant is located on the banks of the Rio Grande River.  Waste water is treated at the plant .  \n\nThe existing chlorine facilities at the WWTP consist of a storage area and process area.  One-ton chlorine containers are housed at the storage area.  The process area is indoors and is comprised of chlorine feed equipment, including chlorinators and rotameters as well as piping, miscellaneous valves, and vacuum regulators.  On treatment plant grounds, the potential to generate a release of chlorine gas exists at the storage areas as well as the process areas. \n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe plant performs consistent operation and maintenance of its chlorine equipment, utilizing only fully trained personnel.  The management ensures consistent operation by using disciplinary measures for operational deviations. \n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe accident history for the Zacate WWTP was reviewed for"

      "SummaryText": " the period from December 2004 through December 2009.  During this period of time, no accidental releases of chlorine occurred.  \n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nManagement of this facility has developed an Emergency Response Program in which plant employees will be trained in the initial response to a release.  The plant is staffed 24 hours per day, 7 days per week.  Plant operators are required to make rounds for inspection and monitoring of the plant processes at least once every two hours.  Once a leak is detected, the Laredo Fire Department HAZMAT Team will be contacted.  \n\nThe Emergency Response Plan includes: (1) procedures to follow in the event of a chlorine emergency, (2) information about the frequency of employee emergency  training, and (3) a detailed description of the emergency response training to be implemented.\n\nIn addition to providing back-up emergency responders and equipment, the Laredo Fire Department HAZMAT Team will assume Incident Command upon arrival at the plant. \n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nBased on the hazard review and prevention evaluation completed for chlorine, a list of action items was developed and is being considered by  management to implement, if feasible.  The most notable planned changes include the following: \n\nA?    Consider the need for an automatishutoffll switch.  This switch would be useful during an emergency when the chlorine supply has to be shutoff immediately.  A remote switch would eliminate the danger associated with plant personnel having to manually shutdown the chlorine system.  Emergency shutdown procedures should be developed and implemented in the training sessions.\n\nA?    When the plant facilities are expanded or upgraded in the futuremanagement will consider the design and construction of a containment building to isolate the storage areas from the process areas.  Additional consideration will be given to the capability to chemically neutralize any accidental releases of chlorine."
