Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nWe at Univar USA Inc. are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers process design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThis facility is located at 1804 N 20th Street, Nampa, Idaho.  The primary activity at this facility is warehousing of raw chemical products.  We have 2 Regulated Substances (RSs) as defined by the federal Envioronmental Protection Agency (EPA) present at this facility.  These RSs are Hydrochloric Acid (Hydrogen chloride) and Ammonia (Aqueous).  All substances are warehoused for the purpose of resale.\n\nThe maximum inventory of Hydrochloric acid (Hydrogen chloride) at our facility is 533.00 lbs. while Ammonia (aqueous) is present at our facility in a maximum quantity of 1,826.00 lbs. \n\n\n3.    The Worst-Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), \nincluding administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\n\nTo evaluate the worst-case scenarios, we have used the EPA?s RMP*Comp?.  For alternative release scenario analyses we have employed the EPA?s OCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equations.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from warehousing.  In this scenario, 410 lbs. of Aqua Ammonia (conc. 20% or greater) is released.  The toxic liquid released is assumed to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to evaporate over 60 minutes.  Th"

At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s wind speed, the maximum distance of 0.2 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.030 mg/L.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Ammonia (conc. 20% or greater) involves a release from warehousing.  The scenario involves the release of 410 lbs.  The toxic liquid is assumed to be released to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated after 60 minutes.  Passive mitigation controls, such as enclosure(s), are taken into account to calculate the scenario, having the effect of a 5% reduction.  The release is also assumed to be mitigated by neutralization.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L of Ammonia (conc. 20% or greater) is 0.01miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Hydrochloric Acid (conc. 37% or greater) involves a release from warehousing.  The scenario involves the release of 533 lbs.  The toxic liquid is assumed to be released to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated after 10 minutes.  Passive mitigation controls, such as enclosure(s), are taken into account to calculate the scenario, having the effect of a 5% reduction.

The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific\nPrevention Steps\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1967 Edition.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the rele"

The methodology used to carry out these analyses is the ?What If? scenario.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of 5 years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  The most recent PHA update was performed on 05/21/2009.\n\nOperating Procedures:\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Univar USA Inc. maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining:\nUnivar USA Inc. has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is conducted on an on-going basis.\n\nMechanical Integrity:\nUnivar USA Inc. carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operation.

The most recent review/revision of maintenance procedures was performed on May 21, 2009.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews:\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at Univar USA Inc.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nIncident Investigation:\nUnivar USA Inc. promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation:\nUnivar USA Inc. truly believes that Risk Management, Process Safety Management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility?s implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses in particular.\n\nContractors:\nOn occasion, our company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.

Due to our stringent release prevention policies, there have been no RMP regulated substances released above the threshold quantities in the past 5 years at this facility.\n\n\n6.    Emergency Contingency Plan\n\nUnivar USA Inc. carries a written Emergency Contingency Plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The Plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first-aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  In addition, the Plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent process changes that would require a modified emergency response.\n\n\n7.    Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSeveral developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program.  Additional training for spill response and personal protective equipment are some of the major steps we want to take to improve safety at our facility.  These changes are expected to be implemented by September 2009."
