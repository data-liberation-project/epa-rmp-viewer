Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Chempak Industries / Hi-lex Corporation are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, our highly trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  We are also completely coordinated with the Denver Fire Department (Hazard Materials Department) which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Chlorine rail-car transfer.  We have 1 regulated substance present at our facility.  This substance is Chlorine.  The regulated substance at our facility is involved in one use.  Chlorine is used in the bleach process as an ingredient in the facility's product.                                         .\n\nThe maximum inventory of Chlorine at our facility is 360000.00 lb..\n\n3.    The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equations.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from Chlorine railcar transfer.  The scenario involves the release of 360000 l"

At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 2.4 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L.\n\nOne alternative release scenario for Chlorine involves a release from Chlorine railcar transfer.  The scenario involves the release of 1000 lb. of chlorine.  Toxic liquid is assumed to be released to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated after 10 minutes.  The release is also assumed to be controlled by emergency shutdown systems.  These active mitigation systems have the effect of controling any potential releases.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L of Chlorine is 0.2 miles.\n\nAnother alternative release scenario for Chlorine involves a release from Chlorine railcar transfer.  The scenario involves the release of 100.0 lb. of chlorine.  Toxic liquid is assumed to be released to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated after 10.0 minutes.  The release is also assumed to be controlled by emergency shutdown systems.  These active mitigation systems have the effect of controling any potential releases.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L of Chlorine is 0.1 miles.\n\n4.    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1967 Edition.    The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nChempak Industries / Hi-lex Corporation maintains a detailed record o"

The methodology used to carry out these analyses is the 'What-if' method.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of 5 years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  The most recent PHA/update was performed on 06/17/1999.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Chempak Industries / Hi-lex Corporation maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nChempak Industries / Hi-lex Corporation has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every 3 years and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nChempak Industries / Hi-lex Corporation carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized tra"

The most recent review/revision of maintenance procedures was performed on 05/05/1999.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at Chempak Industries / Hi-lex Corporation.  The most recent review was performed on 06/17/1999.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nChempak Industries / Hi-lex Corporation conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  The most recent comliance audit was conducted on06/17/1999.  These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\nChempak Industries / Hi-lex Corporation promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation\nChempak Industries / Hi-lex Corporation truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.

The majority of the Chlorine transfer system has been replaced including valves, pumps, and mixing tanks; the railcar has been re-located to be situated closer to the facility to reduce the distance the chlorine must travel before entering the process; and the installation of additional safety controls, such as a second emergency shut-off valve, nitrogen sparging system, remote shut-off controls and a barametric loop are some of the major steps we have taken to improve safety at our facility.  These changes have been implemented within the last year.\n"
