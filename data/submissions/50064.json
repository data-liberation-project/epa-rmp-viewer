This process is subject to regulation under OSHA process safety management and the requirement of this regulation has been met. The Risk Management Programs includes Prevention Programs for: Employee Participation, Process Safety Information, PHA, Operating Procedures, Contractor Program, Pre Startup safety review, Mechanical Integrity, Hot Work Program, Management of Change, Incident Investigation, Compliance Audits, and Emergency Planning and Response. The employee participation program details who and why employees are to participate in the element of the prevention process. The Process Safety information includes MSDS, maximun intended inventory, safe upper and lower parameters, equipment specs, and standards used to design, build and operate the process. The Process Hazard Analysis Program identifies hazards associated with the regulated substance, possible opportunities for equipment malfunction, humane error and steps to detect or monitor releases. The Operating Procedures Program includes procedures currently utilized by plant personnel for startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency operations, emergency shutdown, normal shutdown and startup following abnormal or emergency shut down. All employees must complete an annual chlorine safety course conducted by a quailified person. The Mechanical Intergrity Programs includes preventative maintenance activities, inspection, testing and evaluation. Additionally it ensures good engineering practices are followed. All maintenance employees are fully trained on the process. A Management of Change Program ensures that any process technology or equipment change is reviewed prior to implementation. There is an Incident Investigation Program in place. There have been no incidents involving the concerned chemical at the facilirty. In-house compliance audits are performed as well as Corporate audits. Alarms are in place with and the plant is staffed 24 hours a day.",

      "SummaryText": "Veolia Water North America operates the H.C. Morgan Poluution Control Treatment plant for the City of Auburn, (owner). The facility is an activated sludge/ extended aeration sanitary wastewater treatment operation that is located on the southwest side of the city at 616 Sandhill Road. The site is approximantely 40 acres located in an urban setting. The site is approximantely 450 feet above sea level and the natural flow of surface water appears to be to the South towards Parkinson Mill Creek, a tributary of Chewalca Creek. The facility treats the majority percentage of the Sanitary wastewater for the City. The site is regulated under the State of Alabama NPDES permit #AL0050237. The process utilizes both mechanical and biological treatment to remove organics from the wastewater prior to returning the treated water to the environment. Part of the process uses chlorine gas in contact with the treated water for disinfection. The chlorine gas is stored and is placed into service in a chlorine contact building which is isolated from the remainder of the plant. Operators are thoroughly trained in the handling of the chlorine. A review of the process indicates that the worst case scenario is the release of a one ton cylinder that is being placed in service, plus a small amount of a second cylinder that is in service. The release would allow gaseous chlorine to migrate off the plant site to the south-southwest. The enevolpe of expansion would be some 1.1 miles. The most likely alternative scenario is the release of a partically full cylinder, with the same flow pattern and traveling about 773 yards in the same general direction. In either case, the emergency response would involve activation of the local Emergency Response Program. The site has a Process Safety Management Program in place that includes the following elements; Hazard Review, Operating Procedures, Trainig, Maintenance, Incident Investigation, Compliance Audits, Management of Change, Pre Startup Safety Review,"
