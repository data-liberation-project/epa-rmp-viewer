Epidemics of typhoid, cholera, dysentery and other water-borne diseases occurred.  After chlorine's introduction into public water supplies, deaths from typhoid in the U.S. dropped dramatically from 25,000 in 1900 to less than 20 in 1960.  Water-borne disease is even still a leading cause of infant mortality in many countries throughout Asia, Africa and Latin America where infant mortality rates are 10 to 20 times greater than in the U.S.  In the U.S., however, water-borne disease has been virtually eliminated due to an effective public health strategy of utilizing chlorine for drinking water disinfection.  Chlorine disinfection is arguably one of the greatest achievements for public health worldwide in the last hundred years and is credited with increasing the life expectancy of Americans by more than 50 percent.  \n\nThe use of chlorine is not risk free, however.  Historically it is clear that utilities have recognized the risks and have been successful in developing procedures to handle chlorine safely and to protect the off-site public and the environment from potential accidental releases.\n\nAs an added layer of protection, the United States Environmental Protection Agency promulgated Hazardous Chemical Risk Management Program regulations to further ensure that facility owners understand the risks and take proactive efforts to reduce risk through comprehensive training programs, procedures, and risk mitigation measures.  Additionally, EPA wanted the public to be informed regarding these issues.\n\nCooper City Utilities has always understood these risks and has maintained a well-trained staff and a safely operated and maintained facility.  Cooper City Utilities' track record is exemplary with respect to handling hazardous chemicals.  Furthermore, Cooper City Utilities has taken a compr"

Cooper City Utilities' mission is to protect public health by providing our community with  safe drinking water, free of harmful pathogens.  Approximately 300 pounds per day of chlorine gas is used to disinfect the water and make it safe for human consumption.  A maximum of 16,000 pounds of chlorine are stored on-site.  The chlorine is stored as a gas that is liquified under pressure in containers that contain 2,000 pounds each.\n\n\n\n\nChlorine Process and Safety Equipment\n\nThe chlorine system is a vacuum regulated system with an automotic shut-down mechanism when a loss of vacuum occurs.  The system is divided into two separate banks of chlorine containers; one for the water plant and one for the wastewater plant.  An automatic switchover system from an empty container to a full container is built into the vacuum regulator.  The entire chlorine system is housed in a separate building designed specifically for this purpose.  Approximately 16,000 pounds of chlorine are kept in the building at any time.  Within the building, an alarm system and a sodium hydroxide scrubber has been installed.  At the first indication of any chlorine release within the building, the alarm system is activated.   An external visual and audible alarm is sounded at the same time the scrubber is activated and the building is sealed.\n\nRick Management and Process Safety Management Program Overview\n\nChlorine is subject to the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation which can be found in 40 CFR 68 and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) Process Safety Management Program (PSMP) regulation which can be found in 29 CFR 1910.119.\n\nThe primary components of the RMP are as follows:\n\n' A five-year accident history\n\n' An off-site con"

The Plan is a summary of the facility's Risk Management Program.  The RMP will be updated every five years, or whenever a process changes or a new process is added.  The OSHA PSM regulation has basically the same requirements as the prevention program element of the EPA RMP.  The Cooper City Utilities West Treatment Facility (CCUWTF) RMP meets the requirements of both regulations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following sections briefly summarize the elements of the CCUWTF's RMP:\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nThe CCUWTF has used chlorine to disinfect water for twenty-nine years.  There has never been an accidental release of chlorine at this facility which resulted in the damage of property or personal injury during the operation of this facility.\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario\n\nThe worst case release scenario for a toxic gas has been defined by the EPA to be an accidental release in which the largest on-site vessel containing chlorine releases its contents as a gas over ten minutes.  Since the largest container stored at the facility holds 2,000 pounds of chlorine, the worst case release scenario is a release of 2,000 pounds of chlorine over 10 minutes.  This scenario was modeled using RMP*Comp software to estimate the distance to an endpoint of 3ppm.  It should be noted that this concentration has been found to typically cause minor eye and nose irritation.  This scenario resulted in a distance to endpoint of .9 miles.\n\nThe mitigation measure is the chlorine building which houses the chlorine containers.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario\n\n"

The RMP regulation allows the owner to define the alternative release scenario based on historical experience or  operations staff knowledge of their system.  The alternative release scenario for the facility  assumes that the pig tail disconnects from the chlorine container.  This scenario was modeled using RMP*Comp software to estimate the distance to an endpoint of 3 ppm.  It should be noted that this concentration has been found to typically cause minor eye and nose irritation.  This scenario resulted in a distance to endpoint of .1 miles.\n\nThe mitigation measure is the chlorine building which houses the chlorine containers.\n\nPrevention Program\n\nThere are always inherent risks associated with handling and using chlorine.  These risks include the potential inhalation of chlorine gas if it is accidentally released.  The prevention program is a key component to reducing the risk associated with a potential chlorine gas release.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey elements of the prevention program include:\n\n' Employee participation\n' Process safety information\n' Process hazard analysis\n' Incident investigation\n' Standard operating procedures\n' Mechanical integrity\n' Management of change\n' Pre-startup review\n' Training\n' Contracts\n' Compliance audits\n' Hot work permits\n' Trade secrets\n\nThe following briefly states the benefits of the following prevention program elements:  standard operating procedures, mechanical integrity program, employee training and the process hazard analysis.\n\nThe facility staff has developed up-to-date and accurate written standard operating procedures (SOP's) to ensure that operators have clear instructions for safe operation of the chlorine system.

The CCUWTF mechanical integrity program includes maintenance, inspection and testing procedures and schedules along with maintenance personnel training.  \n\nKnowledgeable well-trained personnel are essential to preventing and mitigating the effects of accidental chemical releases.  The CCUWTF training program ensures that personnel working on or near the chlorine system are adequately trained in operation and maintenance procedures and the appropriate response actions to an accidental chlorine release.  The process hazard analysis is a valuable risk reduction tool that outlines deficiencies in equipment and procedures, identifies potential system failure modes, and provides recommendations for system and operational improvements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nA comprehensive emergency response program has been prepared which outlines the procedures and lines of communication that are necessary to effectively respond to and mitigate a potential chlorine gas release.\n\nIn the event of a chlorine gas release, a detector located in the storage area, will detect the presence of chlorine gas.

Chlorine disinfection is arguably one of the greatest achievements for public health worldwide in the last hundred years and is credited with increasing the life expectancy of Americans by more than 50 percent.  \n\nThe use of chlorine is not risk free, however.  Historically it is clear that utilities have recognized the risks and have been successful in developing procedures to handle chlorine safely and to protect the off-site public and the environment from potential accidental releases.\n\nAs an added layer of protection, the United States Environmental Protection Agency promulgated Hazardous Chemical Risk Management Program regulations to further ensure that facility owners understand the risks and take proactive efforts to reduce risk through comprehensive training programs, procedures, and risk mitigation measures.  Additionally, EPA wanted the public to be informed regarding these issues.\n\nCooper City Utilities has always understood these risks and has maintained a well-trained staff and a safely operated and maintained facility.  Cooper City Utilities' track record is exemplary with respect to handling hazardous chemicals.  Furthermore, Cooper City Utiliti"

Cooper City Utilities' mission is to protect public health by providing our community with  safe drinking water, free of harmful pathogens.  Approximately 300 pounds per day of chlorine gas is used to disinfect the water and make it safe for human consumption.  A maximum of 16,000 pounds of chlorine are stored on-site.  The chlorine is stored as a gas that is liquified under pressure in containers that contain 2,000 pounds each.\n\n\n\n\nChlorine Process and Safety Equipment\n\nThe chlorine system is a vacuum regulated system with an automotic shut-down mechanism when a loss of vacuum occurs.  The system is divided into two separate banks of chlorine containers; one for the water plant and one for the wastewater plant.  An automatic switchover system from an empty container to a full container is built into the vacuum regulator.  The entire chlorine system is housed in a separate building designed specifically for this purpose.  Approximately 16,000 pounds of chlorine are kept in the building at any time.  Within the building, an alarm system and a sodium hydroxide scrubber has been installed.  At the first indication of any chlorine release within the building, the alarm system is activated.   An external visual and audible alarm is sounded at the same time the scrubber is activated and the building is sealed.\n\nRick Management and Process Safety Management Program Overview\n\nChlorine is subject to the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation which can be found in 40 CFR 68 and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) Process Safety Management Program (PSMP) regulation which can be found in 29 CFR 1910.119.\n\nThe primary components of the RMP are as follows:\n\n' A five-year accident histor"

The Plan is a summary of the facility's Risk Management Program.  The RMP will be updated every five years, or whenever a process changes or a new process is added.  The OSHA PSM regulation has basically the same requirements as the prevention program element of the EPA RMP.  The Cooper City Utilities West Treatment Facility (CCUWTF) RMP meets the requirements of both regulations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following sections briefly summarize the elements of the CCUWTF's RMP:\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nThe CCUWTF has used chlorine to disinfect water for twenty-nine years.  There has never been an accidental release of chlorine at this facility which resulted in the damage of property or personal injury during the operation of this facility.\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario\n\nThe worst case release scenario for a toxic gas has been defined by the EPA to be an accidental release in which the largest on-site vessel containing chlorine releases its contents as a gas over ten minutes.  Since the largest container stored at the facility holds 2,000 pounds of chlorine, the worst case release scenario is a release of 2,000 pounds of chlorine over 10 minutes.  This scenario was modeled using RMP*Comp software to estimate the distance to an endpoint of 3ppm.  It should be noted that this concentration has been found to typically cause minor eye and nose irritation.  This scenario resulted in a distance to endpoint of .9 miles.\n\nThe mitigation measure is the chlorine building which houses the chlorine containers.\n\nAlternativ"

The RMP regulation allows the owner to define the alternative release scenario based on historical experience or  operations staff knowledge of their system.  The alternative release scenario for the facility  assumes that the pig tail disconnects from the chlorine container.  This scenario was modeled using RMP*Comp software to estimate the distance to an endpoint of 3 ppm.  It should be noted that this concentration has been found to typically cause minor eye and nose irritation.  This scenario resulted in a distance to endpoint of .1 miles.\n\nThe mitigation measure is the chlorine building which houses the chlorine containers.\n\nPrevention Program\n\nThere are always inherent risks associated with handling and using chlorine.  These risks include the potential inhalation of chlorine gas if it is accidentally released.  The prevention program is a key component to reducing the risk associated with a potential chlorine gas release.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey elements of the prevention program include:\n\n' Employee participation\n' Process safety information\n' Process hazard analysis\n' Incident investigation\n' Standard operating procedures\n' Mechanical integrity\n' Management of change\n' Pre-startup review\n' Training\n' Contracts\n' Compliance audits\n' Hot work permits\n' Trade secrets\n\nThe following briefly states the benefits of the following prevention program elements:  standard operating procedures, mechanical integrity program, employee training and the process hazard analysis.\n\nThe facility staff has developed up-to-date and accurate written standard operating procedures (SOP's) to ensure that operators have clear instructions for safe operation of the chlorine system.  Effective SOP's, when combined with operator training, are instrumental in ensuring safe operation of the system and in preventing accidental releases.\n\nThe purpose of the mechanical integrity program is to ensure the continue"

An effective mechanical integrity program is integral to preventing accidental chlorine releases that may result from mechanical failure of improperly maintained equipment.  The CCUWTF mechanical integrity program includes maintenance, inspection and testing procedures and schedules along with maintenance personnel training.  \n\nKnowledgeable well-trained personnel are essential to preventing and mitigating the effects of accidental chemical releases.  The CCUWTF training program ensures that personnel working on or near the chlorine system are adequately trained in operation and maintenance procedures and the appropriate response actions to an accidental chlorine release.  The process hazard analysis is a valuable risk reduction tool that outlines deficiencies in equipment and procedures, identifies potential system failure modes, and provides recommendations for system and operational improvements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nA comprehensive emergency response program has been prepared which outlines the procedures and lines of communication that are necessary to effectively respond to and mitigate a potential chlorine gas release.\n\nIn the event of a chlorine gas release, a detector located in the storage area, will detect the presence of chlorine gas.  The detector will activate audible and visual alarms throughout the facility to give warning to plant staff.
