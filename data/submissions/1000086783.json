      "SummaryText": "EPA RMP Executive Summary\r\n\r\nNorthstar is a 5-acre artificial island located approximately 6 miles northwest of Prudhoe Bay in Alaska's Beaufort Sea.  Northstar is a self-contained installation, which includes oil processing facilities, utilities, a warehouse, a medical facility, a cafeteria, and worker living accommodations which can house up to 54 employees and contractors.  A typical operating and support crew at Northstar consists of about 26 employees and contractors.\r\nOil and gas liquids are transported from production wells on Northstar where oil, water and gas are separated.  Sales oil is then shipped down a 17-mile pipeline that ties in with the Northstar oil sales pipeline and then on to Pump Station 1 where it enters the Trans-Alaska Pipeline. \r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies \r\n\r\nThe Northstar Emergency Action Plan (EAP) covers responses for situations in which there is probable loss of life, extensive injuries, environmental damage, or significant business interruption to normal operations.  The emergency procedures comply with OSHA regulation 29 CFR 1910.38 (Emergency Action Plans), 29 CFR 1910.120 (HAZWOPER) and apply to all contractors and visitors.  This plan includes information on alarms, evacuation plans, safe briefing areas, containment, control, cleanup and emergency notification procedures. \r\nAs described in the EAP facility employees undergo a variety of training to prepare for emergency situation.  These include evacuation drills, total island evacuation drills, response team joint training exercises, rescue training, personal protective equipment training, and Incident Command System training.\r\n\r\nRegulated Substance\r\n\r\nPropane (CAS No. 74-98-6), which Northstar will now have for the first time, will be used in their new closed loop Propane Refrigeration System, is on the list of regulated flammable substances (40 CFR \u00a768.130).  Liquid propane is being purchased commercially and will be trucked to Northstar vi"

This vessel will be located outside in a conex box, on the east side of the main process module.  The worst case release scenario analyzed for propane identified that no public receptors (e.g., offsite residences, institutions, industrial, commercial, etc.) would be impacted.\r\n\r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program - Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nNorthstar has 7 multi-jurisdictional wells that extend into the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) and therefore has been subject to the Safety and Environmental Management System (SEMS) rule (30 CFR \u00a7250 Subpart S).  Northstar has a written SEMS program in place that encompasses all oil and gas related activities on the island.  \r\n\r\nSince Northstar will have more than 10,000 pounds of propane in their new Propane Refrigeration System.  That system will, until further notice, also be subject to OSHA PSM (29 CFR \u00a71910.119). \r\n\r\nNorthstar facility utilizes various safety control and detection alarm systems designed to warn of abnormal conditions that could result in injury to personnel, property damage, or damage to the environment.  A red gas strobe light visual alarm signals a problem with the propane system in the compressor and propane receiver modules.  These detection systems are tested on a set maintenance schedule to assure their operation. \r\n\r\nA Process Hazard Analyses (PHA) of the Propane Refrigeration System at the facility will be conducted at least every 5-years.  When changes to the propane system are made, a Management of Change (MOC) process is followed.  This process is designed to identify potential hazards being introduced by a change, and, to allow all necessary personnel to be informed of and trained on the change.  Process and management system improvements are implemented based on PHAs, periodic audits, and MOC findings. \r\n\r\nFive Year Accident History\r\n\r\nNorthstar Island's propane sy"

      "SummaryText": "stem has not had a reportable accident or incident with offsite consequences in the previous 5 years or since Hilcorp has owned/operated the facility.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\n\r\nNorthstar has its own professionally-trained fire department which responds and serves as the local fire department.  There is no other agency/jurisdiction providing emergency response at Northstar.  In the event additional emergency response support was required mutual aid would be provided by fire departments from other nearby North-Slope Alaska oil fields.  Mutual aid drills are conducted annually.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the volunteers in the fire department, Northstar trains employees for other spill response roles including Operation Level First Responders and Specialized Employees (Operators).\r\n\r\nOperations Level First Responders are trained to respond to an emergency in a defensive manner without actually trying to stop the release.  Their function is to contain the release from a safe distance, keep it from spreading, and prevent exposures.\r\n\r\nSpecialized Employees (Operators) are personnel who are qualified to operate the facility/well pads during routine day-to-day activities.  Their duties are to identify the nature, location and scope of the emergency as well as performing source control.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nPlanned changes to improve safety at Northstar include using PHA recommendations to improve the integrity of the process as well as implementation of a new management of change tool to support improvement of the management of change system."
