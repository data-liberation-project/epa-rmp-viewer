      "SummaryText": "The accidental release prevention and emergency response policy in place at our facility is:  Ayrshire complies with requirements for anhydrous ammonia storage and it is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state and local laws.  If an emergency were to occur, signs are posted that refer to Ken Nading who is employed by West Bend Elevator.  Ken will then decide what steps need to be taken in the event of an emergency.  Ayrshire is a wholesale business providing products for the production of grain and livestock enterprises.  Our worst case scenario is failure of one of our anhydrous ammonia storage tanks when filled to the greatest amount allowed which is 68,850 pounds.  This would cause the anhydrous to become liquefied under pressure.  If this were to occur the release rate would be 6890 pounds per minute and the duration of the release would be approximately 10 minutes.   According to EPA look-up tables, the distance to the endpoint is 3.1 miles.  Ayrshire has 1 bullet tank and 17 nurse tanks on their location.  There are an estimated 349 individuals within this radius.  Our alternative case scenario is a transfer hose failure.  This hose failure would result in a quantity release of 5,954 pounds of anhydrous each minute for a period of 2 minutes.  According to EPA lookup tables the distance to the toxic endpoint is .5 miles.  Within the radius of either scenario are residences, recreation areas and major commercial, office, or industrial areas are also within the radius.  It is this facility's intention to comply with EPA's accident prevention rules and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.  West Bend Elevator Company holds training sessions regularly to train new employees and review procedures with other employees followed by an exam.  Hoses, valves, and vents are inspected on a regular basis for any problems.  Receiving ports include one-way valves to protect from product discharged during receiving.  Also within the past year we ha"

      "SummaryText": "ve installed steel barricades 8 feet apart around the perimeter of the bullet tanks.  These steel barricades are sunk to a depth of 4 feet below ground level and cemented for strength.  These steel barricades protrude 3 1/2 feet above ground level.  This should minimize vehicle contract with bullet tanks at the storage facility.  The bullet tanks are locked when the plant facility is closed to deter vandalism or accidental discharge of ammonia at the plant.  The anhydrous ammonia plant was designed, installed, and is maintained with regulations and state laws in mind.   We have never had an accident involving NH3 that caused death, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations or shelterings in the past 5 years.  In the event of an emergency involving our NH3 system, it is our policy to notify the Ayrshire Fire Dept and request that they respond to the emergency.  We have discussed this policy with the Palo Alto County Disaster Coordinator and Ayrshire Fire Dept Chief and members.  The Ayrshire Fire Dept has inspected our NH3 facility.  We have no plans at this time to improve or change our plans accept as follows.  We are currently investigating the use of locking devices on nurse wagons to prevent the theft of ammonia for meth labs.  We review our plans annually or sooner if necessary."
