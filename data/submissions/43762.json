As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible. To accomplish this, elements have been organized in a way that is consistent with the corporate organization, how frequently different elements are accessed, and who needs to refer to the program.  The order of elements within this organization is not the same as they are listed in the regulations, and in some cases portions of elements may be found in more than one location. \n  \n1. THE  BALLANTINE PRODUCE, RISK & PROCESS SAFETY MANAGEMENT PROGRAM\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that Ballantine Produce has updated their unified Risk & Process Safety Management Program.  The program is in compliance with California?s Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program (in California CCR Title 19, Chapter 4.5 Program Level 3 Elements.  At the Federal level, Title"

This program has been prepared to address the risks involved with the presence of anhydrous ammonia in an amount in excess of 10,000 lbs., which is contained in our refrigeration system. \n\nOur program promotes overall plant, worker, and public safety. The program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of anhydrous ammonia. Overall, the program is designed to prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.\n\nOur company has an exemplary safety record, one that we are quite proud of. Our company has many policies and procedures in place to promote overall plant, worker and public safety.  We have: (1) prepared a unified program based on the PSM plan to meet CalARP obligations as well; (2) reorganized the program so that it meshes more closely with general Ballantine Produce business practices; and (3) reviewed plan documentation forms and responsibilities.  The unified Risk & Process Safety Management Plan sets forth rules, procedures and practices that will help our employees protect themselves and our neighbors.\n\n2. DESCRIPTION OF AMMONIA SYSTEM\nThe Ballantine Produce Plant #2 facility is a commercial cold storage facility for tree fruit and citrus.  The facility has an ammonia system that provides refrigeration capacity to multiple cold rooms equipped with forced air tunnels for cooling fruit.  Four rooms are designated as ?precooling? rooms, while ten others are cold storage rooms.  Both kinds of rooms are equipped with ?bunker style? evaporator coils that contain chilled liquid ammonia.  There are cooled loading dock and hall areas as well.  A computer system provides substantial "

From there, high pressure liquid is piped to each cold room or refrigerated zone, where it passes through an expansion valve into a low pressure accumulator vessel mounted on the roof.  Low temperature liquid circulates by thermal convection through the evaporator coils located behind bunker walls in the cold rooms.  Low pressure and temperature gas collects in the accumulator vessel, and passes through a pressure regulator into a suction line.  The suction line returns the vapor to the primary accumulator vessel located in the engine room, which separates any residual liquid from the gas.  The gas is piped to refrigeration compressors which elevate the temperature and pressure of the gas.  The high pressure discharge from the compressors is sent to water cooled evaporative condensers where the high pressure gas ammonia is liquified and returned to the high pressure receivers. Liquid separated from the suction return gas in the primary accumulator vessels drains into liquid transfer vessels.  Operation of a float switch activated solenoid valve raises the pressure in the liquid transfer vessel to the point the liquid can be drained into the high pressure receiver.   \n\nThe facility was built by professional refrigeration engineers in accordance with industry standards at the time.  It was also built in compliance with the Uniform Mechanical Code and Uniform Building Code applicable at the time of construction. The system contains numerous safety devices including sensors which stop the compressors if temperatures or pressures exceed or drop below established limits, and safety relief valves which vent ammonia gas to a water diffusion tank if the pressure in the system exceeds their set point.  In addition, ammonia detectors are located throughout the facility, and will shut down equipment if ammonia is detected.  Lastly, an emerg"

Therefore, the facility is treated as a single process.\n\n3. GENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE & AMMONIA SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\nThe ammonia refrigeration systems at the  Ballantine Produce facility are an integral part of the overall business.   The system contains a total charge of approximately 20,987 lbs. It is extremely important that it is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner.  Management is committed to making sure that all employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.\n\nOur refrigeration personnel monitor the ammonia refrigeration system/process and keep an active journal of all procedures and transactions that pertain to ammonia.  In addition, the system/process is checked frequently by one of our outside refrigeration contractors. \n\nWe inform our employees of the dangers of an accidental release of ammonia in monthly safety meetings.  New employees are made aware of the potential risk of ammonia in an employee orientation meeting.  During these meetings we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\n\n4. FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nBallantine Produce has not had any reportable accidents within the last five years.\n\n5. EMERGENCY ACTION PLAN\nThis facility?s emergency response program is based on the Cal/OSHA requirements for Emergency Action Plans (in California CCR Title 8, Section 3220, ?Emergency Action Plans.?  Federally, Title 29 CFR 1910.38 and 1910.119), HAZWOPER (standard (in California CCR Title 8, Section 5192, ?Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response,? and Title 29 CFR 1910.120). \n\nStrategically, we will respond defensively to a release.

      "SummaryText": "plan our ammonia refrigeration personnel will take whatever steps are necessary to bring a release under control. The first priority will be to operate the ammonia system to bring a release under control safely, from a distance, without donning personal protective equipment. To better prepare for this type of action, initial training to the defensive level (First Responder, Operations Level) as defined in the HAZWOPER regulations will take place within the next year. All response activities would be done in coordination with the local fire department and the Fresno Fire Dept. Hazardous Materials Response Team.\n\nEvery year at the beginning of the season we review with our employees our evacuation procedures in the event of an emergency, including an ammonia release. \n\n6. PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nOur company has an outstanding safety record, one that we are quite proud of.  Many policies and procedures have been implemented to promote overall plant, worker and public safety.  Nevertheless, Ballantine Produce continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.  Preparation of this Risk & Process Safety Management Program has been the primary recent improvement, and implementation of the program is our plan for improved safety in the near future.\n\nThe Risk & Process Safety Management Program has been written so that program elements are aligned with Ballantine Produce business practices rather than the order presented in the law.  Thus, Safe Operating Procedures are grouped together for the benefit of our system operator.  Safe Operating Policies are grouped together so that appropriate office staff may administer them.  The Emergency Action Plan is now separated out and distributed widely through the plant for easy reference.  \n\nThe Risk & Process Safety Management Program documentation forms and company policy forms pertaining to employee, contractor, and community safety have been carefully reviewed so as to prevent unnecessary complexity and redu"

It is an interactive framework that guides safe action for Ballantine Produce employees, but allows for feedback and continual improvement.  Through the Risk & Process Safety Management Program Ballantine Produce will continue to profit while maintaining overall plant, worker and public safety."
