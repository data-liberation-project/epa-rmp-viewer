ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES.\nAt this George's facility, we utilize \"Anhydrous Ammonia\" that is considered hazardous by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The properties that make ammonia valuable as a refrigerant also necessitate certain safety precautions.\nGeorge's strives to protect all surrounding personnel, property, nearby members of our community, existing natural resources, and the surrounding environment.\nIt is our goal to minimize the potential for releases and comply with all Federal, State and local regulations. This is accomplished through ongoing training of personnel and continuous improvements to our refrigeration system and compliance program.  \nOur emergency response program has specific procedures for responding to fire, severe weather and accidental releases of hazardous chemicals. We work local emergency response entities and the Barry-Lawrence County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) to prepare for necessary responses and notification of all affected neighbors.\n\n2. THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED.\nThe purpose of our facility is to process poultry for use as refrigerated or frozen food. Anhydrous Ammonia is the refrigerant used for bulk cooling and freezing. Our normal inventory of anhydrous ammonia for refrigeration operations meets the PSM/RMP threshold, thus we maintain PSM/RMP Programs for safety and compliance.\nAccess to the site and refrigeration system are restricted for security purposes. Only authorized contractors or employees with proper training and clearance may work on or near the refrigeration system.\n\n3. FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nIn the last five years this facility has had no reportable releases.\n\n4. THE RMP MANAGEMENT PROGRAM\nFacility management holds overall responsibility of the RMP Program.
