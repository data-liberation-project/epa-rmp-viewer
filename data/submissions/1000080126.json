SGL Technic, Inc. is committed to safeguard the public and its employees as it has developed the expertise, experiences, judgment and proactive initiative with its workforce to properly implement and maintain an effective safety management program as envisioned in the OSHA PSM standard.  The program was designed to manage and implement process safety at the Valencia carbon and graphite product manufacturing facility.  Over the last five years the facility did not have any reportable accidental release.  The PSM program, Emergency Response Plan, HAZWOPER training program and the process design all contribute to prevent and mitigate the release of hazardous chemicals.  In addition, these programs and measures are regularly evaluated and improved to assure their effectiveness at every level."
