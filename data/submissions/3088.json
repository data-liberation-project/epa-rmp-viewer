Since PHAST does not allow input of this case directly , one relief valve was modeled and the orifice and tailpipe size were adjusted to simulate two relief valves lifting \n\n  - The vesel is 80% full ( 80,000 gal) .

The hydrogen is pass through a high pressure purification step from which it is transfer directly  to clients by way of a pipeline .\n\nRegulated Substance Handled at the site :\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia is used in two areas of the site :\n\n1) Ammonia is used as a refrigerent in the CO2 Liquefaction process to convert CO2 from the gas to the liquid state. The refrigerent package is a close loop system that contains approximately 4500 lbs of Amonnia at any one time .\n\n2) Ammonia is also used on our site as a reducing agent to reduce the amount of  nitrogen oxides emmisions from our process flue gas . The site uses a Selective Catalytic Reduction system design specific to reduce oxides of nitrogen from exhaust gases . \n\nAuxiliary equipment supporting the Selective Catalytic System includes a 10,000 gallon Ammonia storage tank , Diluge system for the tank , collection system for spills , welded transfer pipe to the Selective Catalytic Reduction system SCR , a NOx control system pannel . \n\nThe system makes use of anhydrous ammonia diluted to approximately five percent concentration with abient air .The ammonia is injected upstream of the catalyst face and mixed with the exhust gas .
