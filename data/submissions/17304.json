If an emerency involving anhydrous ammonia were to occur, it is the policy to notify the Sandy Springs Fire Department if outside assistance is necessary.               \n\nFacility Description & Regulated Substance:\nThis facility manufactures rubber components, textile components, and metallic components for use in tire manufacturing.  Anhydrous ammonia is used to manufacture the metallic components.  It consists of two ammonia storage tanks  (10,000 and 1000 gallons) and associated process equipment.\n\nWorst-case Release Scenario:\nThe worst-case scenario is the loss of the entire anhydrous ammonia storage tank, resulting in a toxic gas release.  In this scenario, the release would be mitigated by the enclosure of the building.  According to EPA's ALOHA Program, a release of this caliber would result in a hazard zone of up to 3.4 miles, which would impact our neighbors.  However, considering the operational procedures, security and restricted access, and the spill prevention and response program in place at the facility, a release of this nature is highly unlikely.  It is much more reasonable to assume that such a release would be averted. A more likely scenario, if there were an incident, would be a limited release from a hose failure when offloading the material from the delivery tanker.  According to EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables, a release of this caliber could result in a small hazard zone of up to 1056 ft, which could possibly reach a very limited number of nearby residences. However considering all the safety precautions that are taken when offloading the material and the spill prevention and response program in place at the facility, a release of this nature is unlikely to ever occur. \n\nPrevention Program:\nThis facility complies with EPA's Risk Ma"

The process is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with OSHA's PSM rule and good engineering practices.  Employees are trained in proper handling of the material.\n\nFive-year Accident History:\nUS2 has never had an accident involving anhydrous ammonia that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or shelterings in place.\n\nEmergency Response Program:\nThe facility has a spill prevention and response procedure in place, which includes employee training and coordination with local emergency response.  In the event of an emergency requiring assistance, it is the policy to notify the Anderson County Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.  This policy has been coordinated with the fire department."
