SPEG's  two bulk storage tanks (T1 and T2) are both refrigerated, low-pressure steel aboveground storage tanks manufactured and certified by CB&I to Annex R (Storage of Refrigerated Products) of API 620: Design and Construction of Large, Welded, Low Pressure Storage Tanks , and in accordance CB&I Specification 521-2-1\n\n   \n\nThe facility is operated and maintained in accordance with NFPA 58: Standard for Storage and Handling of Liquefied Petroleum Gases, as well as equipment manufacturers' operation and maintenance requirements and recommendations, as well with appropriate and applicable industry standards and practices. Our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state and local regulations is demonstrated through SPEG's comprehensive accidental release prevention program for all critical process systems addressing design, installation, operating and maintenance procedures and schedules, and employee and contractor training and certification.  \n\n\n\nIn the event that an emergency  incident were to occur at the Elk Grove Terminal, response protocols have been developed and coordinated with offsite responders, including the Elk Grove Fire Department, the Elk Grove Police Department, the Sacramento County Sheriff's Department and the Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District.  Moreover, the Elk Grove Terminal maintains onsite fire-fighting and emergency response systems and equipment to support and augment offsite emergency response resources.\n\n\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\n\n\nThe Suburban Propane Elk Grove Terminal is a bulk storage and transfer facility for liquid propane, SIC Code 5171/NAICS Code 42471: LPG Bulk Stations and Terminals. Propane is the only regulated substance handled at the facili"

      "SummaryText": "ty.  \n\n\n\nThe SPEG terminal is designed to receive and ship liquefied propane gas by either rail or tanker. The terminal's storage capacity consists of  the two refrigerated bulk storage tanks (seasonal storage tanks, T1 and T2), each with a storage capacity of 11 million gallons; and four (4)-60,000 gallon pressurized horizontal storage tanks (i.e., blimps).\n\n\n\nWORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\n\n\nThe worst case release scenario predicted for the facility would involve a release from the four interconnected 60,000 gallon pressurized blimps. The volume released in ten minutes would result in a vapor cloud explosion. The resulting distance to the endpoint extends offsite, and public receptors are within the distance to the end point.   \n\n\n\nALTERNATIVE CASE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\n\n\nThe most credible alternative release scenario predicted for the facility would involve a release from a single refrigerated seasonal storage tank, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  The resulting distance to the endpoint extends offsite, and public receptors are within the distance to the end point.  Both passive and active mitigation measures were considered including the dike containment system for the seasonal storage tanks; the automatic flare system to mitigate over-pressurization of the storage system; and administrative and operational procedures to control and mitigate high risk events at well below critical conditions.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\n Since the facility was initially brought on line in the early 1970s, Suburban Propane has utilized an informal condition-based inspection mythology, consistent with both API Recommended Practice 575:Inspection Practices for Atmospheric and Low Pressure Storage Tanks, as well as the API 653: Fitness for Service Assessment guidance, to establish the facility's mechanical integrity inspection procedures and schedules.

The purpose of the risk analysis is to identify the potential degradation mechanisms and threats to the integrity of the equipment and to assess the consequences and risks of failure. The resultant inspection plan strategy is designed to target the high risk equipment and to detect potential degradation before fitness for service could be threatened.\n\n\n\nThe Elk Grove Terminal's Process Hazardous Analysis policies and practices are consistent with API Standard 581:Risk-Based Inspection Technology, and serve as the foundation of the facility's  Consolidated Process Safety Program (CPSP), including the facility's mechanical integrity inspection procedures and schedules. Moreover, in 2004 CB&I, the storage tanks' original manufacturer, conducted an inspection of the storage tanks and blimps, and provided a recommended inspection schedule for Tanks T-1 and T-2 for the remaining life of the tanks The CB&I recommendations have been incorporated into SPEG's mechanical integrity inspection procedures and schedules.\n\n\n\nSuburban Propane's  Elk Grove Terminal complies with all applicable federal, state, local and industry-specific codes, regulations and standards, including:\n\n?    The United States Environmental Protection Agency's Accidental Release Prevention requirements in accordance with Part 68 of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (40 CFR 68);\n\n?
