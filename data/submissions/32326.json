      "SummaryText": "The Pleasant Prairie Power Plant, a coal-fired electric generating facility, has constructed a Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) pollution control process to control emissions of nitrogen oxides during the ozone season (May 1st through September 30th). The SCR process utilizes aqueous ammonia which is injected into the exiting flue gas (exhaust gas) from the boiler system. The ammonia reacts with the nitrogen oxides to form harmless nitrogen gas and water vapor.The SCR process requires ammonia to operate in an amount exceeding the threshold value contained in EPA's Risk Management Program. Releases from the ammonia storage tank, which is diked, were evaluated as required by the Risk Management Program. The diked tank would minimize the pooled surface area created by a release, thereby reducing the amount of ammonia that could be released into the surrounding atmosphere and minimizing off-site impacts. THE GENERAL ACCIDENTIAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLANNING: The facilitity's prevention and emergency response approach includes the implementation of USEPA's Risk Management Program, OSHA safety programs, and emergency response procedures developed specifically for the facility by the Company and the Local Emergency Response Committee. Continuing employee safety training ensures the ongoing commitment to continual safety improvement. The facility has personnel trained in OSHA Hazwoper emergency response requirements and has a designated outside emergency response contractor. The ammonia storage tanks are diked to minimize health and environmental impact should a release occur. It is We Energies' policy to not only adhere to all applicable Federal, State, and Local laws, regulations, and ordinances governing the use of this substance, but to extend safety, health, and environmental efforts beyond that of government requirements. In that vain, the Company is committed to the safety and health of its employees and the well being of our community"
