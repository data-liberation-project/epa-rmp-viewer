(White Lily), Knoxville, Tennessee, facility management to implement the requirements of this Risk Management Program (RMP) in accordance with the USEPA regulations under 40 CFR Part 68 and with the corresponding regulations under OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) program. The objective is to minimize the risk of a release of a hazardous material and if a release occurs, to minimize the potential impact to White Lily employees, the public and the environment. This objective will be accomplished by utilizing general good operating procedures, providing appropriate training to all employees, and coordinating response activities, as necessary, with the local emergency response providers.\n\nWhite Lily management is committed to providing the resources necessary to implement this policy.\n\nFacility Description\n\nThe White Lily facility utilizes flourmills to produce flour. The raw materials used in the processes are wheat and chlorine gas. Support operations include a grain elevator system, a quality assurance/control laboratory, and administrative offices. \n\nOne chemical, chlorine, is utilized at the facility, in sufficient quantities to be subject to the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68, RMP. The chlorine is used to bleach or age the flour.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe Knoxville facility is governed by a set of OSHA and USEPA regulations that require planning and facility activities intended to prevent a release of hazardous material, or if a release inadvertently occurs, to minimize the consequences of a release to the employees of the facility, the public, and to the environment. These regulations include:\n\n* 40 CFR Part 68, Accidental Release Prevention\n* 29 CFR Part 119, Process Safety Management\n\nThe key concepts in White Lily's release prevention program are employee participation,"

      "SummaryText": "appropriate design and maintenance of equipment, and appropriate training of all employees.\n\nEmployee participation in the release prevention program is encouraged and supported by White Lily management. Key personnel are responsible for conducting and implementing the findings from the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) for the chlorine system.\n\nWhite Lily's policy is to construct all new equipment, systems, and facilities in accordance with the most current building and safety codes. This ensures the appropriate safety and release prevention systems are included from the beginning of each project.\n\nWhite Lily is committed to providing appropriate training to all employees regarding safety procedures. New employees are provided comprehensive safety training during their initial orientation for the facility. In addition, White Lily conducts regularly scheduled safety training for all employees each year. Additional training is provided to maintenance personnel for the systems they are responsible for.\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nThe facility has not had an accident during the last five years.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nWhite Lily does not have emergency response capability at this facility. White Lily monitors the alarm system 24 hours a day and notifies the local HazMat team (911) in the event of an emergency.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nWhite Lily and American Ingredients, Inc. completes a thorough review of the chlorine systems each time a design change is implemented. The system is also evaluated each time the PHA is revised. White Lily is committed to using these methods to identify and implement ways to improve the safety of these systems."
