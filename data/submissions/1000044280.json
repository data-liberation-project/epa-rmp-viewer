This facility is included on the community emergency response plan through the Wharton county LEPC. \r\n\r\nFacility\r\nThis facility is a typical retail ag facility that stores and distributes agriculture chemicals and fertilizer to local farmers. This facility currently stores anhydrous ammonia in bulk tanks. \r\n\r\nPrevention Program\r\nThis facility uses a combination of  standards both federal and state requirements as well as industry best management practices to ensure we are making our best effort to minimize the risk of an accidental release. \r\n\r\nFive-year Accident History\r\nNo known accidents involving this facility within the previous five-year history.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response\r\nThis facility has implemented an emergency action plan and the employees of this facility will not respond to accidental releases other than very minor incidental releases. The emergency action plan was written to ensure employee safety and call for offsite, trained responders. This facility will rely on the efforts of the Danevang Fire Department for response to accidental release emergencies. This facility is also included on the Wharton county LEPC community emergency response plan. Contact was made with both the fire department and the LEPC to coordinate plans. \r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\nThere are plans to have this system evaluated by a qualified professional to identify improvements needed to ensure compliance with all applicable regulatory requirements as"
