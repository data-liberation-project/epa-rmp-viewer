EWEB's safety and emergency release policies are specifically designed towards prevention through training and employee awareness, which also includes clear and precise methods (SOP's) for mitigating releases to protect its own employees, public and the environment.  \n\n\n\nEWEB's Hayden Bridge Water Filtration Plant has been, and intends to continue to be in compliance with EPA and OSHA requirements for prevention and responsible reaction to chlorine (chemical) releases.  EWEB 's RMP team is composed of five individuals:  one Water Engineering Supervisor, one Quality Assurance Officer, one Lead Operations Operator, one Lead Chlorine Maintenance Specialist and one Water Treatment Supervisor.  The water plant staff annually reviews and drills with its Process Hazards Analyses (PHA), Process Safety Management (PSM) and Emergency Action Plan (EAP).  In addition, EWEB's water plant is annually inspected by local emergency responders and is used as an interactive drill site for the City of Springfield Fire & Life Safety and EWEB.\n\n\n\nAll processes of the chlorination system have approved SOP's with a signature sheet for all employees to verify their knowledge and proof of understanding of the system.         \n\n\n\nEWEB actively employees the CENS system for emergency releases if one were to occur.  \n\n        \n\nEWEB is a member of the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and attends emergency response drills and training sessions with all local and regional emergency response teams.  \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nRegulated Substances \n\n\n\n\n\nThe Hayden Bridge containment facility can hold up to twelve one-ton cylinders of chlorine gas.\n\nThe facility uses the toxic chlorine gas to di"

      "SummaryText": "sinfect McKenzie River water to produce safe drinking water.  To disinfect the raw water, chlorine gas is mixed with water at a concentration of up to 2.0 mg/l (ppm).  After filtration, the clear water is adjusted as needed with smaller doses of chlorine to provide a final chlorine residual of 0.65 mg/l as the treated water leaves the plant site.  As the water reaches the community, the average chlorine residual throughout the service area averages 0.45 mg/l (2011 data).  The Federal Safe Drinking Water Act requires that drinking water contain a minimum of 0.20 mg/l of chlorine as it leaves the treatment facility and that measureable chlorine exists in 95% of all distribution samples collected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\n\n\nThe disinfection building at the EWEB water treatment plant was constructed in 1997.  The storage / process rooms have redundant detectors, half of which are tested weekly.  If a release is detected, the system closes the vents from the outside and the released gas is blown into a scrubber unit that is designed to neutralize the release.  This scrubber is designed to handle a one-ton release of chlorine and is also checked and tested weekly. The structure itself is built to earthquake codes and fire codes and insulation codes.  All monitoring and control systems are checked and maintained on a regularly scheduled basis.  \n\n\n\nThe chlorine feed system is engineered to prevent releases.  Chlorine is fed through a vacuum system.  In the event of a line break in the disinfection building, the line loses vacuum and the feeders shut down, preventing a release.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThere have been no accidents or releases in the last five years.\n\n"
