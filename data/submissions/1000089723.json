Nurse tanks may be stored at this location from October 1 to November 30 and March 1 to April 30 of any given year depending upon weather conditions.\n\n\n\n1. Facility Policy - The owners, management and employees of Northeast Missouri Co-op, Edina, MO (the facility) are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia from nurse tanks. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department or other authorities to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to people and the environment.\n\n\n\n2. Facility Information - Anhydrous ammonia is stored in nurse tanks of 1,000 to 1,450 gallons capacity for retail sale to local farmers or by custom application. The maximum amount stored would be 54,000 pounds.\n\n\n\n3. Worst Case and Alternate Case Release Scenarios - a) The Worst Case Scenario would be the release of the total contents of the largest single nurse tank. b) The Alternate Case Scenario would be a release from a relief valve. Results of the worst and alternate case release scenarios are not listed in the executive summary for security reasons.\n\n\n\n4. Accidental Release Prevention - The facility has been reviewed for general compliance with the provisions of the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Standard 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".\n\n\n\n5. Five Year Accident History - There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia from these tanks in the past five years.\n\n\n\n6. Emergency Response Program - The facility has; a) a written Emergency Action Plan (EAP) in accordance with OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.38 and  b) provided state and local authorities with the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\n\n\n7"
