The Facility Policy\n\n\tWest Central AGRIServices,LLC., and the employees of the West Central AGRIServices, LLC., of Pleasant Hill are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Pleasant Hill Fire Department, and other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information\n\n\tThe primary activity is an agricultural supply center with sales of feed, seed, grain, agricultural chemicals and fertilizers. This RMP is for the storage and distribution to our farmer customers of anhydrous ammonia from the facility located on E. 58 Highway.\n\n\tThere are two storage tanks at this facility one 28,000 gallon capacity and one 18,000 gallon capacity. The maximum combined quantity stored in these two tanks would be 196,500 pounds. The maximum quantity in the largest storage tank would be 120,000 pounds at 85% capacity. The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a transport delivery truck holding approximately 50,000 pounds.\n\n3. The worst-case and alternative release scenario.\n\n\ta. The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of the largest storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes. The maximum quantity released would be 120,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 PPM) is 2.32 miles.\n\n\tb. The alternative release scenario based on the most likely potential incident is a release from a break in a 3\u00bf transfer hose during receiving operations. This release is assumed to last approximately 2 minutes before automatic or manual shut-of"
