Policy dictates that Rinchem personnel continuously identify methods to reduce the risk of handling hazardous materials and to reduce the risk to the community and environment through implementation of new technology and procedures. This commitment to safe and environmentally sound operations is documented in the Team Member Handbook, and the mission statement, which are available to all employees. The Safety and Health policy states:\r\n\r\nSAFETY FIRST is more than a slogan at Rinchem...it is a way of life. Rinchem Company, Inc., is committed to providing a safe working environment for its staff members, its customers and the public, and maintains that \r\n\r\n\"NO JOB IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF OUR STAFF MEMBERS, OUR COMMUNITIES, AND THE ENVIRONMENT\". \r\n\r\nWe recognize that the responsibilities for safety and health are shared: \r\n\u00bf\tManagement, in particular the Director of Quality, ES&H, accepts the responsibility for leadership of the safety and health program, for its effectiveness and improvement, and for providing the safeguards required to ensure safe conditions. \r\n\u00bf\tManagers and supervisors are responsible for ensuring processes are documented which reinforce safety as well as the use of engineering controls as the preferred method of promoting safety and eliminating unsafe conditions. \r\n\u00bf\tStaff members are responsible for cooperation with all aspects of the safety and health program including compliance with all rules, documented procedures, and regulations and for continuously practicing safety while performing their duties. \r\n\u00bf\tStaff members are responsible for stopping activities that may lead to injuries"

The facility provides transportation and public warehousing services for manufacturers, distributors and end users of pre-packaged specialty chemicals. Warehousing activities include shipping, receiving and storage of chemicals as specified by customer requirements.

It is unloaded from the truck using a forklift and staged for inspection. After the material passes quality and safety inspection, it is placed into the hazard-specific storage area until it is shipped to the end user.

After the material passes inspection, it is loaded on to a truck for shipment using a forklift.  \r\n\r\n1.3.\tWorst-Case Release Scenario\r\nWell-documented offsite consequence analyses are essential to adequate communication of potential hazards at the Rinchem Marlboro, MA Warehouse.  Rinchem conducted an offsite consequence analysis, using the EPA's Areal Location of Hazardous Atmospheres (ALOHA),RMPcomp in conjunction with the rules specified in 40 CFR 68.25 to estimate the offsite consequence of a Worst-Case Scenario (WCS) from our warehousing process. The WCS associated with toxic substances in the Marlboro, MA warehouse is a catastrophic failure of the single largest container resulting in a release of the total contents, 55 gallons of Ammonium Hydroxide, Hydrochloric acid or Formaldehyde (each shown separately). The passive mitigation measures taken into account for this scenario are the limited quantity of any of the three chemicals that can be released due to container and the handling of containers within the building. \r\n\r\n1.4.\tThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps \r\nRinchem management realizes that implementation of appropriate administrative and technological safeguards ensure the safety of the workers and the continued safety of public receptors. Those recommendations that are planned for implementation will be discussed in \"Planned Changes to Improve Safety\". The safeguards include both administrative and technological safeguards that prevent, detect, or mitigate releases of Ammonium Hydroxide, Formaldehyde and Hydrochloric Acid.\r\n\t\r\n1.5.\tThe Five Year Accident History\r\n\r\nThere has never been a reportable accident involving Ammonium Hydroxide, ( Ammonia   anhydrous), Hydrochloric acid, Formaldehyde or any other chemical at the Rinchem Company Inc,"

Rinchem has developed an emergency response program to minimize the effects of accidental releases of Ammonium Hydroxide, Hydrochloric acid or Formaldehyde to employees (vapor-dispersion modeling demonstrates no impact public receptors). Rinchem management has opted to respond to releases of these chemicals by containing the spill when it can be safely done and using contracted services for spill cleanup. \r\n\r\nThe Marlboro Warehouse Emergency Response Program consists of:\r\n\u00bf\tEmergency Action Plan and Hazardous Waste Contingency Plan\r\n\u00bf\tChemical Exposure and Chemical Spill Cleanup Procedure\r\n\u00bf\tEmergency Evacuation Plan \r\n\r\nThe Emergency Response Program outlines the instructions and required information in order to respond to fire, chemical spills, natural disasters and other emergencies that may arise.
