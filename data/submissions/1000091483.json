The same is true for low-low conditions including atmospheric oxygen sensors.  Each area has an emergency shutdown button (e-stop) inside and outside each area that interrupts all motor run signals, and interrupts control signals to specific valves (depending on the process) sending those valves to safe fail state. The control scheme was designed around scenarios with risk-based consequences reviewed by the Process Hazard Analysis team.\r\n\r\nAll equipment is designed and manufactured for ammonia use. The ammonia storage tank is provided with the industry standard, redundant emergency relief venting to the exterior discharging above the roof in the event the tank is subject to elevated temperatures. The ammonia systems have been evaluated and stamped by a third-party Professional Engineer. \r\n\r\nAUECC-Reno is subject to Program 3 requirements and has therefore completed the hazard assessments for affected process. The information provided in AUECC-Reno's Hazard Assessments for Anhydrous Ammonia and Ammonium Hydroxide processes is outlined in the Risk Management Plan submission. The results of the Hazard Assessment have been shared with all AUECC-Reno employees, contractors, neighboring businesses and the Storey County Local Emergency Planning Committee.\r\n\r\nAUECC-Reno has an Incident Investigation Policy in place requiring investigation of any incident that resulted in or could have reasonably resulted in a catastrophic release in accordance with 40 CFR 68.81.  AUECC-Reno has no accidental ammonia releases in the past five years, including our sister sights in Asia that have been in operation since the 1990s.  \r\n\r\nAUECC-Reno has an emergency response team trained in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.120 to respond to releases of anhydrous ammonia and associated products discussed above.

The facility operates under SIC 2819 defined as 'Industrial Inorganic Chemicals, Not Elsewhere Classified'.\r\n\r\nLiquified anhydrous ammonia is unloaded from a delivery vehicle and stored within an approximately 2,400 square feet steel structure with metal panel walls. The ammonia storage tank contains a mixture of liquified and gaseous anhydrous ammonia under pressure. Gaseous ammonia is vaporized in the ammonia storage section and delivered by a closed piping system to the 29% Ammonium Hydroxide process room and the 40% ammonium fluoride process room. In the 29% ammonium hydroxide process room, anhydrous ammonia is mixed with ultrapure water to a concentration of 29% ammonium hydroxide. In a separate process room, anhydrous ammonia is reacted with 49% hydrofluoric acid (supplied from an IBC tote) and ultrapure water to create 40% ammonium fluoride.\r\n\r\nAll delivery and use of ammonia between the anhydrous ammonia storage tank and the two process rooms occurs in closed systems with hard piping connections. The bulk ammonia storage enclosure, 29% Ammonium Hydroxide process room and the 40% Ammonium Fluoride process room all have emergency exhaust ventilation to a dedicated alkaline wet scrubber. \r\n\r\nThe safety system control philosophy for these three areas has multiple safety, process interlocks and permissives to ensure safe operating conditions exist during processing.
