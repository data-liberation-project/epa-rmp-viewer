Criterion has recently installed additional passive mitigation equipment to verify that no offsite impacts would occur at any public receptor associated with the complete loss of containment of 20,500 gallons from an aqueous ammonia storage tank, or a 400-pound drum of vanadium pentoxide. Passive mitigation equipment was installed around our aqueous ammonia storage tank to minimize the surface area for evaporation during a spill. Criterion qualifies for Program level 1 under the EPA RMP and CalARP regulations.\n\nCriterion actively participated in Contra Costa County's Community Awareness & Emergency Response (CAER) Group's May 12, 1999 RMP public meeting. In this public meeting, Criterion presented our worst-case release scenarios for both aqueous ammonia and vanadium pentoxide associated with the RMP program in advance of the June 21, 1999 RMP submittal date. Criterion has disclosed to the public, news media and the Bay Point Community Advisory Panel our RMP Program level 1 status due to the installation of passive mitigation controls.\n\nCriterion's aqueous ammonia usage is subject to both EPA's Risk Management Prevention and California's Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program requirements for the development of a Risk Management Plan. Criterion's vanadium pentoxide usage is subject only to CalARP's program requirements for the development of a Risk Management Plan.

Criterion is committed to being a responsible member of the community by operating in a safe and environmentally sound manner. This commitment is documented in our company's policy on health safety and environmental performance, which are available to all employees. Included in this policy are the following statements:\n\n\"Criterion believes that all occupational illnesses, injuries and environmental incidents are preventable, and their occurrence is unacceptable. Criterion's objective is to continuously improve its health safety and environmental performance and in doing so become recognized as a leader in its industry. Criterion will comply with the intent as well as the letter of all applicable health safety and environmental laws where it operates, and where it believes those laws and regulations are inadequate, it will establish appropriate and more stringent internal standards.\"\n\nAlthough not subject to OSHA Process Safety Management requirements, Criterion has developed many similar procedures to protect the health and safety of our workers, the public and the environment. The following summarizes the prevention programs that are used within Criterion:\n\n\n\nManagement of Change\n\nCriterion has established procedures for a comprehensive review of all proposed process changes, other than replacement-in-kind. Each proposed project must be evaluated by the appropriate department managers (e.g., technical, operations, maintenance, safety and environmental). Written documentation of department approvals, hazard evaluation, changes in P&IDs and operating procedures are maintained. \n\nPre-Startup Safety Review\n\nCriterion requires that new or modified equipment meet all design requirements"

Contractor activities are monitored to verify safe work practices and appropriate training. \n\nHot Work Permits\n\nCriterion requires the issuance of hot work permits. Each permit identifies the work to be performed, equipment involved, dates and fire prevention measures. Copies of all permits are maintained.\n\nTraining\n\nInitial training is given to employees at the time of hire. Subsequent training is given when there has been a change to the aqueous ammonia or any other system. On-the-job-training qualification is required for each operator, including an annual review of the aqueous ammonia MSDS. Since vanadium pentoxide is used on an infrequent basis, refresher training is conducted prior to each production run involving the material.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nEvery accident or near miss incident is investigated to determine the underlying cause(s). Root cause analysis (RCA) is the method used in Criterion for analyzing and evaluating incidents. Each incident is documented in writing along with recommendations to prevent reoccurrence.

Two regulated compounds are used above threshold quantities associated with EPA's Risk Management Prevention and California's Accidental Release Prevention (RMP/CalARP) Programs, aqueous ammonia and vanadium pentoxide. \n\n\n1.3 DESCRIPTION OF CHEMICAL USAGE\n\n1.3.1 Aqueous Ammonia Process\n\nCriterion has one 21,300-gallon aqueous ammonia storage tank. Due to administrative controls, the tank is limited to 20,500-gallons maximum capacity. The aqueous ammonia has a maximum concentration of 29% ammonia and the solution is stored at ambient conditions. The solution is used in two types of operations: 1) pumped as a liquid into mixing equipment or blending tanks; and 2) for use in air pollution control equipment.\n\nCriterion uses aqueous ammonia as a raw material during the manufacture of hydrotreating catalyst. Generally, the manufacture of hydrotreating catalysts is a two-step process: 1) the raw materials are mixed in a tank, the intermediate product is extruded, dried initially in an oven then in a kiln. This intermediate is used in step 2): the intermediate is impregnated with a metal salt solution and kiln dried again, pelletized, then finally packaged. Liquid aqueous ammonia is pumped into mixing tanks during both step 1 and step 2 portions of the hydrotreating catalyst manufacturing process.\n\nCriterion also uses aqueous ammonia to reduce air emissions in selective catalytic reduction (SCR) air pollution abatement equipment. Criterion operates two SCR systems to reduce emission of nitrogen oxides (NOx). In these operations, aqueous ammonia is introduced into a process gas stream to convert NOx into nitrogen and water before being exhausted into the atmosphere. Liquid aqueous ammonia is pumped to an ammo"

The ammonia is consumed in the process. \n\n1.3.2 Vanadium Pentoxide Process\n\nCriterion uses vanadium pentoxide on an infrequent basis, which depending on customer orders, could be years between manufacturing runs. Criterion does not maintain an inventory of vanadium pentoxide onsite. The material is only ordered and maintained onsite in preparation for production of appropriate specialty catalyst.\n\nCriterion receives 55-gallon drums filled with 400 pounds of pure vanadium pentoxide. The drums are off-loaded by forklift from delivery trucks and warehoused until needed. Drums are transported by forklift to the O5 Plant where they are repackaged into 1,500-pound stainless steel totes. The totes remain inside the building until used. The vanadium pentoxide is pneumatically transported from the totes in a closed system to mixing equipment where it is blended with water and other solids. Small amounts of vanadium pentoxide are used in the manufacture of specialty dehydrogenation catalyst. \n\n\n1.4 THE WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nCriterion conducted an offsite consequence analysis, using the EPA's RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance, and computer dispersion modeling to estimate impacts of potential worst-case scenarios (WCS) from our aqueous ammonia and vanadium pentoxide processes. Both compounds are listed as toxic materials under CalARP regulations. The scenario that resulted in the largest quantity released and which resulted in airborne concentrations traveling the furthest from point of origin was the failure of the aqueous ammonia storage tank.\n\nThe WCS associated with toxic substances at Criterion is the catastrophic failure of the aqueous ammonia storage tank resulting in the release of 20,500 gallons of 29% concentrated aqueous ammonia solution over a 10-minute period. In reality, this event is extremely unlikely since Criterion has many control measures in"

Because the aqueous ammonia storage tank is located inside a concrete containment area, any release would be contained within the 800 ft2 diked area. In addition, the containment area is filled with small polypropylene balls that would float on top of the liquid surface, reducing the exposed surface area for evaporation by 90%, and resulting in an effective surface area for evaporation of 80 ft2.  \n\nAccording to EPA's RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance, using urban conditions and default values for 30% aqueous ammonia solution, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L (200 ppm, ERPG-2 for ammonia) for the WCS is 0.06 miles (320 feet). This distance from the aqueous ammonia storage tank is within the property boundary. There are no public receptors within 320 feet of the tank and the facility has not had an aqueous ammonia release meeting the accident history criteria for five years. Therefore, Criterion's Pittsburg facility qualifies for Program level 1 under the EPA RMP and CalARP regulations.\n\n1.5 THE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nCriterion management realizes the importance of establishing administrative and technological safeguards to ensure the safety of workers and the continued safety of public receptors. Those recommendations that are planned for implementation are described in Section 1.8, Planned Changes to Improve Safety. The safeguards shown in Tables 1 and 2 include both administrative and technological safeguards that prevent, detect, or mitigate releases of aqueous ammonia and vanadium pentoxide, respectively.\n\nTable 1 \nChemical-Specific Prevention Steps for Aqueous Ammonia Criterion Catalyst Company L.P., Pittsburg Plant\n\n1.

In August 1994, a new aqueous ammonia delivery truck unloading station was installed with adequate secondary containment. Ensures that aqueous ammonia spills associated with delivery truck unloading operations are contained.\n4. In September 1994, the aqueous ammonia storage tank was fitted with pressure safety and vacuum-breaker valves. These valves are designed to protect the storage tank against over or under pressurization during tank filling, emptying or temperature changes.\n5. In September 1994, an automatic shutoff pressure switch was installed on the pump used for delivery truck unloading to the tank. The pressure switch will stop the filling of the storage tank to prevent over pressurization.\n6. In September 1994, a high level switch was installed on the storage tank.

Criterion reviewed incident investigations from January 1994. This five-year accident history review satisfies the requirements of Section 2750.9 of the CalARP regulation. The purpose of conducting an accidental release review is to promote an informed community while also documenting that accidental releases are investigated and concrete changes are made to protect against reoccurrence.\n\nCriterion has established procedures to investigate accidents and recommend changes to operations to minimize the likelihood that a similar accident would occur again. Although not required under Program level 1 of the CalARP regulations, Criterion has voluntarily adopted many of the procedural requirements required for a level 3 facility. These procedural requirements are highlighted under Section 1.1, Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at Criterion. \n\n\n1.7 THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nCriterion's emergency response program was developed to comply with Title 19 of California Code of Regulations (T19 CCR'2731, AB2185 Business Plan) and emergency action plan requirements under Title 8 of California Code of Regulations (T8 CCR'3220, HAZWOPER standard).
