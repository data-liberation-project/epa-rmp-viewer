      "SummaryText": "The Risk Management Program for the Commerce Water Treatment Plant (WTP) minimizes the likelihood and potential effects of a chemical accident involving chlorine by identifying and reducing potential hazards as well as preparing employees and responders to handle a chemical emergency.  This is accomplished by establishing a program in accordance with the EPA's requirements outlined in 40 CFR Part 68 providing for employee and public safety\n\nThe importance dedicated to the safe operation of the Commerce plant is reflected in its record of no reportable releases or accidents involving chlorine over the past 5 years.  Implementation of this Risk Management Program will further ensure the continued safety to the plant's employees and the surrounding community. \n\nThe Commerce WTP, located on Water Plant Road, north of the City of Commerce Commerce in Banks County, uses chlorine to disinfect raw water as part of the treatment process necessary to provide drinking water for the Commerce area.  The plant stores as much as 8,000 lbs. of liquefied chlorine under pressure in containers holding 2,000 lbs.  The chlorination process involves a system where chlorine gas is piped from these containers and then controlled and metered until being applied to the raw water creating a chlorine solution.\n\nTo lessen the likelihood and mitigate the effects of a potential release of chlorine, the Commerce WTP's Risk Management Program provides a means for ensuring that the plant operators' preparedness is improved in the following important areas:\n\n1.  Chlorine hazards and safety;\n2.  Procedures for safely operating the chlorine system;\n3.  Preventive maintenance;\n4.  Emergency action and response.\n\nTo ensure that an emergency situation is handled effectively, this RMP includes an Emergency Action Plan (EAP) and an Emergency Response Plan (ERP).  The EAP details appropriate procedures for the plant operators to follow in responding to a chlorine accident including stopping a leak and contac"

The ERP, which is included in the county-wide community emergency response plan, provides local emergency responders with information necessary to sufficiently understand the hazards a potential escaping chlorine cloud poses to the community and to properly respond to an accident at the plant.  The ERP includes a prediction of the most likely path a toxic cloud may take based on the local topography.  \n\nEffective emergency action and response is ensured through ongoing training of emergency response procedures.  Plant operators are trained on chlorine hazards, stopping chlorine leaks, and emergency procedures and equipment.  To further improve safety at this facility the plant has installed electronic air monitoring equipment to ensure that, if a leak were to occur, personnel will respond and correct it as quickly as possible.\n\nThis Risk Management Program is designed so that each element may be easily implemented and maintained ensuring that potential hazards are closely monitored, operators stay sufficiently trained, and an emergency will be handled as efficiently as possible.  This will assure that the Commerce Water Treatment Plant will continue the safe operation of its chlorination process while providing quality drinking water for the surrounding region."
