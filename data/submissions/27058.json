If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, Custer County LEPC and other authorities, to mitigate any releaase and m inimize the impact of the release to persons and the environment.                                  \n\n2.  Facility information.  \n\n     Trotter Fertilizer is a small independent retail facility of  plant food and crop protection chemicals.  Crop nutrients in a clean, easily absorbable form are mixed, sold and delivered.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application to the farm.  The maximum quantity stored would be 260,000 pounds in a storage tank and nurse facility.\n\n3.  The worst-case release and alternative release scenarios.  \n\n     A.  The worst-case scenario would be the release of the total contents of the storage tank over a 10 minute period.  The distance to the endpoint would be 4.4 miles.  The maximum quantity released would be 130,000 pounds volume of the largest storage tank at 85% capacity as limited by design standards and administrative controls.  \n\n     B.  The alternative release scenario would be the break of a 1\" transfer hose followed by the release of ammonia for 2 minutes before an automatic excess flow shut down value intervenes or remote manual shut-off is closed and stops the flow of ammonia.  The maximum quantity released would be 2,900 pounds.  .  The distance to the endpoint would be .30 miles.\n                \n4.  Accidental Release Prevention Program.  \n\nThis facility is in compliance with teh provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia K-61.1\", published by The American National St"
