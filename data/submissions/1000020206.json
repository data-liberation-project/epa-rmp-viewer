The facility has an ammonia refrigeration system that provides refrigerating capacity to ten (10) cold storage rooms, seven (7) precool rooms, three (3) mini-rooms, and a shipping area.  The rooms utilize bunker mounted evaporator coils that contain chilled liquid ammonia.  A computer system provides substantial control and alarm capability.\n\n\n\nThe system operates as follows: high pressure liquid from the high pressure receiver is piped to each flooded zone of refrigeration, where it passes through a solenoid valve, an expansion valve, and into a low temperature & pressure accumulator vessel mounted behind the bunker wall. From the accumulators, cold liquid ammonia is circulated through evaporator coils. As heat is absorbed, the liquid ammonia vaporizes to form low temperature & pressure gas which is returned to the accumulator vessels. The ammonia vapor is returned from the accumulator vessels through a suction return line to our main suction accumulator in the engine room.  From there, it passes through the compressors. The high pressure discharge from the compressors is sent to water cooled evaporative condensers where the high pressure gas ammonia is cooled, liquefied and returned to our high pressure receiver.  Liquid separated from the suction return gas in the main suction accumulator drains into the liquid transfer vessel.  Operation of a float switch activated solenoid valve raises the pressu"

Since then the following significant projects have occurred:\n\n\n\n1. Mid 1990's - B&W Refrigeration increased the  of the evaporator coils, accumulators, fans, and control valves in Storage Rooms 1-8\n\n2. 1996 - B&W Refrigeration installed the refrigeration equipment for the Shipping Room\n\n3. Early 2000's - B&W Refrigeration increased the  of the evaporator coils, accumulators, fans, and control valves in Precool 1 and 2\n\n\n\nThe system contain numerous safety devices including sensors which stop the compressors if temperatures or pressures exceed or drop below established limits, and safety relief valves which vent ammonia gas to the atmosphere if the pressure in the system exceeds their set point.  Lastly, an emergency \"dump box\" contains switches and valves to turn off equipment and vent ammonia if necessary.\n\n\n\nThe ammonia system at our facility consists of vessels which are interconnected, or which are co-located such that a release of ammonia could impact the ability to operate vessels that are not directly connected. Therefore, we are treating the system as a single process.\n\n\n\n1.3    GENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE & CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\n1.3.1    GENERAL \n\n\n\nWe inform our employees engaged in process operations of the dangers of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia in annual safety meetings.  During these meeting we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\n\nPandol & Sons has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the ammonia refrigeration process.  These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release.  The results of the analyses are reported in the body of the program. \n\n\n\n1.3.2    ANHYDROUS AMMONIA\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration process at the Pandol &"

It is extremely important that this process is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner.  Management is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.\n\nOur refrigeration personnel monitor the ammonia refrigeration process and keep an active log book of all procedures and transactions that pertain to ammonia.  In addition, the process is checked frequently by one of the outside refrigeration contractors that we use. These contractors also assist in performing the annual mechanical integrity inspection of our ammonia equipment. \n\n\n\n1.4    FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nPandol & Sons has had no accidental release within the last five (5) years.\n\n\n\n1.5    EMERGENCY ACTION AND RESPONSE PLAN\n\n\n\nPandol & Son's emergency action and response program has been developed to satisfy the following requirements:\n\n\n\nCalifornia \"Emergency Action Plan\" - Title 8 CCR A?3220\n\nFederal \"Emergency Action Plan\" - Title 29 CFR A?1910.38 \n\nCalifornia \"Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response\" (HAZWOPER) - Title 8 CCR Title 8 A?5192(q)\n\nFederal \"Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response\" (HAZWOPER) - Title 29 CFR A?1910.120(q)\n\n\n\nEvery year we review with our employees our evacuation procedures in the event of an emergency, including a hazardous chemical release.\n\n\n\n1.6    PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nOur company has an outstanding safety record, one that we are quite proud of.
