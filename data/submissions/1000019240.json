The Emergency Action Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the PSM/RMP document which is maintained at the facility.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n  1.)  To save lives.\n  2.)  To minimize and avoid injuries.\n  3.)  To protect the environment.\n  4.)  To minimize property damage.\n\nCostco Wholesale maintains a safety committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations.\n\nCostco Wholesale has coordinated emergency response efforts with the local fire department and with the contracted refrigeration operation and maintenance firm.  In the case of an ammonia-related emergency, it is the policy of Costco Wholesale to evacuate and to allow the fire department/HazMat Team to respond to the emergency.  The refrigeration contractor will be available for guidance and assistance.\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nConstruction of the ammonia refrigeration system at Costco Wholesale was completed in November 2000.  The facility serves as a distribution point for chilled goods that are shipped to Costco Wholesale retail outlets.  The facility is located at 4250 S. Fulton Parkway in Union City, Georgia about 3 miles west of the junction of the Interstate 85 and Interstate 285 freeways.  The immediate area is primarily undeveloped with some light commercial areas.  The ammonia system was constructed in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local"

      "SummaryText": " regulations including the Uniform Fire and Mechanical Codes.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system uses approximately 26,000 pounds of ammonia for cross dock operations, warehouse cold storage, and freezer storage.  The majority of the system is located in the machine room including vessels, compressors, and associated piping.  The condensers are mounted on the engine room roof, and all of the evaporators are located in their respective cold storage rooms/areas.\n\nThe refrigeration cycle begins with the transfer of high pressure liquid ammonia from the thermosyphon  receiver to the high pressure receiver.  The thermosyphon receiver maintains a liquid level that is used for cooling of the compressor oil.  Excess liquid is drained to the high pressure receiver, which supplies liquid to the intermediate temperature and high temperature recirculator vessels.  The intermediate temperature recirculator feeds the low temperature recirculator.  As the ammonia enters each recirculator vessel, it is expanded through a hand expansion valve, reducing the pressure (and hence the temperature) in order to maintain a predetermined internal (high, medium, low) pressure.  Each recirculator supplies overfed pumped liquid ammonia to a distinct set of evaporators.  The high temperature recirculator  serves sixteen (16) cross dock evaporators.  The medium temperature recirculator serves eight (8) cooler evaporators, and the low temperature recirculator serves four (4) freezer evaporators. Fans in each evaporator are used to blow air across the coils which partially vaporizes the liquid ammonia in the coils as heat from the room is transferred to the ammonia.\n\nThe resulting two-phased (liquid/vapor) ammonia from each set of evaporators is returned to its respective recirculator vessel in which constant pressures (temperatures) are maintained based on the suction pressure of the corresponding compressors.  The vapor from each recirculator vessel is then drawn to seven (7) compressors where the"

      "SummaryText": " pressure and temperature of hte gas is increased.  All seven compressors work in combination to compress the vapor pulled from the three recirculators.  Compressor discharge (high pressure ammonia vapor, or hot gas) is routed to one (1) condenser where it is condensed to a high pressure liquid (by discharging latent heat to the atmosphere) and drained back to the thermosyphon receiver.  Hot gas is also used for defrost of the freezer and cooler evaporators.  An auto-purger periodically purges the system on non-condensibles collected in the condensers.  Dual pressure relief valve assemblies are installed on each vessel to relive high pressure ammonia to a water diffusion tank through a common header in case of a high pressure event.\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEP\n\nThe Costco Wholesale ammonia refrigeration system has many safety features.  Much of hte safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system.  For example, the Costco Wholesale facility operates in accordance with OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation.  Refrigeration contractors, experts in the ammonia refrigeration industry, are contracted at the facility to maintain the system and perform any repairs.\n\nThe Costco Wholesale facility, including the ammonia system, was designed and constructed in accordance with the Uniform Mechanical Code, which specifically outlines requirements for the safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system.  These safety features include a water diffusion tanks, ammonia sensors in the machine room and just outside of the machine room (condensers).  All pressure vessels are equipped with pressure relief valves that automatically engage in case of a high pressure situation and vent through a common header to the water diffusion tank.\n\nIn addition to the Uniform Mechanical Code, the facility operates in accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (II"

In particular, the IIAR Bulletin 110, \"Startup, Inspection, and Maintenance of Ammonia Refrigeration Systems.\"\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe Costco Wholesale facility has not had any reportable ammonia releases during the past 5 years (December 2005\n- December 2010).  No injuries have occurred at the facility due to the operation of the ammonia refrigeration\nprocess\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nCostco Wholesale has an emergency action plan in effect at the facility. If a release of ammonia were to occur, Costco will determine the extent of the emergency.  The alarms are tied into the ammonia sensors and will automatically alarm.  Costco management will determine if an evacuation is necessary.  They will call 911 in order to reach the appropriate HazMat team who will respond to the ammonia release.\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe initial Process Hazard Analysis (November 2000) provided mitigation measures to improve safety at the Coscto Wholesale facility located at 4250 S. Fulton Parkway in Union City, Georgia.  All of these recommendations are complete and most were implemented prior to system startup.  Since that time, the faciliyt has conducted three (3) compliance audits and two (2) PHA Revalidations.  Additional recommendations were developed and addressed by the facility.  The facility is currently implementing improved usage of safety signage based on these recommendations."
