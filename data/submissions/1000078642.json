      "SummaryText": "The HP-A Hazelwood facility is a refrigerated warehousing and storage facility located in the metropolitan St.  Louis area near Lambert Airport.  \n\n\n\nThe covered process at this facility is an ammonia-based mechanical refrigeration system which contains a maximum intended inventory of 26,200 pounds. The system was installed in 1998.\n\n\n\nThe facility has an active Process Safety Management Program.  Operation of the ammonia equipment is restricted to only a select few refrigeration contractors. The majority of the distribution piping which contains ammonia, and connects to air cooling evaporator units and process equipment, is located above the roof of the warehouse freezer and cooler areas, and therefore not very susceptible to damage from accidental, inadvertent contact by lift trucks and lifted loads.   The significant investment associated with the pre-planning for safety is an example of the commitment of management to identifying critical safety control points and improving the process accordingly.\n\n\n\nAn OSHA-prescribed Process Safety Management Program has been adopted for this facility.  Under that Program, the major components of the process are inspected frequently.  Operating conditions are constantly monitored by a computerized system with integral alarms that notify process operators of an upset.  The automatic leak detection devices alert persons in the constantly-inhabited areas where ammonia-containing equipment is located that even the slightest release may have occurred.  As stated above, the company has located principal piping and many key shutoff valves on the roof area for easier access in emergency conditions.  Shutoff valves which allow operators to isolate sections of piping/equipment in compressor room areas are readily accessed.  The compressor room area is well vented with high volume fans, and is readily accessible in case of a release in that area.  The ammonia leak detection devices in the compressor room automatically start the ventilat"

      "SummaryText": "ion system and also communicate directly to a supervised alarm system.\n\n\n\nThe St.  Louis County LEPC has included the HP-A Hazelwood facility in the community emergency plan.  The facility's relationship with the LEPC includes infrequent interactive exercises and regular dialogue regarding the process. The Hazelwood and Berkeley Fire Departments maintain  HAZMAT squads, and have mutual aid agreements in place with nearby municipalities for the provision of those services in the event of an accidental release which requires external intervention or assistance.   HP-A Hazelwood has adopted the INTEGRATED CONTINGENCY PLAN format preferred by EPA and OSHA for preparing and implementing its onsite Emergency Action and Response Plan.   Under this plan, emergency training and practice drills will be frequent and will cover a multitude of potential scenarios.  Three key managers will become involved immediately upon the recognition and characterization of all non-incidental ammonia releases, and their duties will be as follows:  (a) coordination of and direction to onsite and external emergency responders; (b) notification of agencies and on-site safety and security; (c) protection and continuation of business operations and employee welfare; and (d) communication with the public as necessary.\n\n\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety\n\nThe primary mechanisms to identify and plan safety improvements include (but are not limited to):\n\n? Process Hazard Analysis revalidation/update;\n\n? Compliance Audits;\n\n? Mechanical Integrity Program;\n\nEach of the Programs above may result in recommendations ranging from capital improvements to routine maintenance of the plant. Implementation of these measures has commenced according to the schedule set by the management of HP-A Hazelwood.\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nThe HP-A Hazelwood facility has had no EPA RMP-applicable accidental releases of ammonia within the last five years."
