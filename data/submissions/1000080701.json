      "SummaryText": "WFP Executive Summary\n\n1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe City of Oshkosh Water Filtration Plant (WFP) uses gaseous chlorine and anhydrous ammonia for disinfection of the City's drinking water. Chlorine and anhydrous ammonia are considered hazardous by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The City of Oshkosh (City) is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety. This commitment is important to an accidental release prevention program that includes areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the chlorine and ammonia storage and feed processes at the WFP. It is City policy to comply with applicable Federal and state rules and regulations including completion of comprehensive updates to its Risk Management Program and Process Safety Management Program every five years, or as needed to reflect changes to the WFP chlorine and ammonia process. \n\n2. The Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe Oshkosh WFP uses two regulated substances, gaseous chlorine and anhydrous ammonia. Both chlorine and anhydrous ammonia are toxic gases stored under pressure as a liquid. These substances are used to disinfect the City's drinking water.  \n\nThe average WFP chlorine inventory is eight (8) ton containers (2,000 pounds each), for a total of 16,000 pounds. The WFP chlorine storage room is equipped to store up to eighteen (18) ton containers for a total maximum storage inventory of 36,000 pounds.\n\nThe average WFP anhydrous ammonia inventor is 8,670 pounds, the equivalent of one (1) 2,000-gallon capacity bulk storage tank that is 85 percent full. The WFP ammonia storage room is equipped with two (2) 2,000-gallon capacity bulk storage tanks, 85 percent full, for a maximum storage inventory of 17,340 pounds.\n\n3. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe Oshkosh WFP has taken the necessary steps to c"

      "SummaryText": "omply with the EPA Accidental Release Prevention Rule requirements as specified in Title 40 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 68 (40 CFR Part 68). The Plant is also in compliance with Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals Rule as specified in 29 CFR 1910.119. The chlorine ton containers are handled minimally outside of the facility and are stored indoors. The anhydrous ammonia storage system is located indoors; exterior system features are limited to a truck unloading connection. Water Filtration Plant operators are competent in the chlorine and ammonia system operations and are trained in the hazards and operating procedures associated with the chlorine and ammonia processes.\n\n4. Five-year Accident History\n\nThe Oshkosh WFP went on-line in December 1999. Since going on-line, no documented accidental releases have occurred.   \n\n5. Emergency Response Plan\n\nEmergency response by WFP employees is limited to minor, incidental releases only. The plant has coordinated emergency response actions with the City of Oshkosh Fire Department and the City of Oshkosh emergency dispatcher. The Oshkosh Water Filtration Plant Emergency Response Plan is reviewed annually and updated as needed.\n\n6. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe City of Oshkosh uses a continual improvement process to improve safety and minimize risks of release. The process includes periodic review of the RMP, operating procedures, training content and the Hazards Review. Modifications to these entities are documented as appropriate.\n\n"
