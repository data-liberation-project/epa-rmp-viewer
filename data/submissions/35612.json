The Risk Management Program rule was issued and is administered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). This rule, \"Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions\" (Part 68 of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR)), applies to a wide variety of facilities that handle, manufacture, store or use toxic and/or highly flammable substances.\nThe City of Pittsfield owns and operates the Cleveland Chlorinator Facility located at 29 Old Windsor Road in Hinsdale, Massachusetts.  The purpose of the facility is to generate chlorinated solution, which is used to disinfect the Pittsfield water supply.  The Cleveland Chlorinator Facility currently stores up to 6,000 pounds of chlorine in three one-ton containers.  The chlorinator facility is a dedicated building less than one mile away from the water treatment plant which is located next to the Cleveland Reservoir.  Since the Cleveland Chlorinator Facility stores more than 2,500 pounds of chlorine, the facility is required to comply with the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68.\nThe goal of Part 68 - the Risk Management Program - is to prevent accidental releases of substances that can cause serious harm to the public and the environment from short-term exposures and to mitigate the severity of releases that do occur. The 1990 Amendments to the Clean Air Act (CAA) require EPA to issue a rule specifying the type of actions to be taken by facilities to prevent accidental releases of hazardous chemicals into the atmosphere and to reduce their potential impact on the public and the environment. Part 68 is that rule. \nThe phrase \"Risk Management Program\" refers to all of the requirements of Part 68, which must be implemented on an on-going basis. The phrase \"Risk Management Plan"

The Risk Management Program will include an analysis of the potential offsite consequences of an accidental release, a five-year accident history, a release prevention program and an emergency response program.\n* Covered facilities also must submit registration information (RMP Submit), to EPA no later than June 21, 1999 or the date on which the facility first has more than a threshold quantity, whichever is later and every five years thereafter.\n* Covered facilities also must continue to implement the Risk Management Program and update their RMPs periodically or when processes change, as required by the rule.\nThe plan contains the Policies and Procedures used at The Cleveland Chlorinator Facility to assure continued compliance with EPA Risk Management Program.  Most of the sections in this plan follow a standard format that includes the purpose, organization, responsibilities and authorities, as well as general step-by-step instructions. \nMost procedures contain information on document control and filing.  Typically, documents are periodically revised through the procedures outlined in Section 9, MANAGEMENT OF CHANGE.  The Risk Management Program Coordinator (RMPC) is the person authorized to revise these Policies and Procedures.  \nAll employees are strongly encouraged to review these Policies and Procedures.  The manual is available for review by any employee at any time; see the RMPC for a review copy of the manual.  Any recommendation to improve a document's accuracy or effectiveness in assuring employee, visitor and contractor safety can be directed to the RMPC.\nSection 2 - Management System\nThe implementation and management responsibilities for the Plan must be clearly defined.

The facility Water Superintendent, is responsible for the implementation of this Risk Management Plan and is identified throughout this document as the (RMPC).\nSection 3 - Hazard Assessment\nA major component of the Plan is the assessment of impact associated with the accidental release of the hazardous material(s) in question.  This section evaluates both the worst-case release as well as alternative releases that are specific to the site.\nThe analysis focused on the impact to neighboring areas called receptors.  Receptors include residences, schools, parks, prisons, commercial buildings, etc.  Graphic as well as tabulated exhibits help to define the impact of accidental releases.  These scenarios were recalculated for the five year anniversary updating population and receptor information.\nBased on guidelines provided by EPA in the 2004 RMP Submit Instruction Manual, release scenario information is not provided in this Executive Summary.\nSection 4 - Process Safety Information\nProcess Safety Information (PSI) is a repository for information related to the safety of a process.  Three major subjects addressed in this section are: \n* The hazards of the chemicals and the process (physical properties, toxicity and exposure limits, fire and explosion characteristics, reactivity data, thermal and chemical stability, corrosivity data).\n* The process technology (process chemistry, process flow diagrams, safe operating limits, maximum intended inventories, consequences of deviation).\n* Equipment information (piping and instrumentation diagrams, material and energy balances, safety systems involved, materials of construction, electrical classification, relief system design and design basis, ventilation system design and design basis, design codes and standards employed).

The MSDS are filed alphabetically at The Cleveland Chlorinator Facility.\nSection 5 - Process Hazard Analysis\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA) is a systematic approach toward evaluating the safety of a process.  PHAs must address the hazards of a process, previous incidents having potential for serious consequences, engineering and administrative controls, facility siting, human factors and an evaluation of the range of exposures if controls fail.  If there is more than one process, a schedule for completing PHAs must be formulated and be based on the extent of process hazards, the number of potentially affected employees, the age of the processes and the operating history of the process.  Employees must have input into the prioritization of PHAs and this schedule must be fully communicated to all employees.  PHAs must follow a standard methodology, such as a What If/Checklist Analysis and be performed by a cross-functional team with at least one person who is familiar with the process, at least once every five years.  A system for addressing, resolving, documenting and communicating all recommendations in a prompt manner must also be in place.\nTypical documentation should include information on how PHA studies were prioritized, employee briefings on the PHAs, a copy of each PHA file index and evidence of how PHA recommendations were completed.  These PHA files should include the pertinent process safety information.\nThe last PHA performed under the RMP program was conducted on June 9, 2004.  The PHA was facilitated by Michael Matilainen, Certified Safety Professional / Certified Industrial Hygienist, of Tighe & Bond.  In attendance were operations personnel from the facility and the RMPC.  The results of the PHA were reviewed by the RMPC prior to final approval and incorporation into the RMP.\nSection 6 - Operating Procedures\nOperating procedures are instructions that outline how"
