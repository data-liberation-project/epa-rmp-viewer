Three of these areas are covered under the RMP rule (PX2, PX3, OSBL).  All three of the covered units qualify for Program 3 coverage. The covered processes contain regulated flammable mixtures held above the threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds and the OSBL area contains a 29% solution of aqueous ammonia over the threshold quantity.   The flammable mixtures contain various regulated substances such as but not limited to propane and ethylene.\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT RESULTS\n\nThe RMP rule requires facilities to calculate worst case and alternative release scenarios for each regulated substance on-site.
