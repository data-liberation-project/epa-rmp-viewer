This commitment is demonstrated by significant investments of resources to prevent releases of hazardous substances and accident prevention, such as employee participation and training and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of processes.  PEC policy is to implement practical controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances.  However, if a releases does occur, the Thomasville Gas Plant has a well-defined emergency action plan and trained personnel to control and contain the release.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe PEC operates the Thomasville Gas Plant, located in Brandon, Mississippi, to produce natural gas and sulfur from sour gas.  The facility consists of an outdoor gas processing facility and control room.  The process section consists of inlet gas separators, patented Sulfinol Treatment process for the removal of hydrogen sulfide, sulfur plant, incinerator, and all utilities necessary the plant operation. (Please see bitmap file PECSITE.BMP of Thomasville Gas Plant Site Plan).  The plant has an excellent safety and environmental record, with a high level of employee involvement and commitment to operational excellence.  \n\nThe Thomasville Gas Plant has one toxic substance listed in the EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) rule, hydrogen sulfide, and one flammable regulated substance, methane, above the threshold quantity of 10,000 lbs each. The process operations are covered by OSHA's process safety management (PSM) standard and are considered Program Level 3 for the RMP rule.\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCES ANALYSIS RESULTS\n\nIn order to continuously improve safety and environmental operations of its facilities, PEC initiated a hazard analysis (HA) of the Thomasville Gas Plant process.

It must be noted an extensive emergency response plan has been implemented at the site to comply with the requirements of the Mississippi Oil and Gas Board since the inception of the plant and this consists of a network of hydrogen sulfide monitors and on-line computer- based emergency shutdown (ESD) system.  To perform the hazard analysis, PEC assembled a team of experts who are familiar with the design, operation, and maintenance of the gas plant operations.  The HA team used the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance, U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), dated May 24, 1996 and other EPA guidance documents, as necessary.  The HA team used RMPComp and Area Locations of Hazardous Atmospheres (ALOHA) software, developed by EPA and CAMEO team of the Chemical Emergency Preparedness and Prevention Office (CEPPO), respectively to conduct the calculations.  The calculations were plotted using Mapping Application for Response, Planning, and Local Operational Tasks (MARPLOT).  The results of the offsite consequence analysis for toxic and flammable substances are provided below.\n\nToxic Substance Offsite Consequence Analysis Results\n\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with the toxic substance is a catastrophic failure of the sulfinol contactor, releasing the entire content of the vessel, containing 3,250 lbs of gaseous H2S over a 10-minute period.  Although PEC has numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for administrative controls or passive mitigation measures was taken into account for evaluating this scenario.  The maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 30 ppm for this WCS is 2.3 miles.

The release duration of 10 minutes is the approximate time necessary for operators to detect and stop the release.  No other mitigating measures were taken into account in evaluating this scenario.  The maximum distance to the endpoint of 30 ppm (0.042 milligrams per liter) for this ARS is 450 feet. (Please see bitmap file PECTXAR1.BMP.) \n\nFlammable Substance Offsite Consequence Analysis\n\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with the flammable substance is a catastrophic release of the entire content of the sulfinol contactor, releasing a mixture of hydrogen sulfide (discussed in previous section) and methane, containing 6200 lbs. of methane by weight  (Entire vapor section of the vessel volume).  A vapor cloud is formed containing the total quantity of methane and 10% of the vapor is assumed to detonate with a vapor cloud explosion (VCE).  The maximum distance to the endpoint of 1-psi for this WCS is 0.2 miles from the sulfinol contactor.  Although PEC has numerous controls to prevent such a release and to manage the consequences of such a release, no credit for any safeguards (e.g., passive mitigation measures) was taken into account in evaluating this WCS. (Please see bitmap file PECFLWC1.BMP.)\n\nThe alternate release scenario (ARS) associated with the flammable substance involves release of methane from catastrophic failure of a heat exchanger tube (1\" outside diameter tube) routed from the sales gas compressor discharge line, resulting in a release of 2400 lbs. in 10 minutes.  The release is expected to be isolated by the operators within 10 minutes (active mitigation).

Because the plant process regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) risk management program (RMP) regulation is also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management systems in place to implement the accidental release prevention program.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nThe Thomasville Gas Plant conducts its business using a teamwork approach.  A small plant environment and teamwork approach provide an active forum for employee participation in the implementation of PSM standard elements.  Examples of employee involvement range from participation in the initial process hazard analysis in 1992 to recent changes in operating procedures.  Employees have access to all information created as a part of the prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan in the PSM Manual.  In addition, specific employee participation activities include operations teams and periodic safety meetings to discuss specific safety-related topic.  Meeting attendance sheets are maintained as primary documentation. \n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe Thomasville Gas Plant develops and updates a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operations of the process.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis and configuration information.   A table summarizing the reference documents and their locations is readily available along with specific procedures for maint"

This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals. The Thomasville Gas Plant has established safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., level, temperatures, pressures) in process documentation. The Thomasville Gas Plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown).\n\nThe Thomasville Gas Plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nThe PEC Thomasville Gas Plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled. Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe PEC Thomasville Gas Plant primarily uses a combination of What-If, checklist and hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis techniques to perform these evaluations.

This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional safeguards when the team believes such measures are needed.\n\nThe PHA team findings are evaluated by local and corporate management for resolution. Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team. This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk ranking receive prompt attention. All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed. The formal resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five (5) years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating. The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained. Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe Thomasville Gas Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) process  startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) and normal shutdown. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.

New employees receive safety orientation in Thomasville Gas Plant operations.  After successfully completing this basic orientation, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate (e.g., through skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. This refresher training is conducted at least every three (3) years. All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.  For specific safety (e.g., H2S safety) and/or regulatory (e.g., hot work permits) issues, PEC develops highly interactive training for all employees on a routine basis.  \n\nContractors\n\nThe Thomasville Gas Plant uses contractors to supplement its work force during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.

Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any\nnew hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change. Affected\nchemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures,\nare updated to incorporate these changes. In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided\nany necessary training on the change.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nThe Thomasville Gas Plant promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have\nresulted in, a fire or explosion, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury. The goal of\neach investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the\nincident or a similar incident. The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to\nprevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to Thomasville Gas Plant management for resolution.\nCorrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked\nuntil they are resolved. The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the\ninvestigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the\nfindings. Incident investigation reports are retained for at least five (5) years so that the reports can be\nreviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidations.\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the PEC Thomasville Gas Plant\nperiodically conducts an audit to determine whether the proce"

Compliance audits are conducted at least every three (3) years.\nBoth hourly and staff personnel participate as audit team members. The audit team develops findings that\nare forwarded to Thomasville Gas Plant management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response\nto the audit team's findings are tracked until they are resolved. The final resolution of each finding is\ndocumented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.\n\n\nPROCESS-SPECIFIC SAFEGUARDS TO PREVENT ACCIDENTAL RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nThe regulated process at the PEC Thomasville Gas Plant has hazards that must be managed to ensure\ncontinued safe operation. The Thomasville Gas Plant has safety features to help (1) prevent occurrence of\na release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release. The\nfollowing is a description of existing process-specific safety features applicable to prevention of accidental\nrelease of a regulated substance in the facility. These safeguards, combined with the general prevention\nprogram described in the previous sections, collectively help prevent potential accident scenarios that could\nbe caused by equipment failures and human errors.\n\nRelease Detection / Prevention\n\n    An elaborate, state-of-the-art H2S detection and monitoring system, with numerous H2S continuous\n    monitoring detectors, strategically located, track ambient H2S concentration in low (1 ppm or less)\n    range, with alarm and automatic shutdown system to quickly detect and isolate the entire network\n    of the gas-gathering system as well as the gas plant itself\n\n    The inlet gas and sulfinol treatment system vessels and columns are designed for at least 1100 psig\n    maximum allowable working pressure (MAWP), while these are currently operated at less than 450\n    psig.  The flash gas system is designed for 300 psig MWP and is currently operated at less than 120\n    psi"
