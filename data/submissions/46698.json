      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY ? VICKSBURG\n\n\n1. Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies\n\nAt this new distribution facility, we plan to store chlorine and sulfur dioxide, which are considered hazardous by the EPA.  The same properties that make chlorine and sulfur dioxide valuable as commodity chemicals also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as that of our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle chlorine and sulfur dioxide, and the training of our personnel.\n\nThis new facility at Vicksburg is replacing our current facility in Jackson, Mississippi.  The new facility is much larger, and more remote from population centers and other potential public receptors.\n\nOur emergency response program is based upon The Chlorine Institute?s Pamphlet 64, Emergency Response Plans for Chlorine Facilities.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of the local fire authority and notification of our immediate neighbors.  Trained responders from the current Jackson facility will be moving to this new facility.\n\n\n2. The stationary source and regulated substances handled\n\nOne of the primary purposes of this facility will be to store chlorine and sulfur dioxide for distribution to our customers which include water treatment facilities and general industry.  Chlorine and sulfur dioxide are received in Department of Transportation (DOT) approved 150 pound cylinders and ton containers and are shipped in the same packages.  Chlorine and sulfur dioxide are not currently used, manufactured, or repackaged at this facility.  Access to the site is restricted to Harcros employees, and authorized contractors and visitors.  The maximum total inventory of chlorine at this facility will b"

The general accidental release prevention program and the specific prevention steps\n\nThis distribution facility complies with EPA?s Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.  This facility is operated in accordance with recommendations from The Chlorine Institute and with the Responsible Distribution Process of the National Association of Chemical Distributors.\n\n\n4. Five year accident history\n\nThis is a new facility and we have not stored RMP regulated substances before the date of this submittal.  Therefore, there have not been any reportable accidents.\n\n\n5. The emergency response program\n\nThis facility?s emergency response program is based upon The Chlorine Institute?s Pamphlet 64, Emergency Response Plans for Chlorine Facilities.  This plan is reviewed annually and updated when required.  All response team members attend annual refresher training including the use of response equipment on simulated leaks.  We work closely with our suppliers, customers, public responders, and The Chlorine Institute to continuously improve our emergency response capabilities.  Response team members at this facility were members of the response team at the old facility in Jackson.\n\n\n6. Planned changes to improve safety\n\nThis is a new facility and many changes are planned to increase efficiency, and to improve safety and security.  The movement of the distribution branch to this new facility is in itself a significant safety improvement.  We will continue to participate in The Chlorine Institute and the National Association of Chemical Distributor programs, and to continue to improve our operations in accordance with Responsible Distribution Guidelines.  \n\nAdditional operations are anticipated for this facility, and new safety challenges will accompany them.  We will continue to meet t"
