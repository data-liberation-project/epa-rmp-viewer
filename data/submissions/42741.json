              "Description": "PREVENTION PROGRAM CHLORINE:  Smurfit-Stone Container Corporation, Ontonagon Mill has an OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) program in place covering its chlorine operations.  The PSM program meets the requirements of the RMP and is thus utilized as the prevention section of the Ontonagon facility's RMP.  The Michigan Occupational Safety and Health Adminstration in January 2005 audited the Mill's PSM program.  There were no recommendations from this audit.  The Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) for the chlorine system was updated after an audit by the State in May 1998 and again in May 2004 after an intrnal review.  All materials, installation, and operating procedures follow TheChlorine Institue's recommendations.  Written operating procedures that relate to the chlorine system are maintained in the WWTP control room and are available electronically to all mill employees 24 hours a day on the Ontonagon Mill's internal website.  These procedures address the hazards of chlorine and how to safely complete the task required by the operators.  There is a written training program and all operating and maintenance employees dealing with chlorine are trained in the procedures and chlorine safety.  Refresher training will be conducted as often as necessary to ensure employees are operating or maintaining the system according to current procedures and are adhering to the current procedures.  The refresher training will include safety and the hazards of chlorine and avoidance of unsafe conditions.  Refresher training will be provide at least every three years.  Written procedures are maintained for ensuring the ongoing maintenance, inspection, and checking of the integrity of the chlorine system equipment.  Any incident that did or could have resulted in a catastrophic release of chlorine will be investigated.  All employees are required to report chlorine related incidents and document the incident using the mill's SERIOUS INCIDENT REPORT form.  The employee must notify their supervisor no later than the end of the current work shift of an incident and provide a SERIOUS INCIDENT REPORT form.  The correct use of the form and any forms completed as the result of a release of chlorine will be part of future safety training.  An incident investigation team will be formed for each reported incident.  The facility procedures established that prompt addressing and resolving of the incident investigation team's findings and recommendations is a requirement.",

              "Description": "PREVENTION PROGRAM AMMONIA:  A Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) for the ammonia process has been conducted and all concerns were addressed.  A tank failure is the worst case event.  The ammonia tank is inside a containment area that will contain the entire contents.  The system is inspected by the WWTP operator at least every 12 hours and would detect a problem before it became a major event.  All operating and maintenance personnel who work with or around ammonia have been trained in their job functions and how to work safely around ammonia.  Written operating procedures for the RMP covered ammonia system are maintained at the WWTP, copies are provided to each employee during their training, and are available electronically to all mill employees 24-hours a day on the Ontonagon Mill's internal website.  These procedures address the hazards of ammonia and how to safely complete the task.  Refresher training will be conducted as often as necessary to ensure employees are operating or maintaining the system according to current procedures and are adhering to the current procedures.  The refresher training will be provided at least every three years.  Smurfit-Stone WWTP operating employees will provide routine checks and inspections on the ammonia system.  Frequency of inspection: Daily visual inspections are made during the rounds of the WWTP operators.  Weekly inspections are made by the WWTP operators to check and document the condition of the area and the covered equipment per the checklist \"Weekly Cleanup Checklist\".  Maintance inspections are conducted as needed but at least annually.  Before a contractor is allowed to work on (including filling the bulk storage tank) the ammonia system, they must assure that their employees are trained and qualified to conduct the required work and to do it safely.  Any incident that did or could have resulted in a catastrophic release of ammonia will be investigated.  All employees are required to report ammonia related incidents and document the incident using the mill's SERIOUS INCIDENT REPORT form.  The employee must notify their supervisor no later than the end of the current work shift of an incident and provide a SERIOUS INCIDENT REPORT form.  The correct use of the form and any forms completed as the result of a release of ammonia will be part of safety training each employee involved in the operation and maintenance of the ammonia system recieves.  The facility procedures establish that prompt addressing and resolving of the incident investigation team's findings and recommendations is a requirement.",

This manual gives the detailed requirements that must be taken by each facility to develop its safety program.  The manual describes senior management's commitment to safety.  The safety policy assigns the responsibility and authority to the management team at each facility for conducting an effective safety program.\nThere is a written Corporate CHEMICAL HAZARDOUS COMMUNICATION MANUAL.  The manual describes how each facility is to develop its own Hazardous Communication program.  The manual assigns the responsibility and authority to the management team at each facility for developing an effective Hazardous Communication program.\n\nOntonagon Mill Policy:\nIt is the policy of Smurfit-Stone Container Enterprises, Inc., Ontonagon, Michigan to conduct its business to insure the likelihood of a release of Chlorine or Ammonia is minimized, and if there is a release, the offsite consequence will be reduced.  To accomplish this the equipment associated with the chlorine and ammonia systems are maintained according to good engineering and maintenance practices.  The operating and maintenance employees utilizing the chlorine and ammonia systems have been trained in the safety requirements of the two materials.\n\nDescription of Ontonagon Mill Operation:\nSmurfit-Stone Containe Enterprises, Inc. Ontonagon facility produces corrugating medium on two paper machines.  The mill produces the pulp for the corrugating medium from recycle fiber and a carbonate-based semi-chemical pulping process.\n\nDescription of RMP Systems:\nChlorine\nThe mill has a high rate activated sludge wastewater treatment system.  This wastewater treatment system is sensitive to stressors from the mill operations.  Sometimes the stressors result in an imbalance in the microbiological system, generating filamentous organisms.  These filaments in turn create poor settling in the "

      "SummaryText": "final effluent.  To control the filaments (settling rate) chlorine is required.  Chlorine is used from one ton cylinders and is injected into the wastewater treatment process as needed to control the undesirable microorganisms.\n\nThe Ontonagon mill uses water from Lake Superior for all its process water needs.  The intake water is treated with chlorine to prevent biological fouling of process equipment.  Chlorine is used in one ton cylinders and is injected into the intake water as needed to prevent equipment fouling.\nThere will be a maximum of five cylinders connected at any one time.  Four for the wastewater process and one for the intake water process.  This number was determined by the need for chlorine.  Each of the connected cylinders is a separate but identical process.  There could be 20 cylinders (40,000 pounds) on site, connected and in storage, at a time.  In this arrangement a problem as defined by the worst-case release scenario will only involve one cylinder.\n\nAmmonia\nIn an activated sluge wastewater treatment system nutrients are required for the microorganisms to properly digest the contents of the waste stream.  Nitrogen is one of the requried nutrients and it is supplied to the process by feeding ammonia.  \nThe storage tank has a volume of 18,000 gallons.  The maximum volume in the tank is controlled to 15,000 gallons of a 30% solution of ammonia water.\n\nWorsrt-case release scenario:\nChlorine\nThe maximium volume of chlorine that will be in the largest container on site at any one time will be 2,000 pounds.  There can, however, be five of these containers in service at a time.  The arrangement is that each cylinder is a separate but identical process and the worst-case release on any one cylinder will not cause an effect on the other cylinders.  This will result in the worst-case release of 2,000 pounds or 200 pounds per minute.  There are no administrative controls on the chlorine inventory in use at the facility.  There are no passive control measu"

Administrative Controls in place restrict the quantity of ammonia solution in the 18,000-gallon tank to 15,000 gallons.  There are instructions to never fill the tank above the level of 15,000 gallons.  Documentation of the ammonia tank level is recorded on the WWTP daily log sheet.  There are instructions that the ammonia tank level must be below the 45-inch mark before ammonia is ordered.  This level provides for the introduction of a full truckload of ammonia without exceeding the limit of 15,000 gallons (85 inch) control point.  The ammonia tank has a passive containment system around it.  This passive system consists of a concrete secondary containment area that has a surface area of 1041 square feet and will contain all of the ammonia solution with an excess volume of 805 cubic feet.\n\nAlternative release scenario:\nChlorine\nA cylinder is in service with a regulator in place.  The regulator is hit causing the regulator to break off.  This will result in a leak equal to the maximum withdrawal rate from the cylinder.  Release quantity of chlorine will be 23.4 pounds or 0.39 pounds / minute and last for 60 minutes.  Under all conditions of alternative release scenarios there will be no offsite impact from the chlorine system.\n\nAmmonia\nThe hose used by the delivery truck to fill the ammonia tank breaks and releases the capacity of the truck pump.  The amount of material released is 4145 pounds of solution or 1244 pounds of ammonia.  Under all conditions of alternative release scenarios there will be no offsite impact from the ammonia system.  During a filling operation of the ammonia tank there is always a trained driver in attendance and would require only five minutes for the truck pump to be stopped and the valve closed.  There will be a release to the atmosphere for 20 minutes from the puddle formed.\n\nFive-y"

This PSM program meets the RMP requirements for a release prevention program.  The Michigan Occupational Safety and Health Administration conducted an audit of the mill's PSM program on January 4-6, 2005.  There were no recommendations from this audit.  The PSM program was approved as meeting the PSM requirements, and was last updated May 18, 2004.\n\nAmmonia\nAn OSHA PSM program is not required for this process, as ammonia is not on the list of materials requiring a PSM program.  The mill, however, has taken steps to use the knowledge and practices from the Chlorine PSM program to insure the safety of its ammonia process.  \nThe operators are trained in ammonia safety and correct operating procedures.  The operators conduct daily inspection rounds of the WWTP, including the ammonia system, to insure the WWTP is operating correctly.  Any concerns, including safety of the ammonia process, are reported to the maintenance department so corrections can be made.  \nThe maintenance eployees are trained in ammonia safety and how to complete the required work.\n\nGeneral prevention activities:\nThe mill has a staff of experienced and knowledgeable employees that receive refresher training on these systems at least every three years.  Each employee working with chlorine or ammonia has experience in the proper use of personnel protective equipment.  \nEmployees are trained how to change chlorine cylinders  as necessary and check for and correct small leaks that occur occassionally during the cylinder changing process.  If a leak can not be controled by closing the cylinder valve, the Village of Ontonagon Fire Department's hazardous materials (HAZMAT) team will be called to respond to the release.\n\nAny event involving a releas"
