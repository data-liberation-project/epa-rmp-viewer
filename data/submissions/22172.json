The following effects could occur at the endpoint distance. At distances less than the endpoint distance, the effects would be greater; at distances greater than the endpoint distance, the effects would be less.\n\nWhen considering the release of a toxic substance, most people at the endpoint distance would be able to walk away from the exposure without any long term health consequences, although some short term consequences (e.g., strong eye or throat irritation) are possible. Some people who are particularly susceptible to the substance released could be incapacitated.\n\nThe RMP rule includes specific requirements for the worst-case and alternative release scenarios that must be reported by Borden. These requirements are:\n\n\u00d8 one worst case release scenario for the class of toxic substances in Program 3 processes\n\n\u00d8 one alternative release scenario for each of the toxic substances in a Program 3 process\n\n\u00d8 one worst case and one alternative release scenario for the class of flammable substances in Program 3 processes\n\nThe following information summarizes the offsite consequence analysis performed by the Virginia Plant:\n\n1.3.1 Program 3 Processes-Toxic Substances - Formaldehyde Solutions\n\nThe worst case release scenario for a 50% solution of formaldehyde is the release of the entire contents of the largest storage tank, a 20,300 gallon (97,450 lbs of pure formaldehyde) tank. A concrete diked area contains the released formaldehyde solution which evaporates and forms a vapor cloud. The maximum distance to the toxic endpoint concentration based on modeling is 0.2 miles.

In fact, the Virginia Plant has a comprehensive safety program in place establishing many levels of safeguards against release of a hazardous substance and injuries and damage from a release of a hazardous substance.\n\nBorden limits the use of hazardous substances. Before using a hazardous substance at the Virginia Plant, less hazardous alternatives are considered. When a hazardous substance is used at the Virginia Plant, Borden considers the potential for this substance to adversely affect plant workers, the public, and the environment and takes steps to prevent any such effects.\n\nBorden prevents releases of the hazardous substances used at the facility. When a hazardous substance is used at the Virginia Plant, the equipment is carefully designed, built and operated to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release. Industry and government standards are closely adhered to in the design, construction, and operation of the equipment. \n\nBorden limits damage from a release, if such a release occurs. Borden trains its workers to respond to an accidental release, reducing the consequences of a release if it occurs. In addition, Borden works with the local fire department to help prevent injuries and/or environmental damage if a release does occur.\n\nThe safety program at the Virginia Plant consists of a number of elements, only some of which are required by the RMP rule. This RMP Plan is primarily intended to describe those parts of the safety program at the Virginia Plant that are required by the RMP rule.\n\n1.1 Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nBorden is committed to the safety of workers and the public, and the preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardou"

The plant requires that the contractor supervisors train each of their employees who will work at the plant before that worker begins work at the plant site. The plant periodically reviews contractors' training documents and work performance to help ensure that safe practices are followed.\n\n1.4.2 Chemical specific Prevention Steps\n\nIn addition to the required prevention program elements, the Virginia Plant has implemented safety features specific to the hazardous substances used at the plant. The following paragraphs describe some of these features.\n\nFormaldehyde solution-Industry standards are followed at the plant to help ensure safe handling of formaldehyde. The formaldehyde is stored in the plant's storage tank which is designed and constructed in accordance with ANSI standards. Workers who perform operations involving formaldehyde receive training emphasizing safe handling procedures for formaldehyde developed by the plant. The storage tank is surrounded by a concrete dike which is large enough to contain 100% of the volume of the tank should its entire contents be spilled.\n\n1.5 Five Year Accident History\n\nThe Virginia Plant has completed a five year accident history that indicates no off-site releases of toxic compounds.\n\nYear Number of Reported Accidents Substance Released Consequences\n\n1995: None;  No Offsite Impacts\n1996: None;  No Offsite Impacts\n1997: None;  No Offsite Impacts\n1998: None;  No Offsite Impacts\n1999: None;  No Offsite Impacts\n\n1.6 Emergency Response Programs\n\nThe Virginia Plant has established a wri"
