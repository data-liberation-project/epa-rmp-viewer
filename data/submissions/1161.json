Five year accudent history.\nThe wastewater treatment plants have not had any RMP releases during the past five years (1994-1998).\n6.  The emergency response program.\nOur emergency response program will be coordinated through the Port Arthur Fire Department and their hazmat team.  Ton response kits will be kept at the wastewater plant and on the Fire Department response truck.  Class A encapsulated suit will also be kept at both locations.\n7.

      "SummaryText": "1.  Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies.\nThe City of Port Arthur Port Acres Wastewater Plant uses chlorine gas, which is considered hazardous by the EPA.  The City is committed to its employees in the safe handling of chlorine.  We are also committed to reducing the threat to nearby members of the community.  All employees that handle chlorine in its container are hazwopper trained.  \nOur emergency response program will be coordianted with the Port Arthur Fire and Police Departments.  Our emergency plan includes procedures for notifying any affected neighborhoods.  \n2.  The stationary service and regulated substance handled.\nThe primary purpose of the facility is to treat and disinfect the wastewater effluent.  Chlorine is the only toxic chemical over the threshold limit used at this facility.  It is received in ton containers and is used for disinfection.  The facility has equipment in use for the safe handling and storage of the ton cylinders.  The total inventory of chlorine stored at this facility is 18,000 pounds.\n3.  The worst case release scenario and the alternative release scenario, including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario.\nWorst Case Scenario - Rupture of a ton cylinder would release 2000 lbs. of chlorine.  An addiitional 1200 lbs. would escape through the ruptured drum from the manifold system.  It is assumed that the entire contents are released as vapor, which is heavier than air.  The distance to the endpoint is 0087 mg/L.  All liquid leaks will be handled as a worst case scenario.\nAlternative Release Scenario - A 1/4 inch tubing that runs from the ton cylinder to the manifold breaks and releases chlorine gas.  It is estimated that 500 lbs. of chlorine would be release in a 60 minute time period.  Plant personnel will handle all gas leaks in order to minimize the release.\n4.  The general accidental release prevention program and the specific prevention steps.\nA"
