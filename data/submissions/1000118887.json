This designation applies due to the facility\u0092s storage of a propane (CAS 74-98-6) and n-butane (CAS 106-97-8) mixture exceeding 10,000 pounds, used as a propellant for aerosol paint cans.  \n\nFinished goods are stored and distributed from the warehouse, consisting of 12- and 18-ounce cans containing mixtures of propellant, flammable liquids, and paint solids. Propellant, while flammable and potentially explosive, is not inherently toxic.  \n\n---\n\n### 2.1 POTENTIAL RELEASE SCENARIO  \n\n#### 2.2 WORST-CASE SCENARIO  \nIn alignment with RMP requirements, a worst-case release scenario analysis was conducted, evaluating the maximum distance to the flammable endpoint. Since the facility stores only 12- and 18-ounce finished product cans without associated process piping or large vessels, the worst-case and alternate-case release scenarios are compare the impact of one pallet vs. two pallets double stacked. The difference between scenarios is negligible. \n\nThe analysis and endpoint determinations follow the guidance provided in USEPA\u0092s *Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance*.  \n\n---\n\n### 3.0 ACCIDENT HISTORY  \nOver the past five years, there have been no accidental releases of propellant at the Riverside warehouse resulting in:  \n- On-site death, injury, or significant property damage.  \n- Off-site death, injury, property damage, evacuation, shelter-in-place orders, or environmental harm.  \n\n---\n\n### 4.0 PREVENTION PROGRAM  \nWhile Program 1 processes under RMP regulations do not require a formal prevention program, the Riverside facility has implemented several design and operational safeguards to minimize fire or explosion risks. Key preventative measures include:  \n- **Warehouse De"
