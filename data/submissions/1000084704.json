To ensure that a release does not occur, the Plant has developed and implemented an effective release prevention program encompassing the twelve elements of both EPA RMP and OSHA Process Safety Management requirements. A risk management team, consisting of qualified personnel located onsite and at regional offices, is accountable for implementation, enforcement and oversight of the above elements of the release prevention program.\r\nIn addition to the above referenced EPA and OSHA prevention programs, chemical-specific prevention steps include:\r\n> System instruments and alarms to rapidly alert operators to any problems;\r\n> Periodic confirmation of safe process design in accordance with refrigeration industry standards and applicable codes and regulations;\r\n> Process and chemical-specific operating procedures and training to ensure that the system is operated safely; and\r\n> Maintenance, inspection and testing in accordance with refrigeration industry standards and manufacturer's recommendations to ensure system integrity.\r\n\r\n4. Five year accident history\r\nIn the last five years, the Holmes Foods facility has not experienced any significant accidental ammonia releases that resulted in injuries or property damage. The plant has maintained an excellent safety record throughout its operating history and has never had a major anhydrous ammonia release that could have had adverse effects on the public.\r\n\r\n5. The Emergency Preparedness and Response\r\nThe Holmes Foods recognizes that swift, efficient actions can minimize the potential for injury in the event of an accidental release.  Our emergency preparedness program includes an Emergency Action Plan and training to ensure that employees quickly recognize a release, assess whether they can safely abate it and immediately notify the Nixon Fire Department in the event of an emergen"

Planned Changes to Improve Safety and Maintaining a Safe Operation\r\nWe have already installed controls and protective systems to meet refrigeration system industry design safety standards and applicable regulations and continually work to safely manage chemical hazards to protect our employees and the community we serve. Each year we will review procedures, maintain equipment, follow safe work practices and coordinate with community emergency responders.  Periodically, we will audit our program, update our Process Hazard Analysis and implement any additional improvements recommended by these evaluations. Based on our most recent evaluation, we will be further improving our mechanical integrity, equipment controls and release detection and taking other prevention improvement measures. We continue this process on an ongoing basis."

      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\n1.  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\nHolmes Foods is committed to protecting the public, its employees, and the environment from any accidental releases of hazardous materials used at its facilities. Holmes Foods believes that the best way to prevent an accidental release is by being proactive in its approach to safety.  We have implemented safety, environmental protection, and risk management programs to prevent hazardous materials releases. We have an emergency preparedness program to be prepared to work with the Nixon Fire Department and Gonzales Count LEPC to minimize the potential impacts and notify the public of any actions necessary should an accidental release occur.\r\n\r\n2.  The Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\r\nHolmes Foods has four (4) ammonia refrigeration systems called Glycol, Red Water, Ice Making, and Freezer.  When aggregated, the combined inventory of all four systems exceeds the 10,000 lb. OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM, 29 CFR 1910.119) and EPA Risk Management Programs (RMP, 40 CFR 68) regulatory threshold quantity; however, the thresholds apply to each process, defined as follows under the regulations:\r\n40 CFR 68.3 Definitions\r\nProcess - ... any group of vessels that are interconnected, or separate vessels that are located such that a regulated substance could be involved in a potential release, shall be considered a single process.\r\nThe Ice Making and Red Water systems have interconnected piping making them one interconnected process under the regulations.  The Freezer system and Glycol systems are separate from Ice Making/Red Water and each other.  A review of the facility layout and potential accident scenarios was done within the process hazard analysis (PHA) and the PHA team has made a reasonable determination that no more than three (3) of the systems could be involved in the same accident and the total inventory of those 3 systems is above the Threshold Quantity.

      "SummaryText": "ased on the determination that there are no reasonable scenarios by which all four systems could all potentially be involved at one time in an accidental release, HF is documenting herein that the four systems together should not be considered either a single interconnected process or co-located processes that could simultaneously be involved in a release. However the inventory of the 3 systems does exceed the regulatory threshold therefore those 3 systems (Red Water, Ice Making, Freezer) are considered to covered by OSHA PSM or EPA RMP.  The glycol system is not collocated and is not specifically covered however the hazards of the Glycol system will be managed similarly to ensure compliance with the General Duty Clause.\r\nThe General Duty Clause (GDC)--Section 112(r)(1) of the Clean Air Act (CAA)--is a performance-based authority making owners and operators of facilities accountable for preventing accidental chemical releases regardless of quantity.  \r\nThe GDC requires owners and operators to:\r\n1.\tIdentify hazards which may result from accidental releases of extremely hazardous substances using appropriate hazard assessment techniques,\r\n2.\tDesign and maintain a safe facility taking such steps as are necessary to prevent releases, and\r\n3.\tMinimize the consequences of accidental releases which do occur.\r\nThe General Duty Clause applies to any facility producing, processing, handling, or storing any extremely hazardous substance.  EPA has indicated that general duty clause applies to RMP regulated chemicals present under Threshold Quantity and extremely hazardous substances identified under the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA).    \r\nAmmonia is the only substance present above the RMP threshold quantity. \r\n\r\n3. Accidental Release Prevention Program and Specific Prevention Steps.\r\nWe are careful to understand the hazards of ammonia and safely manage it. Our policies and programs call for preventing accidental releases, safely mitigating them on-"
