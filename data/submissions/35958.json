Wherever possible refrigeration system components are located in areas that are not as likely to become damaged (i.e., tanks and pipe runs are placed away from and protected from forklift and truck traffic). The facility maintains an ongoing emergency response program that prepares for safe evacuation and timely response by trained personnel.\n\n2.0 SEFF Miami and Anhydrous Ammonia.\n\nApproximately 17,724 lbs. of anhydrous ammonia is contained within the SEFF Miami refrigeration system. A Risk Management Plan has been developed as required, and is maintained in order to reduce the possibility of an accidental release of ammonia from the system. \n\n3.0  Accidental Release Prevention Program and Prevention Steps.\n\nSEFF Miami complies with all rules and regulations that pertain to the safe storage and use of anhydrous ammonia. Specific regulations include: OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) rule; OSHA Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response (HAZWOPER); OSHA Hazard Communication (HAZCOM); OSHA Employee Emergency Plans and Fire Prevention Plans; EPA Risk Management Plans (RMP). \n\nSpecific prevention steps have been implemented to increase the safety of operation of the ammonia refrigeration system. Specifically, an emergency shut down push button has been installed outside of the engine room, enabling remote shutdown of the ammonia refrigeration system. The ammonia system is inspected daily, and all refrigeration service valves have identification tags. Ultra-sonic pipe and vessel thickness testing was started in 1999, and is currently 50% complete. Twenty-four hour Hazardous Materials Technician/Incident Commander Training has been completed for all facility managers, maintenanc"

Security fencing has been installed around the facility, with security personnel on-site 24 hours, 7 days per week.\n\n4.0  Five Year Accident History.\n\nThere has been one reportable release of ammonia from the ammonia refrigeration system at SEFF Miami in the last five years. The release occurred in December of 2001. Approximately 85 pounds of ammonia was released from a relief valve. The problem that caused the release has been corrected. Final documentation of the correction was completed in January, 2002. There is a record of the release incident maintained on file as part of the facility Process Safety Management Program.\n\n5.0  SEFF Miami Emergency Response Program.\n\nSEFF Miami maintains an ongoing emergency response program in order to efficiently notify/evacuate employees, notify potential critical receptors in the community, and state/local emergency response agencies. The program includes initial and annual training for employees who respond to toxic chemical releases or potential releases. It also includes written procedures for proper first aid and emergency medical treatment to treat human exposures. Procedures for using emergency response equipment, and procedures to review/update the emergency response plan are also developed. The facility emergency response plan is coordinated with the local fire department as required by the Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act.\n\nDuring normal workday operation, the facility emergency response plan consists of employee notification (public address system) and evacuation, followed by notification of the Miami Fire & Rescue Department, Norland Station #38, 575 NW 199th St., by dialing 9-1-1.\n\n5.1  Red Cross shelter resources in the North Miami Beach area consists of pre-arranged service agreements with the local school board and some local churches.

Churches that would serve as a shelter would have food shipped in or supplied by a local vendor under contract.  In addition, the local Red Cross office warehouse is capable of supplying extra food, cots, basic first-aid supplies, and blankets, with access to the Broward County Red Cross supplies if needed.  An emergency management official (HAZMAT Team, Fire Department, Police Department, etc.) would decide if sheltering in place was adequate or additional shelter space was required in a given emergency. The OEM (Office of Emergency Management) would then direct the Red Cross to activate the shelter(s) determined to be located at a safe distance from the hot area.  Reference:  Red Cross Office of Dade County and Florida Keys, Inaki Rezola, Disaster Services, (305) 644-1200.\n\n6.0  Planned Changes to Improve Safety at SEFF Miami.\n\nFuture plans to improve anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system safety at the SEFF Miami facility consists of the following engineering and administrative controls: \n1. Repairing existing ammonia detectors and guard shack alarm indicators.\n2. Installing a temperature control system to signal problems with the refrigeration system. \n3. Completing a planned compressor upgrade.\n4. Replacing the exit doors in the engine room with tight sealing doors. \n5. Purchasing a PSM and Maintenance Management Program.\n6. Continuing annual operator training. \n7. Continuing HAZWOPER refresher training for facility responders. \n8. Periodic Process Safety Management Program audits. \n9. Continuing management of the facility PSM program elements."
