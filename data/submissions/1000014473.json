To accomplish this, J. Milicic & Son has chosen to use the software package, PSM Writer\u00c2\u00a9, software developed and distributed by Resource Compliance, Inc.  This software will assist us with compliance and provide a more efficient method to manage our CalARP and RMP-PSM program elements and keep them up to date.\n\n1.1\tJ. MILICIC & SON, RISK & PROCESS SAFETY MANAGEMENT PROGRAM\n\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that J. Milicic & Son has updated their unified Risk & Process Safety Management Program.  The program is in compliance with California\u00c2\u00bfs Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program (in California CCR Title 19, Chapter 4.5 Program Level 3 Elements.  At the Federal level, Title 40 CFR Part 68, and California OSHA\u00c2\u00bfs \u00c2\u00bfProcess Safety Management (PSM) of Acutely Hazardous Materials\u00c2\u00bf standard (in California CCR Title 8, Section 5189, \u00c2\u00bfProcess Safety Management of Acutely Hazardous Materials,\u00c2\u00bf and Federally Title 29 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 1910.119).

The program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of hazardous chemicals. Overall, the program is designed to prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.\n\nJ. Milicic & Son has an exemplary safety record, one that we are quite proud of. Our company has many policies and procedures in place to promote overall plant, worker and public safety.  We have: (1) prepared a unified program based on the PSM plan to meet CalARP and RMP obligations as well; (2) reorganized the program so that it meshes more closely with general J. Milicic & Son business practices; and (3) reviewed plan documentation forms and responsibilities.  The unified Risk & Process Safety Management Plan sets forth rules, procedures and practices that will help our employees protect themselves and our neighbors.\n\n1.2\tPROCESS DESCRIPTIONS\n\nJ. Milicic operates a commercial cold storage for table grapes.  The ammonia system provides refrigerating capacity five (5) precool rooms, five (5) storage rooms, and a hallway. \n\nThe systems operate as follows. High pressure liquid from our main receivers is piped to each cold room, where it passes through a liquid control valve into low temperature & pressure accumulator vessels. From the accumulators, cold liquid ammonia is circulated through evaporator coils. As heat is absorbed, the liquid ammonia vaporizes to form low temperature & pressure gas which is returned to the accumulator vessel. The ammonia vapor is returned from the accumulator vessels through a suction return line to our engine room, where it passes through the compressors. The high pressure discharge from the compressor is sent to the water cooled condenser where the high pressure gas ammonia is cooled, liquefied and returned to our receiver.\n\nThe system contains numerous safety devices including sensors which stop the co"

Lastly, an emergency \u00c2\u00bfdump box\u00c2\u00bf contains switches and valves to turn off equipment and vent ammonia if necessary. \n\nThe ammonia system at our facility consists of vessels which are interconnected, or which are co-located such that a release of ammonia could impact the ability to operate vessels that are not directly connected. Therefore, we are treating the system as a single process.\n\n1.3\tGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE & CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n1.3.1\tGENERAL.\n\nWe inform our employees engaged in process operations of the dangers of an accidental release of any one of the regulated chemicals in annual safety meetings.  These employees are made aware of the potential risks of the process chemicals involved.  During these meetings we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\n\nJ. Milicic & Son has also conducted an off-site impact analysis of worst-case and alternate-case release scenarios for each process.  These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release.  The results of the analyses are reported in the body of the program.\n\n1.3.2\tANHYDROUS AMMONIA.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration process at the J. Milicic & Son facility is an integral part of the overall business and operates most of the year. It is extremely important that this process is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner.  Management is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.\n\nOur refrigeration personnel monitor the ammonia refrigeration process and keep an active log book of all procedures and transactions that pertain to ammonia.  In addition, the system/process is checked frequently by one of the outside refrigeration contractors that w"

Milicic & Son has had no accidental releases within the last five (5) years. \n\n1.5\tEMERGENCY ACTION PLAN\n\nThis facility\u00c2\u00bfs emergency response program is based on the Cal/OSHA requirements for Emergency Action Plans (in California CCR Title 8, Section 3220, \u00c2\u00bfEmergency Action Plans.\u00c2\u00bf  Federally, Title 29 CFR 1910.38 and 1910.119), HAZWOPER (standard (in California CCR Title 8, Section 5192, \u00c2\u00bfHazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response,\u00c2\u00bf and Title 29 CFR 1910.120). \n\nStrategically, we will respond \u00c2\u00bfminimally\u00c2\u00bf to a release.  Under this plan we will call emergency personnel and evacuate the facility. Select J. Milicic & Son employees have been trained as First Responders Operations (as defined by the HAZWOPER regulation).  Those trained individuals will participate in a response event using only \u00c2\u00bfdefensive\u00c2\u00bf actions that can be safety completed with little or no personal protective equipment.   All offensive response activities would be done in coordination with the Kern County Environmental Health Department and their Hazardous Materials Response Team.\nEvery year at the beginning of the season we review with our employees our evacuation procedures in the event of an emergency, including a hazardous chemical release. \n\n1.6\tPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nOur company has an outstanding safety record, one that we are quite proud of.  Many policies and procedures have been implemented to promote overall plant, worker and public safety.  Nevertheless, J. Milicic & Son continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.  The overhaul of this Risk & Process Safety Management Program has been the primary recent improvement, and implementation of the program is our plan for improved safety in the near future.\n\nThe Risk & Process Safety Management Program has been written so that program elements are ali"

Thus, Safe Operating Procedures are grouped together for the benefit of our system operator.  Safe Operating Policies are grouped together so that appropriate office staff may administer them.  The Emergency Action Plan is now separated out and distributed widely through the plant for easy reference.  \n\nThe Risk & Process Safety Management Program documentation forms and company policy forms pertaining to employee, contractor, and community safety have been carefully reviewed so as to prevent unnecessary complexity and redundancy.  Our operators have assisted in the writing of Standard Operating Procedures, and they are presented in a format that is easy to use.  \n\nFor the future, J. Milicic & Son now thinks of the Risk & Process Safety Management Program as a \u00c2\u00bfliving document\u00c2\u00bf.  It is an interactive framework that guides safe action for J.
