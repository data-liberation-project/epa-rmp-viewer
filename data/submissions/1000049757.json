Because the storage tank contains greater than 10,000 # of ammonia which is used strictly for feed stock to the pipe reactor, that tank is considered to a level 3 process (reported as level 2 in past RMP's).  The pipe reactor also processes greater than 10,000# of ammonia and is also considered a level 3 process. \n\n\n\nCHS believes that the health, safety, and preservation of our environment are critical components of effective management and business success.  As a company, we are committed to:\n\n\n\n?Providing a secure and health conscious work environment for employees and visitors\n\n?Conducting our business with always having value for the communities in which we operate and in the spirit of a good neighbor\n\n?Meeting or exceeding the requirements of the environmental, health, & safety laws and regulations\n\n?Training employees on the environmental, health & safety requirements of their jobs\n\n?Working with government and other stakeholders to identify and solve problems\n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammonia (feed stock to the pipe reactor) is stored in a pressure vessel on the property. The anhydrous ammonia storage tank is equipped with a safety relief valve that are designed to release pressure in the event the tank becomes over pressurized.  The tank is also equipped with excessive flow valves that are designed to shut down the flow of ammonia if a sudden release should happen.\n\n\n\nThe worst-case release scenario for the storage tank (total maximum release from the storage tank within a 10 minute period) was calculated using RMP-Comp.\n\n\n\nThe same scenario was used for calculating the worst-case scenario for the pipe reactor operation.\n\n\n\nAn alternative release scenario for the storage tank was calculated using RMP-Comp.  The scenario involved the rupture of a transfer hose during filling of the tank."

The release point for that case was a pipe leak/rupture.  Tis would also be quickly detected by operating personnel and controlled in a short time using a combination of operating procedures and excess flow valves.  \n\n\n\nIn the event of a release from a storage facility that could impact the community, CHS advises those in the affected area to shelter in place until the plume dissipates.  Shelter in place involves everyone in the affected area seeking shelter indoors, shutting the windows and turning off the air conditioning and other ventilation systems.\n\n\n\nNo reportable accidents have occurred at this site within the last 5 years.\n\n\n\nThe site employees are trained in the characteristics and proper handling procedures for anhydrous ammonia.  They are equipped with the proper personal protective equipment for routine handling of the product.  The training also covers the basics in responding to emergencies involving ammonia releases and are available to assist the community first responders with technical information and advice.  The employees are considered as limited first responders in that they will handle any leak or spill they judge to be within their capabilities and training but are instructed in case of a major incident (one they can not handle) to activate the site emergency plan and to call for trained responders.\n\n\n\nCHS provide training, training material and emergency response information to the fire department with jurisdiction over this location. CHS also meets with concerned citizens and other interested parties about our risk management program and anhydrous ammonia safety in general.\n\n\n\nCHS continually updates the training provided to its employees.  Employees are trained in proper handling, facility inspections, ammonia characteris"
