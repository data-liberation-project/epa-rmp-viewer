EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\n\nIntroduction and Policies\n\n\n\nHuckabay Gas Plant, owned and operated by Colt G&P (North Texas) L.P., is committed to the same quality of safety and environmental excellence that all other Colt assets promote.  This philosophy involves making each and every employee and contractor accountable for their own safety as well as that of the community around them.  As a company we follow a close adherence to all applicable federal, state, and local laws to ensure a safe and healthy environment for all.\n\n\n\nEmployees who enter the Huckabay Gas Plant complete a thorough training, both in the classroom and on-the-job, that enables them to address emergency issues as they arise.  This preparation includes standard operational, emergency operational, and release prevention training.  In addition, periodic refresher courses help to keep operators' problem solving abilities up to date and in sync with our recurring safety improvements.  Our regular internal audits provide an excellent checks and balances system for monitoring these high standards that we set.\n\n\n\nThe Huckabay Gas Plant, located in rural Erath County, Texas, operates a variety of processes\n\nto recover natural gas liquids (NGLs) from field gas and stores them on site prior to sale to wholesale markets.  One 30,000 gallon NGL tank is used to store the regulated flammable liquids.  Additionally the facility consists of multiple small lube oil, waste oil, condensate and fuel tanks and their associated piping, valves, pumps, and compressors on site that support the plant's compression as well as the NGL tanks.  As such, the Huckabay Gas Plant is classified as a Program 3 RMP facility.\n\n\n\nThe purpose of the Risk Management Plan (RMPlan) is to provide information about our operations at the facility, our programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, our emergency response plans in case an accidental release should occur, our 5-year accident history, and our planned changes to improve safety at t"

In the case of the Huckabay Gas Plant, this would involve our 30,000 gallon flammable natural gas liquids tank (162,750 pounds).  Such a scenario is highly unlikely; however, using the EPAs RMP*Comp &trade; calculations, the distance at which the resulting vapor cloud explosion could cause an overpressure of 1 psi would be approximately 0.4 miles (approximately 2,112 feet).  An overpressure of 1 psi is the EPA's threshold for measurable impacts. \n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario characterized as a more likely scenario that would involve offsite consequences is calculated to reach approximately 0.2 miles (approximately 1056 feet) from the release point.  This distance calculation is also based on the EPAs RMP Comp, which is known to be highly conservative and should over predict any potential release from such a scenario.  We have selected the alternative release scenario vapor cloud explosion based on a vapor cloud explosion created when the vapors released from our 30,000 gallon condensate bullet tank due to a four inch puncture of the tank and a release of condensate vapor comes into contact with an ignition source.  The estimated release quantity is 18,609 pounds of condensate vapor in ten minutes.  As a conservative estimate it is assumed the condensate vapor would have a similar make up as the NGLs produced.  This incident could occur if a truck backs into the tank or piping is broken off of the tank in the event that a truck drives off while load lines are still connected.  As a method of preventing such events, signs are posted in conspicuous locations to provide constant reminders to the drivers about proper unloading techniques.  Barriers are in place to prevent trucks f"

Additionally, this sceanrio would account for any potential releases from process piping including flanges, joints, welds, valves, and valve seals, Any releases from vessels including drains, bleeds, cracks, seal failures, plug failures, overfiling, overpressurization, and venting would also be accounted for in this scenario.   \n\n\n\nColt has discussed these potential hydrocarbon releases with its employees and with local emergency response officials in Erath County, thereby further reducing the possibility of any impact on the public.  \n\n\n\nPrevention Program\n\n\n\nBelow is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Huckabay Gas Plant.  Because the processes at the facility are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Risk Management Program (RMP) and are also subject to the OSHA PSM, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation:  Active employee participation and involvement in the development and implementation of Huckabay Gas Plant's PSM program is an important step toward achieving the objective to prevent or minimize the consequences of catastrophic releases of toxic, reactive, flammable, or explosive chemicals.  Employee involvement will help to ensure that all perspectives regarding PSM are considered, and that the best ideas are implemented.  Open communications are encouraged between supervisors and employees regarding all safety and health issues.  Huckabay Gas Plant strongly promotes employee imvolvement in safety issues through existing programs.  These programs include Unit Safety Teams (which are made up of a cross section of employees and supervision), regularly scheduled safety meetings, tail-gate safety meetings, Hazard Communication, Safety Suggestion Forms, and special training programs (Emergency Response Training, First Aid, etc.). \n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information:  Complete"

The PSI will be useful to the operators; the team performing the PHA; those in charge of training; contractors; those conducting pre-startup safety reviews; and those in charge of updating the emergency preparedness plans.  Process safety information is readily available to all employees.  Huckabay Gas Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the process.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response / exposure treatment consideration, is provided in safety data sheets (SDSs).\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA):  Huckabay Gas Plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.  The facility primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) method analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.  Periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  \n\n\n\nOperating Procedures:  Huckabay Gas Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of "

These procedures provide guidance for experienced operators and also provide the basis for training new operators.  Operating procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The review and certification process involves both operators and technical staff.  \n\n\n\nTraining:  In addition to training on operating procedures, the facility has a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating the process.  Employees receive basic training on the operating procedures when they are first assigned to the plant and refresher training to ensure that their skill and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years.  All of this training is documented for each operator including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.  \n\n\n\nContractors:  Huckabay Gas Plant uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the facility has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have appropriate skills, (3) are aware of the hazards of their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site specific safety rules, and (6) inform facility personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with orientation sessions pertaining to these key points.  \n\n\n\nPre-startup Safety Review (PSSR):  Huckabay Gas Plant conducts a PSSR on any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in process safety information.

The goal of each investigation is to gather the facts, determine the root cause, and develop corrective action to prevent the reoccurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a reoccurrence, and forwards these results to the business management team for resolution.  \n\n\n\nCompliance Audits:  To help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the Huckabay Gas Plant periodically conducts an audit to determine whether procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.  Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years.  Both hourly and staff personnel participate as audit team members.  The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to Huckabay Gas Plant management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.  \n\n\n\nFive-year Accident History\n\n\n\nNo incident resulting in onsite or offsite impacts from a hydrocarbon release has occurred at the Huckabay Gas Plant within the last five years.
