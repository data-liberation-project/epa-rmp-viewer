      "SummaryText": "The City of Vacaville is required to develop and implement a Risk Management Program (RMP) for the Water Treatment Plant under U.S. EPA RMP regulations and California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program regulations due to the facility's use and storage of up to 10,700 pounds of chlorine.  The RMP is subject to Program 3 guidelines because the worst-case release scenario endpoint distance for chlorine exceeds the distance to the nearest public receptor and the quantity of chlorine utilized is sufficient to make the facility subject to the Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations administered by U.S. OSHA.  The facility's RMP consists of an offsite consequence analysis based on computational modeling, procedures for accidental release reporting, a prevention program, and an emergency response program.\n\nChlorine is added to surface water and well water treated at the facility in order to ensure purity of the drinking water and to meet California Department of Health Surfaces water treatment regulations by accomplishing the disinfection of any pathogens that might be present in the water supply.  The present chlorination system installed at Water Treatment Plant was designed in 1992 by Nolte and Associates in accordance with recognized and generally accepted good engineering practices, federal, state, and local design regulations and codes, and industry-specific design codes and standards.  The system is designed such that all chlorine is conveyed from the storage cylinders under vacuum pressure created by water flowing through an injector.  This design greatly enhances the overall safety of the system because regulator valves will not permit chlorine to be conveyed if the vacuum is lost, as would be the case under most possible failure scenarios.  \n\nAt most two one-ton chlorine cylinders can be connected to the chlorination system at a time.  Up to two additional one-ton cylinders may be stored in the chlorine room at a time, as well as eighteen 150-pound"

The 150-pound cylinders are stored in specially designed racks for distribution to other City well facilities.  This procedure provides for the greatest overall safety because there is an emergency vapor recovery system installed for the chlorine room at the Water Treatment Plant, which is designed to almost completely mitigate accidental releases of chlorine (less than 1 ppm is released to atmosphere).\n\nA Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) was conducted for the Water Treatment Plant as part of developing the facility's PSM.  The PHA is an organized and systematic effort to identify and analyze the significance of potential hazards associated with the processing or handling of highly hazardous chemicals.  The PHA focuses on equipment, instrumentation, utilities, human actions (routine and non-routine), and external factors that might impact the process.  These considerations assist in determining the hazards and potential failure points or failure modes of a process.  When hazard scenarios are identified, existing or proposed designs and operations are assessed to determine if appropriate engineering and administrative controls are in place.  If the current level of protection is determined insufficient, recommendations are made to eliminate and mitigate the scenarios.\n\nIn order to provide a thorough analysis as specific as possible to the Water Treatment Plant, the Hazards and Operability Analysis (HazOp) method, incorporating the guide-word approach, was selected for the PHA.  The HazOp Study was conducted on February 23, 1999 by a HazOp Team consisting of two employees of Block Environmental Services, with expertise in the HazOp process, and five members of the City's Staff, with collective expertise in the management and operations of both the City's water and wastewater treatment facilities.  \n\nThe PHA also included a seismic review to determine whether the facility and equipment are designed and"

In addition, risks posed by the date change to the year 2000 (Y2K) and possible computer system complications were also assessed as part of the PHA.  Several other external events that might impact the chlorination system were also examined, including fire, power failure, sabotage, flooding, and tornado.\n\nIn general, the HazOp team concluded that engineering controls, safety systems, and procedures in place at the facility achieve the lowest risk practicable for all deviations identified, based on the implementation of two recommendations, which are slated for May, 1999.  Because the flow of vapor chlorine relies on vacuum pressure created by the chlorine injectors, releases from any type of failure in the vapor chlorine portion of the system will necessarily be limited because valves on the cylinders and chlorinators will automatically close upon the loss of vacuum pressure that would accompany any release, unless it is directly from the cylinder (the only portion of the chlorination system that has positive pressure).  The type of release determined to pose the greatest risk is a breakage of the cylinder valve during cylinder changeover.\n\nThe Assistant Director of Public Works is assigned overall responsibility for the development, implementation, and integration of the RMP elements.  In addition, a management system is in place for implementing specific elements of the RMP.  The Utilities Operations Superintendent will implement most of these elements through supervisors, although certain tasks may be delegated to facility operators and maintenance personnel.\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis portion of the RMP involves developing and modeling a worst-case and an alternative theoretical release scenario to estimate the impact an accidental release may have on the public and environment in the surrounding area.

It is intended as a basis of comparison with other facilities, but it is not realistic to expect such a scenario to actually occur.  The alternative scenario was selected based on the PHA conducted for the facility.  It is both a more likely potential release scenario and of sufficient magnitude to reach receptors offsite.   For the alternative release scenario, more representative average daily atmospheric conditions are assumed.  OCA data reported for the RMP is based on data provided in the Risk Management Program Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants, published by U.S. EPA in October of 1998.  The toxic endpoint to be used for chlorine is 3 ppm, which is the maximum airborne concentration that most individuals could be exposed to for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms. \n\nThe worst-case release is predicted to reach the toxic endpoint at a distance of 1.3 miles from the facility.  Although the width of the area affected by chlorine concentrations of this magnitude, or footprint, is limited and will only extend downwind from the source, a circle with a 1.3 mile radius is drawn to identify potential offsite impacts.  Using interpolation of 1990 census block group data, it is estimated that 10,100 people live within this radius.  There are fifteen school and daycare facilities, one hospital, ten parks, one cultural center, and the Ulatis Community Center, Cultural Center, and Public Library located within this radius.  There are no environmental receptors within this distance.\n\nThe alternative release scenario chosen was identified in the PHA as posing the greatest risk (i.e. highest likelihood of occurrence and severest consequences) out of several release scenarios considered.

This is a result of U.S. EPA's recognition that measures taken to reduce and mitigate hazards to facility workers will also serve the same purpose for the surrounding community and environment.  Thus, in order to eliminate redundancy, the PSM is  referenced in the RMP.  The PSM consists of several elements that contain or describe procedures that must be implemented on an ongoing basis, including chlorine and process safety information,  process hazard analysis, operating procedures, employee training, contractor qualification, pre-startup safety reviews, mechanical integrity of equipment, management of change, incident investigation, and injury and illness prevention. \n\nThe intent of the Process Safety Information (PSI) section is to compile system information for use in conducting the Process Hazard Analysis and to help facility operators to identify and understand the hazards posed by those processes involving highly hazardous chemicals.   PSI must include information on the hazards of the highly hazardous chemicals used in the process, information on the technology of the process, and information on the equipment in the process.

The active mitigation provided by the vapor recovery system installed at the Plant must be ignored for the analysis because if it functions as designed, the release would not extend offsite above the endpoint, as required by the regulations.  Taking into account passive mitigation provided by the enclosure of the chlorine room, it is conservatively estimated that 13.5 pounds-per-minute of chlorine is released to the atmosphere over two minutes under such a scenario.  The endpoint for this release extends 0.1 miles from the facility.  Using interpolation of 1990 census block group data, it is estimated that 170 people live within this radius.  Only residences and commercial property are located within the alternative scenario endpoint distance.  There are no environmental receptors within this distance.\n\nIdentifying these potential receptors is only an indication that they could be adversely affected by such a release.  The likelihood, type, or severity of potential impacts on either public or environmental receptors is not assessed in this document.  Furthermore, it is not possible for the entire area within the endpoint circle to experience concentrations of chlorine above the endpoint value, as concentrations of chlorine will only exceed the endpoint within a relatively narrow, oval-shaped footprint.  It should also be reiterated that the vapor recovery system installed at the facility is designed to prevent chlorine from being released above concentrations that would create any offsite impacts, however its function had to be ignored for the OCA.\n\nThe accidental release reporting section of the RMP gives the details and definitions for what must be reported in the event of a significant release of chlorine.
