This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. LanzaJet is considered a non-responding facility for releases of the RMP-listed chemicals, so the site utilizes an Emergency Action Plan (EAP).\n\nThe stationary source and regulated substances handled [40 CFR 68.155(b)]:\nThe LanzaJet ATJ plant located at 535 Commerce Dr, Soperton, GA,  is designed to convert Ethanol to Synthetic Paraffinic Kerosene (SPK) and Synthetic Paraffinic Diesel (SPD) via the production of ethylene as an intermediate. This process entails three basic conversion steps, followed by a final fractionation step to yield the desired jet or diesel product cut.\n?\tEthanol dehydration to ethylene\n?\tOligomerization of ethylene and light olefins\n?\tHydrogenation of olefins to paraffins and final fractionation\n\nThe LanzaJet Alcohol-to-Jet process contains flammable mixtures (that include RMP-regulated substances) in quantities exceeding the RMP threshold. A requirement of the RMP rule is for the affected facility to prepare a worst-case release scenario analysis for each covered process. The LanzaJet is eligible for the RMP Program Level 1 because the facility has not had a reportable release in the previous five years, the distance to the flammable endpoint for a worst-case release is"

      "SummaryText": "less than the distance to any public receptor, and the facility has coordinated response efforts with the local emergency planning and response agencies. Under Program Level 1, LanzaJet is only required to include data for the worst-case release scenario, and therefore, only a worst-case scenario is included with this submittal.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps [40 CFR 68.155(c)]:\nLanzaJet is not required to implement the Program Level 3 prevention program requirements under the RMP regulations because they are eligible for RMP Program Level 1.\nHowever, LanzaJet is required to comply with the requirements for preventing or minimizing the consequences of catastrophic releases of flammable or explosive chemicals codified under the Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations (29 CFR 1910.119). The required elements of the PSM program relevant to general accidental release prevention are listed below:\n?\tEmployee Participation\n?\tProcess Safety Information\n?\tProcess Hazard Analysis\n?\tOperating Procedures\n?\tContractors\n?\tPre-startup Safety Review\n?\tMechanical Integrity\n?\tHot Work Permit\n?\tManagement of Change\n?\tIncident Investigation\n?\tEmergency Planning and Response\n?\tCompliance Audits\n?\tTrade Secrets\n\nLanzaJet has a program in place to comply with these items and their specific requirements.\n\nThe five-year accident history [40 CFR 68.155(d)]:\nLanzaJet Soperton facility has had no accidents meeting the definition in 40 CFR 68.42 in the past five years.\n\nThe emergency response program [40 CFR 68.155(e)]:\nAs a non-responding site, LanzaJet has developed a written emergency action plan (EAP) that includes activation of the local emergency notification system and calling 911 from a safe location, and directing an evacuation, including exit route assignments. All employees are trained to assist other employees in a safe and orderly evacuation. Should the scope of any incident exceed the capability of staff, such as a la"

Emergency exit routes are through any available gate for this outdoor location and muster points. The facility is a non-responding facility and relies on the Soperton Fire Department when necessary to respond to RMP chemical releases.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety [40 CFR 68.155(f)]:\nLanzaJet is continually improving and implementing its PSM/RMP program and safety systems. There is a process in place for the management team to review all potential process changes, including recommendations following process hazard analysis and compliance audits.  \n\nLanzaJet has completed this report to provide the public with information about our activities at this facility. We believe that, due to the many controls instituted to maintain a safe operation and our commitment to continuous improvement, an incident affecting our employees, or the surrounding area is unlikely to occur."
