      "SummaryText": "Chugach Electric Association, Inc. (Chugach) owns and operates the Southcentral Power Project (SPP).  Chugach has recently permitted four gas fired turbines of 59,900 hp each and four gas-fired duct burners of 140 MMBtu/hr each at their International Station Power Plant in Anchorage, Alaska.  Although four turbines and four duct burners were permitted, Chugach has chosen to only install three gas fired turbines and three gas-fired duct burners at this time.  The new units will be operating with selective catalytic reduction for NOX emission controls.  The facility will use aqueous ammonia solution (29.4 percent by weight) in the selective catalytic reduction process for NOX control.\r\nChugach has prepared this risk management plan (RMP) based on 40 CFR Part 68 and other published guidelines from EPA because SPP will have more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance in a process.  The aqueous ammonia storage and handling system is the only process at SPP that triggers the RMP requirement.  This process was determined to be covered by federal RMP Program Level 2 requirements.\r\nThe aqueous ammonia storage and handling system at the facility is comprised of two storage tanks, pumps, and piping which terminate at the vaporizer where the aqueous ammonia is atomized.  The tanks are each 12,000 gallons in volume and when full have a combined capacity for 52,638 pounds of ammonia onsite.  This exceeds the toxic substances threshold of 20,000 lb for ammonia with a concentration of greater than 20 percent.  The tanks are surrounded by a single dike that is capable of containing the entire contents of more than a single storage tank in case of equipment failure.\r\nThe worst case release scenario for SPP is that an aqueous ammonia storage tank fails and its full content of aqueous ammonia is released at one time.  An offsite consequence analysis was conducted using the EPA's RMP Guidance for Offsite Consequence Analysis (March 2009).  Under worst-case meteorological con"

The impact distance from a worst case release extends beyond the facility property.\r\nAn alternative release scenario for SPP is that aqueous ammonia is spilled while the tanks are being filled.  In this scenario, it's assumed that enough gallons of aqueous ammonia spill into the containment dike to cover the full area of the containment dike. Under the EPA's RMP Guidance for Offsite Consequence Analysis, the alternate release scenario meteorological conditions are 3.0 meters per second wind speed and an atmospheric stability class of D stability for urban releases.  In the alternate release scenario the ammonia cloud could travel 0.1 miles (528feet) before dispersing sufficiently to no longer pose a health hazard to the public.  The impact distance from an alternate release scenario also extends beyond the facility property.\r\nTo prevent future potential ammonia accidents with offsite impacts, Chugach has established the following practices:\r\n\u00bf\tThe facility utilizes an extensive, interconnected alarm system to monitor the tanks;\r\n\u00bf\tAccess to the site is restricted via guard gates to authorized personnel;\r\n\u00bf\tAll facility personnel are trained on safe work practices and the proper procedures to be followed should a leak or spill occur;\r\n\u00bf\tSpills are contained in the dike, minimizing the impact distance;\r\n\u00bf\tThe tanks and unloading areas are situated away from the main process area, such that if an accident were to occur, the area of highest impact would generally be away from employees; and\r\n\u00bf\tTanks are inspected to ensure their integrity.\r\nThere have been no accidental releases from the aqueous ammonia storage and handling system at the facility in the past five years.  Aqueous ammonia use will only begin in the second half of 2012 at SPP.\r\nChugach"

      "SummaryText": "has developed their accidental release prevention and emergency response policies.  These are described in the operating, maintenance and safety procedures for working with the aqueous ammonia solution and tanks.  The documents provided from the equipment vendors contain many of these procedures in Johnson March Systems, Inc.'s Operations and Maintenance Manual ,  Peerless' Control Narrative and TriTech Energy Services' SCR System Operation documents.\r\nAs part of the emergency response program, Chugach has contacted Emerald Alaska Inc. to respond to aqueous ammonia spills.  Chugach personnel will respond to smaller spills.  Chugach has also developed written emergency response plans as outlined in this document to ensure the protection of public health and the environment.  One document prepared for Chugach is the Emergency Action Plan for Ammonia - SPP Site and the other is the corporate document Corporate Safety Policy Manual that addresses 'Emergency Response and Action Plan' in Chapter 1.11.  The emergency response plan details procedures for informing the public and local emergency response agencies about accidents as well as first-aid and emergency medical treatment for exposure.  Those responding to spills are required to have proper training and knowledge of how to use emergency response equipment.\r\nChugach will retain records supporting this RMP for a minimum of five years."
