These substances are used in various\nprocesses throughout the facility to produce water treatment polymers. Substances that are used\nby Taylor that are regulated as either toxic substances or flammable substances by 40 CFR Part\n68 are as follows:\n\nToxic Substances:\n\n          Formaldehyde: Formaldehyde is received and stored as a 37 percent solution in water. \n     The maximum amount of 37 percent formaldehyde stored on-site is 77,000 pounds\n     (29,000 pounds pure formaldehyde).\n\nFlammable Substances:\n\n          Dimethylamine: Dimethylamine is received and stored as a 60 percent solution in water.\n     The maximum amount of 60 percent dimethylamine stored on-site is approximately\n     54,000 pounds (32,000 pounds pure dimethylamine).\n\n\nWorst-case Scenarios:\n\nAs required by the Risk Management Program Rule, worst case and alternative release scenarios\nwere evaluated and are discussed in this RMP.  As required, worst case scenarios are presented in\nthe RMP for one toxic substance and one flammable substance.  Alternative scenarios were\nprepared for each of the toxic substances with worst case endpoints located offsite and for one\nflammable substance.  The endpoint represents the distance at which a released substance must\ntravel before it disperses sufficiently to no longer pose a hazard to the public.  \n\nFor the worst case scenario, EPA has defined a worst-case release as the release of the largest\nquantity of a regulated substance from a vessel or process line failure that results in the greatest\ndistance to a specified endpoint.  For the worst-case analysis, the possible causes of the\nworst-case release or the probability that such a release might occur are not considered.  The\nrelease is simp"

      "SummaryText": "ly assumed to take place and the greatest amount held in a vessel is suddenly\nreleased.  The results of the worst case scenario analysis were as follows:\n\n          Toxic Substances: The formaldehyde storage tank was assumed to fail and subsequently\n     produce an instantaneous release of the entire tank contents.  The release was assumed to\n     evaporate over a 10-minute time period.  The passive mitigation control of the tank dike\n     were considered in limiting the release impacts.  The distance to the toxic endpoint was\n     estimated to be less than 0.19 miles. The release rate according to OCA Guidance was\n     calculated to be 0.067 pounds per minute.  However, a release rate of 0.2 pounds per\n     minute was entered into the RMP Submit document since this is the lowest value that can\n     be entered into the program.\n\n          Flammable Substances: The dimethylamine storage tank was assumed to fail and\n     subsequently  produce an instantaneous release of the entire tank contents that results in a\n     vapor cloud explosion.  No passive mitigation controls were considered in limiting the\n     release impacts.  The distance to the explosion endpoint was estimated to be less than\n     0.24 miles.\n\nAlternative Release Scenarios:\n\nAlternative release scenarios are more realistic scenarios that result in endpoints that affect public\nreceptors.  For formaldehyde the release was assumed to occur as a result of the uncoupling or\nrupture of a  transfer hose during unloading operations.  For flammable materials, the alternative\nrelease scenario assumed that dimethylamine was released as a result of the uncoupling or\nrupture of a hose during unloading operations. The durations for releasing these materials from a\nvessel/pipe for the alternative release scenarios were assumed to occur over a 45-second time\nperiod since the unloading operations are supervised.  With the exception of considering that\nthese transfer operations are monitored by personnel at all times,"

The key parts to the program are:  \n\n     Formal Company Risk Management Procedure that includes:\n          Management Systems Responsibilities\n          Risk Management Plan Coordinating Review Team\n          Risk Management Plan Changes and Updating\n          Recordkeeping Requirements\n          Communication and Coordination of Risk Management Information\n\n     DOT Hazardous Material Training\n     Contractor Performance Selection Process\n     Operating Procedures\n     Emergency Procedures\n     New Employee Environmental Health and Safety Orientation Training Program\n     Process Safety Program Auditing\n     Engineering Controls that Include Automatic Level and Interlock Alarms and Shutdowns\n     24-hour Emergency Communications\n\nAdditionally, the facility has programs to address the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM)\nrequirements for the chemicals formaldehyde and dimethylamine, such as:\n\n     Mechanical Integrity - Preventive Maintenance of Equipment\n     Pre-startup Safety Reviews\n     Management of Change\n     Process Hazard Analysis\n     Incident Investigation\n\n\nEmergency Response Program:\n\nThe facility also has an emergency response program (ERP) that has been enhanced as part of\nimplementing the Risk Management Program.  The ERP has historically been coordinated with\nthe county dispatcher (i.e., 911) and Lackawanna County Emergency Service and Pennsylvania\nEmergency Management Agency.\n\nAs part of preparing the RMP, the facility's five year accident history was reviewe"

No\naccidental releases from covered processes have occurred that resulted in deaths, injuries, or\nsignificant property damage on-site or off-site; or resulted in off-site evacuations or sheltering in\nplace. \n\n\nSafety Improvement:\n\nTaylor is committed to continuous improvement of safety.  Planned changes and policies to\npromote this improvement include updating and implementing safe work practices such as:\nconfined space entry permits; hot work permits; pipe entry permits; lock-out tag-out procedures;\nand hazard communication procedures."
