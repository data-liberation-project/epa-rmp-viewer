      "SummaryText": "FACILITY OVERVIEW:\nThe Diatec Environmental facility in Southgate, California produces non-hazardous, bio-degradable chemical flocculents used in the treatment of municipal sewage.  The facility is regulated under the federal Risk Management Program (RMP), due to onsite dimethylamine storage in excess of the federal RMP applicability threshold.  The stationary source covered process consists of two dimethylamine tanks (5600 gallons and 6200 gallons) that contain a mixture of 60 percent dimethylamine and 40 percent water.  The reaction vessel for mixing the dimethylamine with the other process chemical is 20 feet long with a diameter of 18 inches.  The reaction occurs at atmospheric pressure and goes to completion, resulting in non-hazardous material.  The reaction vessel is cooled to remove the heat of reaction and maintain a maximum temperature of 85 degrees fahrenheit.\n\nCHEMICAL SAFETY OVERVIEW:  \nThe facility's overall approach and commitment to chemical safety is demonstrated by the existing management, training, and maintenance programs as well as written operating procedures.  The management structure and oversight to ensure safety at the facility is documented in the Risk Management and Prevention Plan and includes compliance with applicable regulations, codes, and standards (40 CFR 68 and CCR Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5). \n\nRELEASE SCENARIOS:  \nWorst-case and alternative release scenario assessments were conducted for the facility's dimethylamine storage based on the United States Environmental Protection Agency's (USEPA's) RMP*Comp program.  The vapor cloud explosion scenario was considered  for both releases.  Residential exposure was present in the worst case secenario but not in the alternative scenario.  No public facilities were present in either the worst case scenario or the alternative scenario.  The resulting worst-case and alternative release impact zones were determined to be at a distance of 0.2 miles and .03 miles from the plant, respecti"

      "SummaryText": "vely.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:  \nThe facility has had no RMP-reportable accidents/releases within the five years proceeding RMP submittal.\n\nPREVENTION PROGRAM:  \nThe facility has a program of written operating procedures and on-the-job training that is designed to ensure that all operators are fully trained in safe and proper equipment operation.  Whenever new controls or equipment are installed, a walk through training is conducted before the new equipment is operated.  This training is conducted by either management or the vendor of the equipment.  The primary maintenance concerns involve the pumps, which are checked daily for proper performance.  When a pump starts to perform outside its normal operating parameters, the pump is immediately taken out of service and repaired or replaced.\n\nThe demethylamine storage tanks are surrounded by a dike that has the capability of holding greater than 110 percent of the contents of the largest tanks.  In addition, the process area and building are surrounded by a curb that would contain spilled  liquids within the process area. \n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:  \nThe facility has coordinated emergency response with the Los Angeles County Fire Department to ensure that they will respond to accidental releases from the facility.  The facility has also established a notification mechanism to ensure the Fire Department will be properly notified when response is required for a release.  Based on this coordination with the local emergency responders, the facility is not required to implement additional RMP emergency response program requirements.  \n\nSAFETY MANAGEMENT AND CHANGES:  \nThe facility is committed to ensuring its operations are safe and in accordance with all RMP requirements, and has established a senior manager responsible for RMP development, implementation, and compliance.  This manager is committed to maintain the safety of the RMP-covered dimethylamine storage through active adherence to the appropriate procedures"
