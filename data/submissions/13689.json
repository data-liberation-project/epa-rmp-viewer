The facility utilizes anhydrous ammonia (ammonia) as a refrigerant to maintain the proper temperature within the process equipment, tanks and cooler areas of the facility.  Anhydrous ammonia is an effective refrigerant that has been used for many years by most food processing facilities.  Ammonia is a gas at ambient temperatures but is handled as liquefied gas under pressure.  The refrigeration system consists of a high-pressure receiver, evaporators, compressors, piping and valves.\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nMaplehurst Farms, LLC is committed to safety for its employees, the physical plant, and the surrounding area.  The facility is complying with OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM), Title 29 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 1910.119, and EPA's Risk Management Program regulations (RMP), Title 40 CFR Part 68.  The purpose of these programs is to ensure that the refrigeration system is operated safely in order to prevent releases of ammonia from the system.  In addition, these programs serve to develop procedures to minimize releases in the event that they do occur, and to outline appropriate emergency response steps to take in the event of a release.\n\n\nWorst Case Release Scenario\nEPA's \"Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration\" (November 1998) and the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration's (IIAR) Risk Management Guidelines (1998) were the primary documents used to develop the worst case release scenario. The worst case release is one that is unlikely to occur.  The purpose of the worst case release analysis is to support a dialogue with the community on release prevention.  It is a conservative analysis and is not to serve as a rational basis for actual emergency response planning.\n\nThe worst case release scenario (as defined by EPA) is the "

      "SummaryText": "release of the largest quantity of ammonia from a vessel or process line failure that results in the greatest distance to a toxic endpoint.  The worst case release scenario for the refrigeration process is assumed to be a case where the total quantity of ammonia in the largest vessel is released.  The release scenario was performed assuming that the largest vessel was filled to capacity.  The largest vessel however is normally filled to twenty percent capacity.  There were no passive mitigation systems (dikes, berms, sumps or enclosures) considered in the analysis although the vessel is located indoors.\n\nThe toxic endpoint used for this scenario must be where the ambient concentration of ammonia is 0.14 mg/L or less.  This endpoint is a concentration below which nearly all individuals could be exposed to for one hour without serious health effects.  Based on Exhibit 4-4 in EPA's guidance, a release from the largest vessel would result in a situation where public receptors would be within the distance to the toxic endpoint.\n\n Alternative Case Release Scenario\nThe alternative case release scenario selected would be the lifting of a relief valve.  EPA's \"Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration's (IIAR) Risk Management Guidelines (1998) were the primary documents used to develop the alternative release scenario.  The alternative release scenario is one that is more likely to occur than the worst case release scenario.\n\nThe release scenario must meet two criteria:\n\n1. Must be more likely to occur than the worst case scenario, and\n2. Must reach an endpoint offsite, unless no such criteria exist.\n\nA possible release scenario is one in which the lifting of a relief valve occurs.  A relief valve will lift in the event of an overpressurization of the system to relieve pressure.  The capacities of the facility's refrigeration system relief valves range from 30.9 to 138 pounds of ammonia per minute.  The average value of the relief valves is 50 pounds per min"

      "SummaryText": "ute.  Many of the valves are located inside the building; therefore, the building would serve to attenuate the release to the outside atmosphere in many instances.  Building attenuation cannot be considered, however, if the release occurs near an open door or window or outside.  For the alternate release scenario, it was assumed that a relief valve lifts either outside or near an open door or window.  A relief rate of 50 pounds per minute was assumed because it is the average relief valve capacity.  It was assumed that a release would last only 10 minutes, which is EPA's default for most of its release scenarios.  Therefore, the total release to the atmosphere is assumed to be 500 pounds (50 pounds per minute X 10 minutes).\n\nThe toxic endpoint used for this scenario must be where the ambient concentration of ammonia is 0.14 mg/L or less.  This endpoint is a concentration below which nearly all individuals could be exposed for one hour without serious health effects.  Based on Exhibit 4-4 in EPA's guidance, a release from the largest vessel would result in a situation where public receptors would be within the distance to the toxic endpoint.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nAs a part of its PSM Program, Maplehurst Farms, LLC has established numerous programs that serve to prevent accidental releases of ammonia.  These programs include:\n\n7 Process Safety Information\n7 Process Hazard Analysis\n7 Operating Procedures\n7 Training\n7 Mechanical Integrity\n7 Management of Change\n7 Pre-Start-up Review\n7 Compliance Audits Incident Investigations\n7 Employee Participation\n7 Hot Work Permits\n7 Contractor Safety\n\n Emergency Response Information\nAs a part of the PSM Program, the facility maintains an Emergency Response Plan that was prepared in order to improve procedures to respond to an emergency incident and to increase the effectiveness of actions taken during an emergency incident.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response "

      "SummaryText": "including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuation procedures, and notification procedures for local emergency response agencies as well as the public.\n\nIn the event of an emergency incident involving the ammonia system, it is the policy of the facility to request assistance as necessary by calling 911.  Calling 911 will notify the Marion County Emergency Response Committee, the Indianapolis Police Department and the Indiana State Police if necessary.  In addition, the Marion County Emergency Response Committee has included Maplehurst Farms, LLC in its local emergency response plan.\n\nFive Year Accident History\nMaplehurst Farms, LLC has had an excellent record of preventing accidental release over the last 5 years.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies, there have been no accidental releases during this period.\n\nSteps to Improve Safety\nSeveral developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program.  In addition, the facility will continue to operate and maintain the system in accordance with IIAR Guidance and will continue to implement its OSHA PSM Program in conjunction with the Risk Management Program.\n\n\n\n"
