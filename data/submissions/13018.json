Chlorine-Specific Policies and Procedures\nChemical-specific prevention features of the plant include: the policies and procedures listed above and those of the chlorine specific program.  These include:\n7 Specific procedures for the operation of the chlorine process. \n7 Completion of a Pre-startup Safety Review prior to startup of the modified chlorine system.   The latest one was conducted on February 5, 1999.\n7 Specific emergency response procedures for chlorine releases as outlined below under both operating procedures and in the emergency response procedures. \n7 Specific training in the properties, hazards, handling requirements, and leak repair for chlorine. \n7 Finally, the details of both facility and equipment design are key to the safe operations of the chlorine system.\n \n1.4.2.2. Facility Design\nThe plant and support equipment of the chlorine storage building and control room meet and exceed design codes standards and good engineering practices.  The building is equipped with ambient ventilation area.  The control room has a fan ventilation system, which is on 24 hours a day.  All the vent air and any fumes are diluted and then removed from the room by the vent system.\n1.4.2.3. Equipment Design\nThere are two types of chlorine pipe systems, high and low (vacuum) pressure.  The high pressure chlorine piping system is made of chlorine compatible steel pipes or equipment.  These materials are steel or chlorine compatible non-metallic compound (not corroded by chlorine) rated to 500 psig.  The maximum pressure of the chlorine in the high pressure system is only 150 psig giving a 3 to 1 safety factor. The low pressure system operates under a vacuum pressure of 13 inches of mercury.

The first scenario is defined by EPA, which states that the < shall assume that the < maximum quantity in the largest vessel < is released as a gas over 10 minutes  due to an unspecified failure.  The alternative scenario is defined as more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario.\nAtmospheric dispersion modeling was performed to determine the distance traveled by the chlorine released before its concentration decreases to the toxic endpoint.  The EPA selected endpoint for chlorine is 0.0087 mg/l which equals 3 ppm. The 3 ppm endpoint is the Emergency Response Planning Guideline Level 2 (ERPG-2).  This is defined by the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) as the maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms which could impair an individual\u0012s ability to take protective action.  The residential population within a circle with a radius corresponding to the toxic endpoint distance was defined, to estimate the population potentially affected.\n1.3.1. WORST CASE   (c)(1)\n Atmospheric dispersion modeling for the worst case scenario was performed using the EPA assumptions.  Results demonstrate a distance of 1.30 miles to the toxic endpoint.  The residential population that could potentially be affected by the release is estimated at 11,261 people.  There are 24 public receptors included in that release area.\n1.3.2. ALTERNATIVE CASE   (c)(2)\n The alternative release scenario involves the failure of the yoke assembly regulator of the pressure system connected to one of the one-ton containers. This failure is equal to creating a 1/16 inch diameter hole in either the yoke assembly, the drip tube, a pipe, or even the container.  Modeling using the EPA  water g"

This is coordinated with the City of Neptune Beach Fire Department.\n1.4.1. GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM   (d)(1)\n Plant-wide, many elements of the prevention program are used for all operations. An overview of the generally written programs are listed below:\n7 The City of Neptune Beach has detailed process safety information on each of its operations. \n7 The DMS, document maintenance system, is integral to the management of change for all operations on site control.  \n7 Training is the backbone of employee knowledge, job operations and is ongoing in each area.  Employee training in operations and maintenance emphasizes awareness of the hazardous and toxic properties of all chemicals used. \n7 Maintenance and preventive maintenance are used for all operations making mechanical integrity a part of each piece of equipment. \n7 Incident investigations of accidents and near-miss incidents ensure we learn from each event as well as correct the causes of the incident. \n7 Employees participate in all aspects of the plant as listed below under emergency response. \n7 Safe work practices are used throughout the facility including:  1) Hot Work Permits, 2) Lock Out Tag Out Permits, 3) Vessel Entry Permits, 4) Site Security, and 5) Breaking Into Chemical Lines. \n7"
