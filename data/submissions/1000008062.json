The mitigating factor of the building is not considered in computing the release rate to the atmosphere for either scenario. \n\nThe worst-case scenario assumes a one-ton cylinder fails and discharges 2000 pounds of chlorine gas in ten minutes. This results in a discharge rate of 200 pounds per minute to the atmosphere. No active or passive factors are assumed to mitigate this release. The EPA CEPP RMP Guidance, dtd October 1998 (RMP Guidance), determines a footprint with a radius of 1.3 miles around the plant is the area affected by this release. The area has a population of 5200 and public receptors of residences and schools.\n\n\nThe alternate scenario assumes the fusible plug metal blows out on a one ton cylinder filled to capacity. This causes chlorine gas to escape through a 3/8-inch hole. This scenario creates the greatest release of gas to the atmosphere. Using the RMP Guidance, the release rate is 37 pounds per minute with the radius of 0.1 miles around the plant as the footprint of the area affected. This footprint does not affect any public or environmental receptors.\n\nEMERGENCY PLANNING AND RESPONSE\n\nOur emergency planning and response program addresses the actions that our employees are to take in the event of an unwanted release of a highly hazardous chemical at our facility. We have established an emergency action plan, which provides procedures for planning and responding to a release of a highly hazardous chemical.\n\nThe purpose of this procedure is to ensure that FCSA maintains up-to-date and complete written emergency action plans (EAPs) and effective response capabilities for all covered processes.

The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that the facility is ready to safely operate new and modified regulated processes.\n\nPSSRs will be performed in conjunction with the Management of Change (MoC) procedure for major modifications to the covered systems at the facility. A major modification is defined as a modification that requires a change in process safety information. In addition, PSSRs will be performed for all new processes regulated under OSHA PSM and EPA RMP.\n\n\u00c2\u00bf Compliance audits, Section 68.79\n\nOur compliance audits evaluate the effectiveness of our compliance with the risk management program, identify any deficiencies in the program, and ensure that corrective actions are implemented in a timely manner. We conduct our audits at least every 3 years and retain the two most recent compliance audit reports. Our audits are conducted by at least one person who is knowledgeable of the process and we ensure that a report of any findings of the audit is developed and all deficiencies are corrected.\n\n The compliance audits will evaluate each PSM and RMP element, develop and implement corrective actions to address any identified deficiencies, and document the entire procedure. Compliance with each requirement will be evaluated based on the answers to the following questions:\nDo the established program procedures satisfy the EPA RMP and OSHA PSM standards?\nAre the established procedures being followed?\n\n\u00c2\u00bf Incident investigation, Section 68.81\n\nOur incident investigations examine the incidents that either resulted in, or could have resulted in, a catastrophic release of a highly hazardous chemical at our facility. Our investigations are initiated within 48 hours following the incident, and all written reports are retained for at least five years. The written report"

      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\nFrederick County Sanitation Authorities\u00c2\u00bf Risk Management Program is intended to reduce the risk to employees and the public of injury or death from accidental release of chemicals. FCSA\u00c2\u00bfs management is committed to this goal.\n\nThe Facility and the Regulated Chemical\n\nThe James H. Diehl Water Filtration Plant, 5100 Passage Rd. Stephens City VA 22655, withdraws water from abandoned limestone quarries. The water is treated to comply with Safe Drinking Water Act standards and pumped into the distribution system. Chlorine gas is used to disinfect the water and make it safe for consumption. The treatment plant may inventory a maximum of 8,000 lbs chlorine in one ton containers. \n\nPrevention Program Procedures:\n\nOur prevention program ensures that the elements of the risk management program are integrated and implemented on an ongoing basis, and that there is accountability and responsibility for the overall program and for each element of the program. An organizational table describing the lines of accountability and responsibility is included in the written plan. Our hazard prevention program follows the guidelines of Section 68.175 and addresses the following elements that are tailored to suit the degree of hazards present at our facility and the degree of complexity of our facility's operations:\u00c2\u00bf Process safety information, Section 68.65\nPrior to conducting any process hazard analyses, our facility compiles written process safety information regarding process chemicals, process technology, and process equipment. The purpose of compiling this written material is to enable our facility, and the employees involved in the operating processes at our facility, to identify and understand the potential hazards of processes that involve highly hazardous chemicals.\n\n\u00c2\u00bf Process hazard analysis, Section 68.67\nOur facility follows a thorough, orderly, and systematic approach for identifying, evaluating, and controlling processes that involve highly hazardous c"
