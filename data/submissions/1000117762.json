This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training and consideration of safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations and implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond and have the ability to control and contain the release.  \n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Plains Water Station operates 24 hours per day. The station is a water treatment facility that supplies water to the Borger Refinery. The NAICS Code for Water Supply operations is 22131. Chlorine is the only regulated toxic material used at the facility. Chlorine is used as a disinfectant during the water treatment process in the manner mandated by state and federal laws.\n\nThe site is a \u0093normally unoccupied remote facility\u0094 per the definition of OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119. The plant is automated to operate without continuous supervision. The plant is enclosed by a security fence with all gates and doors being secured during unmanned hours. Kay Water Station keeps and uses up to two (2) Chlorine cylinders on-site at any time.\n\nChlorine is stored under pressure as liquid in one-ton containers, located outside in ambient conditions. Chlorine must be stored under pressure to maintain its liquid state. The pressure varies with the ambient temperature (pressure increases as temperature increases). The cylinders are equipped with a fusible plug that acts as a pressure release if exposed to temperatures exceeding 150 degrees F. \n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT INFORMATION\n\n40 CFR Part 68, Subpart B - Hazard Assessment, outlines a specific"

Worst case and alternative case scenario modeling was completed using RMP*Comp software.\n\nACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no chlorine-related accidents at the facility within the past five years.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM INFORMATION\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the Plains Water Station. This document describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\nSAFETY INFORMATION (PSI)\n\nThe Plains Water Station keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to maintain safe operation of the process. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. Site personnel have access to PSI documentation.\n\nChemical specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response medical treatment considerations, is provided in Safety Data Sheets (SDS\u0092s). \n\nThe Plains Water Station also maintains technical documents that provide information about the design of process equipment. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nHAZARD REVIEW\n\nThe Plains Water Station has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the process are identified and controlled. Within this program, the process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nPlains Water Station uses the \u0093What If\u0094 and other analysis techniques to perform these evaluations for water stations. The analyses are conducted using a team o"

This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nThe process hazard analysis (PHA) team findings are reviewed with local management. Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team. This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention. All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed or resolved. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the Plains Water Station revalidates the hazard analysis results every 5 years.  The 5 year frequency will continue until the process is no longer operating.  PHA results are communicated to all affected personnel. \n\nOPERATING PROCEDURES\n\nStandard Operating Procedures (SOPs) are developed by a subject matter expert (SME) for critical operating tasks in each phase of operation in compliance with the EPA RMP regulation.  These procedures are kept evergreen and are reviewed and updated as they are used by operations or as part of an expiration review. An annual certification letter is signed by leadership attesting that the process unit\u0092s SOPs meet regulatory and local requirements and are valid for use.  Any change to a procedure is controlled through the Management of Change workflow process in AcceleratorKMS. Operations employees are required to initially train on applicable SOPs for their process and refresh on the procedures on an annual basis for emergency preparedness or triennially through revie"

Unit emergency drills are conducted regularly to evaluate emergency procedures. \n\nTRAINING\n\nThe Plains Water Station has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating the process to prevent accidental releases from operator error.  New employees receive basic training including safe handling of chlorine.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator assigned to the Water Stations will receive a process specific training plan. The facilitation of the training is performed by individuals knowledgeable in the process. Trainees will review a process overview, process system detail, understand and demonstrate job specific tasks, and review relevant operating procedures. After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, the trainee will receive qualification in the process unit.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years. All training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training. \n\nMAINTENANCE \n\nThe Plains Water Station has well-established practices and procedures to maintain chlorine containers, piping and material transfer systems, controls, and emergency systems in a safe operating condition. The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures. In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process equipment.\n\nMaintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safet"

If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or an MOC team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\n\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance. The Kay Water Station incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs. This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\nCOMPLIANCE AUDITS\n\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the facility periodically conducts self-audits to review the procedures and practices in place to prevent accidental releases. Compliance self-audits are conducted at least every 3 years. Both hourly and management personnel participate as audit team members. The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to the company management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.\n\nINCIDENT INVESTIGATION\n\nPhillips 66 personnel promptly investigate all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personnel injury.
