The ultimate objective is to minimize the risk of an accidental ammonia release.  The facility management has developed an Emergency Action and Response Plan along with training to ensure a fast and efficient response in the event of an accidental hazardous material release, fire or other emergency situation.\r\n\r\nIn order to prevent a potential accidental ammonia release at the facility, the Company has an ongoing review process for design and operating procedures.  This assists in ensuring the refrigeration systems comply with OSHA, EPA and all other local, state and federal regulatory agency safety standards, as well as its own internal standards.\r\n\r\nThe 4220 South Kildare LLC, is a refrigerated warehousing facility. The large majority of products stored are refrigerated foods for human consumption and inherently pose no known environmental or safety risks.  Ammonia, a regulated substance, is the commonly used refrigerant in industrial grade refrigeration systems that maintain low storage temperatures and can be safely managed by trained operators.  The ammonia refrigeration process functions within a closed piping network serving the facility operations. \r\n\r\nThe 4220 South Kildare LLC. is committed to safe management and operation of the closed loop Ammonia Refrigeration System.  Maintenance employees are trained to observe operational procedures designed to be as fail-safe as possible to prevent accidental release of ammonia at any time.  \r\n\r\nAs part of the 4220 South Kildare LLC.'s safety programs, we have adopted the OSHA Process Safety Management Plan as an integral part of our base safety manual.  The OSHA PSM Program has been implemented and covers the entire 14 elements under OSHA 1910.119 \r\n\r\nNormal operations rely on the following:\r\n\r\nO The Maintenance Management"

Maintenance technicians are notified of a deviation from\r\n normal operational specifications through indicator or alarm systems.\r\n \r\nO In the event of deviations, technicians are trained to analyze the situation,\r\n follow personal safety procedures at all times, determine that everything\r\n is under control and correct problems and/or deviations.\r\n \r\nO If a problem cannot be corrected immediately, the equipment needing\r\n repair service will be safely locked out of service until such time as\r\n\r\nO If a problem cannot be safely handled by the Maintenance Personnel, procedures are in place to obtain the required resources to correct the situation.\r\n \r\n During the past five years there have been no accidental releases at this facility.\r\n \r\n \r\nIt is the intent of the 4220 South Kildare LLC. to not only meet any regulatory requirement, but also take a pro-active approach into implementing these requirements as part of a working safety plan."
