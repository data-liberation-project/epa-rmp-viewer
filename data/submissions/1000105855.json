      "SummaryText": "The UNFI - Distribution Company LLC (Mechanicsville) facility is food products warehousing and distribution to client grocery stores and distribution centers. This building complex includes a Perishable Warehouse with an ammonia refrigeration system which contains over 10,000 pounds of ammonia.

Most piping and all key shutoff valves are located on the roof area for easier access in emergency conditions. Shutoff valves which allow operators to isolate sections of piping/equipment from areas of safety, such as the maintenance and compressor room areas, were installed many years ago. The compressor room area is well vented with high volume fans and is readily accessible in case of a release in that area. \n\nAs a testimony to the overall safety of the ammonia refrigeration system at this facility, and the diligence of the process operators, no accidents have occurred within the past five years which have necessitated an off-site evacuation or have had any off-site consequences.\n\nThe Hanover County LEPC has included the UNFI - Distribution Company LLC (Mechanicsville) facility in the community emergency plan for many years.
