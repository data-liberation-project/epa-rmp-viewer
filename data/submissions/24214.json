The Emergency Action Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Response section of the PSM/RMP document as well as the Business Plan.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n1.) To save lives.\n2.) To minimize and avoid injuries.\n3.) To protect the environment.\n4.) To minimize property damage.\n\nThe Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation assembly areas, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan was reviewed and updated at least once per year.\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe Telco facility was designed and constructed in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations.  The facility is located at 2111 West Valley Blvd., Colton, CA 92324 and began operation in 1999.  In October 2000, the facility added new freezer and cooler rooms which required additional evaporators (10), compressors (2), and condenser (1).  In July 2001, an additional separate and independent ammonia refrigeration system containing 21,000 lbs. of ammonia was installed.\n\nThe area immediately surrounding the facility is comprised of commercial areas and vacant fields with residences to the north.  The facility is situated approximately 0.3 miles north of Interstate 10.\n\nAmmonia is used as the refrigerant in the industrial refrigeration system that provides cold storage for food products.  The original ammonia refrigeration system uses 19,100 pounds of ammonia within a closed system for the purpose of manufacturing bakery products.  The July 2001 ammonia system uses 21,000 lbs of ammonia.  The system cycles ammonia through various physical states in order to provide cooling in the bakery production processes and cold storage rooms. \n\n\nHAZAR"

      "SummaryText": "D ASSESSMENT SUMMARY\n\nWorst Case Release Result Summary\nScenario Description: Since this facility has two separate and independent ammonia refrigeration systems, the worst case release is defined as the release scenario that has the greatest off-site consequence.  The worst case release for the original system (installed in 1999) resulted in a release rate of 654 lbs/min.  The worst case release from the new system (2001) resulted in a release rate of 1500 lbs/min.  Also both systems are located such that the potential off-site consequences are affected similarly by the distance.  Therefore, the worst case release for the facility is defined as follows:  The Controlled Pressure Receiver #2 (CPR-2) is the largest vessel in the July 2001 system (with a capacity of 27,000 pounds of ammonia) and is assumed to hold the entire charge for the worst case scenario, with the vessel contents released in a 10 minute time span. The release rate is limited by the ammonia charge of 21,000 lbs, and was calculated to be 1,155 pounds per minute, after passive mitigation effects due to the enclosure of the vessel in the Machine Room 2 were taken into account.  The most pessimistic meteorological conditions were used: 1.5 meters/second wind speed, and F stability.  The reference table, Exhibit 4-4, from the EPA's Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration was used to determine the distance to the toxic endpoint of 200 ppm for a release of 1,500 pounds per minute.  This release reaches offsite and may affect public receptors.  No environmental receptors were affected by this potential release.\n\nAlternative Release Result Summary (Both processes)\nScenario Description: Both systems operate in the same manner; therefore, the alternate release scenarios examined are the same.  A release of ammonia gas from a 1/4 inch diameter leak and is assumed to occur from the high side of the system, which is at 166 psig.  The meteorological conditions used were 3 meters per second wind "

The reference table, Exhibit 4-5, from the EPA's Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration was used to determine the distance to the toxic endpoint of 200 ppm for a release of 128 pounds per minute.  This release reaches offsite and may affect public receptors.  No environmental receptors were affected by this potential release.  \n\nPopulation estimates for the alternate release differ because of the different population estimate methods of the software (Landview, 1997) and the currently used software (Landview 2000). \n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nA sensor within Machine Room 1 will alarm at 125 ppm.  A signal is sent to the central computer and is logged within alarm history and will wait for operator response, otherwise, if time occurs, operators are paged.  An initial shutdown occurs at 250 ppm which does the following: (1) Shut down of solenoid valves in order to isolate the ammonia, (2) The purge ventilation fan is turned on with a manual reset required, (3) scrubbing system pumps and fans are turned on with a manual reset required, and (4) Signal is sent to notify operator (refrigeration contractor).  A final shutdown occurs at 10,000 ppm which de-energizes all of the equipment in the machine room including the compressors.  The facility is equipped with an automatic shut off button located outside of the Machine room.  If a release were to occur, operators can activate this prevention measure.  The majority of the ammonia equipment is located in the Machine Room. \n\nSensors are also located within Machine Room 2 (July 2001) which alarm at 30 ppm.  A signal is sent to the auto dialer (Security Link) who contacts operators.  At 120 ppm, Security Link is instructed to call the fire department.  Exhaust fans are energized and exhaust is routed from engine room to condenser inlet.  Automatic controls energize condenser fans.  Shutdown occurs at 10,000 ppm which de-energizes al"

The majority of those recommendations were completed by June 2000.  ries).\n\nA second Process Hazard Analysis study (including a HAZOP study, checklists and walkthrough) was performed on July 25, 2001 at Telco Food Products, Inc. for the ammonia system installed in July 2001.  There were several mitigation measures recommended at that time.  The recommendations will be completed by July 2002.  Some of the mitigation measures implemented included the following items:\n\nR01:Conduct an awareness training program that includes informing all employees of the following: 1) the presence of and the hazards associated with ammonia at the facility, 2) what to do if they observe an ammonia leak, and 3) where to go when they are told to evacuate.\n\nR02:Consider having local Fire Department team participate in the evacuation drills and familiarize "
