      "SummaryText": "United States Cold Storage, Inc. is committed to the safe operation of all our facilities to protect our workers, the public and the environment. This is accomplished to a great extent by a well developed, up-to-date and implemented Risk Management Program. All USCS facilities shall operate in a prudent and safe manner. It shall be the responsibility of the plant manager to ensure that all procedures are followed as set forth in our Risk Management and Process Safety Management programs. In the unlikely event of an accidental release it is USCS policy to immediately call the National Response Center, Local Emergency Response Committee, the local Fire Department and other agency(ies) that may be required. All USCS facilities will have an emergency response team to assist these agency(ies).\n\nUnited States Cold Storage, Dinuba, \"O\" Street is a public refrigerated warehouse that uses anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant in a closed loop system. Anhydrous ammonia, most commonly known as ammonia, is an excellent refrigerant and is commonly used in most of the world's industrial refrigeration systems. Ammonia has an excellent warning property, its odor. Ammonia's odor is familiar to most people due to the fact  that it is commonly used in household cleaning solutions. Ammonia can be detected as low as 5 parts per million (PPM) and has an average life span of 7 days in the environment before it breaks down to its common elements nitrogen and hydrogen.\n\nTypical items stored within USCS facilities are raw or processed food items that can be found in your supermarket or local restaurant. Temperatures range between +25 degrees to +40 degrees F. The refrigeration equipment and piping are located throughout  the facility. The condensers and high pressure receiver with related  piping  are located outside,  with the piping to and from the coolers and truck  docks. The machine room contains most of the large refrigeration machinery and vessels.  In an unlikely event of a refrigerant "

      "SummaryText": "leak in a refrigerated space, the ammonia vapor would be contained inside the space, due to the vapor tight construction of the facility. It then may be treated and/or vented under controlled conditions.  \n\nUSCS believes that prevention is foremost.  All of USCS facilities are maintained by a staff of trained maintenance personnel. Most of these people are members of the Refrigerating Engineers and Technicians Association (RETA) and all Chief Engineers are members of the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR).  USCS has on staff at the corporate level an OSHA and EPA coordinator/trainer who is a certified OSHA Instructor.  All facilities comply with OSHA's Process Safety Management without regard to the ammonia threshold quantity.  All the vessels and piping have been installed according to ASME vessel and piping codes and applicable local Building, Fire and Mechanical Codes.  \n\nThe facility's emergency response program is based on the OSHA requirements for 29 CFR 1910.38-Emergency Action Plan, OSHA's 1910.119, Process Safety Management and 1910.120 HAZWOPER standards. We have trained  employess for emergency response and maintain a written emergency response  plan.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\nThe USCS Dinuba facility has been operating at this location for the past 43 years. Within that long history the facility has seen few refrigerant releases. Since June, 1994, this facility has not experienced any accidents or releases from their refrigeration system(s) that resulted in deaths, injuries or significant property damage on site or offsite, deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS:\nWorst-case release scenario analysis: As required by law under Title 19, Public Safety, Chapter 4.5 California Accidental Release Prevention Program, Section 2750.3, and 40 CFR Part 68.25, Worst-case release scenario analysis, an analysis was prepared for the Dinuba facility.

      "SummaryText": "ates Environmental Protection Agency's Risk Management Program RMPComp for Ammonia  was used along with EPA's  formulas for ammonia. This worst-case release scenario is estimated to create the greatest distance in any direction to an endpoint of 200 ppm from the accidental release of anhydrous ammonia used as a refrigerant in a closed-loop refrigeration system. The quantity release was based on a \"Worst-case\" release scenario for a toxic gas liquified under pressure that is normally a gas at ambient temperature. The release was generated from the facility's high pressure receiver. Releasing xxxx pounds per minute for a 10 minute period with NO passive mitigation system in place, inside a facility. The Dinuba facility has offsite consequence.\n\nThe dispersion analysis used a wind speed of 1.5 meters per second and an \"F\" atmospheric stability class. With an ambient temperature of 77 degrees F (25C) and a relative humidity of 50%. Using a release height at ground level and a surface roughness class of Urban.  Dense gas was used for gas density.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario Analysis: As required by law under 40 CFR Part 68.28, Alternative release scenario analysis was prepared for the Dinuba facility. The United States Environmental Protection Agency's Risk Management Program RMP Comp a computer based program was used for this analysis. This alternative release scenario is estimated to create a distance to reach off-site in any direction to an endpoint of 200 ppm from an accidental release of ammonia used as a refrigerant in a closed-loop refrigeration system. The Dinuba facility has offsite consequence.\n\nThe alternative release scenario was piping failure on one of the bunker coils. The piping failure was identified through the review of our process hazard analysis (PHA) for the  Dinuba  facility's What-If Study. The failure scenario was identified under Subsystem(s) #18, question #8.  Passive mitigation system was in place, the release took place inside the facility."

Oil that is added to the refrigeration equipment is noted on the Daily Engine Room Log. Annual preventive maintenance of the refrigeration equipment  includes the bunker coils. \n\nThe second PHA recently performed for this facility produced no recommendations to improve safety. However the first PHA produced 24 recommendations to improve safety at the Dinuba facility. Such recommendation included installation of new mitigation and/or controls, equipment and/or technology."
