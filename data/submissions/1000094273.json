The header vents that are associated with the electrolyzer system were also opened after clearing which is the normal operation and the recommended procedure per the electrolyzer vendor. While performing work near these header vents, there was an upset situation with the Emergency Vebt Scrubber that caused partial loss of vacuum, thus allowing flow through the system to the header vents.  Inerts (air) from the header with a small amount of chlorine was released through the header vents.  A contractor was working on scaffolding below the header vents and was exposed to chlorine while exiting the scaffolding. From the learnings achieved investigating this event k2 Pure Solutions no longer allows vacuum to be considered part of an isolation plan. \r\n\r\nThe Emergency Response Program\r\nThe K2 Pure Solutions Emergency Response Plan has been developed to prepare our employees to respond in the event of a chemical release, fire of medical emergency in way that protects life, property and the community while protecting our employees from unnecessary risk.  The Plan consists of 11 elements:\r\n-\tGeneral Section \r\n-\tEmergency Coordination and Communications\r\n-\tFacility Plot Plan and Hazardous Wastes, Chemical Storage Areas\r\n-\tAccountability, Assembly, and Evacuation \r\n-\tReporting\r\n-\tCalculations and Reportable Quantities\r\n-\tRescue and Medical\r\n-\tEmergency Procedures\r\n-\tDecontamination\r\n-\tEmergency Equipment\r\n-\tHazard Communication\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\nSince the K2 Pure Solutions ECU and Bleach Plant is a new facility, every effort has been made to bring the plant on-line in the safest configuration possible.  Of course, potential improvements will be identified as we execute our PSM processes (PHA, Audit, Pre-Startup Safety Review, etc) and we will capture and prioritize them through our Corrective Action Review process."

Since every accident includes a sequence of contributing causes, it may be possible to avoid a repeat performance of the first event by recognizing and eliminating these causes. The removal of a single cause may prevent a recurrence.\r\nEmployee Participation\r\nThe policy of K2 Pure Solutions Pittsburg plant is to actively encourage employee participation in all aspects of process safety management.\r\nHot Work Permit\r\nEstablishing minimum standards for the performance of safe welding, cutting, brazing, grinding, or wherever the use of open flames or other spark producing equipment is used is vital to reduce the possibility of injuries to personnel and/or damages to plant facilities that could result from welding, cutting, brazing, grinding, use of open flames and electrical tools.  A Hot Work or Fire Permit Form shall be used in all situations where hot work is performed.\r\nContractors\r\nK2 Pure Solutions recognizes that the use of contractors is vital to the safe operation of the Pittsburg Plant.  However, since they are not routine workers in our plant, they have a limited understanding of our processes and may have different approaches doing work.  It is important that K2 Pure Solutions bring in only qualified contractors and ensure that they perform to the highest standards of safety.  This is accomplished through pre-qualification, education, and field auditing of contractors selected to perform work at K2 chemical process and storage areas.\r\nThe Five-Year Accident History\r\nK2 Pure Pittsburg has had one accidental release of chlorine in the past five years that resulted in an injury. \r\nOn October 26th, 2017, the plant Elecyrolyzer system was shut down for routine maintenance during a turnaround. After shutdown, the system was purged of chlorine and isolated to make safe for work. The isolation procedure allowed for a continuous line to be open between the area to be worked upon, and the plant"

The purpose of this standard is to define the procedure and authority levels for making plant changes in the implementation of continuous improvement in a manner that allows for team input. This will assure plant safety, environmental responsibility, product quality, and efficient plant operation.\r\nPre-Start-Up Safety Review\r\nTo assure all major safety aspects of new projects are adequately reviewed by necessary personnel and to minimize the risk of personal injury or loss of equipment a project safety review will be conducted for all projects or process changes that are:\r\n-\tNew to the Pittsburg plant.\r\n-\tBeing scaled up or scaled down in .\r\n-\tBeing modified to an extent that, in the judgment of the project manager, department managers, or plant manager, warrants a review for new hazards.\r\n-\tWhen the project is significant enough to require a change to the Process Safety Information.\r\nCompliance Audits\r\nIn the interest of continued safe operation of the Pittsburg Plant, as well as compliance with the law, K2 Pure Solutions believes that a frequent and robust compliance audit process is mandatory.  K2 Pure will work in cooperation with the Dow Chemical Company, third party consulting auditors and CCCHSD , in addition to conducting internal audits, to ensure the Accidental Release Prevention processes at the plant are always maintained in robust condition.\r\nIncident Investigation\r\nAll incidents, no matter how minor, whether personal injury or chemical release, shall be reporte"

This management system satisfies the requirements of Section 2735.6of the CalARP regulation and ensures that the risk management program elements are developed and continually improved.  All records associated with the prevention program elements will be retained for a minimum of five years unless otherwise specified in the CalARP regulation.  \r\nChemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\nThe prevention programs described in the following section represent integrated administrative controls intended to ensure the safety of workers, the public, and the environment.  Many of these prevention programs (e.g., PHAs, compliance audits, incident investigation) result in the development and implementation of additional safeguards (administrative and engineering controls).  Those recommendations that are planned for implementation at the K2 Pure Solutions Pittsburg Plant will be discussed in Planned Changes to Improve Safety.  Those applicable safeguards that have already been implemented or that were part of the original design are described below.  These safeguards prevent, detect, or mitigate accidental releases of regulated substances.  All covered processes have control systems designed to maintain operating"

A portion of the compressed gas (up to 100 tons/day) is diverted to make sodium hypochlorite bleach by direct contact with a solution of sodium hydroxide. All of the remaining compressed gas (up to 200 tons/day) is converted to liquid chlorine when the gas is cooled in two stages of refrigeration. The liquid chlorine from the liquefaction step is collected in the Chlorine Proof Tanks. Each of these storage tanks, which are maintained at 2 PSIG, has a maximum capacity of 101.5 tons of chlorine. These tanks are operated so that one is being filled while the other is being emptied.\r\nLiquid chlorine collected in the Chlorine Proof Tanks is analyzed to verify that it meets the quality specification requirements, and is then transferred to the High Grade Chlorine Storage Tanks. Each of these storage tanks, which are maintained at 50 PSIG, has a maximum capacity of 201.4 tons of chlorine. During operations, one tank is normally empty and the other is maintained with some inventory (200 tons or less).\r\nLiquid collected in the Low Grade Chlorine Storage Tanks is vaporized and used to supplement the chlorine flow to the sodium hypochlorite bleach plant. Liquid in the High Grade Chlorine Storage Tanks is vaporized and used to supply Corteva with chlorine via pipeline. None of the chlorine is loaded into railcars, ton containers, or any other form of transport vessel.\r\nIn addition to various meteorological parameters that could lessen the off-site consequences, the facility has the following engineering controls in place to reduce the amount of a release that are not allowed to be considered when preparing the worst case release:\r\n-\tArea monitors to detect and alarm when chlorine is detected in the atmosphere.\r\n-\tAbility to transfer chlorine from a leaking tank to another tank via a pump and / or padding system.\r\n-\tAbility to vent and ev"
