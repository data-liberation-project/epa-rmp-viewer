On-line ton containers rest on load cell scales, which allow the operators to monitor the chlorine weight remaining in each ton container. All on-line ton containers are equipped with Halogen actuators on the ton container valves. The primary bank is connected to the chlorine liquid header and the secondary bank is connected to the chlorine gas header.  The liquid chlorine passes from the ton containers to the evaporator where it is vaporized in a water bath.  Gaseous chlorine from the secondary bank of ton containers bypasses the evaporators, serving as an automatic backup when the primary ton containers run dry, or when the evaporators shut down due to (1) a low water level, (2) temperature condition, or (3) power loss.  Space is allocated in the room for the storage of additional ton containers without any connection to the chlorination system.\r\n\r\nThe gas header line is equipped with automatic switchover vacuum regulating valves (a combination of evaporator actuated vacuum regulating valve with check-relief unit and standby vacuum regulating valve with check-relief vent), and pressure gauges.  The liquid header line is equipped with pressure gauges and an expansion chamber to protect against excessive pressure.  The primary (liquid) bank provides all the chlorine to the station through the evaporators until it is depleted.  The gaseous chlorine bank automatically starts supplying chlorine when the primary bank is depleted.  This automatic system is achieved by setting the automatic vacuum regulating valve leading from the secondary bank to standby.

The LADWP has prepared an Emergency Response Plan for the Encino Chlorination Station to facilitate coordination and emergency planning with offsite response officials and facilities in the event of an emergency.  The Emergency Response Plan has been coordinated with the local response agency (City of Los Angeles Fire Department). The Encino Chlorination Station has a good record in preventing accidents from occurring. \r\n\r\nGeneral Facility and Regulated Substance Information\r\n\r\nThe Encino Chlorination Station is located at 4500 Encino Avenue, Encino, California.  The station serves to disinfect drinking water by chlorinating water in the reservoir and at various locations in the on-site water piping system.  The treated water is then piped into the distribution network, which serves parts of the San Fernando Valley with potable water.  The station consists of a three building complex: the pump station, the chlorination station and the membrane filtration plant. The facility stores chlorine, a regulated toxic substance under the EPA and CalARP Program rules. Chlorine ton containers can be attached to the liquid chlorine header for discharging chlorine, as well as to the gas header which provides an automatic backup supply. The maximum quantity of chlorine present at the Encino Chlorination Station at any given time exceeds the listed threshold quantities in the EPA and CalARP regulations.

      "SummaryText": "l 2006, a few minor changes in the piping system were made.  An update to the April 2006 Risk Management Plan, reflecting these minor changes was prepared in December 2006.  The LADWP prepared Program Level 2 RMPs from 1999 through 2006 because Encino Chlorination Station is not subject to Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations. However, in the excess of caution, the LADWP prepared a Program Level 3 RMP in 2010 for the ECS and submitted it to the LAFD. In April 2014, the LADWP performed a PHA for the ECS, including the ventilation system provided for the chlorination system. The LADWP, therefore, updated the ECS RMP prepared and submitted in 2010. This 2019 update of the 2014 RMP for the Encino Chlorination Station also demonstrates compliance with the Program Level 3 requirements.  \r\n\r\nThe following information is specifically required in the RMP Executive Summary: \r\n\r\n\u00bf\tAccidental release prevention and emergency response policies.\r\n\u00bf\tGeneral facility and regulated substances information.\r\n\u00bf\tSummary of the accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps.\r\n\u00bf\tFive-year accident history summary.\r\n\u00bf\tEmergency response program summary.\r\n\u00bf\tPlanned changes to improve safety.   \r\n\r\nThe above information for the Encino chlorination station is provided below.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nThe LADWP accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates the use of proven technology, trains staff in operation and maintenance practices, and uses tested and proven management system practices.  All applicable requirements of the State of California and the EPA's Prevention Program are adhered to, including key elements such as training, systems management, and emergency response procedures.  \r\nThe LADWP emergency response policy involves the preparation of emergency response plans for hazardous materials which are tailored to each facility and to the emergency response services avai"

      "SummaryText": "Chlorine is the most commonly used substance for disinfecting drinking water.  The addition of chlorine or chlorine compounds to water is called chlorination.  Chlorination is considered to be the most important process for preventing the spread of waterborne disease in drinking water.  The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP) also uses chlorine for drinking water disinfection purposes at the Encino Chlorination Station to protect public health per state and federal water quality standards.  Storing and handling large quantities of chlorine can create hazardous situations.  The LADWP takes safety obligations in storing and using chlorine as seriously as it takes in providing safe drinking water.  The LADWP has been operating the Encino Chlorination Station (ECS) since 1956. The ECS is a chlorination facility that stores and uses anhydrous chlorine for disinfection purposes.  The LADWP made significant improvements to the chlorination facility to further enhance the safety of the chlorine handling process. The modified chlorination facility is in operation since 2006. The Encino Chlorination Station chlorine handling process is subject to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program and Plan, and also to the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program regulations. The facilities subject to the EPA and CalARP regulations are required to prepare and update Risk Management Plans (RMPs). An update is required at least once every five years from the date of its initial submission.  The RMP is to include policies and procedures followed to safely operate the facility and the actions, which will be taken by the facility in an event of an emergency. \r\n\r\nA Risk Management Plan for the Encino Chlorination Station was prepared in June 1999 that was updated in June 2004.  The Risk Management Plan for the modified chlorination station was prepared in April 2006.  Subsequent to the preparation of the Risk Management Plan in Apri"

      "SummaryText": "rinators that regulate the flow of chlorine.  Chlorine gas from the vacuum regulating valve with check-relief units is pulled by vacuum to the chlorinators and then to the injectors located in an underground vault, cabinet, or within the membrane filtration building.  The injectors provide vacuum, which draws chlorine gas into mixing water to form a concentrated solution.  It is important to note that in case of loss of vacuum downstream of the vacuum regulating valve with check-relief unit, air would be drawn in rather than chlorine being released and the vacuum regulating valve with check-relief unit will shut down the chlorine supply to the chlorinator, operating as a shut-off valve. The concentrated water and chlorine solution is piped through diffusers into the reservoir and to various locations in the on-site water piping system. Process control is by a programmable controller, which determines the feed rate relative to the water flow rate.  There are flow meters transmitting flow signals to the controller.  Chlorine residual analyzers continuously monitor and record the treated water residuals.\r\n\r\nMultiple chlorine leak detectors have been installed inside the chlorine building, which alarm locally as well as at the LADWP Los Angeles Aqueduct Filtration Plant (LAAFP) Control Room at Sylmar.\r\nA dry media type chlorine gas scrubber system (main scrubber) is installed at the station.  The unit is actuated by chlorine detectors at a chlorine concentration of 3 ppm.  The scrubber is provided to neutralize an accidental release of chlorine gas from the chlorine storage or chlorinator rooms.  The scrubber draws suction from the chlorine storage and chlorinator rooms through a duct.  The station is equipped with uninterruptible power supply (UPS) in addition to a backup power generator.  Therefore, in case of the failure of regular power, the scrubber will be functional.\r\n\r\nA dry media chlorine mini-scrubber unit (MS) has also been installed at the Encino Chlorinat"

The MS is an emergency chlorine scrubber intended to protect personnel working in the building or immediate area from a chlorine gas release from the pressure safety relief vent provided in the vacuum regulator check units. Mini-scrubber can neutralize up to 25 lbs of chlorine, and the media manufacturer specifies chlorine removal to less than 5 parts per billion. The mini-scrubber is activated automatically at a chlorine concentration of 1 ppm.\r\n\r\nIn the event power is lost at the chlorination facility, an alarm will alert the LAAFP control room.  Chlorine flow will continue unaffected, with no safety consequences.  An emergency generator will automatically start and supply power to the entire system.\r\n\r\nThe facility is normally unoccupied; water treatment operators visit the facility daily. A response team coordinated from LADWP Los Angeles Aqueduct Filtration Plant (LAAFP) responds to any trouble alarms, which may occur.
