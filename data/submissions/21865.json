THE ACTIVITY OF THIS PLANT INVOLVES THE STORAGE AND TRANSFER OF THE PRODUCT.\n\nTHE COOPERATIVE'S STORAGE TANKS CONSIST OF 3 TANKS ( ONE TWELVE THOUSAND, ONE EIGHTEEN THOUSAND AND ONE THIRTY THOUSAND GALLON) WITH A  MAXIMUM QUANTITY STORED OF 263,000 LBS.  WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO WOULD BE A RELEASE AS A GAS OVER 10 MINUTES.  THE POTENTIAL QUANTITY RELEASE COULD BE 132,000 LBS., WHICH IS THE VOLUME OF THE LARGEST TANK AT 85%- AS LIMITED BY DESIGN STANDARDS AS WELL AS COMPANY POLICY.  DISTANCE TO ENDPOINT IS 2.5 MILES AND HAS THE POTENTIAL TO AFFECT NEARLY 2500 LOCAL RESIDENTS.  THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO BASED ON INDUSTRY INFORMATION COULD BE A RELEASE FROM A PIPE OR TRANSFER HOSE BREAK.  THE DISTANCE TO ENDPOINT IS .83 MILES.   PUBLIC RECEPTORS INCLUDE RESIDENCES, SCHOOLS, HOSPITALS, COUNTY JAIL AND COMMUNITY PARKS. \n\nOUR EMPLOYEES ARE TRAINED ON A REGULAR BASIS AND WITH THIS IN MIND MAKES IT REALLY EASY TO REPORT THAT THERE HAVE BEEN NO RELEASES OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA IN THE PAST 5 YEARS RESULTING  IN ANY INJURIES, DEATH, EVACUATION, SHELTERINMG IN PLACE, OR OTHER EMERGENCY PROCEDURES.  OUR EMERGENCY PLAN IS DESIGNED TO MINIMIZE RISKS TO EMPLOYEES, THE SURROUNDING PUBLIC, AS WELL AS EMERGENCY RESPONDERS.  OUR COMPANY WILL CONTIUE TO WORK WITH ALL IN THE INDUSTRY TO IMPROVE AND IMPLEMENT ANY NEW PRODEDURES FOR THE BETTERMENT AND INTEREEST OF SAFETY."
