The only chemical currently at Aquatics that meets this definition is chlorine (Cl2). Table 2.1.1 (below) lists the stationary sources to which this plan currently applies. The process at each identified stationary source is the treatment of swimming pool water using chlorine gas fed from a ton container.\n\nTABLE 2.1.1\nCovered Processes\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE    ADDRESS    Max Cl2\nLbs.\nMcDowell Mountain Ranch Aquatic Center    15525 N.

Protect public health and the environment through proper emergency response in the event of a catastrophic release.\n\nAll City managers are committed to these goals. This plan has the full approval of management with the authority to commit the necessary resources to implement it in accordance with the requirements of the RPM Standard and the policies of the City. The City will provide all funds, manpower, equipment and materials necessary to fully implement this plan.\n\nEach employee has a vested interest in providing for and assisting with the development and implementation of work practices to protect employee health, welfare and the environment.  All employees are responsible and accountable for safety performance including the responsibility to work safely at all times.\n\nAll City personnel have the authority and the obligation to cease any operation that could cause a catastrophic release or an unsafe emergency response.  No operation or work will be started unless it can be performed safely.  Supervisory personnel have the responsibili"

All orders for these spare parts and replacement parts must be approved by the responsible manager prior to purchase.\n\nAll of the processes covered in this plan are also subject to the OSHA PSM standard and therefore to the \"Program 3\" requirements of the EPA RMP Standard and this plan. All of the prevention requirements of A?A?68.65 through 68.87 have been implemented and are fully described in Section 5.0 of this plan.\n\n2.4 EMERGENCY RESPONSE\n\nThe City of Scottsdale has a fully developed and implemented emergency response program for the purpose of protecting public health and the environment. The program, which is described further in Section 6.0 of this plan, includes:\n\n1.    An emergency response plan that is maintained at each stationary source and contains at least: procedures for informing the public and local emergency response agencies about accidental releases; documentation of proper first-aid and emergency medical treatment necessary to treat accidental human exposures; and procedures and measures for emergency response after an accidental release of a regulated substance;\n\n2.    Procedures for the use of emergency response equipment and for its inspection, testing, and maintenance;\n\n3.    Training for all employees in relevant procedures; and\n\n4.    Procedures to review and update, as appropriate, the emergency response plan to reflect changes at the stationary source and ensure that employees are informed of changes.\n\nThe emergency response pla"
