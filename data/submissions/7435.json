Co., Inc.\nFacility Accidental Release Policy\nThe owners, management, and employees of Bakersfield Ag. Co., Inc. at 34710 Seventh Standard Road\nBakersfield, CA, 93312 are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.\nIf an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or\nother authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the \nenvironment.  A detailed emergency response plan has been developed and will be implemented in the \nevent of an accidental release.\nFacility Information\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage, blending, and sale of fertilizers, in addition to, the sale of\npre-packaged agricultural chemicals to farmers.\nAnhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for both direct application and for blending into\nmixed grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients.  The regulated pesticides are received, stored and\ndistributed for direct application in pest control.\nAnhydrous ammonia is received by tanker truck and stored in one above ground tank at the site.  The \nmaximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia hadled is 52,020 pounds.\nThe Worst-Case Release Scenario and Alternative Release Scenario\nAnhydrous Ammonia Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\nThe worst-case release scenario is failure of the largest storage tank when filled to the greatest amount would release 52,020 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85% capacity as limited by regulations.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 0.74 miles.  The alternative release scenario, based on the five-year accident history (or the most likely potential incident) is a release from a 3 inch line leak.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 0.41 miles.\nAccidental Release Preventio"
