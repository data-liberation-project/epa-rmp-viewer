The NAICS code for the processes at the facility is 311612.  Many areas of the plant are refrigerated to maintain temperature in the production and storage areas.\n\nThe facility uses ammonia for refrigeration, and is regulated under 40 CFR Part 68, the EPA RMP Rule. There is one RMP regulated refrigeration system onsite that is used for refrigerating meat products. The system originally contained a charge of 21,000 pounds of ammonia.  The amount of ammonia currently present in this refrigeration system is approximately 29,000 pounds, which is above the minimum threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds. \n\nAn aerial map identifying the site location is included as Appendix A. \n\nIV.\tHazard Assessment \u0096 Worst Case Scenario (WCS)\nAppendix B consists of the RMP*Submit Printout and contains additional information on the worst-case scenario.
