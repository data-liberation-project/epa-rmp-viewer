General accidental release and prevention policy of Performance Food Group.\n\nIn this frozen food distribution center we utilize anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant.  Anhydrous\nammonia is considered hazardous by the Environmental Protection Agency. The same properties\nthat make ammonia a valuable refrigerant also makes it necessary to observe certain safety\nprecautions during it's use to prevent human exposure, reduce the threat to our workers personal\nhealth, the surrounding community and the environment.  It is our policy to adhere to all\napplicable federal and state regulations.  Safety depends directly on our proper handling of\nammonia combined with the safety devices that are incorporated in our facility and the safe\nhandling procedures that our personnel are trained in.\n\n2.  Stationary source and regulated substance handled.\n\nPerformance Food Group, 825 Maddox-Simpson Parkway, Lebanon, Tennessee is responsible for\nthe storage and distribution of various frozen food products.  There are approximately 120\nemployees at this facility which includes hourly and salary personnel.  This distribution facility\nreceives and prepares shipment of frozen food via tractor trailers approximately 20 hours a day,\nseven days a week.  \n\nPerformance Food Group is located in an industrial park approximately 3 miles north east of the\ncity of Gainesville, Florida.  In addition to our distribution facility the industrial park also houses\nother manufacturing or business facilities.  \n\nThe potentially hazardous chemical used at the Performance Food Group facility is\nANHYDROUS AMMONIA.  The dominant characteristic of ammonia vapor is it's pungent,\ndistinct odor.  Persons exposed to ammonia will not voluntarily stay in areas of even small\nconcentrations, although these levels would not result in any health risks. \nRis"

      "SummaryText": "ks from accidental exposure to ammonia in a vapor state are irritations to the eyes, nose and\nthroat. The extent of irritation depends on the exposure amount and length of time exposed.   \nAmmonia is classified non-flammable by the Department of Transportation.  Ammonia will burn,\nbut only in a very narrow, high concentration level when accompanied with a constant ignition\nsource.\n\nThe normal operating level of ammonia that is used/stored at the Performance Food Group facility\nis 12,000  pounds. Anhydrous ammonia is used as the chemical in the refrigeration process. The\npossible hazards that could lead to an accidental release include, but are not limited to, equipment\nfailure, damage to piping, damage to equipment, human error, etc. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Worst case release scenario and alternate release scenarios including administrative and\nengineering controls to limit/ prevent the release.\n\n\nWorst case scenario depicts continuous source leak from the High Pressure Receiver (HPR)\nlocated inside the machine room.  This vessels normal operating level is 4,300 pounds of liquid\nammonia,  approximately 50% of it's total capacity. Although it's maximum capacity is 8,600\npounds, this exceeds company policy  and engineering controls of only allowing an 80% level in\nthe vessel at any time. \n     \n\n     Worst case release scenario criteria for Performance Food Group facility:\n\n     Ammonia Quantity:                  4,300 pounds\n     Rate of Release:                   430 lbs / min.

Alarms tie in to\nthe maintenance system control computer.  Computer system activates a local audible alarm\nindicating an abnormal operating status. \n     \n     *  Periodic Maintenance Program is established within the maintenance department to\nensure the refrigeration system and it's components are kept in optimum operating status.\n\n     *  Emergency shut down procedures are in place and periodic training is held to activate\nthe shut down system during an actual emergency.\n\n     *  High and low level switches are configured to all pressure vessels which shut down\ncompressor operation during an abnormal level condition.\n\n     *  Safety Relief Valves are configured to all pressure vessels, condensers and compressor\noil separators to eliminate over pressurization conditions in those associated pieces of equipment.\n\n\n4.

Emergency Response Program\n\nThe purpose of the Performance Food Group Emergency Action Plan is to:\n\n     1.   Minimize exposure to our employees and the surrounding community in the event of a\n     hazardous material release or spill.\n\n     2.  Assure the safe emergency evacuation of the plant in the instance that it is required.\n\n     3.  Pr"
