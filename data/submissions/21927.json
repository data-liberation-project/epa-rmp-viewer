This commitment is demonstrated\nby the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design,\ninstallation, operation, and maintenance of facility's processes.  The Enterprise Gas Processing L.L.C. (Enterprise) \npolicy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances.  However, if a release does \noccur, trained personnel will respond to, control, and contain the release.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nEnterprise Products Operating, L.P. operates the Calumet Gas Plant located in St. Mary Parish, Louisiana.  Enterprise Gas\nProcessing, LLC is the owner of this facility.  The Calumet Gas Plant is a refrigerated lean oil absorption plant which \nextracts natural gas liquids from an inlet stream of produced natural gas.  The plant recovers natural gas liquids from the \nAmerican Natural Resources (ANR) and Trunkline Pipeline Companies.  Products are transported from the facility via \npipeline and truck.\n\nThe Calumet Gas Plant was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances exceed threshold \nquantities.  Based on process knowledge, Enterprise identified the regulated substances and quantities kept on site.  \nThese quantities are maintained in process vessels and piping at normal operating conditions and does not necessarily \nrepresent maximum capacities of the equipment.\n\nListed flammable substances which are stored above threshold quantities at the Calumet Gas Plant are condensate, \nrich/lean oil, propane, natural gas liquids, natural gas, and sponge oil.  However, Enterprise has determined that \ncondensate has an NFPA flammability hazard rating of 3, which exempts this mixture from threshold determination. \nBased on worst-case analysis, the distance to the endpoin"

Therefore, the Calumet Gas Plant is classified as a Program 3 \nprocess under the Accidental Release Prevention (ARP) program.\n\nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n\nFlammable Substances - Worst-Case Scenario\n\nThe endpoint for worst-case release of flammable substances is 1 psi overpressure (i.e., 15.7 psia), resulting from a \nvapor cloud explosion.  The ARP Program requirement for flammables assumes an instantaneous release and vapor \ncloud explosion.  A yield factor of 10 percent of the available energy released in the explosion shall be used to\ndetermine the distance to the explosion endpoint.  Since the worst-case release scenario for a flammable substance is \nbased on the assumption that the entire quantity of the substance in a vessel forms a vapor cloud, passive mitigation \nsystems are not applicable.  The worst-case distance calculations were based on the largest vessel of each substance \nat 100% capacity.  Natural gas liquids is the worst-case flammable release with a 0.53-mile distance to the endpoint.\n\nFlammable Substances - Alternative-Case Scenario\n\nA single alternative release scenario for all flammable substances is required under the ARP program.  A hypothetical release\nscenario has been identified for propane as follows.  A 2-inch pipe on the truck rack is sheared during loading, resulting in the\nentire contents of the tank truck to empty. The propane will vaporize and may ignite, possibly resulting in a vapor cloud \nexplosion with an endpoint of 1 psi overpressure or a vapor cloud fire with an endpoint of the lower flammability (LFL) for\npropane.  The alternative-case release of propane resulted in a 0.15-mile distance to the 1 psi overpressure endpoint.\n\nToxic Substances\n\nThe Calumet Gas Plant does not have any toxic substances held above the threshold quantity.  Therefore, analysis of \nworst-case or alternative release scenarios for toxic sub"

Because the processes at \nthe plant that are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Risk Management Program (RMP) regulations \nare also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, \nthis summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the \naccident prevention program.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nActive employee participation and involvement in the development and implementation of the Calumet Gas Plant's PSM program \nis an important step toward achieving the objective to prevent or minimize the consequences of catastrophic releases of toxic, \nreactive, flammable, or explosive chemicals.  Employee involvement will help to ensure that all perspectives regarding PSM are \nconsidered, and that the best ideas are implemented.  Open communications are encouraged between supervisors and employees\nregarding all safety and health issues.  \n\nThe Calumet Gas Plant strongly promotes employee involvement in safety issues through existing programs.  These programs \ninclude Unit Safety Teams (which are made up of a cross section of employees and supervision), regularly scheduled safety meetings, \ntail-gate safety meetings, Hazard Communication, Safety Suggestion Forms, near-miss reporting, and special training programs \n(emergency response training, first aid, etc.).\n\nThe Calumet Gas Plant actively seeks employee involvement in the development and conduct of all accident prevention activities \nthrough the appropriate existing safety programs.  Accident and release prevention is discussed at regularly scheduled safety \nmeetings and/or during special training sessions if necessary.

The PSI will be useful to the operators, the team performing the PHA, those in charge of training, contractors, \nthose conducting pre-startup safety reviews, and those in charge of updating the emergency preparedness plans.  Process \nsafety information is readily available to all employees.\n\nThe Calumet Gas Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the process.  \nThese documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific \nchemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is \nprovided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).\n\nThe gas plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of \nprocess equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and \nelectrical rating of equipment.

The team identifies and evaluates the hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and \nmitigation measures and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when they believe \nsuch measures are necessary.\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings\nis based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the \nhighest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are\ncompleted.

Operating procedures are specific instructions or \ndetails on what steps are taken or followed in carrying out the stated procedure.  The specific instructions include the applicable safety \nprecautions and appropriate information on safety implications.\n\n\nTraining\n\nIn addition to training on operating procedures, the Calumet Gas Plant has a comprehensive training program for all employees\ninvolved in operating the process.  New employees receive basic training in plant operations.  In addition, all operators periodically\nreceive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable\nlevel.  This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the\nmeans used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nContractors\n\nThe Calumet Gas Plant uses contractors during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.

The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately\nprepared for startup prior to placing equipment into service.

This system requires that changes\nto items such as process equipment, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be\nproperly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to\nmanage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.
