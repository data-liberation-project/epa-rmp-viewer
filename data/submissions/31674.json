If an accidental release should occur, the facility id prepared to work with the local fire department or authorities to mitigate and release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.  The General Manager of this company is a member of the local volunteer fire department, which helps insure a clear line of communication.\n\nThe primary activity at the storage of anhydrous ammonia is for the sale to farmers.  Ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application for crop production nutrients.  The maximum quantity stored would be 113,594 pounds in 1-26,000 gallon tank.  There are usually7-1,000 gallon nurse tanks that hold a total of 30,583 # of product when filled to the maximum level of 85%.  The total amount of product that could be on hand would be 144,177#.  The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a semi trailer holding 41,000 pounds.  \n\nNote:  There are two 11,000 gallon bulk tanks on site that are out of  service and will not be use.  If for any reason these tanks needed to be re-activated the plan will be updated to include this information and all data will be changed accordingly.  \n\nThe worst-case scenario and the alternative case scenario have been removed from the summary at the request of the EPA.  This is due to security concerns.  The figures for distance to endpoint and population have been given to the first responders as part of th RMP.  Population data was achieved by counting houses within the endpoint and assuming 4 people per house.  \n\nThe facility is included in the company training plan, with a goal of annual training for all employees.  This training includes safety information, hazards, operating procedures and the maintenance of an NH3 plant.  Goggles and gloves are stressed for all employees who are involved in loading nurse tanks.\n\nThe Anth"

The plan contains maps and emergency procedures in the event of a release or an emergency.  Our employees are required to evacuate the area and call 911 in event of a release.  Employees who may work as members of the first responders may return as a first responder to assist in mitigating the situation. \n\n\nThere are no improvements, repairs, or upgrades needed or expected in the near future.  \n\nThe plant is inspected annually by the Kansas Department of Agriculture and is maintained according to all local, state and federal rules and regulations.\n\nThere are no current plans to upgrade the facility.  As the state adopts more current ANSI standards we will budget needed improvements and make the necessary changes."
