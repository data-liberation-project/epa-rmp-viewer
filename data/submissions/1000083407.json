These regulations require\n\nstationary sources with listed substances present in a process in quantities\n\ngreater than the threshold quantity to develop and implement a risk\n\nmanagement program that includes a hazard assessment, a prevention\n\nprogram, and an emergency response program.  The risk management\n\nprogram must be described in an RMP that is required to be:\n\nregistered with the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA);\n\nsubmitted to appropriate local emergency planning agencies; and\n\navailable to the public.  \n\n\n\nFor the Interstate Paper facility in Riceboro, Georgia, chlorine (which is a\n\nlisted toxic substance) is stored in amounts that exceed the threshold quantity\n\nof 2500 lb.  Based on a review of the RMP regulations and the potential off-site \n\nimpacts from this chlorine system, Prevention Program 3 requirements\n\nwere identified to apply to this facility (due to the system's applicability to the OSHA process safety management program requirements).  To meet the\n\nPrevention Program 3 requirements, this RMP has been prepared in\n\naccordance with 40 CFR Subpart G, Parts 68.150 through 68.190, which\n\ndescribe the format to be followed in completing an RMP document.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.1.

In pursuit of this goal, it is the Interstate Paper\n\nfacility's policy to adhere to applicable State and Federal regulations.
