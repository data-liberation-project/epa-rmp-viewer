      "SummaryText": "The Lansing Smith Electric Generating Plant is owned and operated by Gulf Power Company, an investor owned utility located in Pensacola, FL.  The plant encompasses approximately 1,230 acres and employs 124 people.  The plant is located at 4300 Highway 2300 in Section 25, Township 2 South, Range 15 West, Bay County, west of the City of Southport.  The plant site includes four generating units with a combined generating capacity of 909 MW.  Plant Lansing Smith has chlorine stored on-site that is covered under the Risk Management Program (RMP) regulations 40 CFR Part 68, as a Program 3 process.  The facility uses chlorine as a biocide in the treatment of once through cooling water and for other water treatment purposes.  The maximum amount of chlorine that is stored on site is 22,600 pounds.  The worst chlorine release scenario was defined as the release of the largest single vessel occurring over ten minutes.  The RMP*COMP version 1.07 model predicted that the chlorine gas would travel 3.0 miles before reaching its end point.   A valve failure resulting in a 0.75\" rupture was used for the alternative case scenario.  The model predicted that chlorine would travel 0.6 miles at a release rate of 151.9 lb/min before reaching its end point.  Plant Lansing Smith has developed an emergency response plan that complies with 29 CFR 1910.38 to protect the public health and the environment.  The plan includes the procedures for notifying the public about accidental releases, procedures to use and maintain response equipment, employee training, and procedures to review and update the plan."
