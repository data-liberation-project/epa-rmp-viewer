THE CHLORINATION SYSTEM INSTALLED AT CONSTRUCTION DURING 1968, CONSISTS OF TWO ROOMS. THE SCALE ROOM HOLDING TWO ONE TON CYLINDERS MOUNTED ON A SCALE, AND VACUUM REGULATORS MOUNTED ON EACK CYLINDER. THE OTHER ROOM CONTAINS THE RATE SETTERS, EJECTORS AND DISTRIBUTION BOARD. EACH ROOM IS EQUIPPED WITH CHLORINE GAS DETECTION UNITS WITH ALARMS MOUNTED OUTSIDE THE CHLORINE ROOMS AND A REMOTE ALARM INSIDE THE MAIN BUILDING. OUR CHLORINE SYSTEM IS A COMPLETE VACUUM SYSTEM TO REDUCE THE RISK OF LEAKS. EACH ROOM HAS HAD THE VENTILATION SYSTEM UPGRADEDTO INSURE COMPLETE VENTING TO THE OUTSIDE WITH REMOTE EXHAUST FAN SWITCHES. THE LOADING DOCK AREA IS STORAGE FOR A MAXIMUM OF EIGHT ONE TON CYLINDERS AND ALL EMPTY CYLINDERS. THE WATER PLANT IS MANNED 24 HOURS A DAY, YEAR ROUND WITH A MINIMUM OF TWO EMPLOYEES PER SHIFT.\n\nTHE SAFETY EQUIPMENTIS ASSESABLE INSIDE THE MAIN BUILDING AWAY FROM POTENTIAL HAZARDOUS LEAK AREAS.\nTHE ENTIRE CHLORINE AREA IS CHECKED EVERY HOUR BY ONE OF THE OPERATORS ON DUTY.\n\nc.
