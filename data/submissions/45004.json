EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nThe MAP LLC Minnesota Refining Division is committed to operating in a manner that is safe for Minnesota Refining Division workers, the public, and the environment.  As part of this commitment, Minnesota Refining Division has established systems to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility.  One part of these systems is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at Minnesota Refining Division and that complies with the requirements of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\u00bfs (USEPA\u00bfs) rule 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMPlan) describing the risk management program at Minnesota Refining Division.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMPlan executive summary requirements of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at Minnesota Refining Division.\n\n\n1.1  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nMinnesota Refining Division is committed to the safety of Minnesota Refining Division workers and the public, and to the preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  Minnesota Refining Division implements controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances.  In the event of a significant accidental release, trained personnel will respond to control and contain such releases.  The overall emergency response program for the Minnesota Refining Division is coordinated with the facility Emergency Response Team (ERT), WAKOTA CAER, a local response cooperative, and with offsite responders who would be called to support emergency response efforts if required.

The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, refinery evacuation plans and accounting for refinery personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and postincident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  In addition, the Minnesota Refining Division has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment.  Employees receive training in these procedures to perform their specific emergency response duties.  The Emergency Response Team conducts additional training sessions so that they can safely handle potential emergency situations.  The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to refinery processes or facilities. \n\nThe overall emergency response program for the Minnesota Refining Division is coordinated with the facility\u00bfs Emergency Response Team (ERT), WAKOTA CAER, a local response cooperative, and with offsite responders who would be called to support emergency response efforts if required.  This coordination includes periodic meetings of the LEPC, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives.  The Minnesota Refining Division has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate government officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department).

However, the specific responsibilities for certain aspects of that program have been delegated by the Division Manager to other personnel who report either directly, or through other management personnel, to the Division Manager.  Those relationships are depicted on the division organization chart maintained by the Division Manager\u00bfs staff.  Specific responsibility for the implementation of the division process safety management (PSM) and accident prevention program has been delegated to the Division PSM/RMP Coordinator.  Similarly, responsibility for the RMP hazard assessment and risk management plan has been delegated to the Division PSM/RMP Coordinator.  The division emergency response program, including compliance with the RMP aspects of that effort, is the responsibility of the Division Fire Chief.  In keeping with our policy that safe operation is part of everyone\u00bfs job, many other division personnel are also involved in RMP activities on an ongoing basis.\n\n\n1.2  The MAP LLC Minnesota Refining Division Regulated Substances\n\nMinnesota Refining Division is a refinery and petroleum products facility located in St. Paul Park, Minnesota.  Crude petroleum is the feed material to make a variety of petroleum-based products, including gasoline, diesel fuel, kerosene and liquefied petroleum gases such as propane and butane.  Many of these products are flammable substances that USEPA has specifically listed in the RMP rule and are present in our process units above the USEPA threshold quantity of 10,000 lb.

Hydrofluoric acid (HF) is used as a catalyst in our HF Alkylation unit to make high quality gasoline components.  \n\n\n1.3  Offsite Consequence Analysis\n\nMinnesota Refining Division performed an offsite consequence analysis to estimate the potential for an accidental release of a regulated substance that could affect the public or the environment.  The offsite consequence analysis consists of evaluating both worst case scenarios and alternative release scenarios as defined by the USEPA.  Minnesota Refining Division does not expect a worst case release scenario to ever occur.  An alternative release scenario represents a release that might occur during the lifetime of a facility like Minnesota Refining Division.  Alternative release scenarios can be used to help the local emergency responders, such as the fire departments improve the community emergency response plan.  We have submitted release scenario analyses to USEPA and have shared that information with the organizations involved in emergency response activities.  Please recognize that none of these events have occurred at the facility.  Also, for some of these events, emergency mitigation systems should reduce the consequences of the events if they occurred.  In all cases, if such events occurred, we would actuate our emergency response plan to respond to the event, notify local authorities, and take appropriate actions to protect both our employees and people in the community.\n\nAs stated previously, we have included details regarding these scenarios in the additional information submitted to USEPA with this executive summary, and have shared that information with the organizations involved in emergency planning, and me"

Because processes at the Minnesota Refining Division that are regulated by the USEPA RMP regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) process safety management (PSM) standard, and because the OSHA PSM requirements are very similar to the USEPA RMP requirements for refineries, this summary also addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements.  The PSM program at this facility has been extended by the Minnesota Refining Division, where necessary, to satisfy USEPA\u00bfs Program Level 3 accident prevention program requirements.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nThe Minnesota Refining Division encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents to participating as a member on the process hazard analysis (PHA), incident investigation, and compliance audit teams.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the Minnesota Refining Division accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the Minnesota Refining Division and addresses each accident prevention program element.  In addition, the Minnesota Refining Division has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and employee safety issues, such as meetings of the Health and Safety Committee.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe Minnesota Refining Division keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.

Specific departments within the Minnesota Refining Division are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.  A table summarizing the reference documents and their location is readily available as part of the written process safety information program to help employees locate any necessary process safety information.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).  This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For specific process areas, the Minnesota Refining Division has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in Critical Process Variable Documents.  The Minnesota Refining Division oerates equipment within these limits by using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\nThe Minnesota Refining Division also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nThe Minnesota Refining Division has a comprehensive PHA program to help ensure that hazards as"

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage those hazards.\n\nThe Minnesota Refining Division primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques available.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating experience and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes recommendations for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. \n\nThe PHA team recommendations are forwarded to local management for resolution.  Approved safety improvements being implemented in response to PHA team recommendations are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each recommendation is documented and retained.\n\nThe Minnesota Refining Division periodically updates and revalidates the PHA results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The PHA Team has considered off-site effects of potential releases in all PHA\u00bfs completed after August 1996. The results and recommendations from these updates are documented and retained.  \n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe Minnesota Refining Division maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  Procedures, exce"

In addition, the Minnesota Refining Division operating procedures provide guidance on how to respond to events that result in exceeding safe operating limits for specific process or equipment parameters.  The written operating procedures are readily available to operators in the process units and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Minnesota Refining Division has implemented a company training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in Minnesota Refining Division operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operating employees periodically receive refresher training to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nContractors\n\nThe Minnesota Refining Division uses contractors to supplement its work force during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.

This is accomplished by providing contractors with access to (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, (4) safe work practices, and (5) work permit processes (i.e. for hot work, confined space, etc.) prior to their beginning work.  In addition, the Minnesota Refining Division evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.  Minnesota Refining Division personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews\n\nThe Minnesota Refining Division conducts a pre-startup safety review for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the review is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional means to verify that construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that supporting systems are operationally ready.  The review team uses checklists to verify all readiness.  A review involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe Minnesota Refining Division has practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating c"

The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures.  In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process equipment.\n\nMaintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their job in a safe manner.  Written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training.  Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended, and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels).  If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or a management of change team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\n\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance.  The Minnesota Refining Division incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs to verify that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made. \n\nSafe Work Practices\n\nThe Minnesota Refining Division has safe work practice procedures and a safe work permit system in place to help ensure worker and process safety.  Examples of items include included in the procedures and work permit system include: control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, safe removal of hazardous"

These procedures and safe work permit system, along with training of affected personnel, form a system to enable operations and maintenance activities to be performed safely.\n\nManagement of Change\n\nThe Minnesota Refining Division has a comprehensive system to manage changes to processes.  This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided with any necessary training on the change.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nThe Minnesota Refining Division promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to Minnesota Refining Division management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team\u00bfs findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with employees (including contractors) who coul"

Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidations. \n\nCompliance Audits\n\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the Minnesota Refining Division periodically conducts audits to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.  Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years. The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to Minnesota Refining Division management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team\u00bfs findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.  \n\n\n1.5  Chemical-specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe processes at the Minnesota Refining Division have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.  The accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all USEPA RMP-covered processes at the Minnesota Refining Division.  Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures or human errors.\n\nIn addition to the accident prevention program activities, the Minnesota Refining Division has safety features on many units to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of a release.  The following types of safety features are used in various processes:\n\nRelease Detection\n\n\u00bf  Hydrocarbon detectors with alarms in the liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) storage and other areas;\n\n\u00bf  Hydrofluoric acid detectors with alarms in the HF Alkylation Unit;\n\n\u00bf  H2S detectors in the Sulfur Recovery Unit facilities\n\nRelease Containment/Control\n\n\u00bf  Process relief valves that discharge to a flare to capture and incinerate process materials to prevent overpressure damage to e"

No injuries were experienced by any responder, employee or neighbor.  No environmental damage was reported.\n\nSignificant property damage was suffered in the alky unit as a result of the fire.  Most notably, the fire burned caused damage to the heater, pumps, instruments, instrument and electrical conduit banks and wiring, piping and piping components, structures and an idle fin fan exchanger.\n\n\u00bf  At approximately 0830 on March 2, 2003, a small amount of hydrocarbon containing HF acid was released in the HF Alkylation Unit from a bleeder line on a process pump. \n\nAs part of the Alkylation fire on February 25, unit processes were slumped and mitigation systems activated to de-inventory the major portions of the acid system resulting in an apparent contamination of the pump seal flush with HF acid. On March 1 problems were noted with the seal while the pump was in operation. Provisions were made to de-inventory and repair the pump. During this process, a bleed valve was opened on the pump flush piping circuit which was expecte to be empty resulting in discharge Hydrocarbon and HF acid. The operator immediately closed the bleeder to stop the release. The material was carried by wind through the unit and dispersed downwind in less than a minute. \n\nSubsequent to the release, some contractors and maintenance personnel reported being affected by the material.  As a result, 13 contractor personnel were transported to the local hospital.
