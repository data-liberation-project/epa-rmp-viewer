      "SummaryText": "The City of Winters (City) operates a Water Treatment Plant (WTP) which is located at 801 Wood Street, Winters, Runnels County, Texas.  The WTP produces potable water for the City of Winters and North Runnels Water Supply District. Chlorine gas is used in the disinfection process at the plant.  Up to 4,000 pounds of chlorine may be stored at the WTP.  Because the stored quantity of chlorine onsite exceeds the threshold quantity for chlorine (?68.130; Table 1), the City developed this Risk Management Plan (RMP).  The WTP is subject to Program 2 RMP requirements (?68.12(c)).  A Management System overseen by the Plant Superintendent or WTP Chief Operator is implemented to ensure that the RMP and associated Prevention Program are implemented correctly and maintained up-to-date. \n\n\n\nThe Prevention Program designed to prevent accidental releases includes all required elements of 40 CFR Part 68.  The TCEQ licensing program for water operators is used as a training tool, along with site-specific RMP training.  TCEQ licensing testing and on-site observation and demonstration are used to evaluate comprehension of all training materials.  Written operating procedures are used in conjunction with on-the-job training to ensure that certified WTP operators are proficient in performing their duties before being allowed to work with chlorine storage and feed systems.  Certified WTP operators conduct daily inspections and any problems with the chlorine systems are corrected and documented.  In addition, the certified WTP operators ensure that the equipment used in the disinfection process is maintained according to the manufacturers' recommendations (?68.56(a)).  Because of these efforts, the WTP has not had a chlorine release that resulted in an injury, either on-site or off-site, within the previous five (5) years (?68.42(a)).  As part of the Program, the City will periodically perform compliance audits, hazard reviews and incident investigations, according to a predetermined sche"

These compliance audits and hazard reviews document any planned changes to improve safety (?68.50 & ?68.58).\n\n\n\nThe City complies with the emergency response regulations per Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) 29 CFR ?1910.38, as well as with applicable fire codes and the standards set forth by the Chlorine Institute.  The WTP is a non-responding facility for emergency response.  The WTP is included in the City of Winters' regional Emergency Response Plan.  WTP operators are trained to contact the Runnels County dispatch via 911 in the event of a release.  The Runnels County dispatch contacts the nearest first responder unit (typically the City of Winters) which coordinates the emergency response according to the City's Emergency Response Plan, including the evacuation of surrounding residents when required (?68.155(e)).\n\n"
