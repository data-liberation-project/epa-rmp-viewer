The prior Operator Dole Fresh Vegetables developed a comprehensive RMP/PSM Plan in March, 2008, but has since terminated operations and site lease agreement.  Coastal Cooling, LLC is updating the Registration and reviewing the existing RMP for changes, as allowed under Section 68.190, Part 68, Title 40, Code of Federal Regulations and Section 25531, CA Health and Safety Code.  California has adopted the Federal RMP Program with additional state-specific requirements; the Program is known as the California Accidental Release Prevention Program or CalARP.  In the Program Level 3 designation, CalARP includes CA Title 8, Section 5189 Process Safety Management as the basis for the Prevention Program component of the Plan. \n\n1.1  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe Coastal Cooling Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies are simply not to have accidental releases or emergencies.  The Company endeavors to execute these policies through the daily implementation of its Safety Programs.  Company safety programs include, but are not limited to the Process Safety Management Program (PSM).  The PSM Program is an integrated, holistic approach to the safe operation of processes "

The design of the Process in use and the PSM Program are specifically intended to prevent accidental releases, and to deal safely with emergencies if and when they do happen.  It is the primary goal of Coastal Cooling to protect its employees, visitors and neighbors from harm due to Company operations.  With this in mind, the priorities of protection of life, the environment, and then property have been established.   \n\nThe Company also recognizes the need to be prepared for accidental releases that could occur should established prevention programs fail. In addition to a Fire Alarm and Sprinkler System, the siteA?s main ammonia refrigeration process is equipped with an ammonia monitoring, control and alarm system.  The system is supervised on-site and remotely by a third party alarm company.  If and when an ammonia leak is detected, notifications and alarms are triggered.  Our policy is to regularly test and maintain emergency safety systems per our Mechanical Integrity Program, which is intended to ensure proper operation, actuation and function of the refrigeration-related systems and components.  The Plant is also equipped with Ammonia-Water Diffusion Tank Systems (ADT).  The function of an ADT system is to prevent ammonia from venting to atmosphere should a Pressure Relief Valve lift.  \n\nThe Company has adopted a A?Non-responding Facility Emergency Response PolicyA?.  The PlantA?s California Hazardous Material Business Plan was developed to be consistent with Emergency Action Plan requirements (i.e. notify and evacuate).  Emergency response pre-planning is coordinated through the local Certified Unified Program Agency (Monterey County Health Department/CUPA).

Coastal Cooling is leasing an existing ammonia refrigeration facility located in Castroville, CA, in a commercial/industrial area on the SE side of the city.  The ammonia refrigeration process was built in 1985 with expansions in 1994 and 1998.  From 1999 to 2006, this facility was registered under the DA?Arrigo Bros. Company.  In December 2006 the facility closed and DA?Arrigo Bros. de-registered from the RMP Program.  In 2008, the facility was re-opened by Dole Fresh Vegetables (Dole).  On-site documentation indicates an RMP re-submission was part of the re-registration of the facility.  The RMP Plan prepared by Snowden Engineering was certified by Dole on 03/18/2008.  Snowden Engineering has a reputation for developing detailed and thorough RMP/PSM Plans"

Coastal Cooling has notified the local CUPA that it is now leasing the site and has taken responsibility for the Cal/ARP Program.         \n\nThe refrigeration process is used for the cooling and short-term storage of fresh produce.  The facility plans to be open year-around with a busy season from early March through the summer months.  The remaining months may see little fresh product, however the refrigeration equipment is still operative.  Annual refrigeration equipment maintenance is performed during low-season winter months.\n\nThe Regulated Substance in use is anhydrous ammonia (NH3) CAS #7664-41-7, which is used in an inter-connected mechanical refrigeration system.  Refrigeration equipment consists of Pressure Vessels, Compressors, Evaporative Condensers, Evaporators (Room Units), Pressure Cooler Units, Ice-making equipment and associated valves, instrumentation and piping.  Pressure and temperature controls are installed in accordance with appropriate codes & standards, including isolation and overpressure relief valves.  Pressure relief valves are piped to a common header that terminates at an ammonia- water diffusion tank.  Pre-qualified personnel regularly check the refrigeration system. \n\nA portable HydroVacA? Vacuum Tube closed-loop system is a planned future addition.  Vacuum cooling is used to rapidly remove field heat from certain types of agricultural product; removal of this heat extends product shelf-life.  The Vacuum Tube system and supporting high-side (compression) equipment is portable and may move seasonally depending on market conditions & demand.  This system is to be located away from other refrigeration equipment.  The currently planned portable equipment will contain less than the federal threshold planning quantity of 10,000 lbs. ammonia.\n\n1.3 General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemica"

The PSM Program is specifically intended to promote the safe operation of the ammonia-handling equipment and process, and to prevent accidental releases.  Coastal Cooling strives to make the PSM Program an integral part of daily Plant operation.  Other safety programs are integrated with the PSM Program, to the extent practicable, appropriate and/or required (such as the California Injury and Illness Prevention Program/IIPP).  \n\nWPS is the company that inspects and performs mechanical maintenance of the ammonia refrigeration equipment.  Schedules and written procedures for the operation and maintenance of ammonia-handling equipment, including the steps to be taken in the event of a release or threatened release, have been developed.  Written procedures include necessary safety precautions for operations, inspection, maintenance, and moving of portable equipment (Hydro-VacA? Vacuum Tubes).  In addition to existing equipment technical documentation and procedures, WPS also maintains an extensive library of refrigeration equipment technical documentation including written manufacturer reference manuals and technical bulletins.  As maintenance needs are determined, the need is expressed at the workload meetings conducted by the WPS Area Manager.  The specific task for the expressed need is decided by the WPS Area Manager and entered into the WPS work order system. Tasks are then tracked to completion through the work order system.  Through this regular routine of inspect, discuss, assign and confirmation of completion, Coastal Cooling and WPS reduce equipment operational problems and potential for releases.\n\nWPS actively encourages its ammonia technicians to seek Certification through the Refrigerating Engineers and Technicians Association (RETA).  Technicians only perform tasks for which they have been pre-qualified."

To correct this issue special self-closing valves are installed as a permissive for oil drain flow.  If a release were to develop during the oil-draining task, the mechanic simply releases the handle of the self-closing valve and flow is terminated.  These types of valves are installed at the PlantA?s oil drain points.\n\nOther release prevention steps taken at the Plant:\n\n-New management has acknowledged and is taking ownership of the existing RMP.  The RMP is being evaluated for needed changes (see also #1 INTRODUCTION above).\n-Continue to implement the current Prevention Program and update it as needed.  The current prevention program is equivalent to PSM including Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Written Procedures, Training, Mechanical Integrity, Management of Change, Prestartup Safety Review, Employee Participation, Incident Investigation, Compliance Audits, Contractor Safety, and Employee Injury and Illness Prevention.\n-The facility is protected by fencing and gates to limit access by potential A?wrong-do-ersA?.\n-A sign-in/sign-out program is vigorously enforced.\n-Employees are trained for ammonia awareness and hazard communication (discovery and communicating) for un-authorized personnel, suspicious activity, fires, releases or other hazardous/suspicious condition.   \n-A strong relationship exists with the local implementing agency (Monterey County Health Department/CUPA).
