The Authority presently owns approx. 150 acres that surrounds the plant. There is no residence within 900 feet of present chlorine storage and operation area.  We operate under a Wastewater Discharge Permit issued by the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission,  Permit # 0011269-001. The plant is located in a sparsly populated area along the South Bank of the Cibolo Creek.\n\nIt is chlorine usage and storage in one ton containers for effluent disinfection that qualifies for this submittal. The wastewater plant utilizes 2 - one ton containers of chlorine gas on line for disinfection of our effluent as per our permit requirements. There are also 2- one ton containers in the stand-by mode for automated switch over when first set of cylinders is empty.  We feed chlorine in a gas form under vacuum to injectors for mixing with our effluent flow in our chlorine contact basins. The chlorine storage and operation area is protected by an air pump alarm system. This system produces both audio (horn) and visual alarms. Self contained breathing apparatuses are on site and in stand-by mode of operation.  They are available at all times.  When one set of chlorine cylinders are emptied, the order for 2 replacement cylinders is placed. Cylinders are unloaded from trucks and handled according to a specific written proceedure. Operators are trained by supervisory personnel on those proceedures. There are never more than four cylinders on site at our present operating flow of 2.7 MGD. Plant operation and maintenance is performed by an eight member staff under the direction of the Systems Manager for the Authority.  The Systems Manager is under the direction of the General Manager.  Management is governed by a five member elected board of directors.  \n\nThe operations team"

There are two type - B, 1 ton emergency repair kits on site as issued by the Chlorine Institute. Operators follow written proceedures for all above training. They also train in simulated situations to correctly don emergency equipment and make a repair in actual time to a leaking cylinder. Fortunately, we have never experienced an accident. \n\nWe have experienced leaking gaskets on cylinder connections from time to time. These have been repaired with no problems incurred. Our worst case senario would be a ruptured pipe in the manifold or broken valve on the cylinder or manifold. Should this occur, our proceedure calls for immediate shut down of the chlorine cylinders themselves if possible. Should it not be possible to secure a cylinder valve, repair kits contain items needed to isolate valve and stop leakage.  This would be performed by operations personnel. Leakage elsewhere would make the problem easier to correct due to entire system being under vacuum. The vacuum feed systems would pull any remaining chlorine in system into the contact chamber and would mix with effluent water.  Proceedures also call for informing all 3 fire departments within our service district.  The City of Schertz and the City of Cibolo jurisdictions are within patterned areas of release. We would also contact the Universal City Fire Department for they are the core of the Randolph Area Haz-Mat Team.\n\nThe predominant winds are from the south at the plant location. There are no residence or buildings within 2,000+ feet in that direction.  There are an estimated 650 residences within the 1.3 miles the RMP model program gives us. There is also a bank, restaurant, furniture store and several small business located within this area. Should we experience this worst case senario, proceedures called for evacuation of a one"
