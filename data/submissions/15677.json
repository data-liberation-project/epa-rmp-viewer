      "SummaryText": "The PSM written program also incorporates the Albertson's distribution center's emergency response plan and places special emphasis on handling accidental releases of hazardous chemicals and coordination of emergency response with local fire departments and other emergency response organizations.\n\nAs part of the RMP requirements, Albertson's undertook a review of the potential offsite consequences of the accidental releases of the largest vessels in the system.  Although such a release is highly unlikely, the regulation requires this review.  The following is a description of the results:\n\nAmmonia Refrigeration\n\nAlbertson's stores and uses anhydrous ammonia on site for refrigeration of products in storage.  Ammonia is used for its excellent energy efficiency and flexibility, in addition to benefits to employee safety.  Ammonia at the facility is kept entirely within the refrigeration system, much as the refrigerant in your car air-conditioner.  The Albertson's Tulsa distribution center has never experienced a release of ammonia involving consequences that affected residents or the environment.\n\nThe worst case scenario was assumed to be the release of the entire contents of the 40,170-pound capacity of the control-pressure receiver which is located indoors. The analysis of this release indicates that a potential exposure of an area approximately 3.6 miles in diameter (distance to endpoint of 1.8 miles) would result. The total population within the potential exposure area is estimated to be 5,391.\n\nIn determining the alternate case scenario for ammonia, Albertson's analyzed incidents occurring at other refrigeration facilities and the results of the process hazards analysis (PHA).  The scenario chosen for the ammonia system assumes a = hole in a liquid return pipe from the outside condensers. Such a release would affect an area of 0.34 miles (0.17 miles to the toxic endpoint) and create the potential to affect approximately 47 persons.  Residences are located within"

      "SummaryText": "Albertson's, Inc. (Albertson's) is a diversified retailer of grocery products throughout the United States. Albertson's operates many retail grocery stores throughout the Midwest and Southwest that will be supplied through a distribution and transportation complex located in Tulsa, Oklahoma. This Albertson's distribution operation is new, planning startup in early August of 1999 and currently employs approximately 150 people. The Albertson's Refrigerated Distribution Center, located on this facility site, uses anhydrous ammonia for refrigeration of the products in storage. Anhydrous ammonia is subject to EPA regulation under 40 CFR 68, Accidental Release Risk Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals.\n\nPursuant to the RMP regulations (40 CFR 68) and the Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations, Albertson's is in the process of developing a comprehensive PSM written program to protect our employees and the surrounding community from exposure to the hazardous chemicals onsite.  The facility completed a pre-startup safety review as well as a process hazards analysis (PHA) for the ammonia system using a checklist developed through the International Institute for Ammonia Refrigeration. These reviews were completed using technical and operations staff from the Tulsa facility as well as engineering consultants with extensive experience with ammonia refrigeration.\n\nAlbertson's implementation of the PSM program will include employee education in the hazards of ammonia and measures that can be used to reduce employee and community exposure to accidental releases of ammonia. The plans include preventive maintenance programs (mechanical integrity) for the ammonia system, and a program for both pre-startup safety reviews and management of changes (MOC) to this system. The program also includes specific requirements for safe work practices (such as safe approaches to welding and similar hot work) and safety requirements for contractors who may be hired to work on the system."
