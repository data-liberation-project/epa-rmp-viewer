These two facilities also share information on hazardous chemicals \nand coordinate their emergency response plans.  Thus, the MeadWestvaco Specialty \nChemicals Division facility has a program in place to notify the neighboring Kraft \nDivision facility in the event of an accidental release.  Because it would not be necessary \nfor the LEPC or other on-site emergency responders to coordinate intra-company \nemergency response, it is not appropriate to consider the Kraft Division as off-site for the \nRMP.  \n\n1.3 Risk Management System\n\nMeadWestvaco Specialty Chemicals Division has developed a management system to \nimplement and maintain compliance with the ARP and related chemical safety and \nemergency response programs.  This management system identifies lines of responsibility \nfor the entire program and each of its key elements.\n\nThis management system is also coordinated with the system developed by \nMeadWestvaco's neighboring Kraft Division.\n\n\n2.0   PROCESSES AND SUBSTANCES SUBJECT TO 40 CFR PART 68\n\nThe MeadWestvaco Specialty Chemicals Division facility manufactures industrial \nintermediates (crude tall oil, modified rosin and fatty acids and lignin-based products) \nusing raw material supplied via pipeline by the neighboring MeadWestvaco Kraft \nDivision facility and other materials supplied by truck and rail from external sources.  \nChemical manufacturing processes at the facility utilize a number of chemicals, some of \nwhich are regulated under 40 CFR Part 68.  At the Specialty Chemicals Division facility, \nonly the lignin-based production area (i.e Performance Chemicals) contains a threshold \namount of a regulated substance, formaldehyde.\n\nThe Performance Chemicals process area includes a number of reactors that produce a \nvariety of products.

The tank is surrounded by a 30 ft x 30 ft dike that \nprovides passive mitigation by limiting the surface area of a spill.\n\nThe EPA Risk Management Regulation identifies three levels of requirements defined as \nprograms.  The EPA recognizes that some regulated processes would not pose an off-\nsite hazard in the event of an accidental release.  Such processes are classified as Program \n1.  Program 1 is applicable to any process that can demonstrate that the public would not \nbe adversely affected by a release. Thus, to qualify for Program 1, a facility with a \nregulated toxic chemical needs to meet two criteria.  \n\n1) no release over the most recent 5-year period has resulted in off-site injury or \nenvironmental damage; and \n\n2) dispersion modeling demonstrates that a worst-case release (as defined by the \nregulation) will not result in concentrations at public receptors that exceed the \ntoxic endpoint.\n\nMeadWestvaco has determined that the Performance Chemicals production process that \nuses formaldehyde qualifies for Program 1.  Program 2 and 3 are applicable to processes \nthat do not qualify for Program 1.  Program 3 applies to processes that are subject to \nOccupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management \nStandard (PSM) or listed among nine North American Industrial Classification System \n(NAICS) codes.  Otherwise, a process would be subject to Program 2.  If a change were \nto occur such that the Performance Chemicals process no longer met the Program 1 \ncriteria, it would be subject to Program 3.  This is because that process belongs to a listed \nNAICS code (325199, industrial organics) and is subject to PSM.\n\nThe Risk Management Plan requirements for Program 1 processes are as follows:\n\n*Registration\n*Accident history\n*Hazard assessment for the worst-case release\n*Coordinate emergency response procedures with local emergency planning and \nresponse organizations\n*Certifica"

Because there \nhave been no accidental releases during the most recent five-year period that had an off-\nsite impact and modeling of a worst-case release shows that off-site concentrations of \nformaldehyde would not exceed the toxic endpoint concentration, the Specialty \nChemicals Division plant is subject to Program 1 ARP requirements.\n\n3.1 Five-Year Accident History\n\nIn conjunction with the current ARP programs in place at the MeadWestvaco Specialty \nChemicals Division facilities, there is a standard management practice that requires \nimmediate internal reporting of unusual events, including those in which any abnormal \nemission of regulated chemicals is observed or suspected. The incident information is \nreviewed by environmental and supervisory staff and a determination is made as to \nwhether a reportable quantity of any listed chemical requiring reports to regulatory \nauthorities is involved.  If so, the appropriate authorities are promptly notified. \n\nDuring the past 5 years, there have been no accidents involving formaldehyde that qualify \nfor reporting under 40 CFR Part 68.  This means that no accident has resulted in \nreportable on-site injury, off-site injury, off-site evacuation or sheltering in place, or off-\nsite damage to property or the environment.
