The facility is also committed to providing its' employees with the skills necessary to safelly handle the chemicals used at the site.\n\nFor the anhydrous ammonia, the tanks and associated peiping are visually inspected and maintained to ensure the tank and its' components are in good condition and they do not develop defects which could comproomise the tanks integrity.  Both tanks contain manual shut-off valves which will stop the flow out of the piping if a rupture in any of the connected hosing should develop.The anhydrous tanks are also equipped with autoomatic valves which will shut off the flow if a pipe break were to occur.  The anhydrous ammonia tanks are equipped with break away piping which will prevent damage to the tank and loss of substantial product if a transfer tank is not disconnected prior to moving away from the loading area.  The applicator tanks for the anhydrous operations are also inspected regularly and maintained to prevent releases.\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED:\n\nRothsay Farmers Coop stores and handles anhydrous ammonia in quantities above the 10,000 pound threshold, which requires the facility to complete a Risk Management Plan (RMP)\n\nThe facility stores and distributes anhydrous ammonia.  The anhydrous ammonia is stored in two 30,000 gallon tanks at the facility.  Facility personnel are responsible for transferring the anhydrous ammonia to transfer tanks which are used in conjunction with injection equipment to inject the product into the ground for use as a fertilizer.\n\nWORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS:\n\nThe worst case scenario for the anhydrous ammonia stored and handled on the site fwould be a tank rupture releasing 131000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia which would create a "
