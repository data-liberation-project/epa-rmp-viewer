Skinner Plant has Operational Level HAZWOPER-trained plant employees who can handle incidental chlorine releases and will respond to emergency releases only to assess and take defensive measures.  Skinner Plant also includes employees trained in the Incident Command System, who can coordinate with and provide technical assistance to outside emergency responders.  Depending on the severity of the accidental release, external hazardous materials response agencies, such as the Riverside County Fire Department, will be called to handle a chlorine release.  Skinner Plant management coordinates with local response agencies (Riverside County Fire Department) to help ensure that they are familiar with the Skinner Plant Chlorine System and its emergency requirements and that it is reflected in their Area Plans.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nNumerous changes to improve safety (recommended actions) were identified, evaluated and resolved for the chlorine process as a result of Process Hazard Analyses (PHAs) conducted prior to implementation of the new Chlorine Containment and Handling Facility, a significant additional safety enhancement and risk reduction measure. Further changes were identified in June 2006 and September 2007, when the process hazard and seismic risk analyses were updated to include the new chlorine containment and scrubbing system modification.  Additional recommendations were developed as part of the Five-Year Update PHA and Seismic Assessments, in 2011 and 2012, respectively."

The Management of Change process of Metropolitan provides a system and approach to maintain and implement any management of change or modifications to equipment, procedures, chemicals, and processing conditions.  This system allows Skinner Plant employees to identify and review safety hazards or provide additional safety, process, or chemical information to existing data before the proposed change would either compromise system safety or need training to be completed.\n\nInternal Compliance Audits\n\nInternal compliance audits are conducted every three years to verify compliance with the programs and procedures contained in the RMP.  Metropolitan management assembles an audit team that includes personnel knowledgeable in the Risk Management Program rule and in the process.  This team evaluates whether the prevention program satisfies the requirements of the Risk Management Program rule and whether the prevention program is sufficient to help ensure safe operation of the process.  The results of the audit are documented, and a plan is developed to resolve the recommendations and implement appropriate enhancements to the prevention program.  The last internal compliance audit was completed in May 2023. \n\nIncident Investigation\n\nSkinner Plant management investigates all incidents that resulted in or could reasonably have resulted in a catastrophic release (serious injury to personnel, the public, or the environment) so that similar accidents can be prevented.  If required, an investigation team is assembled, and the investigation is initiated within 48 hours of the incident.

The ejectors are located at various points throughout the facility and introduce chlorine (under vacuum) into service water to form chlorine solution that subsequently mixes with the water supply at different stages of the treatment process for disinfection purposes.\n\nThe Chlorine Containment and Handling Facility (CCHF) is continuously monitored in the control room by video cameras, process condition transmitters (pressure, flow, etc.) and chlorine leak detectors. Chlorine leak detectors are provided in the storage bays, evaporator rooms, chlorinator room, pipe tunnels and ejector cabinets.  Based on the concentration and location of chlorine detected, the leak detection system will activate a succession of safety measures, beginning with visual and audible alarms, the start-up of the chlorine neutralization system and shut down of the normal ventilation system, and finally, automatically closing the storage vessel liquid chlorine angle valve.  The alarms are annunciated at the chlorine alarm panel as well as at the operator\u2019s console in the control room.  Once alerted, fully trained personnel will respond to assess the chlorine leak.  In addition, each storage vessel valve connecting to the process is provided with a remotely actuated (pneumatic) emergency shutoff system.  In case of a major chlorine leak, chlorine supply can be stopped almost instantaneously by closing the shutoff system, automatically or manually from any of three control panels: unloading platform, chlorine maintenance room, or control room.  Emergency showers and eyewash stations are also provided throughout the Chlorine Containment and Handling Facility including the scrubber system.\n\nA packed-bed chlorine gas scrubber system, consisting of two parallel scrubber units, is provided to neutralize an accidental release of chlorine gas from either stora"

The plant is designed to treat drinking water, including disinfection with chlorine.  The facility currently stores and uses chlorine, a regulated toxic substance under the RMPR and CalARP Program rules, as well as the Federal and California Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Standards.\n\nThe Chlorine System at the Skinner Plant is composed of the following components: (1) a totally contained chlorine feed system to receive, store, and deliver liquid chlorine to the evaporators, chlorine expansion vessels, associated piping and valving, leak sensors and monitors, and instrumentation, (2) totally contained evaporators to convert the chlorine to gas for use in the chlorinators (evaporator units, associated piping and valving, instrumentation and vent exhaust gas arrestors (VEGA units), (3) totally contained chlorinators to regulate flow of chlorine gas under vacuum to the ejectors (chlorinator units, associated piping and valving, instrumentation), (4) ejectors to mix the chlorine gas with service water and inject chlorine solution at application points throughout the plant, and (5) chlorine gas treatment systems for capture and neutralization of an accidental chlorine release in the contained areas (scrubbers, caustic soda, fans, pumps, and associated piping and valving).\n\nThe chlorine storage vessels are totally contained in the Chlorine Containment and Handling Facility storage bays.\n\nThe process flow for the Chlorine System begins at the liquid chlorine angle valves located on the storage vessels in each storage bay, connected by flexible metallic hose to the fixed piping system.

      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nThe Metropolitan Water District of Southern California (Metropolitan) treats and distributes drinking water to member water agencies throughout Southern California.  Metropolitan provides approximately 40 percent of the drinking water used by nearly 19 million people living on the southern California coastal plain between Ventura County and the Mexican border and is one of the largest distributors of treated drinking water in the United States, delivering an average of 1.5 billion gallons of water per day to a 5,200-square-mile service area.\n\nDisinfection is a critical process used by Metropolitan in the treatment of its drinking water.  Disinfection helps to protect public health by killing pathogens in the water and preventing the spread of waterborne diseases.  The use of chlorine as a disinfectant in the treatment of drinking water and wastewater has been the dominant disinfection method in the United States since it was introduced, around the beginning of the last century.  Metropolitan currently utilizes bulk chlorine for disinfection at all of its water treatment plants, including the Robert A. Skinner Water Treatment Plant (Skinner Plant).\n\nAs one might expect from its superior disinfection properties, chlorine is a hazardous substance.  Thus, storing and handling chlorine can present a risk to employees and the public without proper precautions.  Metropolitan regards safe practices in the storing and usage of chlorine to be of primary importance and has an excellent safety record with chlorine.  To further safe practices, Metropolitan constructed a Chlorine Containment and Handling Facility in 2008 to contain all chlorine inside a building which is protected by vapor scrubbers.\n\nSkinner Plant's chlorine storage and usage process is subject to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program Rule (RMPR) and also to the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program regulation.  Both of these regulations requ"
