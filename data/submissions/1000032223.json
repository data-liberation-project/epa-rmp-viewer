If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the Cobb County Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.  We do not maintain a fire brigade, but do maintain fire response equipment such as hand held fire extinguishers for small fires.\n\n\n\nA description of your facility and the regulated substances handled:  The Apollo Industries facility, located at 1850 S. Cobb Industrial Blvd, Smyrna Georgia, is operated as a contract aerosol manufacturing facility.  Apollo manufactures various organic and water based solvent cleaners and pesticides as janitorial aerosol products.  Waste water generated by the operation of on-site groundwater remediation system is discharged to the Cobb County sewer system after pre-treatment.   The production portion of the facility is located in the Apollo building adjacent to an aboveground storage tanks (AST) tank farm.  Production chemicals are stored in drums or totes and also within the ASTs.  Finished products are stocked in the warehouse areas and shipped off-property through the loading dock area adjacent to the warehouse.  Liquid process chemical deliveries are made directly to the tank farm via tanker truck to permanent piping systems.\n\n\n\nThe property is located off of South Cobb Drive and is surrounded by industrial tenants.  The primary AST storage material and transfer operations takes place in a central portion of the facility with storm water discharges also leaving this area to the south.  The facility operates 11 propellant tanks with four tanks used for propane blends (One 12,000 gallon tank for NP-70, One 12,000 gallon tank for NP-46, One 5,500 gallon tank for A-31, One 5,500 gallon tank for A-108), four 1,000 gallon tanks for 152A and 134A, On"

      "SummaryText": "e 5,500 gallon tank for DME, and a 13 ton tank for CO2.  These tanks are located in the central courtyard on the west side of the production plant.  The approximate weight amount of propane propellants stored on site is 149,445 pounds.\n\n\n\nThe worst-case and alternative release scenario:  Our worst-case scenario is failure of one 12,000-gallon propane storage tanks when filled to the greatest amount allowed of approximately 49,000 pounds (88% at 60F), resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  The resulting distance to the endpoint extends offsite, and public receptors are within the distance (0.3 miles) to the endpoint.  Our alternative release scenario is a break in a 2-inch diameter transfer pipe with a 1 psi overpressure, leading to a 10-minute release and explosion.  The pipe break could be associated with either the transfer line between the transfer pump to the actual gasser or from a line rupture between the low to high pressure pumps.  The resulting distance to the endpoint extends offsite, and public receptors are within the distance (0.2 miles) to the endpoint.  All release amounts, endpoint distances and receptors were modeled based on the tables provided in the EPA guidance for Propane storage facilities and using Marplot Ver 4.2.2.  Copies of the EPA Program guidance and the Marplot output figures are provided with the RMP Plan. \n\n\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:  This facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule, the OSHA PSM standard, and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.  The propane system is intended to be designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with NFPA-58 and state law.  The tanks and equipment are designed to comply with recognized and generally accepted good engineering practices.\n\n\n\nFive-year accident history:  We have never had an accident involving propane that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or shelterings i"

We have coordinated our response plans (RCRA Contingency Plan and Emergency Action Plan) with the fire department; members of the fire department have inspected our propane system and conducted a joint exercise with us in past annual emergency evacuation tests.\n\n\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety:  Continue to reinforce safe practices during operational training and safety training meetings.\n\n"
