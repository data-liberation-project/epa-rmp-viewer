The plans also includes first aid procedures for immediate care and instructions for follow-up medical care when necessary.   The plans address training requirements for employees including production employees, supervisors, managers, and operators.  Evacuation drills are an important part of the training. \r\nUnder Shamrock's emergency response policy, employees who have been trained as First Responders - Awareness Level may initially respond to releases that can be addressed without entering the danger area (i.e. de-energizing equipment).  At this time, First Responders - Awareness Level authority is addressed through the use of the refrigeration contractors who have remote access to system controls in order to provide mitigation during release events: no additional first responder training is provided.  Shamrock will evacuate affected area, begin notification process and rely on off-site responders (e.g., the fire department and refrigeration contrac"

Shamrock certifies its onsite operators following completion of operator training and Shamrock's confirmation of the operator's ability to apply what they have learned.  (Addressed under Training chapter.)\r\n5. Employee involvement in the Prevention Program.  This is addressed on two levels.  First, refrigeration equipment operators participate in the planning and evaluation of the Prevention Programs (e.g., Process Hazard Analysis study team, writing and/or reviewing operating procedures, Incident Investigation team, etc.).  This involvement encourages ownership of the Prevention Program and positively affects the operators' day-to-day activities.  \r\nSecond, all employees (direct hires and contract) at this facility receive ammonia awareness training.  Additionally, they have access to the RMP/PSM information.  These activities improve the overall safety of the employees. (Both levels are addressed under Employee Participation chapter)\r\n6. Implementation of additional measures when changes are planned (procedural or mechanical).  These measures begin before any changes are made and may include a Process Hazard Analysis, operator training, and Process Safety Information updates plus other measures required by their Management of Change Procedure.  \r\nIf a mechanical change is required and for maintenance contracts, Shamrock follows the Shamrock procedure for selecting a contractor based on the company's experience and safety history. Additionally, if welding, grinding, or other Hot Work occurs close to the refrigeration system, a Shamrock Hot Work permit is required.  The purpose of the permit and the associated Hot Work procedure is to minimize the possibility of a fire. \r\nFollowing completion of a mechanical change, a pre-startup safety review is required before the system can be started.

The RMP Prevention Program is equivalent to OSHA's Process Safety Management Program (PSM).  The Prevention Program implemented by Shamrock is essential to help prevent releases and to minimize the effects if a release does occur.\r\nKey objectives of Shamrock Prevention Program are briefly described below:\r\n\r\n1. Maintain current and complete refrigeration system technical information. (Addressed under the Process Safety Information chapter)\r\n2. Thorough team evaluation of the refrigeration system.
