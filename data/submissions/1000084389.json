The Washita Plant has an active safety program covering both employees and contract workers. This program encompasses promotion of safe work practices to prevent personal accidents, and incidents that would adversely affect the community. XTO recognizes their commitment to accident prevention through continuing programs including personnel training. Consideration is also given to safety in the design, installation, and operation of natural gas production and gathering systems and modifications to the Site. The safety commitment is also carried forth as evidenced by an aggressive maintenance program. Reasonable controls have been implemented to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. In the unlikely event that a release does occur, arrangements have been made within the local community to provide response and control of any catastrophic releases. Passive mitigation, such as vents, is present at the site to manage any overpressure conditions that may occur. \r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nThe facility is located at 1388 Mockingbird Road, Carter County, located just outside of Ardmore Oklahoma.  The plant receives compressed natural gas and condensate that is inherent with the operation of a hydrocarbons plant gathering and liquids separation site and stores regulated flammable substances above the threshold quantity. The facility further compresses the natural gas and treats a small portion of gas for internal consumption. The flammable substances are addressed throughout the program level 2 Risk Management Plan (RMP), and may include methane, ethane, propane, and butane, which are all components of the Natural Gas Liquids Product (NGLP).\r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nXTO maintains a variety of technical docu"

These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. Employees at the Site are active in the development and maintenance of up-to-date process safety information. Chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in safety data sheets (SDSs). This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known concerns. For specific operations areas, the Site has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters, such as temperature, level, and composition. The Site ensures that each process is maintained within approved limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, trained personnel, and automated shutdown systems.\r\n\r\nThe Site also maintains technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and Site changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\r\n\r\nOperations at the Site have hazards that are managed to ensure continued safe operation. The following is a description of existing safety features applicable to prevention of accidental releases of regulated substances in the location.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe Site maintains a written emergency response program, which is in place to protect worker and public safety, as well as to protect the environment.

The procedures address aspects of emergency response by outside experts and include proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post-incident cleanup and any decontamination requirements. Employees receive appropriate training in procedures necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties which includes contacting trained responders. The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to Site processes or other facilities within the Site.\r\n\r\nThe overall emergency response program for the Site is coordinated with the Eddy County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). This coordination includes periodic meetings, which include local emergency response officials, and local government officials. The Site contacts local emergency responders annually with regard to the hazards of regulated substances at the Site.\r\n\r\nXTO has implemented an Emergency Response Plan (ERP), elements of which overlap those of the RMP. The ERP provides the following information:\r\n\r\n\u00bf\tProcedures for informing the public and offsite emergency response officials of a release.\r\n\u00bf\tThe individuals and groups contacted, the means by which they will be contacted, the time frame for notification, and the information that will be provided is included in the ERP.\r\n\u00bf\tThe proper procedures for first aid and medical treatment for employees, first responders, and members of the public exposed to a release.\r\n\u00bf\tSafety precautions for injured parties and detailed information for medical professionals\r\n\u00bf\tInformation regarding who is likely responsible for providing appropriate treatment (e.g., an employee, an employee with specialized training, or a medical professional)."

In the event a change is identified that would improve safety, that change will be implemented upon management approval and directive. \r\n\r\nIncident Investigation\r\n\r\nThe Site has had no incidents, to date, that would require an accident investigation. However, there is a system in place to investigate any incident that could result, or could reasonably result in, a fire/explosion, flammable gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury. The goal of an investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to management for resolution. Corrective actions potentially taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations will be tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding or recommendation will be documented, and the investigation results reviewed with all employees and contractors who could be affected by the findings."
