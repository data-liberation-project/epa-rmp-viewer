(DPC) is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations as well as implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. \n\nOur emergency response program includes procedures for notification of the local fire department; notification of any potentially affected neighbors; and notification of local, state and federal agencies.   Safety is an essential part of our operations, the safety devices built-in to the design of this facility, the safe handling procedures that we use, and the extensive training of our personnel.\n\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nDPC is a 52-year-old company whose primary activities encompass distributing and repackaging inorganic chemicals and compressed gases as well as manufacturing water treatment products. For example, chlorine is used to produce sodium hypochlorite commonly know as household bleach.   We are headquartered in Houston, Texas and operate more than 20 plants across the United States.\n \nWe have these regulated substances at our facility: Chlorine, and Sulfur Dioxide (anhydrous).  DPC stores these materials in 150-lb. cylinders, 800-lb. containers, and ton containers for use by our customers.\n\nThe maximum inventories of these substances at this facility are:\n\nChlorine  - 10,000 lbs.\nSulfur dioxide (anhydrous) - 30,000 lbs.\n\n3.\tThe Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\n\nTo perform the"

The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nExecutive Summary\n\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from Chlorine storage.  The scenario involves releasing the entire contents of a ton in a gaseous form over 10 minutes.  This release would reach the toxic endpoint (0.0087 mg/l or 3 ppm) and public receptors.\n\nOne alternative release scenario has been submitted for each toxic substance present in Program 3 processes.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Chlorine is a vessel leak.  This would release material in a gaseous form over 15 minutes.  This release would reach the toxic endpoint (0.0087 mg/l or 3 ppm) and public receptors.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Sulfur dioxide (anhydrous) is a vessel leak.  This would release material in a gaseous form over 15 minutes.  This release would reach the toxic endpoint (0.0078 mg/l or 3 ppm) and public receptors.\n\n4.\tThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  A number of processes at our facility are subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.  Our facility is also subject to EPCRA Section 302 notification requirements.    The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nDPC maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our process"

The studies are undertaken by a  team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated every 5 years as required or as necessary.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nExecutive Summary\n\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, DPC maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, and normal shutdown.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nDPC has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every 3 years and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nDPC carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Qualified personnel carry out maintenance operations with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nCompliance Audits\nDPC conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.

These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation\nDPC truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses in particular.\n\n\nExecutive Summary\n\n\nContractors\nOn occasion, our company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out.  DPC has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related the contractor's work and the processes.  Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\n\n5.\tFive-year Accident History\nDPC has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies, there have been no accidental releases during this period meeting RMP requirements. \n\n6.\tEmergency Response Plan\nDPC carries a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas."
