It is International Cushioning Company, LLC's (ICC's) policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  If an emergency were to occur, ICC's policy is to notify the Propst Crossroads Volunteer Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.\n\nA description of your facility and the regulated substances handled:  This facility manufactures expandable polystyrene (EPS) resin.  Isopentane is used in EPS resin manufacturing.  The regulated process consists of one isopentane 9,200-gallon storage tank and the associated EPS resin manufacturing equipment.\n\nThe worst-case and alternative release scenarios:  ICC's worst-case scenario is failure of the 9,200-gallon storage tank when filled to the greatest amount allowed (85%), resulting in a vapor cloud explosion. The resulting distance to the endpoint extends offsite and public receptors are within the distance to the endpoint.  ICC's alternative release scenario is a break in a 1-inch diameter pipe handling the liquid phase leading to a 60-minute release and pool fire. The resulting distance to the endpoint extends offsite and public receptors are within the distance to the endpoint.  No administrative controls and mitigation measures where used to limit the impacts of the reported scenarios.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:  This facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's Process Safety Management standard, and all applicable state and local codes and regulations. The isopentane system is designed, installed and maintained in accordance with NFPA-30 and state law. \n\nFive-year accident history:   ICC has never had an accident involving isopentane that"

ICC has coordinated its response plans with the fire department and members of the fire department have inspected the facility. \n\nPlanned changes to improve safety:   None."
