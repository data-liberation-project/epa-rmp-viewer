The responsible official at the facility is Eddie De La Rosa, Plant Manager. The food processing operation utilizes Ammonia (Anhydrous) in its process. A single tank on the north side of the property houses 23,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia. The container has manual shutoff valves in case of an emergency, and an alarm will trigger if a release occurs. The facility remains staffed twenty-four hours a day. Employees check the anhydrous ammonia processes routinely throughout the day.  Rich employees are not first responders in the event of an anhydrous ammonia release. City of Brownsville Emergency Team will act as the first responder.\n\n\n\nNo accidental anhydrous ammonia releases have occurred at this facility over last five years.\n\n\n\nIt was determined that the facility that stores and uses Ammonia was designed, built, and operated in accordance with applicable codes and industrial guidelines. Continuous inspections as to the integrity and the condition of the process are made daily by Rich Products personnel. The Process Hazard Analysis will be updated at minimum once every five years. \n\n\n\nRich Products ensures that each employee presently operating the Ammonia process, including each newly assigned employee, has been successfully trained or tested in the operating procedures. Annual refresher training provided to each employee operating the process ensures that the employee understands and adheres to the current operation procedures of the process.\n\n\n\nRich Products facility Employee Participation Plan is as follows and is in accordance with 40 CFR 68.83.

Effort has been made to identify potential causes and consequence scenarios; however, it is possible that an event could occur that has not been foreseen. The Process Hazard Analysis and the Hazard Assessment are examples of this effort. The emergency procedure complies with the EPA Emergency Response Program requirements.\n\n\n\nRich Products maintains a written emergency response plan that includes specific instructions in the event of a release of anhydrous ammonia. The plan is in accordance to 40 CFR 68.180 as stated in 4.2. It includes public notification protocol, and emergency health care (the MSDS includes emergency health care information).
