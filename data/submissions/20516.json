The company utilizes the methods set forth in its Process Safety Management Plan to implement its release prevention program.\n\n        \n\nRegulated Substance Handled:     50% Formaldehyde Solution                                    CAS #   50-00-00\n\n\n\nMaximum quantity stored:    150,000 pounds of formaldehyde solution\n\n\n\nAverage quantity stored: 50,000 pounds of formaldehyde solution\n\n\n\nStorage location:    Outside Bulk Storage Tank maintained at a temperature of approximately 60?C.\n\n\n\nManufacturing Process:    The facility manufactures urea-formaldehyde resins which are primarily used as glues. \n\n\n\nWorst Case Release:    The worst case release scenario involving formaldehyde would be the rupture of the bulk storage tank and consequent release of 117,500 pounds of formaldehyde solution into the containment dike.  The dike is large enough to contain the entire release.  This limits the pool surface area, giving a lower evaporation rate. The evaporation rate of the formaldehyde was calculated using the formulas given in EPA's Off-Site Consequence Guidance document along with actual vapor pressure data from the manufacturer.  A ten minute release period was used. Under worst-case weather conditions, the formaldehyde could travel 0.68 miles before dispersing to the degree that it would no longer pose a hazard to the public.\n\n\n\nAlternate release:    The alternate release scenario involving formaldehyde also involves the failure of the bulk storage tank, but assuming that our average stored quantity of 39,200 pounds of formaldehyde solution would be released. Again, the entire quantity would be contained within the dike.  Under average weather conditions, the f"

Actually, as the liquid cools, it quickly polymerizes and begins to gel. Therefore, the actual evaporation rate is expected to be even lower than our calculated rate.\n\n\n\nAccident Release Prevention:    The facility is subject to OSHA's Process Safety Management requirements.  It has a written  Process Safety Plan.  The facility uses employee training, standard operating procedures, and equipment inspection and maintenance programs to prevent releases of formaldehyde.\n\n\n\n\n\nSouthern Resin, Inc. - Executive Summary, Page 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccident History:    Within the past five years, there have been no releases of formaldehye which have caused on-site, or off-site injury, death, or environmental damage.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response:    The facility has a written emergency response plan.  The plan is reviewed and updated at least annually. The facility does not have an emergency response team.  Employees may only respond to very small fires which can be controlled with a portable fire extinguisher or to chemical releases which can be absorbed, neutralized or otherwise controlled by the employees in the immediate area or by maintenance employees.  For all larger incidents, outside responders, such as the fire department will be called.  All employees are trained in proper plant evacuation.   \n\n\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety:    The company is planning to hire an additional person to assist in safety implementation and environmental compliance.\n\n"
