As part of this process, the CCWWC has implemented a Process Safety Management program that includes the identification, evaluation and prevention of chemical releases. An element of the safety program at the CCWWC is an Emergency Response Plan and effective training for its employees.\n\n\n\nThe Clarence Cannon Wholesale Water Commission is a joint municipal utility commission formed under Chapter 393.700 of the Revised Statutes of Missouri. The CCWWC is a regional water treatment facility producing water for 24 member communities and rural water districts in northeast Missouri.\n\n\n\nThe CCWWC uses chlorine gas in its process. Chlorine gas is stored in one ton cylinders, with a maximum of five cylinders on site at any given time. This is the only PSM regulated substance on site at the water treatment facility. \n\n\n\nThe water treatment facility is located in Monroe County, Missouri approximately three miles west of Florida, Missouri on State Route U. It is a very rural area with few households and bordered on the east, north and south by state and federally owned land.  \n\n\n\nWorst case scenario was performed using the RMP Comp Model and per the new instructions, no summary of the OCA was included in this executive summary.  \n\n\n\nThe CCWWC uses an enclosure to limit exposure of chlorine gas to the outside environment. The enclosure consists of a room in the treatment plant facility with access only from the outside of the facility. An alarm system will alert the plant operator on duty prior to the operator entering the room. The alarm consists of two separate leak detectors with separate low level warning and alarm levels. It contains two flashing red lights on the wall outside of the control room and in the ton container storage room. There are two audible alarms that sounds in the operator control room a"

      "SummaryText": "nd outside the chlorine control room when a leak is detected by the leak detection system. It is also connected to an automatic alarm dialer that alarms operators off site, if necessary. The exhaust fan for the enclosed area is not connected to the alarm system or light system. A chlorine leak would be contained in the enclosed area until the leak was stopped. The fan would then be used to clear the area. The feed system is a vacuum feed system with the regulators mounted directly to the one ton container. Any loss of vacuum prevents chlroine feed. The facility is staffed 24-hours per day (7) Seven days per week. \n\n\n\nThe alternative scenario for a chlorine release at the CCWWC facility was done using the RMP Comp model. The scenario indicated an endpoint of 0.5 miles. This would affect an estimated residential population of 9 people, the Mark Twain Lake and the state and federally owned lands. The CCWWC uses the same enclosure as previously described as a passive mitigation measure with the same affects and results. \n\n\n\nThe CCWWC complies with the OSHA PSM rule. The CCWWC also has standard practices to prevent accidents. These include thorough container inspections upon delivery. Any suspected containers are returned without use. Operators do volume readings on containers during every operator round of the plant. Any release would be noticed by the loss of volume or the leak detectors and alarms.\n\n\n\nAdditional prevention practices include quarterly safety inspections, Process Hazard Analysis Program, operator safety training program, SOPs for chlorine handling, routine maintenance program and the leak detection and alarm system. \n\n\n\nThe CCWWC has had no reportable accidental releases in the last five years or in the entire operation of the facility since its start in 1992. In June of 2007 the CCWWC completed the construction of a second 5 MGD water treatment plant in the same location as the original plant. While the construction did increase the production capabili"

Each member of key personnel has a role in the event of a release. The emergency response program is reviewed on a regular basis to update information and revise procedures as necessary. \n\n\n\nThe program is implemented and supervised by technical support staff from United Water, the contract operations firm for the treatment facility. United Water has an extensive Environmental Health and Safety program, which includes a hotline incident reporting system for rapid response to all EH&S incidents.The facility recieves annual Environmental Health and Safety inspections from the United Water EH&S Department.
