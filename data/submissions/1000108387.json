The emergency response program:\nThe facilities emergency response program is based upon OSHA's HAZWOPER standard.  At this site employees are trained to recognize emergencies and initiate emergency response from outside agencies.  They have been trained to OSHAs First Responder Awareness Level.  The employees receive annual refresher training in their role in the emergency plan.  Emergency response activities have also been coordinated with the Motiva Refinery Emergency Response Team.  \n6.  Planned changes to improve safety:\nThe facility resolves recommendations from Process Hazard Analysis (PHAs) and Incident Investigations, some of which may result in modifications to the plant design and operating procedures."

Air Products manages the safety of the regulated processes by means of operating procedures, equipment testing and inspections, safety devices (e.g. alarms, shutdowns, instrumentation, relief devices) inherent in the design of this facility and other controls and systems designed to prevent accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  Safe work practices and training of our personnel supplement the inherent safe design of the plant.   \n\nOur emergency response program is based upon OSHAs HAZWOPER regulation.  The emergency response program response plan includes procedures for the notification of the Motiva Refinery Emergency Response Team so that appropriate measures can be taken by local emergency responders to control accidental releases.  \n\nThis document has been prepared in accordance with the EPAs Risk Management Plan regulation (40 CFR, Part 68).  The substances and processes considered during the preparation of this RMP and the scenarios described were selected based on criteria established in the regulation.  \n\n 2.  The stationary source and regulated substances handled:\nThis hydrogen separation facility brings in refinery fuel and separates the hydrogen from the refinery fuel gas to recover C2+ hydrocarbons from the refinery\u2019s Rich Gas systems to be used as feed to the neighboring Ethane Cracker. This is done through compression and pressure swing adsorption.  Pure hydrogen is then delivered to the refinery\u2019s hydrogen network. It also sends hydrocarbon condensate back to the refinery.  Materials handled include Hydrogen/ Hydrocarbon Mixture (Hydrogen, Methane, Ethane, Propane, Butane, and Pentane).  \n\n3.
