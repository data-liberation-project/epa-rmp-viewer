Facility accidental release and emergency response policy.\n\nThe management and employees of Tri County FS, Inc. are committed to the prevention of any accidental    releases of Anhydrous Ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. The stationary source and the regulated substances handled. \n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient. Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.\n\nThe maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia that can be stored would be 140000 pounds, this includes the maximum capacity of the storage tank.\n\n3. The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a [storage tank] released as a gas over 10 minutes. The maximum quantity released would be 140000 pounds, which represents the volume of the [ largest storage tank] as limited by design standards.\n\nThe distance to the endpoint of .14 mg/L for the worst-case scenario is 1.1 miles. \n\nThe alternative release scenario based on the most likely potential incident is a release from a break in a transfer hose.\n\nThe distance to the endpoint of .14 mg/L for the alternative scenario is .19 miles. This release has the possibilithy of extending beyond the facility boundry.  \n\n4. The accidental release prevention program. \n\nThis facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release  Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations. This facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc, as adopted by state regulat"

Five year accident history.\n\na. The following is a list of accidental releases in the past five years that had occurred at the facility:\n\n    -We had an accidental release of 3300 pounds of anhydrous ammonia on 02/04/1999. The release was\n     from a 4500 pound nurse tank that had a leaky shutoff valve. Several businesses were notified of the \n     release with no reccommeded evacuation. There were no personal injuries or property damage from\n     the release.  The proper  agencies were notified and followed up with a description of the release.\n\n    -No other accidental releases occured in the past five years that we are aware of.\n\n6. The emergency response program.\n\nThe facility has: \n\n--a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38; \n\n--provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA):\n\n--a written emergency response plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.120, including pre-emergency planning and employee training.\n\n7. Planned changes to Improve safety.\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions. There are no specific safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
