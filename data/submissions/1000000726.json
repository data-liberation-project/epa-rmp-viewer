      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary 2009\n\nThe Harpeth Valley Utilities District (HVUD) Water Treatment Plant provides potable water to portions of Davidson, Williamson, and Cheatham Counties in Tennessee.  The source of water for this facility is the Cumberland River.  Part of the treatment process involves disinfection with chlorine to kill pathogenic organisms and to provide safe water to HVUD customers.  To provide this capability, the HVUD Water Treatment Plant has a chemical storage and feed building built specifically to handle and feed chlorine in our treatment process.  The basic goal of our chemical treatment staff is the safe and effective handling of chlorine.  Our safety philosophy is orientated toward affirmative control and minimization of risk to the greatest extent possible.  Every reasonable effort is made to accomplish this goal.  We must meet requirements set down in the OSHA Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals Standard (29 CFR 1910.110), and also by EPCRA Section 302.  Our personnel are thoroughly trained, and our equipment is inspected regularly by our personnel, equipment vendors, or both.  \n\nBeginning in early 2009, we have reduced our on-site storage requirements from 24 one-ton cylinders to 16 one-ton cylinders.  In addition, we have installed a dry medium scrubber system capable of handling up to two tons of chlorine.  Along with the scrubber we have installed automatic shut-off valves on each of the 16 cylinders.  The scrubber, in concert with the shut-off valves, provides a much safer chlorine system for the Harpeth Valley Utilities District.\n\nAlong with the Risk Management Program, HVUD must comply with the OSHA required Process Safety Management Plan.  In addition the District must maintain an Emergency Response Plan.  These programs are inspected by regulatory authorities.  We strive to maintain these programs in order to comply with federal and state regulations and to provide a safe working environment for our employees.  These pla"

Our chlorine system responders have been trained to the Hazardous Materials Technician Level per CFR 1910.120.\n\nThe chlorine building includes chlorine detectors which will sound alarms when chlorine levels in the air exceed 1 part per million, then automatically activate the scrubber system.  We have self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBAA?s) and level A suits located in appropriate areas for use by our personnel.  We have maintained a Respiratory Protection Program in conjunction with our Emergency Response Program which trains our employees in the proper use and care of our SCBAA?s.  An emergency repair kit for chlorine cylinders is located in our chlorinator room.  Our Emergency Response Plan has specific procedures for contacting other related agencies and the public in the event of an accidental release.  The Metropolitan Emergency Management Agency (MEMA) will be notified of any chlorine release of 10 pounds or greater, or any chlorine leak which cannot be contained utilizing tools and procedures immediately available on site.  Our employees have been trained in notification requirements.  Training for these programs has been conducted as recently as March of 2009.  \n\nThe Harpeth Valley Utilities District Water Treatment Plant has experienced no accidents or incidents resulting in a reportable release since the beginning of our risk management program in 1997.  We will continue to train our personnel regularly on all chlorine emergency response and notification procedures.\n"
