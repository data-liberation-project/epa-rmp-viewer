Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n\nThe Air Products and Chemicals (APCI) plant, which is located on Highway 95 in Calvert City, is a Program 3 facility in the Environmental Protection Agencys (EPA) Risk Management Plan (RMP).  Under RMP, the Calvert City plant is classified as two sources:  \n\n1.  The main plant stationary source on Highway 95 and  \n2.  The storage, pipeline and barge unloading source at the Tennessee River.  \n \nThe largest quantity feedstock, Vinyl Acetate Monomer (VAM), is used in the production of polyvinyl alcohol (PVOH) and latex emulsions.  Ethylene and Vinyl Chloride Monomer (VCM) are also used in the production of latex emulsions. VAM, VCM and ethylene, in the quantities handled at this facility, are considered hazardous by EPA under the Risk Management Rule.\n \nAir Products and Chemicals, Inc. (APCI) is committed to continuous improvement in all aspects of safety and environmental performance.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal, Commonwealth of Kentucky and local rules and regulations.  The APCI Plant Manager at the Calvert City plant is responsible for facility operation.  The APCI Environmental Manager reports to the Plant Manager and has overall responsibility for compliance with all aspects of the facilitys Risk Management Plan.  APCI Environmental, Health and Safety (EH&S) operates under a tiered Management System, with policies and procedures cascading from Corporate requirements to detailed plant operating and safe work practices.

Employees are regularly trained, certified, and subject to random substance abuse checks to ensure the safety of the plant.  Our safety process contains many other elements including management of change, hot work procedures and regular process hazards analysis using the hazard and operability (HAZOP) tool.  All contractors working at the plant are subject to the same rules and procedures that APCI employees must follow under the contractor safety program.  \n\nThe emergency response plan includes Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response (HAZWOPER)  training and qualifications for on-site employees.  APCI participates in a partnership among the Calvert City area industries named the Calvert City Industrial Mutual Aid Program or CIMAP.

The substances and processes considered during the preparation of this document, the scenarios described, and modeling techniques selected were chosen  based on the criteria established in the regulation.\n\n2.  The stationary source and regulated substances handled: \n\nThe APCI stationary source that makes up the storage, pipeline and barge unloading facility at the Tennessee River is considered a separate facility under RMP.  This facility unloads Vinyl Acetate Monomer (VAM) from barges that are shipped from the Texas Gulf Coast up the Tennessee River to Calvert City.  VAM is unloaded from the barges and transferred to one of two storage tanks, FB-4515 and FB-4516.  VAM is pumped to the main plant via a pipeline that runs from the river storage tanks to the main plant.  \n\nThe only RMP regulated substance handled at this stationary source is Vinyl Acetate Monomer (VAM), a toxic liquid.  The maximum quantity of VAM inventoried in an individual storage tank is 11,700,000 pounds.\n\n3.  The \"worst case scenarios and alternative release scenarios, including administrative controls and mitigation measures that limit the distance for each reported scenario: \n\nThe VAM storage tank at the Tennessee River, FB-4516, contains 1.5 million gallons when the tank is full.  Passive mitigation includes an 8-foot tall dike wall that will contain the entire contents of the tank.  Under the worst case scenario (a total tank failure), 11,700,000 pounds of VAM would be released into the diked area.  Evaporation of this VAM over a one-hour period under worst case weather conditions would result in a vapor cloud that would spread into the community.  Using the EPA lookup tables for rural terrain, the distance to the ERPG-2 endpoint would exceed plant boundaries.  \n\nThe alternative case for this source would be an uncontained leak of VAM from a pressure relief valve at ground level.  The uncontained release of 51,000 pounds under m"

      "SummaryText": "ore likely weather conditions would spread to a distance that would exceed plant boundaries.  No mitigation factors were considered for this scenario.  Factors such as mechanical integrity programs for pressure relief devices and periodic tank thickness checks would lessen the impact of the alternative case scenario reducing the off-site consequences of any release.  \n\n4.  The general accidental release prevention program and specific prevention measures:\n\nKey to the plants prevention programs are the layers of protection provided at each process.  The hierarchy starts with the facility design and construction which is to all applicable design standards using qualified engineers and contractors. A comprehensive mechanical integrity program includes routine checks of all process equipment, tanks, vessels and piping.  These checks are done using nondestructive testing techniques with records maintained in the permanent equipment files.  \n\nBarge unloading activities are controlled by two people that are present during the unloading.  These people have been trained and certified as tankermen by the US Coast Guard.  When unloading a barge they can instantly stop VAM transfer at any time.  They can also contact emergency assistance via two separate means of communications.   \n\nIn the event an upset leads to an uncontrolled condition, process safety devices including pressure relief valves, rupture disks, and flame arresters are in place to safely control upset conditions. Containment dikes around the storage tanks are designed to hold the entire contents of the tank. \n\nEach plant process design is subject to detailed process hazard reviews during design, construction and startup. All process changes must be reviewed and approved under a detailed Management of Change procedure before any changes are made.  At periods not to exceed five years, Operational Plant Hazard reviews are conducted by teams of supervisors, engineers, operators, mechanics and safety professionals.\n\n"

These audits are documented as part of the basic safety process with corrective action defined and tracked through plant safety management systems. \n\n\n\n\n5.  Five year accident history: \n\nNone of the stationary sources or covered processes at the Air Products and Chemicals plant at Calvert City has had an incident in the last five years that would be reported under RMP.  There have been no releases of VAM that have had any off-site consequences, resulted in any employee injuries or resulted in any significant equipment damage.  \n\n6. The emergency response program: \n\nThe facilitys emergency response program is based on the OSHA HAZWOPER standard. There are at least 16 trained emergency responders in the fire and rescue squad that are divided across four shifts and day workers.  Each shift has a fire and rescue squad that is led by the shift safety officer.  In an emergency, the safety officer assumes on-scene command of any incident.  On-site emergency resources include a fire/foam truck, a rescue truck and ambulance.  In addition to these resources, APCI is a member of the Calvert Industrial Mutual Aid Program (CIMAP) and can count on pooled resources from surrounding plants and communities.  As a member of the LEPC, APCI regularly stages emergency response drills both in-house and outside with emergency responders from the public and private sector.  LEPC members and other emergency responders regularly tour the facility to familiarize themselves with the plant, its hazardous materials, equipment, layout, personnel and emergency procedures.       \n\n7.

The system is composed of a siren network in Calvert City and Livingston County that is activated by the 911 operator.  The 911 operator is backed up by the safety officer at Air Products, who can also activate the system.  In the event of an emergency, 911 would activate the sirens and voice command modules that are placed in public buildings such as the convalescent center, city hall and the Calvert City Elementary school.  Once a citizen has heard the siren or the voice command module alert, they are to turn their radio on to the local Calvert City radio station (WCCK) and listen for specific instructions.  The sirens are routinely tested one day per month and training in the community has been ongoing for almost one year."
