This Risk Management Plan summarizes the management, administrative, procedural, and technological controls that work together to minimize the risk to the community of hazardous chemical releases.  The plan summary is organized to correspond with specific EPA RMP definitions and requirements, including:  \n\n-Introduction;\n-ATOFINA Chemicals, Inc.'s Policies to Protect Health, Environment, and Safety;\n-Facility Identification and Regulated Substances in Covered Processes;\n-Hazard Assessment;\n-Prevention Program;\n-Five Year Accident History;\n-Emergency Response Plan; and,\n-Planned Changes to Improve Safety.\n\nATOFINA CHEMICALS, INC. POLICIES FOR HEALTH, ENVIRONMENT, AND SAFETY\n\nATOFINA Chemicals, Inc. is committed to employee, public, and environmental safety by conducting its operations in a safe and responsible manner.  This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive risk management program that covers areas such as equipment design and installation, plant operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at the Crosby plant.  The Risk Management Plan formalizes and documents these activities.\n\nThis commitment to health, environment, and safety (HES) starts with the CEO.  Senior management routinely dedicates time to review HES matters.  This emphasis on safety is carried through to the facility level, where the Plant Manager and the Safety Team regularly review safety performance, take corrective actions, and strive for continuous improvement.  The success of ATOFINA Chemicals, Inc.'s HES programs is also reflected by a strong commitment to safety by employees and contractors.\n\nATOFINA Chemicals, Inc.'s HES programs include policies, procedures, standards, and guidance materials designed to fulfill ATOFINA Chemicals, Inc.'s commitment to health"

These materials include Risk Management Program guidance to help our facilities prevent and/or reduce the risk of accidents.\n\nFACILITY IDENTIFICATION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES IN COVERED PROCESSES\n\nThe ATOFINA Chemicals, Inc. Crosby facility is located at 18000 Crosby-Eastgate Road in Crosby, Texas.  The facility manufactures liquid organic peroxides which are primarily used in the production of plastic resins, polystyrene, polyethylene, polypropylene, PVC, and fiberglass.  Certain substances used and produced within the facility are regulated substances under 40CFR68, the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) Rule.  These substances are present at or above the minimum threshold for RMP applicability and for the Crosby plant include Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) and 2-Methyl Propene (Isobutylene).\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT\nTOXIC WORST-CASE SCENARIO\n\nThe worst-case accidental release scenario submitted for Program 3 toxic substances involves a catastophic failure of the Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) storage tank.  Sulfur Dioxide is purchased and transported to the Crosby facility via pressurized tank trucks.  SO2 is stored as a gas in a pressure controlled storage tank.  Administrative controls limit the quantity of SO2 stored on-site to 90% of the storage tank's capacity.  This quantity is assumed to be released over a 10 minute period and that the entire quantity is released as a vapor.  Based on dispersion modeling, using the EPA Off-Site Consequence Analysis (OCA), and EPA assumptions, the resulting concentrations of SO2 from the worst-case scenario release caused off-site impacts.\n\nIt should be noted that the worst-case scenario is recognized by regulatory agencies and ATOFINA Chemicals, Inc. as an extremely unlikely event.  Mitigation and prevention procedures and measures are implemented by ATOFINA Chemicals, Inc. to reduce the risk of the worst-case event occurring.\n\nFLAMMABLE WORST-CASE SCENARIO\n\nThe worst-case accidental release scenario submitted for Program "

Isobutylene is purchased and transported to the Crosby facility via pressurized tank trucks.  It is stored as a gas in a pressure controlled storage tank.  Administrative controls limit the quantity of isobutylene stored on-site to 90% of the storage tank's capacity.  This quantity is assumed to be released over a 10 minute period.  It is further assumed that the entire quantity is released as a vapor, which comes in contact with an ignition source, with 10% of the total released quantity participating in a vapor cloud explosion.  Based on dispersion modeling, using the EPA OCA look-up tables, and EPA assumptions, the 1 psi overpressurization resulting from the isobutylene vapor cloud explosion caused off-site impacts.\n\nAgain, it should be noted that the worst-case scenario is recognized by regulatory agencies and ATOFINA Chemicals, Inc. as an extremely unlikely event.  Mitigation and prevention procedures and measures are implemented by ATOFINA Chemicals, Inc. to reduce the risk of the worst-case event occurring.\n\nWORST-CASE RELEASE MITIGATION MEASURES\n\nThe multiple layers of preventive and mitigation measures in use at the Crosby facility make it very unlikely that either worst-case scenarios will occur.  In the unlikely event that such a release occurs, ATOFINA Chemicals, Inc. has mitigation measures in place to reduce any potential impacts.\n\nIn compliance with regulatory criteria associated with RMP evaluations, active mitigation systems cannot be considered in modeling worst-case scenario impacts; however, the significant planning and subsequent implementation that ATOFINA Chemicals, Inc. has made in active mitigation measures could effectively reduce the risk associated with an RMP worst-case related incident.

Mitigation measures to reduce this release are an excess flow valve on the line and a remote activated tank shut-off system.  Evaluation of the alternative release scenario per EPA assumptions shows off-site impacts.\n\nFLAMMABLE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nThe alternative release scenario submitted for Program 3 flammable substances involves the failure of a 4\" line from the isobutylene storage tank to the tank's pressure relief device system.  Mitigation measures to reduce this release is the remote activated tank shut-off system.  Evaluation of the alternative release scenario per EPA assumptions shows off-site impacts.\n\nALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS MITIGATION MEASURES\n\nWhile the Alternative Release Scenarios are, by definition, more likely to occur than the Worst-Case Scenario, they are still very unlikely to occur due to the facility's existing release and accident prevention program.  If a release should occur, ATOFINA Chemicals, Inc. has mitigation measures to reduce potential human health and environmental receptor impact.  The prevention program elements in place at Crosby are:\n\n-Remote shut-off valves on tank piping designed to shut down all flow from the storage tanks, thereby reducing the amount potentially released;\n\n-Excess flow valves on tank process feed lines from the storage tanks designed to close in the case of a line failure, thereby reducing the amount potentially released;\n\n-Stationary fire monitors that could remove airborne vapor with water sprays;\n\n-On-site emergency responders 24 hours per da"

      "SummaryText": "with the organic peroxide intermediate was delayed. During this delay period, the temperature of the organic peroxide intermediate mixture rose. Upon completion of maintenance activities, the production process was continued by combining the two intermediate mixtures. Due to the elevated temperature of the organic peroxide intermediate mixture, the resultant mixture underwent a rapid decomposition. From this decomposition, approximately 180 pounds of isobutylene was released. No off-site injuries or property damage resulted from this incident. No on-site injuries occurred. Property damage occurred on-site and was localized to the facility's production unit. \n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE STATEMENT\n\nThe ATOFINA Chemicals, Inc. Crosby facility maintains a written Emergency Response Plan. The plan includes procedures for notifying civil authorities and the public in the event of an incident; documentation of proper first aid and medical treatment necessary to treat accidental human exposures; procedures for the use of emergency response equipment and for its inspection and testing; descriptions of the training programs for all employees in the relevant emergency response procedures; and the review and update of our response plan to reflect changes at the facility and to ensure that employees are informed of these changes.  The facility also conducts emergency drills on a regular basis.\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES FOR HEALTH, ENVIRONMENT, AND SAFETY\n\nSafety has been a part of the culture at the Crosby facility for many years. An example of Crosby's dedication to safety is that in March of 2000, the facility acheived 17 years without a plant employee lost time incident. Chemical exposure risks to employees and the public have been minimized through ongoing internal risk reduction efforts as well as regulatory requirements. The Crosby facility continues to implement methods to reduce risk, as demonstrated by the installation of remote access controls for these tank systems.\n\n\nCERTIFICATION\n"
