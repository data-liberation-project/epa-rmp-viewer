Box 73   Benton, Mo. 63736\nContact: \tCurtis Sievers\nPhone: \t573-545-3939\n\n\n1. The Facility Policy\n\n\tMFA Incorporated and the employees of the MFA Agri Service near Benton are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the NBC Fire Protection District, and other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information\n\n\tThe primary activity at the facility is the receiving, storage and distribution of bulk dry fertilizer and anhydrous ammonia for direct application as a crop nutrient.\n\n\tThe maximum quantity stored would be 140,196 pounds in our 30,000 gallon storage tank. Product will be received by tanker trucks which typically hold 50,000 pounds.  The facility has twenty-two 1,000 gallon nurse tanks that when filled would hold approximately 95,370 pounds.  There is also one 1,450 gallon nurse tank that would hold approximately 6,288 pounds.  Therefore, the facility has a capacity of approximately 241,854 pounds.  \n\n\n3. The Accidental Release Prevention Program.\n\n\tThe facility has implemented the provisions of Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1, 1981, published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., the Missouri Anhydrous Ammonia regulations and\nThe standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \u00bfStorage and handling of\nAnhydrous Ammonia\u00bf. The facility will work to follow the newest code as time and budgets allow.\n\n\n\n4. The Five-Year Accident History\n\n   There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that: have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries,"

Planned changes to improve safety.\n\n\tSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions. There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time.\n\n\n\n\t5/10/06"
