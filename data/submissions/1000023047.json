      "SummaryText": "Prairie Horizon Agri-Energy, LLC (PHAE) is submitting this 5-Year RMP resubmission under the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68.  PHAE has been in operation since August 2006,there has not been a change in management since the start of operation.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Response Policies:\r\nPHAE has a commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated in the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel as well as considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility.\r\n\r\nPHAE's has implemented reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, plant personnel will respond to contain the release as necessary.  The facility has implemented an Industrial Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP), a Spill Controls and Countermeasures Plan (SPCC), and a Facility Response Plan (FRP) that outline procedures for spill response.  These plans also detail best management practices in place at the facility, i.e. good housekeeping, promt routine equipment maintenance, and inspections.\r\n\r\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances:\r\nPrairie Horizon Agri-Energy, LLC ethanol plant is located in Phillipsburg, Phillips County, Kansas.\r\n\r\nThe facility operates 24 hours per day, 7 days per week for the purpose of manufacturing fuel grade ethanol from corn.  The regulated substances under the RMP program are Anhydrous Ammonia and Denaturant (also known as natural gasoline).  \r\n\r\nPrevention Program:\r\nThe facility qualifies as a Program 3 for ammonia and denaturant due to the close proximity of public receptors, and therefore, Program Safety Management has been completed for this facility.\r\n\r\nAnhydrous ammonia is stored as a gas liquefied by pressure in a 18,000 gallon aboveground steel tank.  The worst case scenario used is a release of the entire contents of the storage vessel, 97,200 pounds, creating a toxic vapor"

RMP Comp was used to determine the worst case distance to endpoint, the model results are also provided as part of this documentation.  The ammonia tank sits on a concrete pad, passive mitigation was not included as part of this scenario.  The facility can elect to place a fence around the ammonia tank for security purposes; the typical chain link fence used to enclose the ammonia tank would not prevent migration of a release.  Public receptor information was obtained using LandView 6 and facility knowledge of the surrounding area.  No environmental receptors are affected by a worst case release of ammonia.\r\n\r\nThe flammable mixture stored onsite is natural gasoline, typically referred to as denaturant.  Natural gasoline is used onsite to denature ethanol prior to shipment off site.   Denaturant is stored in a 100,000 gallon steel tank in the facility tank farm.  The tank is located within a diked containment structure that contains an impermeable liner with gravel overlay.  A worst case MSDS was used to determine RMP applicability.  The breakdown of reportable constituents is included as part of the determination documentation.  The worst case scenario used is the release of the entire contents of the denaturant tank, 560,000 pounds, causing a vapor cloud explosion.  Of the entire tank contents, equaling 560,000 pounds of the flammable mixture, only 190,400 pounds is reportable under CAA Section 112 (r).   RMP Comp was used to determine the worst case distance to endpoint, the model results are provided as part of this documentation.   Public receptor information was obtained using LandView 6 and the facility's knowledge of the surrounding area.  No environmental receptors are affected by a worst case release of denaturant. \r\n\r\nThe alternate scenario used for anhydrous ammonia is a release of 10,000 pounds due to a rupture disk/"

      "SummaryText": "relief valve failure from the ammonia piping system.  This scenario is considered the most likely cause of an ammonia release onsite.  The alternate release duration assumed is 30 minutes with an atmospheric stability of D, and wind speed of 3.0 m/sec.  The facility control room is manned 24 hours/day and would be alerted of the relief valve failure at the ammonia tank within minutes.  The emergency shutdown system was considered in this scenario as active mitigation.  RMP Comp was used to determine the alternate distance to endpoint, the model results are provided as part of this documentation.  Public receptor information was obtained using LandView 6 and the facility's knowledge of the surrounding area.  No environmental receptors are affected by an alternate release of anhydrous ammonia.\r\n\r\nThe alternate scenario used for the flammable mixture is the release of 42,000 pounds of natural gasoline due to a tanker truck loadout spill, causing a vapor cloud fire.   The endpoint used was an over pressurization of 1 PSI, a worst case option.  Denaturant deliveries at the facility typically occur during normal business hours with a facility staff member overseeing loadout operations - therefore a release at the loadout area could be ceased within minutes by manual overrides.  The loadout area also has a catchment basin with underground piping to secondary containment of the tank farm.   For this scenario passive mitigation was not considered, as the mitigation strategy currently in place (tank farm berm) would not contain a vapor cloud fire.  The onsite water cannon was used as part of active mitigation for this scenario.  RMP Comp was used to determine the alternate distance to endpoint, the model results are provided as part of this documentation. Of the entire tanker contents, equaling 42,000 pounds of the flammable mixture, only 14,280 pounds was used in the RMP Comp model due to the breakdown of regulated constituents under CAA Section 112 (r).

No environmental receptors are affected by an alternate release of denaturant. \r\n\r\n\r\nFive Year Accident History:\r\nThere have been no accidents since the start-up of facility operations.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program:\r\nPHAE has several safety programs in place at the facility that incorporate emergency response, including a Health and Safety Plan.  As mentioned an Industrial SWPPP, SPCC, and FRP have been prepared and implemented in accordance with applicable regulatory standards.  The FRP contains a separate docuement that details emergency evacuation procedures, employees are trained on spill response and countermeasures on an annual basis as part of the storm water and spill response plan requirements.\r\n\r\nPHAE's corporate policy places the utmost importance on worker, public and environmental safety, which is reflected in facility plans and training activities.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\r\nA third-party conducts a safety audit at the PHAE facility on a bi-annual basis.  PHAE takes the third-party audit findings very seriously and attempts to implement all recommended changes on a timely basis.  At the time of this RMP resubmission, PHAE has no planned changes to improve safety."
