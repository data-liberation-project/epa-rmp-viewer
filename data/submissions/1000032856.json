The anhydrous ammonia system at Newington Energy provides storage, vaporization, transfer, and injection control facilities for the ammonia gas to support the selective catalytic reduction system (SCR), which is located in line with the heat recovery steam generators (HRSGs).  The SCR system has been designed and operates in compliance with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention rule and applicable State and local codes and regulations.  Newington Energy has qualified engineering, operations, and maintenance personnel knowledgeable in the safe operation of compressed ammonia systems with direct responsibility for the process.  The process is also designed and operated in compliance with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's Process Safety Management (OSHA-PSM) rule.\n\n\n\nThrough its Risk Management Plan (RMP), Process Safety Management (PSM) Manual, and Emergency Response Action Plan (found in the facility's Integrated Contingency Plan), Newington Energy has emergency response procedures in place that comply with the Accidental Release Prevention Program (ARPP).\n\n\n\nA DESCRIPTION OF YOUR FACILITY AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\n\n\nThe Newington Energy facility is a 525 MW natural gas-and oil-fired combined cycle power plant located at 200 Shattuck Way in Newington, NH.  The facility lies approximately 1,000 feet from the Piscataqua River within a mixed industrial/commercial area.  The anhydrous ammonia system provides storage, vaporization, transfer, and injection control facilities for the ammonia gas to support the SCR / HRSG systems at the facility.  The application of Selective Catalytic NOx Reduction Technology (the process) reduces nitrogen oxide (NOx) air emissions "

      "SummaryText": "from the station.  There are two SCR / HRSG systems in the plant, designated as Train 1 and Train 2.  Each SCR / HRSG has its own dedicated anhydrous ammonia storage and supply system.  \n\n\n\nEach of the two ammonia storage and supply systems include a 2,000-gallon horizontal, cylindrical, pressure vessel for storing liquefied anhydrous ammonia.  The vessel is mechanically rated for 265 psig at 170F.  The level in the vessel is administratively controlled to a maximum of 82% capacity, equivalent to 1,715 gallons.  The maximum intended site inventory of ammonia is therefore 3,430 gallons (17,700 pounds) onsite.\n\n\n\nThe ARPP applicability threshold for anhydrous ammonia is 10,000 pounds.  As Newington Energy's anhydrous ammonia storage capacity exceeds this threshold, the facility is subject to the program and is required to prepare and maintain a RMP for this process.  The anhydrous ammonia system at Newington Energy is the only process that stores a substance in greater quantities than the ARPP applicability threshold.\n\n\n\nThis process is subject to Risk Management Program Level 3 because it is subject to OSHA-PSM provisions and it is not eligible for Program Level 1.\n\n\n\nTHE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nThe SCR and HRSG systems were designed and constructed in general accordance with applicable local building and fire codes, as well as industry-consensus codes and standards where appropriate.  Process verification takes place through design audits conducted by trained personnel and/or qualified consultants.  The schedule of such verifications is at least once every three years.\n\n\n\nPreventative maintenance (PM) is an active part of Newington Energy's daily operations.  PM is performed on a schedule in accordance with OSHA-PSM and, in many cases, the process safety equipment PM schedule prescribed by Newington Energy exceeds recommended equipment maintenance schedules.

Maintenance activities are completed on the SCR ammonia system components as specified in documents provided by the manufacturer.\n\n\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nWithin the last five years, Newington Energy has not experienced an accident involving the anhydrous ammonia system that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place.\n\n\n\nTHE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nAmmonia has a strong, pungent odor that makes even the smallest of leaks easily detectable by smell.  A medium to large leak of ammonia could be detectable from a safe distance through a visual white cloud escaping from the source leak.  Ammonia handheld direct reading instruments, fixed area monitors, and ammonia test paper are maintained at the facility to aid in the detection of an ammonia release.  The Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC, or Newington Fire Department) is trained and equipped to respond to ammonia releases at Newington Energy.  \n\n\n\nNewington Energy has developed an emergency response program contained within its Integrated Contingency Plan (ICP) to minimize the health, safety and environmental impacts from a release of hazardous materials, and to restore the facility to normal operating conditions as quickly as possible.  \n\n\n\nIn addition, to the general emergency response program, a unique emergency response procedure has been developed for response to releases from the SCR system as outlined below.\n\n\n\n o After all personnel move to a location lateral or upwind from the release area, they shall call the CONTROL ROOM and inform the CONTROL ROOM of the location (inside or outside) of the release and wind direction or direction in which the vapors appear to be moving (if known).\n\n\n\n o The CONTROL ROOM shall dispatch the First Responders to the scene.  \n\n\n\n o If it is safe to do so, First Responders shall coordinate with"
