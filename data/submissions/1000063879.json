Refrigeration (anhydrous ammonia)\n\nAmmonia is used for refrigeration purposes. The facility operates a three-temperature, single- stage, anhydrous ammonia (R-717) refrigeration system in the processing area and a four- temperature, single-stage system in the remote recirculation room. The majority of the refrigeration components are located in the processing mechanical rooms with the exception of condensers   located   on   the   roof    and    piping    located    throughout    the    facility. The entire refrigeration system is a closed loop, liquid re-circulation system with a total system storage capacity of 19,500 pounds.\n\n\n\n* General Accident Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nPerdue maintains a Process Safety Management (PSM) of Highly Hazardous Chemicals plan prepared in accordance with OSHA regulation 29 CFR 1910.119.
