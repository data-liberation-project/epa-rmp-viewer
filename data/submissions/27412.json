      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nInland Production Company produces oil and gas from the Greater Monument Butte Field located in the Uinta Basin in Uintah and Duchesne Counties in north eastern Utah.  Approximately 11 million standard cubic feet/day (MMSCF/D) of natural gas produced by Inlands 461 existing oil wells is rich in hydrocarbon liquids to the extent that it exceeds specifications for gas pipeline transportation and sales.  The Monument Butte Liquids Conditioning Gas Plant was recently constructed to remove sufficient hydrocarbon liquids to reduce the heat content of the gas to within pipeline specifications.  The gas plant was designed to remove approximately 15,717 gallons per day from a 13 MMSCFD gas stream.   Liquid hydrocarbons are removed from the gas and are stored in two 30,000 gallon propane storage tanks.  The liquid hydrocarbons are then transported via high pressure tanker truck to a fractionation facility for further processing.\n\nThe Monument Butte Liquids Conditioning Gas Plant is located over six miles south of the city of Myton, Utah.  The gas plant is located NW1/4, SW 1/4, Section 25 T8S, R16E in Duchesne County Utah in a remote area surrounded by oil field wells sites.  There are no public receptors in the area.  The Inland field office is located approximately three and a half miles northwest of the gas plant in Section 10 T4S, R1W.  The gas plant is normally unmanned, however the facility is inspected daily by Inland personnel and tanker truck personnel.  The emergency shut off for the gas plant is located at the Monument Butte Compressor Station located approximately half a mile south.\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at your facility.   \nThis facility complies with NFPA-58 requirements for LP-Gas storage, and it is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to isolate, shutdown gas plant operations from the emergency shutoff, and stay awa"

Once the site is determined to be safe, equipment will be repaired.  The Myton Volunteer Fire Department will not respond to any emergency at the gas plant unless requested to do so by an Inland supervisor.  If Myton Volunteer Fire Department support is requested, Inland personnel will supervise and coordinate all activities. People will be kept away from the gas plant until the site is determined to be safe by Inland personnel. \n(24 Hour)Emergency numbers to call, in order are:  Reed Abeggien at (435)823-5562, Mike Guinn at (435)823-2073, and Brad Mecham at (435)823-4008.\n\nA description of your facility and the regulated substances handled.\nThe Monument Butte Liquids Conditioning Gas Plant removes liquid hydrocarbons from a gas stream.  The LPG is collected and stored in two 30,000 gallon propane tanks.  One to two tanker trucks loads per day are removed to ensure that the tanks are filled to less than 88% of their total capacities.  The plant is designed to remove 15,717 gallons per day.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario.  \nThe worst-case scenario is failure of both 30,000 gallon storage tanks when filled to the greatest amount allowed (88% at 60 F), resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  Since this facility is located in a remote, unoccupied area, the worst-case scenario would not affect anyone beyond our property.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps.  \nThis facility complies with EPAs accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.  The propane system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with NFPA-58 and state law.  The site has been graded to prevent potential leaks from the propane tanks from accumulating under the tanks creating a vapor cloud explosion that consumes both tanks.  If leaks do occur, the liquid hydrocarbons would flow away from t"

We have never had an accident involving propane that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, or evacuations.\n\nThe emergency response program.  \nIn the event of an emergency involving our propane system, it is our policy to shutoff and isolate the gas plant.
