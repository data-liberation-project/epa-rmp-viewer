At the time a single polypropylene (plastics) manufacturing unit was built and was owned & operated by Hercules Incorporated.  In 1983 hercules merged its plastics business with Montedison of Milan, Italy to form Himont.  In 1995 Montell was formed by a merger between Himont and Royal Dutch/Shell Group of Companies.

Olefins are hydrocarbons produced by the oil refining industry, such as propylene, butene, propane, and ethylene.

These hydrocarbons (olefins) are present at our site in excess of 10,000 pounds each at any one time.
