This commitment is demonstrated by the investment of significant resources in accident prevention, such as personnel training, mechanical inspection, process control systems and by recognition of safety as a primary factor in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our processes. However, if an accidental release does occur, trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release if safe to do so.\n\n\n\nThe Hawkeye Gas Facility controls its hazardous materials by: \n\n?    A commitment to OSHA's PSM and HAZWOPER standards, EPA's RMP, and the Department of Transportation's Hazardous Materials Transportation Act regulations which promote and require adherence to process safety activities designed to prevent accidental releases.\n\n\n\n?    Use of the parent company Hess Corporation and the Hawkeye Gas Facility safety, operating, maintenance, emergency response, engineering design and construction policies, procedures and practices designed to prevent accidents and potential releases. \n\n\n\n?    A knowledge of and adherence to applicable industry recognized standards, specifications and recommended practices that address and provide guidance for the proper design, construction, operation and maintenance of facilities containing hazardous materials. \n\n\n\n?    A comprehensive equipment inspection and testing program.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nProcesses at the Hawkeye Gas Facility that are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.

      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\n\n\nCertification Letter\n\n\n\nThe Hawkeye Gas Facility (HGF) is a new facility replacing an older compressor station.  The facility compresses produced gas and removes water vapor, collects NGL (Natural Gas Liquids) and sends the NGL and compressed gas to the Tioga Gas Facility via pipeline.  The Hawkeye Gas Facility processes flammable gas and liquids which contain the toxic compound hydrogen sulfide (H2S) at less than the threshold quantity.\n\n\n\nA study was performed using the BakerRisk's  SafeSite 3G computer code  and the Baker-Strehlow-Tang methodology to determine the 1-psi overpressure impact of a vapor cloud explosion.  The worst-case scenario was determined to be the filling of the compressor building with flammable gas release from the flash gas compressor. The flash gas compressor inventory of 10,821 lbs. is greater than the required stoichiometric volume of 7,460 lbs.  to fill the compressor building with a stoichiometric fuel-air cloud. A resulting vapor cloud explosion (VCE) would produce a 1-psi overpressure at 0.13 miles which could impact a public receptor. This worst-case overpressure case with a potential impact to a public receptor, results in the Hawkeye Gas Facility being subject to EPA RMP Program level 3.  The facility is also subject to OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119 Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals. \n\n\n\nThis is a new facility and therefore there have been no accidental releases during the last five years with an offsite consequence as defined by the Risk Management Program rule 40 CFR 68.10(b)(1).  This facility complies with applicable environmental requirements administered by EPA and it is the company policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state and local laws.  No additional measures are necessary to prevent offsite impacts of accidental releases.  \n\n\n\nIn the event of fire, explosion, or a release of a regulated substance from the process, our facility has Emergency Response Plan in place and our facility"

This new facility is replacing an older compressor station and has several regulated flammables, such as Methane, Ethane, Propane, Butane, Isobutane, Pentane and Natural Gas Condensate which are greater than the RMP threshold quantities.   In addition, the facility contains a by-product of Hydrogen Sulfide (H2S) which is below the RMP threshold quantity. \n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nProcesses at the Hawkeye Gas Facility that are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard. The Hawkeye Gas Facility adheres to all applicable federal and state regulatory statutes.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThis is a new facility and therefore has had no accidental release that caused off-site impacts as defined by the EPA Risk Management Program rule 40 CFR 68.10(b)(1). This facility or the older Hawkeye compressor station it is replacing, within the past 5 years the Facility has not experienced an incident involving regulated flammables that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damages, evacuations or sheltering in-place. \n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\n\n\n\nThe Hawkeye Gas Facility maintains a written emergency response program, which is designed to protect worker and public saf"

The program consists of procedures for responding to the release of regulated substances, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is involved. The procedure addresses emergency response, proper first aid and medical treatment, evacuation plans, accounting for personnel, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public. In addition, the plant has procedures that address maintenance, inspection and testing and instructions in the use of emergency response equipment. Employees received training in these procedures will perform their specific emergency response duties as required. The emergency response program will be reviewed periodically and updated when necessary based on any modifications made to the Hawkeye Gas Facility.\n\n\n\nWORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\n\n\nThe Hawkeye Gas Facility identified potential candidates for worst-case scenarios and utilized the services of the Baker Engineering and Risk Consultants, Inc. of San Antonio, Texas to perform consequence analyses using BakerRisk's  SafeSite 3G computer code  and the Baker-Strehlow-Tang (BST) methodology for determining the RMP designated 1-psi overpressure contour. According to the analyses, the maximum end-point distance for a 1-psi vapor cloud explosion (VCE) is 0.13 miles from the center of the explosion, resulting from the instantaneous release of 10,821 lbs. (the flash gas compressor volume) which is greater than the required stoichiometric volume of 7,460 lbs. to produce a stoichiometric fuel-air cloud and subsequent vapor cloud explosion (VCE) inside the compressor building.  This worst-case release would affect a public receptor.  \n\n \n\nALTERNATE WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\n\n\nAn alternate worst-case release scenario was identified for the Hawkeye Gas Facility which is a liquid release from the NGL Bullet Tank (D-751003) containing 26,103 lbs. of flammable hydrocarbon liquids.

The maximum distance to the predicted 1-psi overpressure contour is 0.07 miles, this contour extends beyond the property owned and occupied by the Hawkeye Gas Facility but would not impact an identified public receptor.  \n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nThe Hawkeye Gas Facility conducts ongoing efforts to reduce risk through the Risk Management Program and Process Safety Management. These include recommendations from process hazards analyses, employee suggestions, incident investigations, compliance audits and the preventative maintenance and mechanical integrity program.    \n\n\n\n"
