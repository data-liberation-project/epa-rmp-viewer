We shall, as a minimum: (1) consult with employees and their representatives on the conduct and development of the process hazard review and other elements of the risk management plan, and (2) provide to our employees and their representatives access to the process hazard review and all other information required to be developed under that standard.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe City of Denison believes that preventative maintenance is the key to minimizing the potential for accidental releases.  Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) have been reviewed and revised to enable the employees to perform their work in a safe and efficient manner.\n\nThe City of Denison has taken steps to educate and inform the operators, supervisors, and maintenance crews in the appropriate response to an accidental release.  The training includes classroom training and operating procedures on the proper response to emergency situations. \n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Water Treatment Plant utilizes chlorine and ammonia for disinfection of the treated water.  The maximum inventory and threshold quantity for chlorine is shown below.  (The maximum amount of ammonia on site is below the threshold level and thus is not covered in this plan.)  The chlorine is stored outside.\n\nChemical                                       Maximum Inventory (lb)               "

A dense-gas dispersion model (SLAB) was used to determine endpoint distances for both scenarios.  A dense-gas model is required since chlorine is heavier than air.
