If an accidental release should happen, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department and other govermental agencies, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to public and enviroment.\n\nThe primary activity is the storage for the sale to farmers. Anhydrous ammonia is recieved, stored, and distributed for direct application for the crop production nutrients.\n\nThe off-site consequence analysis includes two anhydrous ammonia release scenarios, that are identified as \"worst case\" release and \"alternative\" release scenario. The first scenario is defined by EPA and shall assume the maximum quantity of the vessel is released as a gas in 10 minutes due to a catastrophic break.\nThe alternitive release scenario is defined as a more likely accidental release of anhydrous ammonia caused by a transfer hose failing. In either case the first thing that we would do is immedately activate our emergency action plan and call 911 and protect our employees from any danger and work very close with the responding agencies to provide all the information that would be required to abate this accident.\n\nThere have been no releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years. Even though the company has not had any releases, we still train our employees what to do incase there is a leak.\n\nThis facility has a written emergency action plan, in accordence with OSHA 29 CFR 1910.38. We also provide state and local authorities the emergency and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA)\n\nAnnual training is required of all personnel on the proper handling, transfering, or transporting of anhydrous ammonia as"

The training includes properties of ammonia, safe handling, first-aid, emergency response, and the use and how to take care of the PPE. We also have periodic site inspections by our safety committee as well as our insurance risk loss department.\n\nWe also have annual inspections by the State Fire Marshal, which include safety equipment, tanks and handling equipment.\n\nAt High Plains Coop safety is a top priority and an on-going process at our facility. We perform periodic evaluations to assess that we have a safe work enviroment for all our employees. At this time there are no additional recommendations for anhydrous ammonia to be implemented."
