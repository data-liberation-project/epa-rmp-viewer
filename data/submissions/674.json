The Facility Policy\n\n           The owners, management, and employees of THE PIQUA FARMERS COOPERATIVE ASSN. are\ncommitted to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release\nshould occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire company, or other authorities, to mitigate\nany release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n  2.  Facility Information\n\n         -The primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.\n\n         -Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for both direct application and for the\nblending into mixed-grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients.\n\n         -The maximum quantity stored would be 132,000 pounds in our 30,000 gallon storage tank.\n\n  3.  The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario.\n\n        a. The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank\nreleased as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released woul be 132,000 pounds, which\nrepresents the volume of the storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.\nThe distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 2.5 miles.\n\n       b. The alternative release scenario based on the five-year accident history (or the most likely potential\nincident) is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion\nto 200 ppm) is .83 miles.\n\n  4.  The accidental release prevention program.\n\n          The facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling\nof Anhydrous Amonia, K-61.1\", published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the\nstandards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health A"

There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\n         -have caused any deaths, injuries,or significant property damage at the facility; nor\n\n         -to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacutions, sheltering in place,\n          property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n  6.  The emergency response program.\n\n        -The facility has:\n\n        a. a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38\n\n        b. provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know\n            information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\n        c. a written emergency response program, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.120,\n            including pre-emergency planning and employee training.\n\n  7.  Planned changes to improve safety.\n\n         Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia\nsafety recommendations for implementation at this time."
