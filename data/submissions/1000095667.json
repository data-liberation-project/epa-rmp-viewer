If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, the Pettis County LEPC and /or other authorities to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the public and the environment.\n\n\n\n2.  Facility Information.  The primary activity at the facility is the storage of fertilizer for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is the chemical covered by the risk management program.  It is received, stored and distributed to the farmers, who are the end users. \n\n3.  Accidental release prevention program.  The facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration.\n\n\n\n4.  Five Year accident history.  There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries or significant property damage at the facility, nor to our knowledge, have resulted in any off site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\n\n\n5.  Emergency Response Program.  We do not plan to have our employees respond to the release of anhydrous ammonia.  We have an emergency plan and in case of a release we will notify the LEPC and the local fire department.\n\n\n\n6.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety.  Safety improvement is an on- going process at the facility.  We conduct monthly safety meetings and safety equipment checks.  There are no additional specific anhydrous safety recommendations at this time.\n\n"
