Promoting the health and safety of co-workers, contractors, customers, and communities is the responsibility of all WTG employees.  WTG will comply with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations.\n\n \n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled:\n\nSonora Gas Plant (Sonora), located near Midkiff, Upton County, Texas, is a natural gas liquids processing plant that produces pipeline specification residue gas and natural gas liquids from field gas collected throughout the gathering system.  Sonora handles flammable gas and liquid mixtures in an amount greater than the threshold quantity containing one of more of the following RMP-regulated constituents:\n\n?    Methane\n\n?    Ethane\n\n?    Propane\n\n?    Isobutane\n\n?    Butane\n\n?    Isopentane\n\n?    Pentane\n\n \n\nThe only RMP-regulated toxic constituent present at Sonora, which is part of the amine treating process, is hydrogen sulfide; however, quantities at Sonora are well below the threshold quantity. \n\n \n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\n\nWTG is committed to ensuring a safe work environment for all its employees, contractors, and vendors.  The Sonora Gas Plant has a detailed Emergency Action Plan in which it has coordinated with the community's local responders in an effort to introduce them to the facility and its personnel.\n\n \n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program:\n\nThe Sonora process is covered by OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119, Process Safety Management of highly hazardous chemicals (PSM) regulation.  WTG considers the systems developed for compliance with PSM to be the basis for good safety and business practices.  In this effort, WTG identifies opportunities to continuously improve initiatives for each PSM element.  The PSM"

Thus, the current PSM improvement initiative is heavily focused on this key element as employees are becoming more actively involved in the implementation of each element of PSM.\n\n \n\nProcess Safety Information:\n\nComprehensive reviews of the available process safety information (PSI) have been conducted.  Updates to the maximum intended inventory (MII) and development of new piping and instrumentation diagrams (P&IDs) have been completed.  Area classification drawings are under development along with material balances for completion estimated in late 2019.  A comprehensive electronic web-based system utilized for timely access to information has been built, implemented, and made available to all personnel involved with process operations.  \n\n \n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA):\n\nA new PHA procedure has been established for WTG.  A new comprehensive PHA team including a highly experienced third-party PHA facilitator, experienced WTG operating personnel (operations and maintenance), WTG engineers, Process Control personnel, safety representatives, and PSM representatives were utilized to conduct a PHA redo from October 8 through November 1, 2018.  Results and recommendations from these analyses have been shared with employees.  Additionally, a process safety tracking tool has been developed and implemented for the interactive tracking of PHA action items to closure.\n\n \n\nOperating Procedures:\n\nA gap analysis and completion of all discovered gaps in Sonora operating procedures is in process.  Operating procedures will be updated to reflect current operations and identified gaps in operating procedures (such as various modes of process operations) will be dev"

After the operating procedures are completed, they will be published to the company's electronic web-based system and used in the operations training program.  \n\n \n\nManagement of Change (MOC) and Pre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR):\n\nImprovements to the MOC procedure and associated checklists are in progress to capture all process related changes.  Requirements for the identification, evaluation, control, and authorization of modifications to plant design and operations prior to the implementation to ensure that the risk of new or existing hazards are properly managed is available to all personnel.  Extensive PSSR checklists for applicable disciplines (electrical, instrumentation, procedures, etc.) have been developed and implemented.  These checklists are Appendices to the Company's MOC procedure and are available online from the company's electronic web-based process library. \n\n \n\nMechanical Integrity (MI):\n\nA third-party contractor has developed global WTG MI procedures.  In addition to the ultrasonic thickness testing program already in practice at Sonora, a complete third-party MI gap assessment was recently completed.  The identified MI gaps have been addressed and are being used to develop comprehensive inspection standards and procedures along with a specialized inspection program structured specifically for Sonora.  The Sonora MI program has been designed and implemented as of July 2019.\n\n \n\nIncident Investigation:\n\nWTG investigates all PSM incidents.  Throughout the PSM program assessment process, incident investigation procedures are being reviewed and will be updated as necessary.  A mix of WTG personnel will be provided investigation methodology training to further enhance the program and ensure root cause is consistently identified.  A process safety tracking tool has been developed and implemented to track action items and incident investigation corrective actions to closure.

There have been no other accidental releases of regulated substances meeting the accident reporting criteria of 40 CFR 68.42(a) during the prior five years.\n\n \n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nWTG Sonora will continue to improve its safety and environmental performance through emphasis on the continued development of its PSM Program.  Improvement plans include continued process engineering support to update critical PSI data for the site; updating operating procedures written for each mode of operation and to include consequences of deviations; an operator certification training program established from the new operating procedures, new process hazard analysis (PHA) procedure and team structure ensuring employee involvement, new MI program incorporating the implementation of all new inspection procedures and frequencies all to be carefully reviewed, and recommendations for improvement generated using WTG's new compliance audit process.\n\n"

In WTG's general PSM improvement program initiatives, an updated audit protocol has been established and implemented within WTG.  A new team including experienced PSM representatives, WTG engineering, operating personnel (operations and maintenance), and safety representatives will be utilized to conduct a new PSM Compliance Audit later this year.  The last audit conducted at Sonora was on December 31, 2018.  Results and action items from the new audit will be shared with employees.
