To ensure proper functioning, Douglas Products, in coordination with Corteva, ensures emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced; Douglas Products is responsible for equipment located within its block limits, and Corteva is responsible for all other response equipment. In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place that would require a modified emergency response. \n\nCorteva provides emergency response on behalf of Douglas Products. CA Region II LEPC is the local emergency planning committee (LEPC) with which the emergency plan for the Douglas Products site has been coordinated and verified. Corteva coordinates plans and actions with local agencies and industrial mutual aid groups on behalf of Douglas Products to enable additional emergency response capability.\n \nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety \n\nImproving safety is a continuous process at Douglas Products. PHAs, compliance audits, process safety information reviews, facility self-assessments and management system reviews, incident investigations, emergency response drills, and employee participation are the primary means for identifying opportunities to improve safety. Planning structural seismic upgrades, planning materials of construction upgrades, installing additional process instrumentation and/or process controls, and conducting hazard awareness training are typical of the planned changes to improve safety at the facility."

Company employees are strongly encouraged to (1) express their views concerning accident prevention issues and (2) recommend improvements. The site has safety programs, which involve employees as leaders in facilitating team efforts. In addition, Douglas Products employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from PHAs in particular. Safe job performance is required for each of the jobs at the site. \n\nContractors \n\nDouglas Products hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance, construction, and various other activities. Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out. Douglas Products has a policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related to the contractor's work and the process. Contractors are also required to inform Douglas Products of any hazards they may introduce at the site. Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur. \n\nFive-year Accident History \n\nDouglas Products has an excellent record of preventing accidental releases due to the site's release prevention policies. There have been no accidents from Douglas Products with offsite or onsite impacts (deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place) that meet RMP and CalARP reporting criteria. \n\nEmergency Response Plan \n\nDouglas Products uses a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials. The plan includes all aspects of emergency response, including adequate first aid and medical treatment, sheltering in place, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-inc"

Process equipment includes pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, critical instruments, and pumps. Qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices carry out appropriate maintenance. These personnel are also offered specialized training as needed. Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner. \n\nManagement of Change \n\nWritten procedures are in place at Douglas Products to safely manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures. Process operators, maintenance personnel, or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification. \n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews \n\nPre-startup safety reviews related to new processes and modifications in the established process are conducted by appropriate personnel as a regular practice at Douglas Products. These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating, and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation. \n\nCompliance Audits \n\nDouglas Products conducts audits of compliance systems for RMP requirements on a regular basis. These audits are carried out at least once every 3 years by a team of qualified personnel. Any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are tracked to ensure resolution in a timely and appropriate manner. \n\nIncident Investigations\n\nDouglas Products promptly and carefully investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in, a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.

Examples include safety data sheets, piping and instrumentation diagrams, equipment specification sheets, reactive chemicals testing reports, and corrosion reports. This information is regularly reviewed, as needed, and is readily accessible to plant operations personnel. \n\nProcess Hazard Analysis \n\nDouglas Products conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with the covered process are identified and effectively controlled. The methodology used to carry out these analyses includes a process hazard analysis (PHA) using the hazard and operability (HAZOP) method in combination with checklists. PHAs use an appropriate team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering, maintenance and process operations and are revalidated on a regular basis. Any findings related to the PHA, where a response is required, are tracked to ensure resolution in a timely and appropriate manner. \n\nOperating Procedures \n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within Douglas Products' covered process, written operating procedures are maintained. These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and startup after a turnaround. This information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to plant operations personnel. \n\nTraining \n\nDouglas Products has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure employees who are operating the process are competent in the operating procedures and safe work practices associated with these processes.

It is Douglas Products' policy and commitment to (1) implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances \u00a0\u00a0and (2) respond to emergencies resulting from accidental releases to mitigate the release and any associated consequences. \n\nThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled \n\nDouglas Products will take over operation of the sulfuryl fluoride (SF) plant in Pittsburg, California, from Corteva Agriscience (Corteva). At that point, the Douglas Products SF plant will become its own stationary source, separate from the Corteva stationary source. The primary activity at Douglas Products is agricultural chemical manufacturing. There are four regulated substances present at the stationary source:  two (hydrogen fluoride [anhydrous] and sulfur dioxide [anhydrous]) exceed both EPA\u0092s RMP rule 40 CFR Part 67 and California\u0092s CalARP\u0092s program 19 CCR, Division 2, Chapter 4.5 threshold quantities (TQs).  The other two regulated substances (hydrogen chloride [anhydrous] and chlorine) only exceed the CalARP TQ. Chlorine, hydrogen fluoride, and sulfur dioxide are used in the manufacture of SF, with hydrogen chloride (anhydrous) produced as a by-product. \n\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program \n\nDouglas Products has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under the RMP rule and CalARP\u0092s regulation.
