      "SummaryText": "The Minute Maid Company - Dunedin Plant\nDunedin, Florida Production Facility\nRisk Management Plan for Ammonia\n\nExecutive Summary\n\n1.  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n     The Minute Maid Company is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety. This commitment is inherent to our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with our regulated processes.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible accidental releases of regulated substances.   However, if such an accidental release does occur, we are coordinated with the Dunedin Fire Department and Pinellas County Emergency Management for emergency response support.\n\n2.  The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\n     This facility is used for the production of juice and fruit drink products.   Ammonia is the only RMP regulated substance present at this facility in a threshold quantity.  It is utilized as the primary cooling media in our closed-loop refrigeration system.  The system's purpose is to provide cold storage capabilities for certain products.  The amount of ammonia currently present in the refrigeration system totals approximately 30,000 pounds.  Due to the size and characteristics of our ammonia refrigeration system, as well as Process Safety Management (PSM) applicability, this facility is covered under Program 3 of the RMP regulations.\n\n3.  The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\n\n     To evaluate both the worst case and alternative release scenarios, the computer dispersion model DEGADIS was utilized exclusively.  While the DEGADIS model is not specifically referenced in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance, the ALOHA-DEGADIS model is list"

      "SummaryText": "ed as an acceptable model for this purpose.  ALOHA is a simplified version of the DEGADIS model.  Since the mathematical approximation processes used in ALOHA are less accurate than those used in DEGADIS, The Minute Maid Company decided to use the DEGADIS model rather than the ALOHA simplification.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\n     The worst case scenario would involve the catastrophic failure of the low-pressure receiver, which has the capacity to hold the entire contents of the refrigeration system during a maintenance condition.  As specified in the RMP Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration, the worst case scenario assumes that the entire contents of the vessel (30,000 pounds) is released over a period of 10 minutes, yielding a release rate of 3,000 pounds per minute. Under worst case weather conditions (Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed) as required by the RMP rule, DEGADIS yielded a distance of  1.34 miles to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L (200 ppm) (\"zone of influence\").  The estimated residential population for the zone of influence is approximately 13,900 based on 1990 census data calculated by LANDVIEW III software.  Other public receptors identified within the zone of influence include schools, hospitals, at least one recreation area and commercial/industrial areas.  No environmental receptors are known to be located within the zone of influence.\n\n     Several alternative release scenarios were evaluated; however, most of these scenarios, when modeled, did not reach a toxic endpoint offsite.  For the purpose of this RMP submission, the following alternative release scenario was chosen, primarily because it is one of the few that would reach an endpoint offsite as required by the RMP rule.  The scenario chosen involves the slow leak of ammonia from a source equivalent to a 0.125 inch hole in the high pressure part of the ammonia system.  This scenario could be representative of multiple situations such "

Due to the presence of isolation valves, the release would be stopped within a 5 - 10 minute timeframe.  Approximately 228 pounds of ammonia could be released over 10 minutes.  Under average weather conditions for this area, DEGADIS yielded a distance to toxic endpoint of 0.112 miles.  The area within the zone of influence exhibits open topography, with industrial buildings being the only offsite receptors identified.  Landview III software estimates that approximately 144 persons reside within the alternative release scenario's zone of influence.  However, the facility has specifically confirmed that there are no residences within 0.112 miles of the potential release source.\n\n4.  The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe facility has taken all necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set forth in 40 CFR part 68.  Our facility is also subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119, as well as the EPCRA Section 302 and 311/312 notification/reporting requirements.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the accidental release prevention program that is in place at our facility.\n\n                            Process Safety Information\n\nThe Minute Maid Company maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associated with the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\n                             Process Hazard Analysis\n\nAs part of the ammonia refrigeration system installation process, and as required under PSM, the facility conducted a comprehensive study to ensure that hazards associated with its ammonia refrigeration system are identified and controlled efficiently.   These studies, using \"What If\" scenarios, will be repeated every 5 years by a team of qualified personn"

The Minute Maid Company has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related to the contractor's work with the ammonia refrigeration system. Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of ammonia occur.\n\n5.  Five-year Accident History\n\n     The ammonia refrigeration system at this facility has been operational for over 20 years and, to date, the facility has not experienced a release that would be reportable under the RMP requirements.  However, in June 1998, the facility did have an accidental release of less than 600 pounds of ammonia.  This incident occurred as a result of a release through a pressure relief valve and lasted for less than 10 minutes before facility personnel successfully stopped the release.  The local Hazmat department was immediately dispatched to the site, but no medical attention or evacuation was required for any residents in the area of the facility, and no facility employees experienced any physical affects from the release.  In response to the incident to prevent a reoccurence, the facility modified its operating procedures for the ammonia system. \n\n6.  Emergency Response Plan\n\n     The Minute Maid Company Emergency Response Policy focuses on evacuation of the facility in the event of an ammonia emergency, with local emergency response agencies performing all rescue, firefighting, first-aid, medical treatment, and other response functions.  The facility maintains a written Emergency Response Plan to document specific procedures to be implemented in the event of various emergencies, including an ammonia release. The Emergency Response Plan includes procedures for facility evacuation, as well as for notification of the local emergency response agencies which are responsible for notifying the public."
