The JCI Facility and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe primary function of this facility is to protect public health by supplying chemicals including chlorine and sodium hypoclorite to disinfect bulk water systems.   The primary operations conducted at this facility include the distribution is inorganic chemicals and repackaging of inorganic gases.  Chemicals are brought on site in bulk quantities (railcars, tank trucks, etc.), repackaged int"

The regulated substances handled by this facility are chlorine and sulfur dioxide.\n\n3. The Worse-Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario\n\nThe WCS for toxic substances at this facility is the instantaneous release of the entire contents of a single 90-ton chlorine railcar.  This is the scenario that is estimated to create the greatest distance in any direction to a chlorine toxic endpoint of 0.0087 milligrams per liter (mg/l).  Chlorine is a dense toxic gas stored as a liquid under pressure at atmospheric temperature.  Fir the WCS release analysis, the following assumptions were made: a ground-level release of 180,000 pounds of liquid chlorine over 10 minutes; generally flat, unobstructed (rural) terrain surrounding the facility; and atmospheric conditions of 1.5 meter per second (mps) wind speed, F stability class, and 77?F ambient temperature.  Although there are numerous installed control measures that, in actual event, would mitigate the release, no credit for mitigation measures was taken into account for this scenario as required by the RMP regulations.  Dispersion modeling of the WCS was conducted using RMP*Comp version 1.03.  RMP*Comp was developed for use in performing the OCA required under EPA\u00bfs Risk Management Planning rule.  \n\nTo assist in emergency response planning, this facility has developed ACSs as required by the RMP regulations.  ACSs and hazard assessment results are useful for assessing the potential hazards posed by the facility and developing or assessing emergency response plans to respond to such an event.  These scenarios are unlikely, but are physically possible.  For the ACS analyses, the following assumptions were made: rural terrain surrounding the facility and atmospheric conditions of 3.0 mps wind speed, D stability class, and 77?F ambient temperatures."

      "SummaryText": "As allowed by the RMP regulations, active mitigation measures were considered and are described under each scenario.  This facility conducted dispersion modeling of the ACSs using RMP*Comp.  \n\nThe first ACS associated with the release of toxic substances at this facility is a crack in a whip (transfer) line at the 1-ton chlorine cylinder filling station.  This facility believes that this scenario, although unlikely, could occur based on its knowledge of similar accidents that have occurred at the other chlorine facilities.  A whip line crack would not result in a significant release of chlorine from a tank or vessel, because chlorine detectors continually monitor the area and the railcar unloading station is equipped with automatic shutdown valves.  However, a whip line crack could result in a 5-second jet release of liquid chlorine from a process line or a gas cylinder from a height of 1 meter.  Five seconds was the estimated maximum time required for an operator or emergency responder to respond to an alarm from area detectors and close the valve on the whip line.  The estimated size of the crack in the line is equivalent to a 1/8-inch diameter hole.  The amount of chlorine released from an open, 6-foot long, 1/8-inch diameter opening in the line at 165 pounds per square inch gauge (pig), would be 7.5 pounds, including the volume of chlorine in the line, at a rate of 89.9 pounds per minute.  \n\nThe second ACS associated with the release of toxic substances at this facility is a sulfur dioxide leak from the fuse plug of a 150-pound container.  JCI representatives believe that his scenario, although unlikely, could occur based on its knowledge of similar accidents that have occurred at other facilities.  A leak from a fuse plug would not result in a significant release of sulfur dioxide from a tank or vessel, because sensors continually monitor the area and would immediately sound an alarm in the event of a release.  However, a leak from a fuse plug could result in"

Two minutes was the estimated maximum time required for the JCI emergency response team to respond to an alarm from area sensors and stop the leak.  The amount of sulfur dioxide released from an open 1/16-inch diameter fuse plug of a container with an internal pressure of 145 pounds per square inch would be 22.7 pounds at a rate of 11.3 pounds per minute.\n\n4. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps.\n\nThe prevention programs described in this facility\u00bfs Safety, Engineering, and Safety Training Manuals represent integrated administrative controls intended to ensure the safety of workers, the public, and the environment.  Many of these prevention programs (e.g., PHAs, compliance audits, incident investigations) result in the development and implementation of additional safeguards (administrative and engineering controls).  All covered processes have control systems designed to maintain operating parameters (temperature, pressures, flow, and level) within allowable limits.  The covered processes are also equipped with alarms to alert personnel when the operating parameters exceed the allowable limits.  This facility developed procedures and conducted training of personnel to familiarize them with the consequences of exceeding allowable limits (safety and operability) to ensure the correct response to the alarms.  Safeguards to prevent, detect, or mitigate accidental releases of regulated substances are described in the facility's Safety, Engineering, and Safety Training Manuals.\n\n5. The Five-Year Accident History\n\nThis facility compiled a five-year accident history (1997-2001) for all accidental releases from covered processes that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage as require"

The five-year accident history allows the Merrimack Facility to explain to the community the factors causing or contributing to accidental releases, the on-site and off-site impacts of accidental releases, and the procedural and technological changes made to minimize the likelihood that these accidental releases will ever occur again.  The intent of this information exchange is to create an informed community, while also documenting that accidental releases are investigated and concrete changes are made to protect against recurrence.  \n\nPersonnel at the Merrimack Facility reviewed all incident investigation reports from January 1, 1997 to the present to identify accidental releases of extremely hazardous substances that resulted in deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.  No accidental releases were identified.\n\n6. The Emergency Response Plan\n\nOverall safety at this facility is governed no only by the ability to prevent accidental releases of regulated substances, but also by the ability to mitigate any accidental releases.  This facility therefore developed an emergency response program to minimize the effects of accidental releases of regulated substances on employees, the public and the environment.  The facility has a trained emergency response team (ERT), appropriate equipment and supplies, and a detailed Contingency Plan.  The Contingency Plan outlines the procedures to be taken in the event of an accidental release of a regulated substance and specified notification, evacuation, and release control and containment measures for accidental releases that may occur at the facility or on the highway (in transportation accidents).  \n\nThe Contingency Plan Manual includes specific process information, a list of emergency equipment, emergency evacuation plans, and a list of plant personnel.  The manual also includes a list of telephone numbers of agencies and individuals to contact in the"

Written coordination agreements that document arrangements with local emergency responders are maintained in the Contingency Plan Manual.  \n\nThe Contingency Plan includes plans to respond to releases of regulated substances, and identifies the ERT training requirements, qualifications, and responsibilities within the incident command system.  The ERT comprises individuals from operations, maintenance, and engineering.  In addition to the ERT, this facility has identified, properly trained and properly equipped employees to administer first aid until the outside responders arrive.  All ERT members complete on-site annual eight-hour refresher training.  \n\nThe Contingency Plan includes the chemical-specific emergency response procedures for releases of regulated and other extremely hazardous substances.

Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nStudies associated with prevention program elements such as PHAs, incident investigations, management of change, and compliance audits are regularly conducted at this facility to verify designs and to identify potential hazards.  Recommendations may be developed as a result of those studies and as a result of equipment inspections, safety meetings, review of industry experience, technology improvements, and employee suggestions.  Once formulated, recommendations are reviewed and corresponding action items are developed to implement each recommendation.  \n\nJCI Merrimack personnel reviewed the following documents to identify all action items that were formulated to reduce the risk (severity or likelihood) of an incident that could have plausibly resulted in an off-site consequence (i.e., the emergency response planning guideline level 2 [ERPG] developed by the American Industrial Hygiene Association for toxic gases): \n\n?
