      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary:\n\nMonte Vista Cooperative Center Fertilizer Plant stores liquid anhydrous ammonia which is considered a regulated toxic substance by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  The anhydrous ammonia is primarily used as a raw material to produce Ammonium Polyphosphate fertilizer.  The Center Fertilizer Plant also sells anhydrous ammonia for fertilizer application and industrial refrigeration.  \n\nThe properties that make anhydrous ammonia a valuable fertilizer and refrigeration source also makes it necessary to observe certain safety precautions during handling and storage.  It is the policy of the Cooperative and its employees to adhere to all of the Federal and state rules and regulations, so as to prevent unnecessary human exposure and to reduce the threat to the community.  Safety depends upon the competent training of Cooperative personnel, the manner in which we handle anhydrous ammonia and the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe worst-case release scenario and alternative release scenarios: (the language below will be replaced with the following for the Executive Summary in RMP*eSubmit:  This facility has developed a worst-case and alternative-case scenario however it has been withheld from this Executive Summary as security-sensitive information as requested by EPA.)\n\n\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program:\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule, with OSHA's requirements and with other applicable Federal and state codes, standards and regulations.  The facility design and construction are in accordance with the ANSI/CGA G-2.1 and the OSHA 1910.111 standards.  It is formally inspected a minimum of once a year for compliance to all applicable standards by a private third party and the Colorado Department of Agriculture.  Corrective and routine maintenance is performed at the facility to maintain compliance with the appropriate standards.  Employees of the crop production "

Emergency response preplanning is conducted with the local fire department and Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  Emergency planning and community right-to-know information is provided to the state emergency response commission, local emergency planning committee and local fire department as required by SARA Title III of EPCRA.\n\nAn Emergency Action Plan is in place for the facility and employees are also familiar with the North American Emergency Response Guidebook.  \n\n\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety:\n\nThis facility utilizes ANSI/CGA G-2.1-2014 and OSHA standards as guidelines for the safe storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.  At this time there are no further plans to modify or change the facility.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information (PSI):\n\nThe Cooperative has developed and is keeping current working copies of the PSI including information pertaining to the hazards of the process, the technology of the process and the equipment of the process.  All employees involved in the process are trained in the area where they will perform work and all contractors are given training before entry into the plant is allowed.  The PSI will enable the employees and contractors of the plant to identify and understand the hazards posed by the process involving anhydrous ammonia.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA):\n\nThe Cooperative is committed to performing a PHA to identify, evaluate and control hazards associated with the plant processes.  The PHA is used to "

The Operating Procedures address the following and are reviewed annually to determine if updates are necessary:\n\n?    all operating modes (startup, shutdown, etc.) \n\n?    operating limits, consequences of deviation and safeguards\n\n?    health and safety\n\n?    safety systems and functions\n\n\n\n&#8195;\n\nTraining:\n\nThe Cooperative is committed to providing its employees comprehensive training to assure that the work force can perform their duties safely, efficiently and effectively.  Employees assigned to the process are trained in all steps including startup, shutdown, normal operations, emergency operations, operating limits and safety systems and functions.  Employees are provided refresher training at least every three years.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity:\n\nThe Cooperative has a written program for maintaining the mechanical integrity of the process equipment at the plant.  The program includes inspection and testing of pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, ancillary equipment, relief systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls, compressors and pumps.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation:\n\nThe Cooperative has communicated to all plant employees that it is every employee's responsibility to report incidents and near misses.  After an incident or near miss is reported, an incident investigation is conducted.  Findings and recommendations are addressed and resolutions documented.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audit:\n\nA compliance audit of the Center Plan"

At a minimum, the audit team will consist of one employee knowledgeable in the audit process who is impartial to the plant and one employee with appropriate technical expertise.  Recommendations resulting from the audit are addressed and efficiencies documented and corrected.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change (MOC):\n\nThe Cooperative's MOC system was developed to ensure that changes at the plant will not result in undetected unsafe situations and employees will be aware of all changes and their implications.  The MOC system includes the following considerations before any process changes take place:\n\n?    Authorization requirement for the change\n\n?    Technical basis for the proposed change\n\n?    Impact of the change on health and safety\n\nAfter changes are made, all affected employees will be informed about the change and training will be provided to the affected employees prior to startup of the modified process.  In addition, the PSI and applicable operating procedures will be updated to reflect the changes made.\n\n\n\nPre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR):\n\nWhen change to the process is significant enough to require a change in safety information under the MOC, the Cooperative will conduct a PSSR.  The PSR Team Leader will develop a checklist and assemble a team of key personnel to go over every element on the checklist during the PSSR.  All PSSR members will be knowledgeable about the process and trained in the area of change.\n\n\n\nContractors:\n\nThe Cooperative has developed and implemented safe work practices to control the entrance, presence and exit of contract employees in covered process areas.  It is the Cooperative's policy to select safe contractors, provide appropriate safety related information to contractors, develop safe work practices related to contractors and periodically evaluate contractors.\n\nThe Cooperative will also inform contractors of the known "

A permit is required when hot work is to be conducted on or near the process.  This permit ensures that fire prevention and protection requirements have been implemented prior to hot work operations.\n\n\n\n"
