Our comprehensive program designed to protect workers from industrial hazards demonstrates this commitment.  Engineering controls are in place to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  \n\nPSGC has a rigorous safety training program covering potential health & safety hazards and safe workplace procedures designed to eliminate or minimize hazards.  Therefore, allowing employees to work in a safe work environment. \n\nPSGC is a non-responding facility and relies on contracted service providers to respond to chemical releases.\n\nThe stationary source and regulated substances handled [40 CFR 68.155(b)]:\n\nPSGC maintains one substance, anhydrous ammonia, on site in amounts exceeding the Risk Management Program (RMP) threshold quantity. Anhydrous ammonia is used in the selective catalytic reduction air pollution control devices installed on two utility boilers.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps [40 CFR 68.155(c)]:\n\nPSGC has a program in place to comply with the provisions of the accidental release prevention regulations under 40 CFR Part 68. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the existing release prevention program.\n\nProcess Safety Information [40 CFR Part 68.65]\n\nPSGC maintains a detailed record of process safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis [40 CFR"

PSGC's process hazard assessment uses a HAZOP/checklist-type analysis for the anhydrous ammonia system.  The PHAs are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of 5 years. Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nWritten Operating Procedures [40 CFR Part 68.69]\n\nTo ensure safe operations, PSGC maintains detailed written operating procedures. These procedures address various modes of operation, such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations and normal shutdown. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nEmployee Training [40 CFR Part 68.71]\n\nPSGC has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are to ensure that employees operating plant processes are competent in the applicable operating procedures. Refresher training is provided at least every 3 years and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity [40 CFR Part 68.73]\n\nPSGC carries out documented checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations. PSGC\u0092s mechanical integrity inspection program follows RAGAGEP for prescribing nondestructive examinations of the entire system regularly. Inspected process equipment includes pressure vessels, piping systems, pressure relief systems, and system controls. Maintenance activities are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices. Any equipment deficiencies identified are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change [MOC] [40 CFR Part 68.75]\n\nWritten Management of Change procedures are in place at PSGC to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment, and operational procedures.

These reviews confirm that construction, equipment, operating, and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup before placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits [40 CFR Part 68.79]\n\nPSGC conducts audits regularly to determine whether the provisions set out under the US EPA RMP and OSHA PSM regulations are being implemented. These audits are conducted at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required due to the audits are undertaken promptly.\n\nIncident Investigation [40 CFR Part 68.81]\n\nPSGC promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in or could reasonably result in a release of a regulated substance. These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident and any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring. \n\nEmployee Participation [40 CFR Part 68.83]\n\nPSGC believes that Process Safety Management and accident prevention is a team effort. Employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements. In addition, PSGC employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP and PSM rules, including information resulting from Process Hazard Analyses.\n\nHot Work Permit [40 CFR Part 68.85]\n\nPSGC has a hot work process that includes issuing a hot work permit for hot work operations conducted on or near the covered process. \n\nContractor Safety Program [40 CFR Part 68.87] \n\nPSGC hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.
