Figure ES-1 provides an outline of the RMP. Chlorine system processes are covered under this regulation at the City of Cedar Park water treatment plant (WTP). \n\nFigure ES-1.

The technical information herein may be used as a training reference in initial and recurring operator and maintenance training. Training on process fundamentals, operations, and maintenance, coupled with the recommended process modifications discussed below, will reduce the potential hazards to WTP personnel and the surrounding community.\nAn emergency response program (ERP) and an incident investigation program are included. These two programs should be an integral part of both initial and recurring training.\nA risk management plan (Plan), as required by the EPA, is included at the end of the main body of this document. It consists of a summary of data elements that must be submitted to the EPA, which eventually will be uploaded onto a public-access database. The Plan has an executive summary that follows a required EPA format and is intended to inform the public of the WTP\u0092s proactive stance toward protection of the environment and the surrounding community. \n\nHazard Assessment\nThe hazard assessment comprises a worst-case and alternative release scenario (ARS) each for the chlorine system, as"

The hazard assessment was conducted as an initial screening procedure as part of determining into which program level (I, II, or III) the WTP falls.\nResidences lie within the EPA-defined endpoint concentrations of WTP\u0092s worst-case releases. Therefore, the WTP is ineligible for Program Level I. Because Texas public utilities are currently excluded from Program Level III, the WTP is included in Program Level II. Section 1 includes the hazard assessment.\n\nWorst-Case Scenario\nThe worst-case scenario was defined as a 1-ton container (2,000 pounds) of chlorine gas experiencing a release of the total quantity of gas within 10 minutes due to a catastrophic event. A mitigation factor of 0.55 was allowed for this evaluation because the enclosure covering the chlorine tank is considered a passive mitigation measure. This scenario was modeled using the EPA-approved RMP*Comp program. The toxic endpoint for chlorine was determined to be 0.9 miles.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario\nThe ARS of chlorine was also modeled using RMP*Comp. Source term estimation of approximately 175 pounds released was derived from a scenario of pressurized flexible tubing failure. The RMP*Comp program estimated the 3 parts per million (ppm) chlorine footprint to extend to 0.1 mile.\n\n5-Year Accident History\nNo accidents have occurred at the WTP involving either on-site or off-site consequences within the last five years.\n\nManagement Program\nThe management program consists of the document management system described subsequently.\n\nDocument Management System\nA document management system was established to attribute responsibility for the development, implementation, and maintenance of the RMP. The RMP must be updated every 3 years, or any time a covered process undergoes a physical or administrative modification. The document management system is largely a function of the RMP team (Table ES-1).\n\nTable ES-1. Cedar Park Water Treatment Plant Risk Management Progr"

This information was compiled from numerous sources and is intended to be a one-stop source for the reader seeking data on these substances. The physical data will provide useful information in the inevitable event the WTP processes are modified, thereby requiring revisited dense gas dispersion modeling.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nProcess safety information was meticulously compiled on each system studied. Specifications are collocated in one place for easy reference. This section details maximum intended inventory, safe upper and lower temperatures, safe upper and lower pressures, and codes and standards used to design, build, and operate the process.

The team consisted of facility management, process operating and maintenance experts, outside process design engineers, and consultants knowledgeable in the hazard review process itself. The hazard review technique used was a hybrid hazard and operability study (HAZOP), in the form of a \u0093What If\u0094 analysis. The \u0093What If\u0094 was developed from HAZOP experience at similar treatment facilities.\n\nRecommendations\nThe result of the hazard review is a set of recommendations for the WTP to implement. The rule under 40 CFR 68.50 requires the City of Cedar Park to ensure that problems identified are \u0093resolved in a timely manner.\u0094 For those items that cannot be resolved promptly, it is recommended that a schedule be developed that addresses those issues, with personnel responsibility assigned for each item. \nThe hazard review team, with consensus from all team members, developed the WTP recommendations. Table ES-2 provides a summary of the recommendations and the results of the hazard review. The table also includes recommendations made during subsequent meetings of City staff, as described in the following sections.\n\nTable ES-2.

A program has been developed with guidelines on how to conduct regular and structured WTP training. Training record forms (Exhibit 3-1) are included with the Plan for the required training documentation. Additionally, a training record has been compiled and included for all affected personnel associated with the covered processes.\n\nMaintenance\nA maintenance program has been developed with associated documentation forms. Preventive maintenance will reduce potential hazards to personnel on-site, as well as to the off-site public. Documentation and recordkeeping associated with the maintenance program must be provided to state and federal regulators upon request during inspections. \n\nIncident Investigation\nThe WTP has developed an incident investigation program that adheres to EPA\u0092s established strict guidelines to follow in the aftermath of any release involving the chlorine system. The incident investigation program outlines key milestones that must be accomplished within 24 hours of any covered incident and the actions that must subsequently occur.
