Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at the Facility: \n\nThe Coop board, management and employees at Watonwan Farm Service, Blue Earth, MN location, are committed to the prevention of accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.    \n\n\n\n\n\n2. Facility Information and Regulated Substance:\n\n\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.\n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received, stored, handled and distributed for direct application. Anhydrous ammonia is used for crop production nutrients.\n\n\n\nThe maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia would be approximately 224,000 pounds in our 30,000 and 18,000 gallon storage tanks; and approximately 125,000 pounds in various nurse tanks ranging in capacity from 1,000 gallons to 2,000 gallons. The maximum quantity handled at one time would be the unloading of a tank truck holding 40,000-45,000 pounds.  \n\n\n\n3.  General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps: \n\n\n\nThe facility has implemented Minnesota Dept. of Agriculture rules, the Standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia; and 40 CFR part 68 as they apply to this facility.  The facility is required to conduct a semi-annual inspection of all bulk and nurse tank equipment, including load and unload equipment, and perform any needed maintenance to the equipment found during the inspections.   Visual checks are to be conducted daily at the facility.  \n\n\n\n\n\n4.  The Five-year Accident History\n\n\n\nThere has been one accidental releases of anhydrous amm"

The release did NOT cause any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, and did not result in any offsite deaths, injuries, or evacuations.  However, the Blue Earth Fire Department did request nearby residents to shelter in place as a precautionary measure. It should be noted that the release occurred in the evening hours AFTER facility plant closure so time of onset is unknown, and therefore duration of the release has been estimated in the Five-Year Accident History. \n\n\n\n5.  The Emergency Response Program.\n\n\n\nThe facility has:\n\n\n\na. A written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38 and 40 CFR 68.95.  The plan includes a specific section on NH3 Releases and what to do in the event of a release. The next annual emergency action plan training is scheduled for July 2014.  Additional emergency response training is also provided throughout the year at various training sessions, including but not limited to a training session just on anhydrous ammonia. \n\n\n\nb. Provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA);\n\n\n\nc. Coordinated with local emergency responders.\n\n\n\nd. A Safety Data Sheet for anhydrous ammonia as part of their emergency response plan information for quick access and reference.\n\n\n\ne. A Minnesota AWAIR (A Workplace Accident and Injury Reduction) program in place and is committed to a safe working environment as well as protection of the community in which we operate.\n\n\n\n6.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  Currently, Watonwan Farm Service plans to implement additional Patron procedures to ensure safe return of anhydrous ammonia nurse tanks to our facilities.  \n\n"
