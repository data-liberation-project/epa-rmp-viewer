As part of this commitment, ARC has established a system to help ensure the safe operation of the processes at its facility.  One component of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the facility to comply with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR Part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements:  Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMPlan) describing the risk management program at ARC.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMPlan requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program implemented by ARC.\n\nARC's risk management program consists of three elements:\n1.  A hazard assessment to help understand (a) the potential offsite consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and (b) accidents that have occurred during the last five years associated with the use of substances regulated by the RMP rule (regulated substances) - see topics 1.3 and 1.5.\n2.  A prevention program to help maintain and safely operate the processes containing more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance (covered processes) - see topic 1.4.\n3.  An emergency response program to help respond to accidental releases of regulated substances from covered processes - see topic 1.7\nInformation further describing these elements is provided in this RMPlan.\n\nAlthough the risk management program at ARC helps provide assurance that the facility is maintained and operated in a safe manner, it is only one component of the safety program at the mill.  In fact, ARC has implemented a comprehensive safety program and established many levels of safeguards against release of a hazardous substance and injuries and damage f"

When a hazardous substance is used at the mill, the equipment is carefully designed, built, and operated to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release.  Industry and government standards are closely adhered to in the design, construction, and operation of the equipment.\n\nARC limits damage from a release, if such a release occurs.  ARC trains employees to respond to an accidental release, reducing the consequences of a release if it occurs.  In the event of an accidental release, the mill's fire department will work with local emergency responders to help ensure that injuries and environmental damage will be minimized.\n\nThe safety program at the mill consists of a number of elements, only some of which are required by the RMP rule.  This RMPlan is primarily intended to describe those parts of the safety program at ARC that are required by the RMP rule.\n\n1.1  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nARC is committed to the safety of employees and the public, and to the preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  The mill implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances.  These controls include training programs for personnel; programs to help ensure safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of processes in the mill; and programs to evaluate the hazards at ARC.\n\nIn the event of an accidental release, ARC controls and contains the release in a manner that will be safe for employees and will help prevent injury to the public or the environment.  The mill provides response training to its employees, designates an emergency response coordinator to oversee response activities, and coordinates response efforts with the local fire department.  The mill's fire department is staffed with certified firemen and is manned 24"

In order to effectively implement these policies, ARC established a management system headed by the Environmental Manager to oversee RMP-related activities.\n\n1.2  Facility Information and Regulated Substances\n\nARC operates two bleached kraft pulp mills that employ approximately 425 full-time workers.  The two mills produce bleached kraft market pulp for sale to customers.  As part of this manufacturing process, ARC handles chlorine dioxide in sufficient quantities to be covered by the RMP rule.\n\n1.3  Offsite Consequence Analysis\n\nARC performed an offsite consequence analysis to estimate the potential for an accidental release of a regulated substance to affect the public or the environment.  The offsite consequence analysis consists of evaluating both worst-case release scenarios and alternative release scenarios.  ARC does not expect a worst-case release scenario to ever occur.  The alternative release scenario was selected to help the Monroe County Emergency Management Agency improve the community emergency response plan.  An alternative release scenario represents a release that (1) might occur at a facility like ARC, and (2) would result in the greatest potential offsite consequences if the release occurred.  \n\n1.4  Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nSince its inception in 1978, the facility has used a prevention program to help prevent accidental releases of hazardous substances.  Beginning in 1992, the mill formalized this prevention program for the Kraft Pulp Bleaching process to comply with the 14 elements of the OSHA process safety management (PSM) prevention programs for chlorine dioxide.  In 1996, the EPA's RMP rule established similar requirements for Program 3 processes.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of ARC's Program 3 prevention program that address the EPA's RMP rule accident prevention program requirements.\n\n1.4.1  Process Safety Information\n\nARC maintains a variety o"

ARC ensures that this process safety information is available to all mill employees, the Monroe County Emergency Management Agency, and local emergency responders.\n\nMaterial safety data sheets (MSDSs) document the physical properties of hazardous substances handled at ARC, including regulated substances in RMP-covered processes.  The MSDS for chlorine dioxide is available to mill operators and local emergency responders for ready reference.  \n\nThe engineering design documents include the operating parameters and the design basis and configuration of the equipment in each covered process.  The available information includes:\n- operating parameters\n- block flow or simplified process flow diagrams\n- process chemistry\n- maximum intended inventories\n- safe upper and lower limits for parameters such as temperature, pressure, or flow\n- consequences of deviation from established operating limits\n- design basis and configuration of equipment\n- piping and instrument diagrams, including materials of construction\n- electrical classification\n- safety systems\n- applicable design codes and standards\n- design basis for relief and ventilation systems\nWhen important information was not available from the design documents, it was developed through special projects.

Responsibility to resolve the recommendations is assigned to mill personnel and, when appropriate, changes to enhance the safety of the process are implemented.\n\n1.4.3  Operating Procedures\n\nARC engineers, operators, and supervisors work together to develop and maintain operating procedures to define how tasks related to process operations should be safely performed.  The operating procedures (1) are used to train employees, and (2) serve as reference guides for appropriate actions to take during both normal operations and process upsets.  Mill employees develop and maintain operating procedures that cover all phases of operations, including initial startup, normal operations, normal shutdown, emergency shutdown, startup following a turnaround or emergency shutdown, and temporary operations.\n\n1.4.4  Training\n\nARC trains employees to safely and effectively perform their assigned tasks.  The employee training program includes both initial and refresher training that covers (1) a general overview of the process, (2) the properties and hazards of the substances in the process, and (3) a detailed review of the process operating procedures and safe work practices.  Demonstrations and employee observations are used to verify that an employee understands the training material before the employee can resume work in the process.\n\n1.4.5.  Mechanical Integrity\n\nARC maintains the mechanical integrity of process equipment to help prevent equipment failures that could endanger workers, the public, or the environment.  The mechanical integrity program includes (1) an inspection and testing program to help iden"

The mechanical integrity program includes:\n- specifications for inspection and testing of process equipment\n- specifications for replacement parts and equipment\n- procedures for inspecting, testing, and maintaining process equipment\n- procedures for safe work practices such as lockout/tagout, hot work, confined space entry, and line or equipment opening\n- training of maintenance personnel\n- documentation of maintenance activities\n\n1.4.6  Management of Change\n\nThe ARC management of change program evaluates and approves all proposed changes to chemicals, equipment, and procedures for a covered process to help ensure that the change does not negatively affect safe operations.  Process changes that are determined to be a replacement in kind (e.g., replacing a valve with an identical valve) are allowed without completing a full management of change program.  All other changes must be confirmed through the full management of change program to help ensure that inadvertent consequences of process changes are prevented, safety consequences of changes are addressed, affected process safety information and procedures are updated, and affected employees \nare notified of the changes.\n\n1.4.7  Pre-startup Review\n\nARC performs a safety review of a new or modified process before the process is placed into service to help ensure that the process has been prepared to operate safely.  This review confirms that:\n- construction and equipment are in accordance with design specifications\n- adequate safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency procedures are in place\n- employee training has been completed\n- for a covered process, a PHA has been performed if the process is new or management of change requirements have been completed if an existing process has been modified\n"

The mill assembles an audit team that includes personnel knowledgeable in the RMP rule and in the process, and this team evaluates whether the prevention program satisfies the requirements of the RMP rule and whether the prevention program is sufficient to help ensure safe operation of the process.  The results of the audit are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate enhancements to the prevention program are implemented.\n\n1.4.9  Incident Investigation\n\nARC investigates all incidents that could reasonably have resulted in a serious injury to personnel, the public, or the environment so that similar accidents can be prevented.  The mill trains employees to identify and report any incident requiring investigation.  An investigation team is assembled, and the investigation is initiated within 48 hours of the incident.  The results of the investigation are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate process enhancements are implemented.\n\n1.4.10  Employee Participation\n\nARC developed a written employee participation program for covered processes to help ensure that the safety concerns of mill employees are addressed.  ARC encourages active participation of personnel in the prevention program activities of all processes at the facility.  Employees are consulted on and informed about all aspects of the RMP rule prevention program, including PHAs, employee training, and operating procedures.\n\n1.4.11  Hot Work Permits\n\nARC established a hot work permit program to control spark- or flame-producing activities that could result in fires or explosions in covered processes at the mill.  ARC reviewed OSHA's fire prevention and protection requirements in 29 CFR "

The Shift Supervisor reviews the completed form before work can begin.  Training in the use of the Hot Work Permit Form is included in the mill's safe work practices orientation.\n\n1.4.12  Contractors\n\nARC established a program to help ensure that contractor activities at the mill are performed in a safe manner.  The program reviews the safety record of all contractors to help ensure that ARC hires only those contractors who can safely perform the desired job tasks.  The mill trains the contract supervisors in the hazards of the process on which they and their employees will work, mill safe work practices, and mill emergency response procedures.  The mill requires that the contractor supervisors train each of their employees who will work at the mill before that worker begins work at the ARC site.  The mill periodically reviews contractors' training documents and work performance to help ensure that safe work practices are followed.\n\n1.5  Chemical-specific Prevention Steps\n\nIn addition to the required prevention program elements, ARC has implemented safety features specific to the hazardous substances used within the facility.  Sensors and alarms are provided in areas containing chlorine dioxide.  Vent gases from vessels where chlorine dioxide is applied to pulp have been routed to scrubbers for emissions control.\n\n1.6  Five-Year Accident History\nARC has had no accidents during the last five years while handling chlorine dioxide.
