Anheuser Busch - Fairfield's safety and environmental policies are administered by the EHS&S Manager, who conducts periodic inspections of the facility to ensure compliance, and oversees the entire safety and environmental programs, including the PSM/RMP/CalARP Program. The management of the Anheuser-Busch brewery in Fairfield, California recognizes and shares the community's interest in safe operation of our facility. We have completed this report under the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) risk management program (RMP) to communicate our efforts to achieve a safe workplace. The brewery uses ammonia as a key part of the cooling system that maintains beer at the proper temperature during certain stages of the brewing process. Ammonia is one of the materials covered under the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration's Process Safety Management standard (PSM) and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Risk Management Program regulations. The brewery follows these regulations, as well as others, to ensure that it safely\nhandles, uses, and stores ammonia and other potentially hazardous chemicals safely. The brewery has had no releases of ammonia that resulted in injuries to people, harm to property, or damage to the environment since it opened in 1976.\nOur global environmental, health, and safety (EHS) policy and requirements promote the overall\nsafety of this brewery, employees, and the public. This policy includes risk reduction programs that\nprovide assurance for the safe management of process risks to prevent environmental, health and\nsafety incidents and to protect the workplace, the community, and the environment.

Each employee is trained and required to comply strictly with this policy. We do not allow production goals or financial objectives to over-ride safety and environmental concerns. Also, it is Anheuser-Busch's policy to lead by example so that other companies, including vendors\nand suppliers, are similarly interested in protecting the health and safety of employees and safeguarding the environment. We are committed to the spirit as well as the letter of our EHS policy and promote, throughout the organization, responsibility, and accountability for strict compliance with that policy. Anheuser-Busch employees whose actions in the performance of their duties may affect the environment and/or public health are trained sufficiently to permit them to comply strictly with our EHS policy.\nIn conducting our businesses, we continue to seek and implement cost effective methods to reduce the EHS impact of our operations. We integrate EHS considerations into our business planning and decision-making processes, including product research and development, packaging, and new manufacturing methods. Our continuous EHS improvement goals include pollution prevention and resource conservation. We ask our contractors to adopt EHS standards, ethics, and policies similar to our own and we will give preference to suppliers that do so.\nWe encourage our employees, customers, and the public to share with us their EHS concerns. We continually talk with local authorities in communities in which we operate to share ideas about preventing incidents with materials we use or store.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\nThe Anheuser Busch facility is located at 3101 Busch Drive in Fairfield, California.

The area immediately surrounding the facility is rural with a mixture of farmland and residential areas. \nThe facility uses approximately 44,000 pounds of ammonia as a refrigerant within a closed-loop refrigeration system. The system, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for the processing and storage of beverages. Typical operating conditions of the system ranges from 26 psig on the low side to 120 psig on the high side of the system.  \nA refrigeration system is used to reduce the temperature of a heat source. A mechanical refrigeration system is a closed system that cycles the refrigerant, ammonia, from liquid to gas and back again. As the refrigerant absorbs large amounts of heat from the source, the refrigerant changes state from liquid to gas. At a different part of the system, the refrigerant releases heat as it is condensed back into a liquid. This system is referred to as having two sides: a low pressure or low side, where the refrigerant absorbs heat as it evaporates, and a high pressure or high side, where the refrigerant vapor releases heat as it is condensed back into a liquid. The system basically moves heat from the low side to the high side. Refrigeration is maintained by isolating the low side in some form of insulated enclosure where goods or processes can be chilled or frozen. \nThe low side of the refrigeration system typically uses one or more evaporators to remove heat from the space or products to be cooled. An evaporator contains a set of continuous coils through which the refrigerant flows. Due to the low pressures and corresponding low temperatures maintained in the evaporator, the liquid refrigerant quickly evaporates, absorbing a great deal of heat from the surrounding area. To inc"

The compressor is the driving force of the system. It pulls refrigerant vapor from the evaporator (low side) at a rate that will maintain the evaporator pressure required for the desired operating temperature. At the same time, it pressurizes the warm vapor and forces it into the condenser and the high side of the system. Refrigeration compressors on the market today are screw type, reciprocating, and centrifugal. \nExpansion valves regulate the flow of liquid refrigerant from the high side to the low side by causing a large pressure drop. These valves are located between the receiver (high side) and the evaporator (low side). These valves, coupled with the capacities of the compressor, can help regulate the pressure of the evaporator thereby creating the cooling capabilities of the system. The high side of the refrigeration system consists of a condenser and a receiver. Warm refrigerant vapor enters the condenser after it has been pressurized by the compressor. A condenser will typically use  water to cool the warm ammonia as it passes through a series of tubes within the condenser. As the cooling medium of  water draws the heat from this vapor, the refrigerant condenses into a liquid and flows to the receiver. The receiver serves as a holding tank for the liquid refrigerant being fed to the low side. The ammonia inventory was provided by the facility on May 30, 2014.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\nThe chemical system at the Anheuser Busch - Fairfield facility has many safety features.

It is important to note that the refrigeration system has been designed with several safety features to prevent the accidental release of ammonia. For example, the compressors are equipped with safety mechanisms that will cause the units to shut down if operating conditions exceed designated safety limits.  Also, level indicators, alarms, and switches are installed in key points within the system to monitor the supply of liquid ammonia and to ensure that a vessel is not overfilled.  Pressure relief valves on all pressure vessels protect the equipment from overpressurization and rupture. \nThe brewery is equipped with automatic seismic orbit valves. The system consists of eight valves placed throughout the refrigeration system and are designed to automatically close during a seismic event minimizing potential releases.\nAdditionally, there is an ammonia diffusion \"dump\" tank that is designed to be use only in the case of an emergency. It is designed to scrub some amount of NH3 gas if released due to overpressurization of the suction system.\n \nThe following elements have produced this safe operating record:\nProcess hazard analysis and review, including corrective action follow-up requirements;\nStandard operating procedures that all operators of the refrigeration system must follow;\nFormal operator training;\nPreventative maintenance to ensure that the entire refrigeration system is mechanically sound;\nProcedures to ensure that changes to the refrigeration system are managed so ammonia flow\nremains safe;\nSafety review prior to the start-up of new or modified equipment;\nAudits of the PSM and RMP programs;\nIncident investigations to ensure that lessons are learned to prevent future incidents;\nEmployee involvement in risk reduction programs;\nContractor safety procedures are reviewed to ensure outside workers exercise the same safety\nconsciousness as employees;\nA work permit system that ensures all welding work is conducted safely;\nPr"

This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:  \n-save lives;\n-minimize and avoid injuries;\n-protect the environment; and\n-minimize property damage.\nThe Fairfield brewery has in place a variety of emergency response procedures in the event of an\nincident involving ammonia. The emergency response program is based on OSHA's requirements\nfor emergency action plans (29 CFR 1910.38) and HAZWOPER (29 CFR 1910.120). We have\ntrained employees for emergency response and maintain a plan titled ES Incident Plan\n(HAZWOPER Plan) which has been supplied to, and discussed with, Region II LEPC. We conduct annual drills with local agencies to help us remain prepared to implement the ES Incident Plan (HAZWOPER Plan) at the brewery. This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year. This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the CalARP regulations.  \nBrewery personnel notify local agencies wh"

If it is determined that the public needs to be notified, the local agencies perform the notification task.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nAnheuser-Busch's Fairfield brewery ammonia refrigeration system is periodically modified to\nimprove safety. A continuous ammonia monitoring/detection system was installed in\nthe machine room (Powerhouse). Upon detection of a high ammonia concentration, the system will\nalarm and automatically shut down all boilers, ammonia compressors, close seismic system valves and de-energize other electrical equipment in addition to activating the exhaust ventilation fans in the machine room. This system is tested on an annual basis to confirm proper function. Additionally, the brewery has recently conducted a minimum system safety evaluation in accordance with Chapter 8 of the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) 9 - Standard for Minimum System Safety Requirements for Existing Closed Circuit Ammonia Refrigeration System and is actively working to address any opportunities to improve the system through that evaluation.\n\nCONCLUSION\nAnheuser-Busch is pleased to share its record of safe operations with the citizens of Fairfield. We\nbelieve the Risk Management Plan under which we are providing this information is an important tool for encouraging communications with our neighbors. Although we are confident the \"worst case\" and \"alternative\" scenarios presented in this report are highly unlikely, we want you ,our neighbors, to know we are prepared to respond quickly and effectively should one ever occur. Anheuser-Busch has worked hard over the years to ensure the highest standard of safety. Our goal is to continue the excellent and safe track record."
