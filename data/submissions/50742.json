The City of Philippi Fire Department personnel can respond within 2 minutes and have the adequate personal protective equipment to isolate valves in the event of such an incident.  Once the chlorine cylinder storage/chlorinator area has been adequately ventilated and the release of chlorine stopped, City of Philippi Water Treatment Plant personnel will enter into the area to perform the repair work necessary.  City of Philippi Water Treatment Plant personnel will enter into the chlorine cylinder storage/chlorinator area in the event of an alarm situation to assess the condition and perform minor emergency response.  The facility is covered by a facility specific emergency response plan.  \n\nTRAINING\n\nCity of Philippi Water Treatement Plant personnel receive annual training through the West Virginia Rural Water Association.  This training is performed to insure that personnel understand the hazards of dealing with chlorine gas and are familiar with the routine tasks associated with their jobs, as well as aware of the emergency response procedures neceessary to be followed in the event of a chlorine release.  \n\nAFFECTED AREA\n\nIn the event of a catastrophic release of chlorine gas, one school, one hospital, several residences, several businesses, and one recreational area would be affected.  For an alternative scenario release, one school, several residences, several businesses, and one recreational area would be affected.."

      "SummaryText": "The City of Philippi water treatment system utilizes chlorine gas for disinfection purposes.  The facility utilizes one ton cylinders of chlorine gas which are received at the facility as needed with one cylinder delivered at any one time.  Up to two cylinders are maintained on-site at any one time.  All cylinders are stored inside the water treatment plant building.  The process utilizes one cylinder on-line at any one time.  One additional cylinder is connected to an automatic transfer system.  The automatic transfer system allows the second cylinder to go on-line as soon as the chlorine from the first cylinder has been totally utilized.  The system operates such that the chlorine transfer from the cylinder to the chlorinators is under vacuum versus pressure.  This type of arrangement provides for minimal potential for leaks of chlorine through the piping.  The only section of the system which is not under vacuum is the piping from the cylinder valves to the cylinder manifold which is under pressure.  The facility has a preventive maintenance program which is designed to maintain the equipment that handles chlorine gas in a good operating mode.  Chlorine cylinders are received from the vendor and the transfer of the cylinders from the truck to the chlorine storage building is always performed during daylight hours, and is attended by the truck driver and a City of Philippi water treatment plant operator.  The City of Philippi water treatment plant is continuously manned.  There is a chlorine sensor system located at the facility.  This system is designed to detect any chlorine release within the chlorine cylinder storage/chlorinator room.  The chlorinator and chlorine storage area is designed with exhaust fans that are manually started if a chlorine release is identified by the sensors.\n\nThe alternative scenario identified for this facility would be for a failure of the yoke piping which connects to the cylinder.  If this piping and related regulator valve failed,"
