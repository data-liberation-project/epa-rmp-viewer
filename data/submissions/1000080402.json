A compilation of written process safety information was used in conducting the process hazard analysis (PHA). The process safety information included information pertaining to the hazards of Ammonia (anhydrous), information pertaining to the technology of the Ammonia refrigeration process, and information pertaining to the equipment utilized in the Ammonia refrigeration system.  The last PHA was conducted on April 17, 2019 using the methodology specified in 40 CFR 68.67 (What If).  A system has been established to promptly address the findings from the methodology used.  The operating procedures will be consistent with the process safety information and address steps for each operating phase, operating limitations, safety and health considerations, and safety systems and their functions.  Training for employees associated with the Ammonia refrigeration process will be provided along with the required refresher training.  The preventive maintenance program is utilized to ensure the ongoing mechanical integrity of the Ammonia refrigeration process.  Proposed changes to the Ammonia (anhydrous) receiving, storage, delivery, and handling and production systems are evaluated and approved before being implemented and so that inadvertent or unintended changes are prevented.  Pre-startup Safety Review (PSSR) is conducted to ensure that plant personnel and process equipment are ready to safely start and maintain process operations.  RMP compliance audits will be conducted every three (3) years to verify that procedures are adequate and are being followed.  Any incident involving the Ammonia refrigeration process and equipment will be investigated.  The facility will consult with affected employees on the conduct and development of the elements of the management of the Ammonia refrigeration process.  Hot work permits are issued for hot work operations conducted near or on the Ammonia refrigeration process.  Information regarding contract owner or operator's safety performance will be obtained and evaluated prior to selection of the contractor.",

Appropriate responses to release of Ammonia (anhydrous) are documented in the Risk Management Program (RMP) document. Safety, environmental protection, and risk management programs will be fully implemented by Plumrose personnel and contractors and are coordinated with community emergency responders for emergency planning and response efforts. \n\n\n\n(b) Stationary Source and Regulated Substance Handled\n\n\n\nPlumrose provides employment for approximately 300 workers in Elkhart, Indiana. This facility is a meat processing plant owned by JBS USA, LLC, which has headquarters at 1770 Promontory Cir., Greely, CO 80631.  The facility is operated by Plumrose USA, Inc., which has headquarters at 651 W. Washington Blvd., Suite 302, Chicago, IL 60661.\n\n\n\nAfter reviewing the facility operations and the RMP regulations, it was determined that the entire facility is considered one process. Plumrose receives and processes raw meat (pork bellies). The pork bellies are processed by washing, injecting, and smoking on site. After processing, the pork bellies are then sliced, and packaged for retail sale. From the time the pork bellies are received and throughout the processes conducted, the facility maintains a cool temperature utilizing an Ammonia (anhydrous) refrigeration process. Based on the facility processes and applicable regulations, it was determined that the facility is subject to Program 3 of the RMP regulation.\n\n\n\n(c) General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information: Plumrose completed a compilation of written process safety information to be used in conducting the process hazard anal"
