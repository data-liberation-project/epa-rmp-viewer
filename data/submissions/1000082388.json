Planned Changes to Improve Safety and Maintaining a Safe Operation\r\nWe have already installed controls and protective systems to meet refrigeration system industry design safety standards and applicable regulations and continually work to safely manage chemical hazards to protect our employees and the community we serve. Each year we will review procedures, maintain equipment, follow safe work practices and coordinate with community emergency responders.  Periodically, we will audit our program, update our Process Hazard Analysis and implement any additional improvements recommended by these evaluations. Based on our most recent evaluation, we will be further improving our mechanical integrity, equipment controls and release detection and taking other prevention improvement measures. We continue this process on an ongoing basis."
