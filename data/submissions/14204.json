      "SummaryText": "SECTION 1\nRMP EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nThe County of San Diego Hazardous Materials Division (HMD) has requested that a \nCalifornia Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program be prepared for the ammonia \nrefrigeration system at the Tenth Avenue Marine Terminal Cold Storage Facility (Facility) \nowned by the San Diego Unified Port District (SDUPD) in San Diego, California.  \nHarborside Refrigerated Services operates the Facility.  Ogden Environmental and Energy \nServices Co., Inc. (Ogden) has prepared this update to the CalARP Risk Management \nPlan (RMP), formerly referred to as a Risk Management and Prevention Program \n(RMPP), and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) RMP on \nbehalf of the property owner, SDUPD, at the request of the Port\u0012s Department of \nEnvironmental Services (ES).  An original RMPP was prepared by Parsons Engineering \nScience, Inc. in 1992; the County of San Diego Department of Environmental Health \n(DEH) determined the original RMPP to be complete on March 17, 1992.  The original \nRMPP is used as a basis for this RMP.  \n\nGeneral Description\n\nThe site of concern is the cold storage facility located on the Tenth Avenue Marine \nTerminal.  The Facility is located on a land area of approximately 100 acres of waterfront \nproperty and consists of over 300,000 square feet of space in Warehouse B.  \nApproximately 150,000 square feet of that space is divided into nine rooms for storage of \nvarious commodities.  All of these rooms are capable of cool storage of commodities at \napproximately 32 degrees Fahrenheit (0F).  In addition, three of the rooms are capable of \nfrozen storage at -100F.\n\nThe refrigeration system uses a combination of chilled brine system when used for cool \nstorage and direct-expansion ammonia system.  In the cool mode, ammonia is used to chill \nthe brine, which is then circulated throughout the room.  The mechanical area containing \nthe chillers, compressors, and Stage 1 pumps consists of a 6,300-square-foot fenced-in"

The system became operational in December \n1992 and was designed by VZM of Oakland, California, with assistance from FES-West.  \nThe Facility received its first shipment for storage on or about February 25, 1993.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Procedures\n\nThe system is designed so that when problems occur the system shuts itself down in a \nmanner designed to reduce the opportunity for releases to occur.  In addition, sensors \nconnected to alarms are in place to detect releases of ammonia.  Employees are trained to \nhelp ensure their safety as well as the safety of others in the vicinity.  Emergency response \nplans and evacuation plans are in place to allow for quick, effective response when \nnecessary.\n\nDescription of Regulated Process and Regulated Substances\n\nAmmonia is used as a refrigerant in the refrigeration system as a part of the \u0013Brine\u0014 \nCooling, Freezer Storage, and Vestibule Systems.  The refrigeration system contains \n22,000 pounds (4,300 gallons) of anhydrous ammonia.  The material is used in a closed \nloop system only and no product is stored.  Anhydrous ammonia is a clear, nonflammable, \nheavy, colorless gas with a characteristic odor.  It is soluble in water, forming a corrosive \nliquid.  Contact with the skin can cause frostbite.  The major concern is a potential \naccidental release is toxicity of the ammonia gas.\n\nWorst-case and Alternative Scenarios\n\nAn Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA) for ammonia handling at the Facility was \nprepared for the 1992 RMPP.  Based on the Hazard Operability Study (HAZOP) and \npreliminary risk analysis, ammonia accident scenarios were selected for detailed OCA.  \nThe alternative release scenario used for both the 1992 RMPP and the 1999 RMP is the \nrelease of ammonia from the oil pot.  Each month approximately 1 gallon of oil collects \nand is removed.  There is the potential for ammonia release if the Standard Operating \nProcedures are not followed.  If ammoni"

It is \nassumed that ammonia would flow out for 15 minutes before an operator stops the \nrelease.  The distance to the endpoint to where the anhydrous ammonia would disperse \nenough to no longer pose a hazard to the public, based on conservative meteorological \nconditions, is 529 meters (579 yards).  \n\nThe worst-case scenario is the release of all of the ammonia from the ammonia receiver.  \nTo model the release, it was assumed that the maximum amount of anhydrous ammonia \nstored in this vessel was 22,000 pounds (4,300 gallons) and was released over a 10-minute \nperiod from a 1-inch-diameter hole in the receiver.  It was assumed that the release would \nconsist of a mixture of 81 percent liquid and 19 percent vapor that would form an aerosol \nand initially act as a dense gas.  The release was assumed to occur at ground level (0 meter \nhigh).
