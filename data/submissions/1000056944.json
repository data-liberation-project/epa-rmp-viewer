      "SummaryText": "The United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) developed the Risk Management Program (RMP) rule (40 CFR 68) to assist facilities in preventing accidental releases of highly toxic or flammable chemicals.  The RMP established three levels of requirements for the program.  Programs 1 and 2 are for facilities that pose less risk to the environment and therefore have reduced compliance requirements.  Program 1 is designed for \"no impact\" facilities and has the fewest requirements, while Program 3 is the most stringent of the three levels.\n\n\n\nThe program level for each facility is determined by:\n\n\n\n?    Use of regulated substances in threshold quantities\n\n?    Impact of an off-site public receptor (e.g., residence, school, park)\n\n?    North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code\n\n?    Five-year accident history\n\n?    OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM), 29 CFR 1910.119 applicability\n\n\n\nThe Arkalon CO2 Processing Facility has not experienced reportable accidental releases in since the facility was built.  It operates under NAICS code 211112 which is not specified for Program 3.  However, the facility is regulated under Program 3 requirements under the applicability criteria of ?68.10 because:\n\n\n\n?    It stores a Propane Mixture (CAS 74-98-6) in excess of the threshold quantity (10,000 lbs).\n\n?    A release from this facility could impact an offsite public receptor (e.g. residence).\n\n?    It is subject to OSHA PSM because Propane is a flammable gas/liquid which is stored above the threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds.\n\n\n\nElements required by USEPA 40 CFR 68 Subparts B through H for Program 3 are presented in Sections 2 through 10 of this document and the Appendices.\n\n"
