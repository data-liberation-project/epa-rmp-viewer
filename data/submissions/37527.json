      "SummaryText": "North Manchester Farm Center RMP Executive Summary\n\nSource and Product Description\nThe Andersons North Manchester Farm Center is engaged in the handling, storage, application, shipping and receiving of agricultural fertilizers (liquid and granular), pesticides and miscellaneous farm supplies.  This facility was purchased in the spring of 1994. The facility manager is Joe Johnson and the operations supervisor is Joel Gaerte.\n\nThe facility occupies approximately 10 acres and is located five miles west of the town of North Manchester, Indiana in Pleasant Township, Wabash County.  The facility is situated north of Rt. 114 and east of Rt. 15.   There is one residence to the east, one residence across the street to the southwest and one residence to the north about a \u00bc mile away.  To the west, there is a cluster of 6 residences as well as a used car lot and a retail gas station.\n \nThe only RMP-regulated material at this facility is anhydrous ammonia.  A 30,000 gallon tank is used for bulk storage of  the material. The tank is located on the west side of the facility approximately 100 feet northwest of the office / warehouse.  When filled to the maximum 85% capacity, this tank can hold 25,500 gallons of anhydrous ammonia.  This material is a gas at ambient temperature and pressure.  It is a liquid when stored under pressure inside the tanks.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is not a poison, but it is an inhalation / respiratory hazard.  Ammonia is a toxic material but it has no cumulative toxic effects on the human body.  However, it is acutely corrosive when it comes in contact with mucous membranes, in particular.  Anhydrous ammonia is a non-flammable gas.  Anhydrous ammonia has a strong chemical affinity for water and, therefore, an abundant supply of water is our best defense against a small or large-scale ammonia release.\n\nSummary of Major Hazards\nThe principal causes of ammonia emergencies are ruptured hoses and defective valves, as indicated by the alternative release scenario.

      "SummaryText": "he most probable time for an exposure or release to occur will be during a transfer from a delivery truck to the bulk storage tank or a transfer from the storage tank to the small application tanks (aka \u00bfnurse wagons\u00bf).  Flexible hoses and fixed piping must be connected properly.  Hoses are date-stamped and replaced in advance of the expiration date or when defects are observed.  All transfers of ammonia are observed by Anderson personnel.\n\nTransfers from the bulk storage tank to the nurse wagon loading station occur inside fixed steel pipes and are manually controlled.  Flexible hoses are used to connect from the loading station to the nurse wagons. \n\nWith elevated temperatures that occur during mid-to-late summer, the ammonia gas inside the bulk storage tank can expand, and possibly cause one or more relief valves to open in order to equalize the pressure inside the tank.  The relief valve will reseal itself when pressure is relieved.  These \u00bfevents\u00bf are very short in duration \u00bf a few seconds at the most.\n\nA complete failure or burst tank, as indicated by the worst case scenario, is highly unlikely.  The ammonia tank was built under strict guidelines established in the ASME pressure vessel code.  The storage tank is protected by concrete traffic barriers.  All welding and structural work done on the tank is performed by certified welders.  \n\nExplanation of How Hazard Releases are Prevented.\nPassive mitigation refers to equipment, devices, or technologies that function without human, mechanical or other energy input.  The passive mitigation systems in place at the North Manchester Farm Center are:\n\u00bf  Bulkhead breakaway units located on the connection point to the storage tank. If a delivery truck or nurse wagon were to move before properly disconnecting from the tank, the concrete structure would cause the hose to break at a safe connection point.  At this point, active mitigation would take effect and an excess flow valve, just to the inside of the breakaway would"

      "SummaryText": "prevent the tank from emptying to the atmosphere.\n\nActive mitigation refers to equipment, devices or technologies that require human, mechanical or other energy input to function.  The active mitigation systems in place at the North Manchester Farm Center are:\n\u00bf  Excess flow valves are located on all outgoing liquid and vapor valves on the storage tank.  They close automatically if the volume of gas or liquid flowing through the line exceeds the normal flow rate.  They won\u00bft reopen until the downstream shutoff valve is closed and the pressure equalizes on both sides of the valve seat.  Two principal causes of the excess valve closing are a ruptured hose or a broken pipe or shutoff valve downstream that is opened too quickly.\n\u00bf  Back check valves are located on the truck unloading riser and are designed to ensure that the flow goes in one direction only.  This prevents anhydrous ammonia from flowing to the truck from the storage tank.\n\u00bf  Pressure-relief valves are located on the top of the bulk storage tank and fixed steel piping to relieve pressure that is too great.  This can be caused by elevated temperatures in the summer or overfilling.  They open directly to the atmosphere at 250 psig and close when the pressure inside the tank drops below this pressure.\n\u00bf  Emergency shutoff cord, located along the side of the 30,000 gallon bulk storage tank activates the emergency shutoff valves on the discharge side of the ammonia pump.  This stops the flow of ammonia by remote activation of a spring loaded valve.\n\u00bf  An ample supply of water is available near the bulk storage tanks from a 12,000 gallon water tank.  A nearby water well (120\u00bf away) could be utilized to provide water to knock down a vapor cloud.\n\u00bf  Spill control kits are located at the facility and include sorbent material, shovels, PPE and disposal containers.\n\u00bf  Anderson personnel and truck drivers supervise all anhydrous transfers to and from the bulk storage tank\n\nPrevention Program\nPreventive maintenance i"

Documentation and attendance rosters are on file at the facility.  \n\nContractors\nContractors receive a \u00bfcontractor safety review\u00bf prior to performing work at the facility.

The audits include a physical walk through of the entire facility and a review of all EPA, OSHA and DOT paperwork and training documentation.  Action items are noted and recommendations are made.

Issues are documented and assigned to employees for follow-up. Records of all meetings are kept at the facility.\n\nResponse Action in the Event of a Release\nIn the event of a burst hose or defective valve, employees are instructed to shut down the transfer process and, if possible, approach the shutoff valve from upwind and attempt to turn it off. \n\nFor an uncontainable release, employees will immediately call the police and fire department or other first responders, as appropriate.  All employees, customers and contractors are to be evacuated to an upwind location. Once the response team has arrived, we will work in concert with them to close the valves between the tank and the leak.  In the meantime, a steady spray of water will deluge the ammonia gas plume and knock it to the ground, while chemically binding any free ammonia.\n\nThe employees are instructed to make emergency phone calls in this order: 911, the facility manager, the corporate Safety Department emergency phone number, the Indiana Department of Environmental Management hotline and the Indiana Emergency Response hotline.  All applicable contact names and numbers are found in the facility spill and emergency response plan.\n\nCommunication procedures with responders \nFacility management, employees and fire department personnel will jointly discussed the location of the anhydrous ammonia and response procedures on a regular basis.
