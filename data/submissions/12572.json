New employees are trained by an experienced employee in the area of their job description.  The new employee will be expected to familiarize themselves with our safety policies and procedures through on the job training and/or written policies.\nOur location at Hoover, our primary activity is NH3 receiving, storage and distribution for sale to farmers.  We provide employees with rubber gloves, goggles and rubber suits for their safety while handling NH3.   Safety and maintenace are always stressed to keep accidents to a minimum.  We have had no accidents in the past five years.\nOur facility has a written emergency plan in accordance with osha standard 29.CFR 1910.38.  Periodic evaluations are used to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no specific recommendations for safety implementation at this time.\nThe maximum quantity of NH3 stored at this facility is 12,000 gal. which is approx. 54,000 lbs.  We have one loading bay, and receive transport loads when needed.  We keep inventories to a minimum to keep any accidental releases to a mimimum.\nThe worse case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of one tank, 54,000 lbs.  \nThe alternative relese scenario base on potential incident of breaking a transger hose is 7172 lbs."
