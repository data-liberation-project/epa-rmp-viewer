We continuously strive to assure that our workers, enibors and the enviroment are safe.\n\nMaple Leaf Farms, Inc. has developed a Crisis Management Team to prepare for any emergency which may occur at any of the Maple Leaf Farms facilities.  Maple Leaf Farms Inc. is committed to protect their employees and the people of the surrounding community.\n\nCurrently, we have just completed a process hazard analysis and are making minor modifications to the  Ammonia refrigeration process.  The Maple Leaf Farms, Inc. Executive Board is committed to making our facilities the safest plants in Indiana .\n\nThe only regulated chemical used by Maple Leaf Farms is anhydrous ammonia used in the refrigeration system.  There is approximately 21,000 lbs of ammonia within the system. At most times the system charge is somewhat lower than this number.\n\n\nAs a part of our prevention plan we have performed a worst case and alternate release scenario centered around the possibility of an ammonia release. Our worst case scenario centers around the possibility of an ammonia release from our receiver during a pumpdown situation. Our alternate release scenario is centered around a piping release on the roof.\n\nMaple Leaf Farms, Serenade Foods Division has in place a Process Safety Management / Risk Program.  As a result of the PSM / RMP Program the following procedures and policies are in place:\n     Employee Participation Guidelines\n     Employee Training\n     Contractor Qualification Guidelines\n     Pre-Startup Procedures\n     Mechanical Integrity Inspection Policy\n     Support Personnel Entry Program\n     Hot Work Permit Program\n     Management of Change Program\n     Incident Investigation Program\n     Emergency Planning and Response Plan\n     Compliance Audit Procedure \u00bf done by outside contractor\n     Dissemination/Trade Secrets Policy\n     Policy for Opening the Refrigeration System\n     Process Hazard Analysis"

Any problems are addressed and repaired as needed.\n\nMaple Leaf Farms Serenade Foods Division has not had a release in excess of 100 lbs of ammonia in the last ten years.\n\nMaple Leaf Farms and Serenade Foods have developed a joint emergency response team to deal with any accidental release of ammonia into the environment.  The team has been trained and equipment has been ordered to enable the team to set up a mobile command center which will contain the P & ID drawings for both facilities, communication equipment, decontamination equipment, tools, level A suits, SCBAS, & all emergency phone numbers.  Warsaw HazMat Team is our backup in the event of a catastrophic release or a release at night or on weekends.  They have toured our facilities and given us a hazard analysis.  We will be having drills twice yearly to familiarize the team with the equipment and procedures to be followed.\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety!\n\nMaple Leaf Farms Serenade Foods Division can only continue to be the number in safety if the Executive Group continues to support the current Process Safety Management Program which is in place. This allows are PSM / RMP team to have the freedom to make necessary improvements as they are identified.\n\nOur new maintenance manager has taken a leadership role in \"taking our program to the next level\" and has implemented a schedule to increase the awareness and safety of our facility."
