This commitment is inherent to an accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at LyondellBasell La Porte. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. If such a release does occur, our trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release. We are also coordinated with Channel Industries Mutual Aid (CIMA) which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled \n\nLyondellBasell produces several final products at the La Porte facility including methanol and syngas (which is a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen). We have two regulated substances present at LyondellBasell La Porte in quantities greater than or equal to their threshold quantities (as listed below).\n\nPropylene\n\n1,3-Butadiene\n\n\n\n3. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nLyondellBasell La Porte has taken the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68. This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, (1967 Edition). Several processes at LyondellBasell La Porte are subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.\n\n\n\nThe following sections briefly describe the elements of our release prevention program that are in place at LyondellBasell La Porte. Regarding Process Safety Information, LyondellBasell La Porte maintains a record of written safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.

The methodologies used to carry out these analyses are unit Process Hazard Analysis. The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated on an as needed basis. Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, LyondellBasell La Porte maintains written operating procedures. These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved with the processes.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\nLyondellBasell La Porte has a training program in place to ensure that employees that are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes. New employees receive basic training in process operations followed by on-the-job supervision until they are deemed competent to work independently. Refresher training is provided at least every three years and more frequently as needed.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nLyondellBasell La Porte carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper functions. Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps. Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices. Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed. Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\n\n\nManagement of C"

Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\n\n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews\n\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at LyondellBasell La Porte. These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nLyondellBasell La Porte conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented. These audits are carried out at least every 5 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner. \n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nLyondellBasell La Porte investigates incidents that have resulted in, or could reasonably result in, an employee injury or a significant release of a hazardous material. These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring. All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nLyondellBasell La Porte believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.
