The information includes materials of construction, design pressure, temperature ratings, and electrical ratings of equipment. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides the basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features are not compromised.\r\n\r\nPROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS (PHA)\r\nBelridge Cogen 32 facility has a comprehensive program to ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled. Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate safeguards are in place to manage these hazards.\r\nAera's Section 32 Cogen Facility uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations. HAZOP analysis in recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques. The analyses are conducted by a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures.

The periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating. The Cogen's 5 year PHA was conducted in 2018, and the next PHA is scheduled for 2023.\r\n\r\n\r\nOPERATING PROCEDURES\r\nAera Belridge Cogen 32 facility maintains written Operating and Maintenance procedures that address various modes of process operations. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\r\n\r\nTRAINING\r\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, Aera's facilities have implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process. New employees receive basic training in plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate (e.g. through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.\r\n\r\nCONTRACTORS\r\nAera Energy uses contractors to supplement its workforce for specialized maintenance, inspection, and construction activities.

This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazardsh, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work. In addition, Aera evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor. Plant personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\r\n\r\nPRE-START UP SAFETY REVIEW (PSSR)\r\nAera facilities conduct a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information. The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing equipment into service. The review provides one additional check to ensure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and all supporting systems are operationally ready. The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness. A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves as a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention programs are properly implemented.\r\n\r\nMAINTENANCE AND MECHANICAL INTEGRITY (MI)\r\nAera has established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems are in a safe operating condition.

Written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training. Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g. adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels). If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back in service (if possible), or a management of change team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\r\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance. Aera Operations incorporate quality assurance measures into the equipment purchases and repairs. This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\r\n\r\nSAFE WORK PRACTICES\r\nAera's safe work practices are in place to help ensure worker and process safety. Examples of these include: (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a energy control procedure to ensure the safe isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) procedures for safe removal of hazardous substances before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark producing activities (hot work), and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.

The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings. Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so reports can be reviewed during future PHA's and PHA revalidation.\r\n\r\nCOMPLIANCE AUDITS\r\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, Aera periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being im"

Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.\r\n\r\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\nThe Cogen 32 Facility Ammonia System is managed to ensure continued reliable and safe operation. The following is a description of the existing safety features applicable to prevention of accidental releases of regulated substances in the facility.\r\n\r\nSPECIALIZED SAFETY FEATURE\r\nThe Belridge Cogen facility has safety features to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) to reduce the consequences of a release. The following types of safety features are used in the covered processes:\r\n\r\nRELEASE DETECTION\r\n1.\tAmmonia fixed gas detectors are located at the Cogen Ammonia Storage area that activate deluge system on high detection limit\r\n\r\nRELEASE CONTAINMENT / CONTROL\r\n1.\tAutomated shutdown systems for specific process parameters\r\n2.\tSecondary containment for anhydrous ammonia storage\r\n3.\tRedundant equipment and instrumentation (UPS for process control system, generator, process monitoring and actuation capability)\r\n4.\tAn 8 psi overpressure Control room was installed per API 752\r\n5.\tFixed deluge system back up by fire monitors \r\n\r\nRELEASE MITIGATION\r\n1.\tFixed deluge system back up by fire monitors at the Cogen Ammonia Storage Area \r\n2.\tVideo Surveillance of loading operations\r\n\r\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\nThe Belridge Cogen facility has had an excellent record of accident prevention over the last 5 years with no reportable incidents.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\r\nAera Energy maintains a written emergency response program, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment. The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substanc"

The plans address response for credible events, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plan and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies, post incident clean up and decontamination. Primary public response agencies are Kern County Fire Department and Kern County Environmental Health.\r\nIn addition, the Cogen 32 has scheduled procedures that address the maintenance, testing, and inspection of emergency response equipment. All Aera operation personnel attend annual health and safety training which involves classroom, field simulations and scenarios. The emergency action plan is updated when necessary, based upon modifications to the facility.\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\nThe anhydrous ammonia secondary containment wall was coated and reinforced in 2021. There are no planned changes at the present time."
