Hydrofluoric acid is brought into the facility in 500 pound factory pack drums, no repackaging of this product is performed.  Therefore, the chance for an incident to occur are small and would only occur while handling the drums.  All of the warehouse employees have been trained on drum handling activities, forklift, and spill response.  No incidents have occurred at this facility.\n\nRULES AND REGULATIONS\nInterstate Chemical Company has developed an Integrated Contingency Plan which is prepared to incorporate the following Environmental Protection Agency, Occupational Health and Safety Administration, and Pennsylvania Department of Environemtal Protection Agency regulations and standards:  Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response, Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasures Plans, Oil Pollution Act, Facililty Response Plan, Recource Conservation and Recovery Act, Storm Water Pollution Plan, Preparedness Prevention and Contingency Plan, and Storage Tank and Spill Prevention Plan.\n\nThe purpose of the Integrated Contingency Plan is to provide facility personnel and emergency personnel with a systematic approach and guidance on how to prevent, manage and respond to releases, of materials into the environment.  The plan identifies the regulated materials and volumes of concern, the parties required to be notified in the event of a release of those materials, the equipement and personnel necessary to control and mitigate an incident, and the tactics and strategies in order to accomplish those tasks.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThere have been no accidents at this facility in the last 5 years.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nInterstate Chemical Company's Emergency Response Plan is part of our Integrated Contingency Plan.

If a spill of a reportable quantity were to occur we have a notification list of all regulatory agencies that would need to be notified both local and national.  We have designated employees who will be in charge during emergecny situations.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nEmployees at Interstate Chemical Company are continually monitored to assure that they handle materials safely.  Supervisors are instructed to provide additional training should a deficiency occur.  All new employees receive training prior to working in our warehouse.  \n\nTo improve the safety of the facility we have placed hydrofluoric acid kits in the warehouse and trained all the employees on the use of that product.  While it is unlikely that we will ever have an incident occur with hydrofluoric acid, we are better prepared to provide first aid should an employee ever get burned."
