Local agents for this facility are Kaid or Kris Dannenberg.  \n\nFor further information, contact: Dale Buxman, ERS Area Manager, 5701 Eureka Bend, McKinney, TX 75070 (972) 489-3154, or; Norwood Naasz, Location Manager, UAP Distribution, Inc., 415 Commercial, Downs, KS 64737 (785) 454-3305.\n\nRisk Management Plan - Executive Summary\n\n1. The Facility Policy\n\nThe owners, management and employees of UAP Distribution, Inc. are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire company and other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information - UAP Distribution, Inc. 310 1st Street, Gaylord, KS 67638 (785) 697-2729 or Downs (785) 454-3305.  This facility serves as a storage and transfer area for anhydrous ammonia.  Storage consists of 1-12,000 gl tank, plus in season, and a potential for 20-1000 gl nurse tanks and 10-1500 gl nurse tanks. \n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage of anhydrous ammonia for sale to farmers.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and transferred into nurse trailers for direct soil application.\n\nThe maximum quanitity stored would be 155,000 pounds, representing 53,000 gallons in the storage tank filled to 85% capacity per regulation, and 102,000 pounds in all nurse tanks filled to 85% capacity per regulation.\n\nOperating procedures for an emergency situation, unloading at a storage facility, and loading of ammoinia nurse trailers have been updated as of 4/19/2007.\n\n3.

The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of of the storage tank, released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 53,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards and regulation.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.1 mile.\n\nb.  The alternative release scenario based on the five-year accident history (or the most likely potential incident is a release from a ruptured hose.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 0.47 miles.\n\n4.  The accidental release prevention program.\n\nThe facility has implemented most of the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29  CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia\".  The governing regulations are put forth by the Kansas Department of Agriculture and the facility is inspected on a regular basis by company personnel, inspectors from the Kansas Department of Agriculture, and representatives of the Company's insurance carrier.  Important differences between ANSI standards and KDA regulations involve color coding of valves, installation of a bulkhead at the truck unloading point, and remote shut-offs for the storage tank(s).  \n\n5.  The Five-year Accident History \n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that: have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor  to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n   \n6.
