The facility is extremely diligent in the handling of all chemicals and is dedicated to the safety of its employees and the neighboring community. The facility staff is highly trained and utilizes log sheets and employee rounds to monitor the facility and provide safeguards, while effectively and safely using ammonia as a refrigerant. The facility has a qualified Ammonia Refrigeration Contractor to assist with their operation and maintenance. \n \nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\nThe facility has a long standing commitment to its workers and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the Ammonia Refrigeration System. The facility\u00bfs policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. \n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\nThe Ammonia Refrigeration System is used for ice making and to keep the product refrigerated.  No chemical reactions occur during the process cycle of an ammonia refrigeration system.  The operation of a refrigeration system requires controlling the ammonia (NH3) refrigerant pressure and temperature at key points in the system. The ideal cycle considers heat transfer in the condenser and evaporator without pressure losses. The refrigerant leaves the condenser as a high pressure, moderate temperature saturated liquid, and then enters an expansion valve and expands.  Past the expansion valve, the refrigerant is a low pressure, low temperature vapor as it enters the eva"

This vapor is characterized as a low pressure, low temperature saturated vapor; it leaves the evaporator and enters the compressor, where the refrigerant is compressed. The compressor compresses the vapor at constant entropy and the refrigerant becomes a superheated vapor. The super heated vapor returns to the condenser where it is condensed at constant pressure back to a saturated liquid. Heat transfer to the evaporator and from the condenser occurs with an unlimited temperature difference between the substance emitting the heat and the substance absorbing the heat. This is not true during the de-superheating process in the condenser. This refrigeration process is a closed loop system, which prevents contact with other chemicals; however, the anhydrous ammonia does come into contact with lubricating oil.  The anhydrous ammonia and the oil are compatible and no chemical reaction occurs.\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY/OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\nWorst-Case Release Scenario Results Summary\nScenario Description: Per the CalARP Regulations one worst case analysis has been defined.  The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment documentation located behind the Hazard Assessment Tab in the Compliance Workbook.  This worst case release scenario is highly unlikely to occur because of active mitigation measures that can be taken and weather conditions that are unlikely as well.\nAlternative Release Scenario Results Summary\nScenario Description: A more realistic alternative release scenario was modeled.\nThe meteorological conditions specified by regulation for alternative release scenarios were used. RMP*Comp was used to determine the maximum downwind endpoint distance.  The downwind distance for this alternative release scenario is significantly less than that for the worst-case scenario.

In addition to the safety practices of the facility and facility personnel that make this worst-case event non-credible, it should also be recognized that there are inherent analysis assumptions that make the results of the atmospheric dispersion analysis appear worse than what would actually be expected during such an event (e.g., In the event of a release, sudden rupture and flashing of ammonia would be highly turbulent.  Turbulence causes entrainment of air and the released vapor dilutes much more quickly than is shown in the model).\nIn addition to the use of conservative analysis assumptions that over-predict the effects of a potential release, other characteristics of the facility and site serve to minimize the potential risks associated with an ammonia release:\n\u00bf\tThere are process valves to permit isolation of any leaks in place without exposing anyone to the anhydrous ammonia.\n\u00bf\tThe system utilizes automatic shut-downs that would prevent a deviation from resulting in a release. \n\u00bf\tPersonal Protective Equipment (PPE) is used by plant personnel, as necessary.\n\u00bf\tThe system has ammonia sensors that automatically notify an alarm company and activate various alarms and shutdowns.  \n\u00bf\tThe machine room is equipped with an emergency ventilation system.\n\u00bf\tThe facility has an ammonia dilution tank that all relief valves are discharged into.
