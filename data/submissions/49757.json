Moody, Technical Outreach Assistant, Air, RCRA, & Toxic Division of the Environmental Protection Agency concerning Nebraska Turkey Growers Cooperatives five year update of the Risk Management Plan which was due on August 14, 2007. Nebraska Turkey Growers Cooperative is committed to our employees and surrounding community with the continuation of all areas of Risk Management and Process Safety. Nebraska Turkey Growers Cooperative continues to comply with all Government regulations to ensure 100% compliance within the Gibbon Community.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Protocols:  The owners, management and employees of Nebraska Turkey Growers are committed to providing a safe workplace free of accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  Health, safety and environmental compliance are a fundamental part of every employee?s job.  It is facility protocol to adhere to applicable Federal, State and local laws and to implement appropriate controls to prevent accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release were to occur, the facility would respond in accordance with its Emergency Action Plan and is prepared to work with the local fire department, the Local Emergency Planning Committee and other authorities to control and mitigate the release and minimize the impact of the release to employees, the environment and the general public.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled:  The primary activity at this facility is the use of ammonia for refrigeration.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and used to refrigerate product produced by this company.  The maximum potential of quantity stored at any given time is 16,000 pounds.  This poundage is split between a receiving tank and piping and the system.  The system runs at its maximum efficiency at 75%.\n\nWorst Case Release Scenario and Alternate Release Scenario:  The worst case"

      "SummaryText": " scenario would be a release of the total contents of our receiving tank which holds approximately 8,000 pounds.  The distance to the toxic end point is .04 miles.  There was one administrative control considered in this scenario; which is the tank is not filled more than 75% full.  This measure then states the worst case release would be 7200 pounds.  There was no passive mitigation measures considered.\n\nThe alternative release involves the release of ammonia from a break/rupture of numerous amounts of piping and accumulators.  The quantity released in a gas form would be approximately 5000 pounds.  The resulting distance to the toxic endpoint is .07 miles.  There were no passive mitigation measures to consider this scenario.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program Steps:  This facility complies with EPA?s accidental release prevention requirements and OSHA?s Process Safety Management Program requirements and applicable State and Local codes and regulations.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program for the primary activity at this facility.\n\n1)    Safety Information:  The facility was designed and constructed in accordance with Federal and State regulations and codes.  All plans and procedures maintained at the facility are periodically reviewed by facility management for safety updates and changes.  Material Safety Data Sheets, equipment specifications and the codes and standards used to build and operate the anhydrous ammonia equipment are maintained at the facility.\n\n2)    Hazard Review:  Facility management conducts reviews of the hazards associated with the handling and storage of ammonia.  The reviews identify the opportunity for equipment malfunctions or human errors that could cause an accidental release, the safeguards used to control hazards and prevent releases, and the steps used to detect or monitor releases.  The results of the reviews are documented and problems identified addressed in a timely manner.\n"

The procedures generally follow the provisions of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration standards.  The written procedures are reviewed by facility management on a regular basis and revised as necessary.\n\n4)    Training:  All employees participate in a training program.  Initial training for new employees consists of classroom type instruction and on-the-job supervision.  Refresher training for all employees is conducted at least once every (1) year.  The training program is reviewed by management on a regular basis and revised as necessary.\n\n5)    Maintenance:  The facility maintains written equipment inspection and maintenance procedures.  Storage and process equipment inspections are performed by qualified personnel on an approximate annual basis and are documented.  Equipment maintenance procedures follow either instruction furnished by the equipment manufacturer or vendors, Federal or State regulations.  The written procedures will be reviewed by management on a regular basis and revised as necessary.\n\n6)    Compliance Audits:  As required by RMP rule, compliance audits will be performed at least once every three (3) years.  The audit will be conducted and documented by a person knowledgeable in the safe handling of anhydrous ammonia.  Corrective actions required as a result of each compliance audit will be performed promptly and documented.\n\n7)    Incident Investigation:  Facility management will investigate each incident that results in, or could have reasonably resulted in a catastrophic release of anhydrous ammonia.  The investigation will be performed to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as corrective actions to prevent the release from recurring.  Investigation reports will be retained for a period of 5 years.\n\n8)    Process Safety Information:  The process equipment was designed and constructed in accordance with applicable "

The written procedures address the following:  technical basis of the proposed change; impact of change on safety and health; modifications to operating procedures; necessary time period for change; and, authorization requirements for the proposed change.  Employees involved in the operating process and maintenance and contract employees whose job tasks will be affected by a change in the process are trained and informed of the change prior to start-up of the process or affected part of the process.  Safety information and operating procedures are updated accordingly.\n\n14)    Pre-Startup Review:  Written modification to a new stationary source or modified stationary source is significant enough to require a change in process safety information, a review of pre-startup safety is performed.  The pre-startup safety review includes a review of the following:  construction and equipment is in accordance with design specifications, safety, operating, maintenance and emergency procedures are in place and are adequate; for a new stationary source, a process hazard analysis has been performed and recommendations have been resolved or implemented for startup; and, training of each employee involved in operating a process has been completed.\n\n15)    Compliance Audits:  As required by RMP rule, compliance audits will be performed"

The facility is also included in the written community emergency response plan developed under the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA).\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:  Nebraska Turkey Growers Cooperative is currently upgrading the ammonia refrigeration system. Phase one of the upgrade included the installation of a new receiver and two new condensers in August of 2007.  After the installation was complete the old ammonia receiver and six condensers were removed. Phase two of the upgrade will include the installation of a new pumper for Freezer 1 and coils, and piping in Freezers 1, 2, and 3. After the installation is complete the old pumper, coils and piping will be removed. Anticipated completion of Phase two is January, 2008. All areas of Risk Management and Process Safety are being followed during the upgrade with continuation of periodic evaluations to assess the safety of equipment and procedures."
