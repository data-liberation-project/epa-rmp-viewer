      "SummaryText": "A. The Harrisonburg-Rockigham Regional Sewer Authority's (HRRSA) accidental release prevention policy involves implementing all applicable program elements and procedures listed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) under 40 CFR Part 68, Risk Mangement Planning.  This is in conjunction with the implementation of the applicable elements and procedures listed by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) under the Process Safety Management Program, Part 1910.119.  HRRSA has coordinated with the Local Emergency Planning Commision (LEPC) through sumbission of information on the substances used that are above threshold quantities (as per the Tier II form, SARA Title III) and site visits by personnel from the local fire department (Bridgewater Fire Department/Rockingham County Fire Department) to familiarize them with the facility.\n\nB.  HRRSA owns and operates the North River Wastewater Treatment Plant (NRWWTP) which is an advanced treatment plant designed to treat 16.0 million gallons of wastewater per day.  The three main stages of treatment used at the plant are:  primary clarification, secondary treatment using the activated sludge method and tertiary treatment using gravity flow filters.  Located at 856 North River Road, Mt. Crawford, VA   22841, the NRWWTP serves the City of Harrisonburg, the Towns of Bridgewater, Dayton and Mt. Crawford and some sections of Rockingham County.  The plant is staffed 24 hours/day, 365 days/year by operations personnel licensed and certified in wastewater treatment operations by the state of Virginia.  As part of the treatment process, chlorine is added to the water (after all other treatment steps have been completed) and allowed to remain in contact with it for thirty minutes for the purpose of disinfecton.  Sulfur dioxide is then added at the end of the thirty minute contact time to neutralize any residual chlorine in the water.  Both chemicals are added at quantities to meet the requirements as set forth b"

The chlorine and sulfur dioxide are received from the supplier in ton containers and are stored in a separate building on the plant site.  This building is divided into several rooms in which the chemicals, safety equipment and spare parts are stored.  \n\n\nC. The accidental release prevention program at HRRSA consists of but is not limited to the following          \n     elements:\n\n          -Training of personnel in process operations, procedures and information on the chemicals.\n          -Process Hazard Analysis(PHA) to indentify and correct problems before they occur.\n          -Inspection and maintenance of equipment.\n          -Adequate inventory of spare parts for process equipment.\n          -Employee involvement in the PHA, review of operating procedures and incident investigations.\n          -Implementation of the OSHA Process Safety Management Program which paralells the Risk\n           Management Program in many areas.                \n          -Submission of Tier II information under SARA Title III to the LEPC and local fire department. \n          -On site visits by personnel from the local fire department.      \n          -Compliance audit every three years to ensure program requirements are being met.\n          -Management of Change procedures.\n          -Use of state of the art, proven process equipment.\n          -Incident investigation procedures.\n          -Annual review of operating procedures.\n\n    Chemical specific prevention steps include:\n\n          -Presence of chlorine and sulfur dioxide leak detectors.\n          -The plant is staffed 24 hours/day, 365 days/year.\n          -Availability of two \"B\" repair kits for ton containers.\n          -Wind direction indicated by the use of a wind sock located on top of the chlorine/sulfur dioxide  \n           building.\n          -Backup electrical power.\n          -Spare parts maintained for process equipment.\n         "

Five Year Accident History:  No accidental releases of chlorine or sulfur dioxide have occurred at the \n    NRWWTP in the past five years that resulted in injury or death or destruction of property on or off-site.\n\nE. Emergency Response:  In the event of an accidental release, the Authority's Emergency Action Plan   \n   would be activated, and those areas of the plant being affected by the leak would be evacuated. The\n   local fire department (Bridgewater Fire Department) and Haz-Mat unit would be called in to stop and correc the leak.  The Authority is included in the LEPC's response plan.\n\nF. Planned Changes to Improve Safety:  HRRSA is currently in the process of installing equipment to use liquid sodium hyypochlorite and sodium bisulfite and discontinue the use of ton containers of liquiefied gas (chlorine and sulfur dioxide).  This will eliminate the risk of a gas leak."
