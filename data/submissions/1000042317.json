The main building houses a processing plant used for manufacturing of frozen meals and processed foods. The products require refrigeration for the processing and freezing associated with the products.\n\n\n\n4. Worst Case and Alternative Release Scenarios: RMP*Comp was used to calculate the worst case and alternative release scenarios for the process.\n\n\n\n5. Five Year Accident History: There have been no reportable incidents during the past five years. However, the facility maintains records of all incident investigation reports regardless of anhydrous ammonia quantity released into the atmosphere.\n\n\n\n6. Planned changes to improve safety: Based on the Process Hazardous Analysis (PHA) for anhydrous ammonia, lists of action items were developed. The status of these action items will be monitored to insure that implementation of the safety improvements is accomplished.  Monthly safety training "
