              "Description": "The Butadiene Process is made up of five units as well as a Receiving, Storage, and Transfer (RS&T) process area.  The Acetylene Hydrogenation Unit (AHU) removes acetylenes from the crude butadiene feed, the Butadiene Purification Unit purifies butadiene products and byproducts, the Sponge Oil Unit recovers C4s from the Vent Gas System and depentanizer bottoms streams, the Flare and Vent Gas Systems collect off-gas for recovery and/or combustion in an elevated flare, and the Waste Water Stripper Unit removes process chemicals from the process water.  Several HAZOPs were conducted in order to cover all of the equipment in this process.  The process controls, mitigation, monitors and detection systems noted in the PHA section apply to all units except as follows: Interlocks are used in the Butadiene Purification Unit, the AHU, the Flare and Vent Gas Systems, and the W3F54 Wastewater Stripper.  Automatic shut-offs are in the AHU, Butadiene Purification Unit, and Flare and Vent Gas Systems.  The deluge system is only used on all pumps and accumulators in the BD portion of the process and on the accumulator in the vent recovery system.  The Receiving, Storage and Transfer (RS&T) process area includes the tankage, loading and unloading of all C4 Plant feed chemicals, intermediates and products including two docks for loading and unloading from barges and ships. This area also includes storage of finished product for the O&O Plant F5 Unit.",

      "SummaryText": "Texas Petrochemicals, LLC - Port Neches Operations (PNO) EXECUTIVE  SUMMARY\n\n\n\n1.  Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies.  Texas Petrochemicals Plant is committed to providing a safe, healthy and environmentally conscious work place for its associates and neighbors. The PNO Plant maintains a working OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) program, which implements a series of steps to prevent potential hazards associated with the process and assures a well-trained work force.   The PSM program further implements its policies with onsite procedures and manuals.  The EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) has been built upon this existing PSM program.   The PNO Plant participates with the Jefferson County Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC) Sabine-Neches Chiefs Association and the Port Neches Fire Department in assisting local officials in the development of emergency response plans and participates in cooperative training with them.   The facility complies with all applicable codes and standards regarding operating and equipment safety. Texas Petrochemicals has participated in the past with the Responsible Care&reg; initiative ACC and is committed to the responsible management of chemicals.   The PNO Plant Manager is responsible for implementation of the Risk Management Program (RMP).\n\n\n\n2.  The stationary source and regulated substances handled. The PNO Plant is located at the corner of Highway 136 and Highway 366 in Port Neches, Texas. The site began production in 1943 and was acquired by Huntsman in 1994 then Texas Petrochemicals, LLC in 2007.  The site produces the primary end product butadiene.  Butadiene is a monomer used in the production of butadiene rubber and various butadiene co-polymers.\n\n\n\nThe PNO Plant processes or stores volumes of a regulated flammable mixture containing the following:  1,3-butadiene, 1-butene, 2-methyl-1-butene, 2-methylpropene, 3-methyl-1-butene, 2-butene-cis, butane, ethane, isobutane, isopentane, methane, pe"

The only regulated toxic substance, in a quantity greater than the threshold amount, at the time of this submittal of the Risk Management Plan is chlorine. \n\n\n\nThe PNO stationary source is composed of two processes. They are identified as the Butadiene Process, which includes Receiving, Storage, and Transfer (RS&T), and the Steam, Power and Water (SP&W) process.\n\n\n\nThe Butadiene Process produces butadiene by extraction and distillation of crude butadiene purchased from various olefin plants. This process also produces a by-product stream (Raffinate-1). Receiving, Storage & Transfer (RS&T) consists of storage tanks, marine docks, and railcar facilities for, loading, unloading and storage of raw materials, intermediates, by-products and finished products.\n\n\n\nThe SP&W Process consists of utilities, including raw water treatment, steam boilers, wastewater treatment and cooling towers. The only part of the SP&W Process which is covered by PSM and RMP is that area which contains chlorine.  Chlorine is stored in cylinders and utilized for water treatment.\n\n\n\n3.  General accidental release prevention program and chemical specific prevention steps. Following is a brief summary of the elements that the PNO Plant has implemented to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements outlined by the EPA in the RMP Rule, as well as, with the OSHA PSM standard.  \n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe PNO Plant maintains a compilation of written safety information.  This includes information pertaining to hazards of regulated substances, the technology of the covered process and the equipment in the covered process.\n\n \n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nThe PNO Plant has performed initial process hazard analysis to comply with 29 CFR 1910.119(e) and these hazard analysis apply to processes covered by RMP.  The PNO Plant utilizes the HAZOP methodology, a recognized and generally accepted metho"
