This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nAervoe Industries Incorporated manufactures a variety of aerosol products, liquid filled containers and fuel containers for portable heating devices.  We have 5 regulated substances present at our facility.
