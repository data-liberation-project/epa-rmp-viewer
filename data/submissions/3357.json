They are transported on roads, waterways, and railways.  We at the Southeast Water Pollution Control Plant (Southeast WPCP) use chemicals too.  For example, we use chlorine to disinfect our treated wastewater to provide safe discharge to the Delaware River. Storing large quantities of chlorine can be a hazard.  We take our safety obligations in storing and using chlorine as seriously as we do providing the effective, safe treatment of wastewater.  The following document describes what could happen if there were to be an accident, the steps we take everyday to ensure a safely operating plant, and what to do in event of an emergency.  \nAccidental Release Prevention and  Emergency Response Policies\nThe Philadelphia Water Department (PWD) and Southeast WPCP accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates proven technology, trains staff on operation and maintenance practices, and uses tested management system practices.  All applicable procedures of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Prevention Program are adhered to, including key elements such as training, systems management, and emergency response procedures.  \nThis document complies with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Risk Management Program, under Section 112 (r) of the Clean Air Act (CAA) Amendments of 1990, 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68. The Southeast WPCP has a chlorination system that uses chlorine gas fed from rail cars. This document summarizes our existing health and safety programs, our internal management response team, policies, procedures, and on-going actions that are designed to prevent or minimize impacts of accidental releases of chlorine to the environment. The Southeast WPCP has prepared a detailed and comprehensive emergency response plan to handle any potential accidental releases that is desi"

To date, we have had an excellent record in preventing accidents from occurring.\nGeneral Facility and Regulated Substances Information\nThe Southeast WPCP, operating since 1954, is located at 25 Pattison Avenue in the City of Philadelphia. The plant is located on property between Interstate 95 and the Walt Whitman Bridge in South Philadelphia.  Wastewater treated at the Southeast WPCP is disinfected with chlorine and discharged to the Delaware River.  The treated wastewater meets all EPA standards. This wastewater treatment includes preliminary screening, primary settlement and treatment, secondary sedimentation and treatment, and chlorination before final discharge.  The Southeast WPCP discharges up to 168 million gallons per day (MGD) of treated wastewater, with an average flow of 112 MGD.\nThe facility currently stores chlorine, which is a regulated toxic substance under 40 CFR Part 68 - RMP.  The Plant's chlorine storage exceeds the listed threshold quantity of 2,500 pounds in the RMP Regulations.\nLiquid chlorine is brought to the plant via rail lines that enter the plant property. Chlorine leak detector monitors continuously check for leaks in the bulk storage areas and in the chlorination rooms. Other indicators include chlorine feed and evaporator alarms. These alarms are annunciated at the central and local control panels at the plant in the main control room. In the case of a leak, the storage area has an audible alarm and red flashing warning light on top of the building.  In addition, an evaporator shut-off and pressure reducing valve is designed to close if low evaporator gas temperature is detected; thus preventing liquid chlorine from reaching the gas piping system.  These valves also reduce pressure and allow for quicker liquefaction to occur.  All process related, factory-set pressure relief valves are set to protect the integrity of the equipment.\nThe rail car storage area is covered for sun protection a"

      "SummaryText": "nd the chlorination room is enclosed in the effluent pumping station building.  The chlorination room is equipped with an automatic ventilation system that activates when the chlorine leak detector detects 5 ppm of chlorine in the room.  Emergency showers and eye wash stations are provided at each building.  The rail car storage area and the effluent pumping station both have Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBAs) available.   \nThe Southeast WPCP is controlled at Pattison Avenue by a gate that is only open during normal working hours.  Visitors and contractors must check-in at the administration building and be approved by Southeast WPCP staff prior to entry into the facility.  The plant is manned 24-hours a day, year round, and alarms notify staff of any problems or situations that require follow-up investigations at all times.      \nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results\nThe offsite consequence analysis includes consideration of two release scenarios, identified as \"worst case\" and \"alternative\" release scenarios. The worst case scenario assumes that the entire content of the largest single container of chlorine is released, regardless of how improbable that may be.  In addition, only \"passive\" mitigation methods, such as buildings or dikes (for liquids) can be considered.  Passive mitigation, as defined, requires no mechanical, electrical, or human input. The regulations require that the worst case scenario assume atmospheric conditions that are conservative and result in large impact areas.\n An alternative release scenario is also required.  \nThe worst case release scenario for chlorine is focused on the 90-ton rail cars that store chlorine liquid. The scenario used for Southeast WPCP is the rupture of one chlorine rail car with a maximum capacity of 90 tons, resulting in a release of 180,000 pounds of chlorine over a 10-minute duration. The chlorine rail cars are stored in an area that is not totally enclosed, so no building mitigation factor can be applied a"

The release rate for this scenario is 18,000  pounds per minute (lbs/min).    \nThe rail car rupture resulting in a chlorine release could be caused by catastrophic events, such as an earthquake. In practice this type of total release of a rail car would be unlikely and never occur during the lifetime of the plant. The results of the dispersion modeling analysis for this worst case release scenario indicate that this scenario has an offsite impact.\nThe alternative release reflects a type of release that is more likely to occur, as compared to the worst case scenario.  Unlike the worst case scenario, the alternative release scenario may consider \"active\" mitigation, such as automatic shutoff valves and scrubbers.  Active mitigation is defined as requiring mechanical, electrical, or human input.  Lastly, the alternative release scenario assumes more realistic regional and seasonal meteorology.\nBased on the process hazard analysis performed for the chlorine system, several alternative release scenarios were selected.  Unlike the worst case release scenario, active controls can be applied to minimize the leak or impacts.  Active controls consist of mechanical, electrical, or human input.  The scenario used for chlorine was a failure of the excess flow valve on the chlorine rail car with no mitigation. Under this scenario, the amount of chlorine released was calculated to be 126.0 lbs/min. The results of the dispersion modeling analysis for the worst alternative release scenario indicate that this scenario has a slight offsite impact. \nFive-year Accident History Summary\nNo chlorine releases that could have caused safety or health hazards to any individuals at on-site or off-site locations (no deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place) occurred at Southeast WPCP during the last five years. \nSummary of the Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-specific Prevention Steps \nSoutheast WPCP is in complia"

The team consisted of process operating and maintenance experts and process design engineers.  The HA technique used was the \"What-If\" scenario and process checklist procedure, per acceptable approach guidance from EPA. The HA was lead by knowledgeable persons on the type of process being reviewed.  This review will be updated again within a five-year period, or whenever there is major change in the process.  A list of actions to resolve any found significant hazard review findings was prepared, and staff is currently working to resolve this action item list.  Staff will document completion of any action item.\nOperating Procedures\nSoutheast WPCP maintains up-to-date, accurate, written operating procedures that give clear instructions for the chlorine process. Southeast WPCP ensures effective operating practices by combining them with operating and maintenance training programs.  Standard operating procedures (SOPs) provide system descriptions, specifications, equipment inspection requirements, and operating procedures for the chlorine system.  Procedures include startup, shutdown, and normal, alternate, and emergency operation.  Also included are maintenance and troubleshooting procedures, including consequences of deviation and the steps to avoid and correct deviations.
