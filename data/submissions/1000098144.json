EOG addresses accidental release prevention through four factors:  design, training, operating parameters and regular maintenance.  Through design efforts, we have limited the public exposure.  Through training, we have prepared our personnel to respond effectively.  Limiting the operating parameters reduces the stress on process equipment.  And regular maintenance serves to prolong equipment life as well as discover potential problems before they become a safety issue.\n\n\n\nShould an accidental release of a regulated substance occur, EOG personnel will evaluate the conditions, take actions within their capabilities to minimize the risk and notify the appropriate outside agencies.\n\n\n\nFACILITY BACKGROUND INFORMATION\n\n\n\nThe Lyssy Hub is located in a rural area in Wilson County, Texas.  This facility is a natural gas dew point control plant with condensate stabilization utilizing fixed and skid mounted processing equipment as well as liquid storage tanks. \n\n\n\nMarplot indicates that there is no population within the area affected by the worst case scenario but there are two potential public receptors.  These potential public receptors are housing units located:\n\n 1.  West at 1,838', and \n\n 2.  South at 1,769'.  \n\n 3.  In addition there is seasonal activity associated with agriculture that cannot be determined.\n\n\n\nThere are no public receptors within the area of the alternate release scenario. Additionally, there are no environmental receptors in either the worst case scenario or the alternate release scenario area.\n\n\n\nGE"

The PHA systematically evaluates each process for potential hazards and then recommends change where needed.  These PHAs are revalidated every five years.\n\n\n\nThe PHA team is selected from management and employees. Members are chosen based on their knowledge in operating and maintaining the process and engineering expertise.\n\n\n\nThe Lyssy Hub considers a variety of factors when conducting the PHA using a combination of the \"What if\" and HAZOP methods for evaluating potential hazards.  Some of the factors considered are:\n\n 1.  All Process Safety Information (PSI).\n\n 2.  Cause and Effects.\n\n 3.  Human factors.\n\n 4.  Public health.\n\n 5.  Environmental factors.\n\n 6.

These procedures cover normal startup, startup after turnaround, normal operation, temporary operation, emergency operation, normal shutdown and emergency shutdown.  In addition, the procedures list operating limits, consequence of deviations and responses, safety and health concerns and  safety systems.  Lyssy uses these procedures for reference by experienced personnel and to provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.\n\n\n\nOperating procedures are reviewed and modified whenever there are changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and/or facility.  Reviewing operating procedures is an element of the Management of Change (MOC) procedure.  In addition, the accuracy of all operating procedures are recertified annually.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\n\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Lyssy Hub has implemented a comprehensive training program for employees involved in operating a process. New operational employees receive training on the Lyssy Hub's Operating Procedures, and basic training in process operations if they are not already familiar with such operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years, or more frequently upon request. All of this training is documented for each operator, including skills demonstration used to verify that the operator understood the training. Process maintenance personnel are trained in their perspective duties for maintaining the mechanical integrity of critical process equipment and "
