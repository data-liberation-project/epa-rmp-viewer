Executive Summary\n\n\n\nGarrison Energy Center (GEC) is committed to safely operating in a manner that is protective of GEC workers, the public, and the environment. As a demonstration of that commitment, GEC has developed and implemented Environmental and Workplace Health and Safety Policies to serve as guiding principles for all its employees and operations. GEC believes that following these policies is the responsibility of every employee.\n\n\n\nAs part of this commitment, GEC has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility. One component of this system is a Risk Management Program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at GEC and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR part 68, \"Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs\" (the RMP rule). One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMP Plan) describing the risk management program at GEC. This document is intended to satisfy the RMP Plan requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at GEC.\n\n\n\nThe risk management program at GEC consists of three elements:\n\n\n\n1.    A hazard assessment to help understand the potential offsite consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and a history of accidents that have occurred during the last five years associated with the use of substances regulated by the RMP rule (regulated substances) - see topics 1.3 and 1.5\n\n\n\n2.    A prevention program to help maintain and safely operate the processes containing more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance (covered processes) - see topic 1.4\n\n\n\n3.         An emergency response program to help respond to accidental releases of regulated substances from covered processes - see topic 1.6\n\n\n\nInformation further describing these elements is provided in this RMP Plan.\n\n\n\nAl"

In fact, GEC has a comprehensive safety program in place establishing various levels of safeguards against release of a hazardous substance and injuries/damage from a release of a hazardous substance.\n\n\n\nGEC limits the use of hazardous substances. Before using a hazardous substance at GEC, less hazardous alternatives are considered.  Part of GEC's RMP compliance philosophy has been the reduction of the use of hazardous substances covered under this regulation. When a hazardous substance is used, GEC considers the potential for this substance to adversely affect GEC workers, the public, and the environment and takes steps to prevent any such effects.\n\n\n\nGEC works to prevent releases of the hazardous substances used at the facility. When a hazardous substance is used at GEC, the equipment is designed, built, operated, and maintained to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release. Industry and government standards are adhered to in the design, construction, operation, and maintenance of the equipment.\n\n\n\nGEC limits damage from a release, if such a release were to occur. GEC trains workers to react quickly in the event of an accidental release, reducing the consequences of a release were to occur. In addition, GEC works with the local fire department and with the local emergency planning committee (LEPC) to help ensure that injuries and/or environmental damage will be minimized if a release does occur.\n\n\n\nThe safety program at GEC consists of a number of elements, only some of which are required by the RMP rule. This RMP Plan is primarily intended to describe those parts of the safety program at GEC that are required by the RMP rule.\n\n\n\n1.1 Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nGEC is committed to the safety of workers and the public, and the preservation of t"

While GEC believes that such releases are unlikely to occur at the Garrison facility, GEC has evaluated the offsite impact of the releases in accordance with the regulatory requirements.\n\n\n\nGEC has conducted the offsite consequence analysis for the worst-case release scenario using the EPA's guidance document and RMP*Comp that was developed to provide the highest estimate of the possible offsite consequences of such a release. The main objective of performing the offsite consequence analysis is to determine the distance at which certain effects might occur to the public because of an accidental release (called the endpoint distance). The model was developed to provide information on the estimated distance to the toxic endpoint for a chemical of concern. GEC has not conducted a more detailed analysis of these scenarios because the potential for such releases is unlikely and because more refined analysis of such events will not provide additional information that would be useful.\n\n\n\nWhile the model provides the required data to meet regulatory requirements, it does not provide detailed information on the travel time or concentration of the chemical in the plume.

Wind direction defines the direction in which the plume travels.\n\n* Temperature: Temperature is used to calculate plume rise and evaporation rates.\n\n* Atmospheric Pressure: is used to calculate gas and liquid release rates.\n\n* Atmospheric Stability: Stability is an indication of atmospheric turbulence. The turbulence is depended upon thermal (heating of the ground) and mechanical (surface roughness and wind speed) effects. Turbulence also acts to dilute the plume and reduce concentrations.

These requirements are:\n\n\n\n* One worst-case release scenario for each Program 1 process (the GEC does not have any processes meeting the Program 1 definition)\n\n* One worst-case release scenario for the class of toxic substances in Program 3 processes (i.e., one scenario representing the Anhydrous Ammonia process)\n\n* One alternative release scenario for each of the toxic substances in a Program 3 process (i.e. one scenario representing the Anhydrous Ammonia process)\n\n\n\nThe following information summarizes the offsite consequence analysis performed by GEC. 1.3.1 Program 3 Processes - Toxic Substances\n\n\n\nThe worst-case release scenario for toxic substances is the instantaneous release of the maximum onsite quantity of 10,200 gal (56,000 pound) of Anhydrous Ammonia from the storage tank. The solution evaporates and forms a vapor cloud. The Anhydrous Ammonia would be released to atmosphere over a 10-minute period.

The release would last for a duration of 10 minutes resulting in a total release of 4,120 lbs of Anhydrous Ammonia. Operators would be notified of a release by Ammonia monitors located around the tank and throughout the process area. The containment area would limit the extent of spread of the liquid Ammonia.

Program 3 requires 12 of the 14 elements of the OSHA PSM regulation, and is the most rigorous prevention program. It has been established for the Anhydrous Ammonia System. The following sections briefly describe the elements of GEC's prevention program that address the EPA RMP rule prevention program requirements.\n\n\n\n1.4.1 Program 3 Prevention Program\n\n\n\nThe GEC Program 3 prevention program, which applies to the Anhydrous Ammonia System, consists of the following 12 elements:\n\n\n\n1.    Process Safety Information: GEC maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to help ensure safe operation of the covered process. These documents address (1) physical properties of hazardous substances handled in the process, (2) operating parameters of the equipment/process (including standard operating procedures (SOPs)) and (3) design basis and configuration of process equipment.\n\n\n\nSafety data sheets (SDSs) document the properties of hazardous substances handled at GEC, including regulated substances in the covered process.

The PHA team prepares a written report describing the results of the analysis, including a list of recommendations. Responsibility to resolve the recommendations is assigned to area personnel and, when appropriate, changes to enhance the safety of the process are implemented.\n\n\n\n3.    Operating Procedures: GEC operators, process engineers and supervisors work together to develop and maintain operating procedures to define how tasks related to process operations should be safely performed. The operating procedures (1) are used to train employees and (2) serve as reference guides for appropriate actions to take during both normal operations and emergency operations.\n\nGEC personnel develop and maintain operating procedures that cover all phases of operations, including initial startup, normal operations, normal shutdown, emergency shutdown, startup following a turnaround or emergency shutdown, and temporary operations.

Mechanical Integrity: GEC maintains the mechanical integrity of process equipment to help prevent equipment failures that could endanger workers, the public, or the environment. This is accomplished by: (1) an inspection and testing program to help identify equipment deterioration and damage before the equipment fails, (2) a quality assurance program to help ensure that new and replacement equipment meet the design standards required for service in the covered processes and (3) utilizing personnel who are specially trained to maintain process equipment.\n\n\n\n6.

The program reviews the safety record of all contractors to help ensure that GEC only hires contractors who can safely perform the desired job tasks. GEC explains to the contract supervisors the hazards of the process on which they and their employees will work, GEC safe work practices, and GEC emergency response procedures.
