      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\n\n\nFacility Description\n    \nThe Coal-Fired Complex is an electrical production power plant operated by the Grand River Dam Authority (GRDA).  The facility is located three miles east of Chouteau, Oklahoma on State Highway 412.  The power plant contains two primary electric generators, referred to as Unit 1 and Unit 2.  Unit 1 was placed in commercial operation in 1981, and Unit 2 in 1986.  Each unit consists primarily of a coal combustion boiler, a steam turbine, an electric generator, pollution control equipment, and auxiliary support equipment.  Total maximum facility generating capacity is 1010 megawatts.\nCoal is transported to the facility using rail cars and trucks.  The coal is burned in a steam-generating boiler.  Steam produced in the boiler flows to a steam turbine.  The steam turbine then drives an electric generator.\nCombustion gases from each boiler contain ash, which is the mineral portion of coal not combusted to a gas.  Unit 1 has an electrostatic precipitator to remove ash before combustion gases exit a chimney.  Unit 2 has a sulfur dioxide removal system that injects lime slurry into combustion gases.  This slurry reacts with sulfur dioxide gas to form a solid.  This composite ash is then removed in an electrostatic precipitator, similar to Unit 1.  Some of the collected ash is placed in the ash storage area south of the two units, and some of the ash is sold for beneficial purposes.\nWater for the plant is pumped from the Grand Neosho River, located ? mile east of the facility.  The water is used primarily in two cooling towers, which remove waste heat from the two steam turbines.  Water is also used in various plant process equipment, again primarily for cooling or steam production in the boiler.  Sewage water from bathrooms and personnel showers flows to a total retention treatment lagoon.  After use, process water flows into settling ponds for removal of suspended solids.  Two oil/water separators are also used to insure any spil"

The implementation of this has been accomplished in a multi-layered manner using equipment system design, management oversight, extensive written procedures, and training of competent and responsible personnel.  The safety measures include the following:\n\nThe Coal-Fired Complex plant site is surrounded by an 8-foot high security (chain link) fence.  Access to the site is permitted through a gate controlled by dedicated security personnel.  Security personnel are on duty 24 hours per day, every day.  Security officers make frequent patrols, searching for unusual circumstances, including fire, spills, and alarms.  The entire power plant is completely lighted at night.  Lighting is controlled by photoelectric cells to ensure that the site is illuminated during periods of darkness.  A shift supervisor is on duty 24 hours per day, every day.  The shift supervisor has the training and full authority to direct personnel and resources to contain a chemical problem or emergency.  Operations personnel are qualified for their responsibilities using detailed checksheets.  Operators must complete an extensive set of workbooks covering fundamental science and principles of proper power plant operation.  Operators must learn extensive written operating procedures and are then evaluated by experienced supervision.  Hazardous chemicals are normally handled or managed by Results Technicians who have specialized training on the chemicals involved.  A computerized maintenance management program is used to help assure that equipment is regularly inspected and properly maintained.  Employees have been trained over accident prevention concepts and philosophy using formal programs developed by the Dupont Chemical Company.  These programs stress following procedure, "

Chlorine sensors within the building detect any leak and trigger a visual alarm on the roof.  \nThe visual alarm is within direct line-of-sight of the security guard shelter.  This shelter is staffed 24 hours per day, 365 days per year.  In addition, plant-operating personnel check the building once every four hours on the back shifts.  During the day shift, plant personnel make chlorine equipment and storage checks in the building.  Once every three months the system is checked by a manufacturer?s representative and rebuilding and replacement is accomplished as necessary.\nA chlorine repair kit for field repair of cylinder leaks is maintained on-site.  Nine individuals are trained in the proper use of the kit.  In addition, these nine individuals receive training on the safe and proper use of self-contained breathing apparatus and chlorine safety, which would allow them to enter the storage building during a chlorine leak.\nA team of 25 facility personnel, the site rescue team, receive training on the entry of confined spaces while using self-contained breathing apparatus.  These individuals are in addition to the nine previously mentioned. \nSpecific safety procedures for the unloading of aqua ammonia from a tank truck and the loading and unloading of chlorine cylinders from the delivering truck are provided to all personnel engaged in these activities. These procedures are intended to provide the personnel involved with procedures that will maximize personal safety and minimize the possibility of leaks, overfilling, and cylinder damage.
