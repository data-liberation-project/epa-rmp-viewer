      "SummaryText": "The Airgas facility in Tampa, Florida is owned and operated by Airgas South. The Facility is a chemical distribution plant, which stores, sells, and repackages industrial gases.\n\nThe Facility operates from 0600 hours to 1500 hours, Monday through Friday and is staffed with approximately 17 full time employees.  The Facility is secured with chain link fencing, locking gate, security cameras, and yard lights.\n\nIn accordance with the EPA's RMP regulations (40 CFR Part 68), the facilityA?s inventory of chemicals was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances were found to be stored in quantities above the EPA threshold quantities .  Based on the facility inventory, the following listed flammable substances are stored by the Facility in quantities above the substance's EPA threshold quantity: \n\nAcetylene gas (CAS # 74-86-2)\nPropane gas (CAS # 74-98-6)\nPropylene gas (CAS # 115-07-1)\n\nAcetylene is packaged in a variety of cylinders, including 24 pound, 12 pound, 5 pound, 1 pound and smaller.  Propylene is packaged in various sized cylinders to a maximum of 1,800 pounds.  Propane is packaged in cylinders to a maximum of 100 pounds.  All three regulated gases are filled by a 3rd party supplier.  \n\nThe maximum amount of acetylene stored at the facility is 20,000 pounds.  The maximum amount of propane stored is 20,000 pounds and the maximum amount of propylene stored is also 20,000 pounds.\n\nThe EPA requires that the facility identify, analyze and report one-worst case scenario and one alternative-case scenario representing all flammable substances held above the applicable threshold quantities.  The worst-case scenario is defined as the release of a substance which results in the greatest release to endpoint (i.e. the release of the entire contents of the largest vessel in the process, followed by a vapor cloud explosion).  For the alternative case scenario, a more realistic and generally lower amount of the substance can be assumed to be released th"

      "SummaryText": "an that considered for the worst-case scenario.  EPA-approved dispersion model, RMP*Comp, was used to estimate the end point distances for both scenarios.\n\nA worst-case release, as defined in the RMP regulations, is a release of the entire contents of the largest vessel in the process, followed by a vapor cloud explosion.  The worst-case release amount for the Tampa plant is therefore 1,800 lbs of propylene, which is the amount of flammable substance in the largest vessel filled to capacity.  EPAA?s RMP*Comp was used to calculate the distance to 1 psi overpressure for a vapor cloud explosion involving 1,800 lbs of propylene.  The print-out of the worst-case RMP*Comp modeling analysis is presented in Attachment A.  This scenario represents all flammable substances on site, as described above.  \n\nIn consultation with Tampa plant personnel and AirgasA? Safety Director, a leak in a 33-pound propane cylinder resulting from the age and fatigue of the valve apparatus was chosen as the most likely alternative-case scenario.  For determination of the endpoint distance, it was assumed that the released propane would detonate in a vapor cloud explosion.  Similar to the worst-case scenario, EPAA?s RMP*Comp was used to determine the release rate based on vessel parameters, and the release duration was assumed to be approximately one (1) minute.  The print-out of the alternative-case RMP*Comp modeling analysis is presented in Attachment A.  This scenario also represents all flammable substances on site.\n"
