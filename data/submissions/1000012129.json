Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and trained to deal with the modification prior to working with the modified process.  In addition operating procedures and associated PSI are updated as required.\n\n\n\nPre-startup Reviews\n\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at  Axiall Corporation.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nAxiall Corporation  promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance. All incidents are inputted electronically on our electronic tracking System. These incidents are shared and provide a tool for \"lessons learned\" throughout the corporation. We use the Apollo Root Cause methodology to investigate all incidents that meet the companys set criteria.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nWe believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements. Georgia Gulf developed a Safety Involvement team (SIT) and a Unit Safety Involvement Team (USIT) to increase employee involvement. Both teams provide value in Employee Participation. They focus on updating safety procedures, plant inspections, unit and plant safety issues and they are a voice to Management concerning plant safety issues.

Georgia Gulf has been recognized by the Chemical Manufacturers' Association for having Employee Involvement Programs that are \"Examples of Excellence in the Chemical Industry.\"\n\n\n\nContractors\n\nOn occasion, our company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out.   Axiall Corporation, Plaquemine Facility has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related the contractor's work and the processes.  Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\n\n \n\n4.        Five-year Accident History\n\n\n\nAxiall Corporation has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies, only three accidental release of a regulated substance that meets the RMP requirements has occurred during this period.                                                                                                                                         \n\nAt about 3:00 p.m. on April 5, 2005 an electrolytic chlorine cell failed.  The liquid level went down, chlorine and hydrogen mixed and reacted.  This caused an over pressure and damage to the chlorine gas pipe releasing 44 lbs. of chlorine over a period of 17 minutes.  There were no injuries or offsite impact.\n\nThe plant emergency response system was activated.  The plant was immediately shutdown.  Detailed Root Cause investigation was conducted.  New instrumentation was installed to aid in the early warning of loss of cell level.\n\n\n\nAt about 10:55 p.m. on April 11, 2005, while starting up a chlorine electrolytic cell circuit, a hydrogen gas detonation occurred in the hydrogen header.  There were no injuries or offsite impact and no reportable release of chemicals.\n\nThe plant emergency "
