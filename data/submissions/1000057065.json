      "SummaryText": "The facility and the regulated substance handled:\n\nHayden Station consists of two coal fired boilers.  Unit 1 is rated at 205 MW and Unit 2 is rated at 300 MW.   Hayden Station is located in a rural area of Routt County, near the town of Hayden, Colorado. Hayden Station is a zero-liquid-discharge facility and employs state of the art equipment and processes to control air emissions. The facility uses anhydrous ammonia in the selective catalytic reduction process to reduce emissions of oxides of nitrogen (NOX) Anhydrous ammonia is a toxic chemical and an uncontrolled release could be hazardous to employees and to the public. The facility stores anhydrous ammonia as a liquid under pressure in three 87,550 pound (17,000 gallon) capacity storage tanks.  Through procedural and process controls, the tanks are limited to a volume of 13,920 gallons.\n\n\n\nFacility's accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n\nThe storage and use of anhydrous ammonia necessitates a facility Risk Management Program (RMP) as well as a Process Safety Management (PSM) program. Because both programs focus on the health and safety concerns of storing and processing anhydrous ammonia, Hayden Station has developed these two programs together. Hayden is a facility that is attended 24/7. The ammonia storage and distribution system is continually monitored and visually inspected at least twice daily during operator rounds. Plant personnel have been trained to operate and maintain the ammonia system to the highest standards.\n\n\n\nXcel Energy has made a major commitment to worker safety and environmental compliance at its facilities nationwide. Comprehensive corporate guidelines govern the development of all facility safety, health, and environmental procedures. Facility employees conduct monthly safety meetings and participate in daily morning meeting to discuss upcoming evolutions, co-ordinate work objectives and discuss all out standing safety, environmental, and health concerns.\n\n\n\nGen"

      "SummaryText": "eral accidental release prevention and chemical-specific prevention steps: \n\nRelease prevention at RMEC is in compliance with EPA's Risk Management Program standard, OSHA's Process Safety Management standard, OSHA's Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia standard, and the UFC Hazardous Materials Management System guidelines. Hayden has taken several technical and administrative steps beyond those specified in the standards to prevent releases. Passive mitigation includes a secondary containment berm and redundant storage and handling equipment. Deluge systems provide active mitigation throughout the process.\n\n\n\nFive year accident history:\n\nHayden has no history of accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.\n\n\n\nEmergency response program:\n\nAll Hayden personnel are trained to the first responder / awareness level, in the emergency response plan, and facility safety and environmental procedures. Coordination with local emergency responders is accomplished through the 9-1-1 system.\n\n\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety:\n\nHayden has established Safety, Environmental, and Health procedures that will continue to improve site and public safety."
