These methods also include detailed \r\nmaintenance, inspection and emergency response plans. \r\n\r\nTerminal Freezers is a cooling business that provides freezing and cooler space for various \r\ncommodities and locally grown produce. There are 6 on site facilities which store and utilize \r\nAnhydrous Ammonia (CAS # 7664-41-7). Anhydrous Ammonia is described as an irritant and is \r\ncorrosive to skin, eye, respiratory tract and mucous membranes. It may cause burns, eye and lung \r\ninjuries, and could potentially pose a health hazard to Facility staff or public receptors in the \r\nevent of an accidental release of stored material. At this time, the maximum quantity stored is \r\n45,000 lbs. \r\n\r\nOur general prevention program includes contractor audits for compliance prior to installation, \r\nregular mechanical integrity checks, written operating procedures, incident investigations, \r\nregular safety inspections and employee training. This program includes a review of potential \r\nhazards associated with the regulated chemical at the facility, operational procedures, \r\nmaintenance procedures and employee training. Periodic safety reviews are communicated to \r\nemployees to reduce the possibility of an accidental release. \r\n\r\nBased on Company policy, safety meetings for employees are conducted on a continuing basis \r\nand ongoing safety improvements are routinely adopted. Additional employee training and \r\npreventive maintenance programs will be implemented in response to the results of internal \r\nauditing procedures, process changes, or changes in the regulated substances handled at the \r\nFacility.\r\n\r\nIn the last 5 years, there has been one accidental release"

Further, company supplied safety equipment is \r\nlocated in strategic areas and is maintained for staff who are trained in the use of this equipment \r\nin an emergency response situation. Regular drills are held to maintain a state of readiness. The \r\nprocedures for updating these procedures include an annual review which includes reevaluating \r\npotential events, such as earthquakes and fires.\r\n\r\nThe Company is currently revising the current system to augment new technology.\r\n\r\n2.\tFive-year Accident History\r\n\r\nThe Company has had one accidental release which occurred at 8:05 A.M. on October 7th, 2003 \r\nin which a 1/4' line was opened by an employee and approximately 137 lbs. of liquid ammonia \r\nescaped under pressure, which resulted in the hospitalization of the employee. There were no off-\r\nsite impacts. The maintenance employee was conducting a check for oil at the bottom of the \r\nthermosyphon for compressor #7 by opening a valve slightly to see if oil would come out. The \r\nvalve was opened slightly by the employee but nothing came out as the valve was clogged with \r\ndebris. The employee continued to open the valve and pressure cleared the debris, subjecting the \r\nemployee to a stream of liquid ammonia, burning his right forearm and causing irritation to his \r\neyes, face, throat and lungs, while he attempted to close the valve. Procedures have been \r\nchanged to include training on correct procedures for checking for oil, positioning valve stems \r\nfacing up for better access and the installation of spring return valves to prevent any re-\r\noccurrence.\r\n\r\n3.\tProgram Requirements\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\nSIC/NAIC code: 4222/493120\r\nName of regu"
