The Facility Policy.\n\n          The owners, management, and employees of Central Farmers Cooperative are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occour, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information.\n\n     -The primary activity at the facilty is the storage and blending of fertilizer for sale to farmers.\n\n     -Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for the direct application of fertilizer for crop production nutrients.\n\n     -The maximum quantity stored at the South Fork Plant location is approximately 140,000 pounds.  \n\n3. The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario.\n\n     a. The worse-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of the storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 140,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards. The distance to endpoint (point of dispertion to 200 ppm) is 2.5 miles.\n\n    b. The alternative release scenario based on the most likely potential incident is a release from a break in a transfer hose. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .83 miles.\n\n4. The accidental release prevention program.\n\n     The facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111,\" Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".\n\n5. The Five-year Accident History (either a. or b.).\n\n     -There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years.\n\n6. The emergency response progr"

Planned changes to improve safety.\n\n     Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions. There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
