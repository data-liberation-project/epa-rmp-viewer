Ploiicy.\n\n     The management and employees of Wiggins Coop Inc., New Raymer facility are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release would occur, the Wiggins Coop Inc., is working to put in place a memorandum of understanding with the local fire department, to respond to and mitigate any release thus minimizing the impact to the community and the environment.\n\n2.  Facility Information.\n\n     The primary activity at this site is that of storage for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is recieved, stored and distributed for application.  The maximum quantity handled woukd be 80,000 pounds in one vessel {30,000 gallons - 80,000 pounds}.\n\n3.  The Worst Case Release Scenerio and the Alternate Release Scenerio.\n\n     The worst case scenerio would be the release of the total contents of the storage vessels, released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity release would be 80,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the storage vessel at 85% capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint {point of dispersion to 200 ppm} is .94 miles.\n\n     The alternate release scenerio is based on the likely potential incident, which is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint {point of dispersion to 200 ppm} is .78 miles.\n\n4.  The Accidental Release Prevention Program.\n\n     The Wiggins Coop Inc., has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\", K-61.1, published by the American National  Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Department of Labor, Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.\"\n\n5.  The Five-Year Accident History.\n\n     There has been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or "

The Emergency Response Program.\n\n     The Wiggins Coop Inc., New Raymer facility has a written emergency action plan in accordance with OSHA's {29 CFR 1910.38}.  The Wiggins Coop Inc., has provided to the Colorado Emergency Planning Commission and the Weld County emergency planning committe the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III {EPCRA}.  The Wiggins Coop Inc., has trained our employees and  is working with the New Raymer Fire Department to develope a response plan in accordance with OSHA's Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response.\n\n7.  Planned Changes To Improve Safety.\n\n     Safety improvement is an on-going processs at the facility.  Periodic evaluations {at least annually} will be preformed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
