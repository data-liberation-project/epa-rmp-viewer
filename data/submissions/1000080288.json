They are transported on roads,\r\nwater, and railways. We at the Dallas Water Treatment Plant (Dallas WTP) use chemicals, too. For example,\r\nwe use chlorine to disinfect our water to provide safe drinking water to the citizens of Dallas. Storing large\r\nquantities of chlorine can be a hazard. We take our safety obligations in storing and using chlorine as seriously\r\nas we do providing the community with safe, disinfected drinking water. The following document describes\r\nwhat could happen if there were to be an accident, the steps we take everyday to ensure a safely operating\r\nplant, and what to do in event of an emergency.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nThe City of Dallas accidental release prevention policy involves proven technology and staff that has been\r\nwell trained on operation and maintenance practices. All applicable procedures of the U.S. Environmental\r\nProtection Agency (EPA) Prevention Program are adhered to, including key elements such as training, systems\r\nmanagement, and emergency response procedures.\r\n\r\nThis document complies with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Risk Management Program,\r\nunder Section 112 (r) of the Clean Air Act (CAA) Amendments of 1990, 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR)\r\nPart 68. The Dallas WTP has a chlorination system that uses chlorine gas fed from liquid chlorine storage\r\ncontainers. This document summarizes our existing health and safety programs, our internal management\r\nresponse team, policies, procedures, and on-going actions that are designed to prevent or minimize impacts\r\nof accidental releases of chlorine to the environment. The Dallas WTP has prepared a detailed and\r\ncomprehensive emergency response plan to handle any potential accidental releases that is designed to\r\nsafeguard both on- and off-site people.

The plant, located on an acre of property, is about 1.2 miles\r\nwest of the city limits of Dallas. Water is supplied to the plant via Rickreall Creek from Mercer Reservoir.\r\nWater from the plant services Dallas and Ellendale Water District. Treatment processes used at the plant\r\ninclude preliminary screening, flocculation and settling, sand bed filtration and chlorination. The Dallas WTP\r\nproduces 8.5 million gallons per day (MGD).\r\nThe facility currently stores chlorine in two, 1-ton steel storage tanks containing a maximum in each tank of\r\n2,000 pounds of chlorine. The facility has the capacity to hold three more 1-ton containers, but seldom does\r\nso. This chlorine storage exceeds the listed threshold quantities in the RMP regulation.\r\nChlorine gas is injected from chlorine containers into a solution that is used in a variety of plant processes,\r\nprimarily for final effluent disinfection. Gaseous chlorine, pulled from a storage container by an ejector, flows\r\nthrough chlorinators that control and measure the flow of gaseous chlorine. The gaseous chlorine is mixed\r\nwith plant effluent water, and the solution is distributed to several locations in the plant. Chlorine leak\r\ndetectors continuously monitor for leaks in the bulk storage area and in the chlorination room. Other alarms\r\ninclude feed and evaporator malfunction and low bulk storage tank weight. These alarms are annunciated at\r\nthe chlorine control panel, as well as, in the case of a leak an audible alarm and red flashing warning light on\r\ntop of the building.\r\nThe bulk storage tanks and the chlorinators are enclosed in separate rooms. Each room is equipped with a\r\nventilation system. Emergency showers and eye wash stations are provided outside the stor"

The plant is manned\r\nduring the day, year round, and alarms notify on-call staff during off-hours of any problems or situations that\r\nrequire follow-up investigations. Security cameras provide 24-hour surveillance.\r\nThe chlorination facilities are also provided with emergency generators. These generators are started\r\nmanually after a power loss and will supply power to the leak detectors, lighting, and ventilation systems.\r\nNo chlorine releases that could cause a safety or health hazard (no deaths, injuries, property or\r\nenvironmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place) occurred at Dallas WTP during the last five years.\r\n\r\nSummary of the Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nDallas WTP is in compliance with Federal and State Process Safety Management (PSM) requirements.\r\nChemical specific prevention steps include availability of self-contained escape breathing apparatus, should a\r\nleak occur when changing chlorine supply tanks, awareness of the hazardous and toxic properties of chlorine,\r\nand the presence of chlorine detectors and alarms.\r\n\r\nDallas WTP accidental release prevention program is based on the following key elements:\r\n\r\n1) Comprehensive safety process information that is readily available to staff, emergency responders, and\r\ncontractors.\r\n2) Comprehensive preventive maintenance program.\r\n3) Use of inherently safe vacuum supply system in which pipe component leaks bring air into the system rather\r\nthan discharging chlorine to atmosphere.\r\n4) Completed a process hazard analysis of equipment and procedures with operation and maintenance staff\r\nparticipation and review.\r\n5)"

The results of the audit are\r\ndocumented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate enhancements to the prevention program are\r\nimplemented.
