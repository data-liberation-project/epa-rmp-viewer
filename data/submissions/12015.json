The facility has been in existence since the mid 1950's.The facility uses anhydrous ammonia as the refrigerant for the vacuum tube precoolers and for the cold storage facities. there is approximately 15000 lbs. of liquid ammonia on sight in various containment vessels. there are three separate refrigeration systems utilized at this facility. One systems provides refrigeration to a newer cold storage building with a roof mounted refrigeration units. Another systems is a systems fully enclosed at ground level and cools three smaller cold rooms. The other system is portable and provides refrigeration to two cold rooms, and two vacuum tube precoolers.                                                                                  NewStar as a company, and its managers. approach chemical safety in a serious and concerned manner. A hazard analysis has been conducted to identify the possible hazards associated with the use of anhydous ammonia as a refrigerant and the likely consequences of those hazards when an accidental release might occur. Consequences of these type of events range from small releases such as leaks from packings or seals, medium releases such as pressure relief valves popping, to catastrophic releases resulting in large quantities of refrigerant release such as a transfer hose coming loose. NewStar has various programs in place such as written operating and maintenance procedures, documentation of maintenance, emergency response programs and evacuation and notification processes. Operation of equipment is done by experinced operators, Maintenance and repairs is performed by journeyman technicians and contractors.
