These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/ exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs). Other chemical-specific information includes maximum intended inventories of chemicals, information on inadvertent chemical mixtures that could occur and their associated hazards. The Plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment, which include information on materials of construction, piping/instrumentation diagrams, relief systems design, as well as others.  This information is provided to maintain safe operations at the facility.\n\nThis information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.  PSI is updated through the Management of Change Program, as are the operating specifications.  The entire system is audited every three years.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nThe Plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe Plant uses some or all of the hazard evaluation techniques outlined in the American Institute of Chemical Engineers publication Guidelines for Hazard Evaluation Procedures to perform these evalua"

PHA team members include employees with expertise in the following areas: technical, staff engineering, operations, maintenance, safety, and PHA methodology.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes recommendations for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. \n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to plant management for resolution.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.  All PHA team recommendations are tracked until they are completed.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the PHA team updates and revalidates each PHA every five years.  These periodic reviews are conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) initial startup, (2) normal startup, (3) normal operation, (4) normal shutdown, (5) emergency operations, (6) emergency shutdown, (7) temporary operation, (8) preparation for maintenance procedure, (9) quality assurance, and, (10) inadvertent mixing.  \n\nThe specific instructions include the applicable safety precautions and appropriate information on safety implications.\n\nThese procedures provide guidance for experienced operators and a basis for consistent training of new operators.  \n\nOperating procedures are reviewed and updated annually by the Manufacturing Department to verify current status.

The Plant produces a wide range of synthetic rubber products manufactured by the solution polymerization process.\nTwo flammable substances and one toxic substance are covered under the Accidental Release Program (ARP).  The two flammable substances are 1, 3-butadiene and 2-butene-cis.  The toxic substance is boron trifluoride.\n\nMANAGEMENT SYSTEM FOR PROCESS SAFETY/RISK MANAGEMENT\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Lake Charles Plant. The processes at the plant that are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency\u00bfs (EPA\u00bfs) Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration\u00bfs (OSHA\u00bfs) process safety management (PSM) standard.  Therefore, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.  The Prevention Program questions found in section 7 of the Risk Management Plan Data Elements submittal have been answered assuming that, for this initial RMP submittal only, they apply to OSHA 29 CFR Part 1910.119.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nOpen communications are encouraged between supervisors and employees regarding all safety and health issues.  There are various levels of responsibility taken by different employees, including the facility manager, safety coordinator, department managers, first-line supervisors, and all employees.\n\nThe Plant actively seeks employee involvement in the development and conduct of all accident prevention activities through the appropriate existing safety programs.  Accident prevention is discussed at the regularly scheduled safety meetings and/or during special training sessions if necessary.  Employees are encouraged to discuss accident prevention with their supervisors if they have questions,"

Training includes emphasis on specific safety and health hazards, emergency operations, and safe work practices applicable to the job.  This training must be passed through oral or written testing and the employee must demonstrate and verify that they understand the required operating procedures before they are allowed to operate the unit alone.  \n\nIn addition, all operators receive refresher training at least every three years.  This refresher training on the operating procedures is to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  Additionally, more frequent training will occur upon the request of the employee.  The appropriate frequency of training is decided by management in consultation with the employees involved in operating the particular process.  All of this training is documented for each operator including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nContractors\n\nThe Plant uses contractors for selected maintenance, construction, and engineering service support activities.  The Lake Charles Plant evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the Lake Charles Plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards of their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency,  (5) understand and follow site specific safety rules, and"

Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tag out procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous and toxic substances before process piping and equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work), and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.  \n\nThese procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\nManagement of Change\n\nThe Plant has a comprehensive system of written procedures to manage changes to all covered processes.  The purpose of this system is to ensure that process changes maintain or enhance the safety, environmental, and technical integrity originally designed into the Plant.  This system requires that changes to items such as chemicals, process equipment, technology (including process-operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  \n\nPrior to changes being made, they are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.

In addition operating and maintenance personnel, including contractor employees, are notified and provided any necessary training on the change.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nThe Plant promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to gather the facts, determine the root cause, and develop corrective action to prevent the reoccurrence of the incident or a similar incident. \n\nThe investigation team documents its findings in a report.  The report includes dates of the incident and investigation, description of incident, factors contributing to the incident.  The team develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards this report to the plant management team for resolution.  Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHA\u00bfs and PHA revalidations.\n\nCompliance Audit\n\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the Plant periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.  Compliance audits are conducted at least every three years.  The audit includes an evaluation of the design and effectiveness of the PSM system.  \n\nThe audit team develops findings in a report that is forwarded to plant management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked and documented until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent compliance audit reports are retained.\n\nCHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe processes at the Plant have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.

      "SummaryText": "accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to the RMP-covered process at the Lake Charles Plant.  Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.  In addition to the accident prevention program activities the Plant has safety features on many units to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a \nrelease, and, (3) reduce (mitigate) the consequences of a release.  The following types of safety features are used in various processes:\n\nRelease Detection\n\n1.  Sensors with audible alarms are located to detect and warn of leaks.\n2.  Video cameras are located in the facility, which assist with leak detection.\n3.  Operators perform visual walk arounds of operating areas.\n\nRelease Containment/Control\n\n1.  Pressure relief valves on applicable tanks.\n2.  Key manual valves are chained and padlocked in their critical (open/closed) position.\n3.  Excess flow check valves in selected operations to limit releases.\n4.  Dikes are utilized around applicable vessels.\n5.  Water deluge systems are utilized at points within the facility to assure the ability to suppress releases.\n6.  Atmospheric scrubbers are utilized to reduce emissions/releases.\n\nRelease Mitigation\n\n1.  Standard operating procedures that control, isolate, and terminate leaks.\n2.  Personnel trained in emergency procedures.\n3.  Personal protective equipment (e.g., escape respirator, self-contained breathing apparatus, and supplied air breathing apparatus).\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe Plant has an excellent record of accident prevention over the past five years. There has been no RMP defined incident involving a regulated substance.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe Plant maintains a written emergency response program, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance,"

      "SummaryText": "including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.\n\nThe overall emergency response program for the Lake Charles Plant addresses personnel, planning, resources, communications and alliances.  Firestone has an emergency response team consisting of employees representing various units in the plant.  This team has been trained in hazardous materials, confined-space rescue and medical training.\n\nPlanning has been developed in coordination with the Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC) and Mutual Aid as well as neighboring companies and communities.  The Plant has the resources to respond to emergencies immediately; these include equipment, materials and additional labor.  Fire water pumps, dry chemicals, foam, emergency vehicles, rescue equipment, spill control/cleanup material and water are available on-site for immediate use.  Firestone has an alliance with the LEPC and Mutual Aid if additional equipment or personnel is needed.\n\nAn internal public-address system is in place to allow communication with employees to address a variety of conditions that may need their response.  Communication with the public is done through the Community Awareness Emergency Response (CAER) sirens and the local broadcast media.  There is also a 24-hour community information line, access to the Emergency Call System (ECAL) of the Calcasieu Office of Emergency Preparedness and use of a dedicated emergency radio signal.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nFirestone is committed to continuous improvement in safety for its workers, the public and the environment.  The Lake Charles Plant has a number of active programs (as outlined in the section above entitled MANAGEMENT SYSTEM FOR PROCESS SAFETY/RISK MANAGEMENT) to identify opportunities for improvement."
