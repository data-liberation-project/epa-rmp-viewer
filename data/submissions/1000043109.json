The system, consisting of vessels, piping, valves, and process equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration to accommodate the storage and production of wine products.  \r\n\r\nSenior management at the facility is not only committed to offering superior service, but also to maintaining a safety and environmental program to promote a safe environment for all employees and the surrounding communities.  Senior management administers the safety and environmental policies and programs.  These programs include but are not limited to forklift safety, hazard communications, lockout/tagout, Hazardous Materials Emergency Business Plan, employee safety manuals, manufacturers' documentation, Emergency Action Plan, as well as the Risk Management Plan.\r\nThe Wine Group - McFarland facility has independently coordinated emergency response efforts with the local Fire Department.  In the case of an ammonia related emergency, it is the policy of The Wine Group - McFarland to evacuate the employees and to allow the fire department/HazMat team to respond to the emergency. If an ammonia release could potentially impact the local community, a Community Notification Plan would be activated. If an ammonia release were to extend into the neighboring community, a Shelter In Place plan would go into effect.  \r\n\r\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\r\n\r\nThe Wine Group - McFarland facility is located at 31795 Whisler Road in McFarland, CA.

The refrigeration system, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, and then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration to accommodate the storage and production of wine products.\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nThe Wine Group - McFarland ammonia system has many safety features.  Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system. \r\n\r\nThe Process Safety Management program ensures that all security and safety procedures are addressed.  The staff at the facility is trained in operation, maintenance and emergency procedures related to the operation of the ammonia system.  All pressure vessels in the ammonia system are equipped with relief valves that vent to the atmosphere at a certain pressure set point. A preventative maintenance program assures that equipment is maintained and serviced on a regular schedule and that worn, aging, or defective components are replaced as required to maintain equipment in good operating condition.  Controls and safety devices are inspected regularly to ensure proper operation.\r\n\r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nBetween April 2009 and April 2014, there have been no releases of a regulated substance from covered processes that meet specific EPA criteria for the Five-Year Accident History.  Such RMP accidents would involve serious accidents with either onsite deaths, injuries, or significant damage; or known, off-site deaths, injuries, property damage, or environmental damage. The"

We have been diligent in reporting releases of hazardous materials and internally investigate and correct the causes of such releases.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe Wine Group - McFarland facility has an Emergency Action Plan (plan) in effect. This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\r\n\r\n  1.) To save lives.\r\n  2.) To minimize and avoid injuries.\r\n  3.) To protect the environment.\r\n  4.) To minimize property damage.\r\n\r\nThe Wine Group - McFarland facility maintains a safety committee whose members include the designated Emergency Coordinator for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures, which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM, RMP, and CalARP regulations, as well as to incorporate facility changes.\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nThe Process Hazards Analyses (performed separately for each system), including a Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) study and a Facility Inspection, provided mitigation measures to improve safety at The Wine Group - McFarland facility located at 31795 Whisler Road in McFarland, California. The Wine Group - McFarland safety committee is planning to complete several items over the next year, as a continual effort to provide a safe work environment for their employees.  These changes include the following items:\r\n\r\n1. Continue to train all employees in the facility safety plan/programs.\r\n2. Continue to have employee involvement in safety plan development.\r\n3. Continue employee involvement through safety team participation.\r\n4. Continue internal and extern"
