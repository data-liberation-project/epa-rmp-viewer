If any such release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, of which myself and one other employee are members of, or any other authority, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n 2)  Facility Information.\n\n      The primary activities at this facility is the storage, blending, and custom application of fertilizers for sale to growers in our area.\n\n      Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application only for crop production needs.\n\n      The maximum quantity stored would be 71,500 pounds in our single 18,000 gallon storage tank.  All of our product is received by truck only with no capabilities of rail tank car unloading.\n\n 3)  The worse-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario.\n\n       a.  The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the entire contents of a storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 71,500 pounds, which represents the volume of our storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 9/10 of a mile.\n\n       b.  The alternative release scenario based on the five-year accident history (or the most likely potential incident) is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .56 miles.\n\n 4)  The accidental release prevention program.\n\n       The facility has implemented the provisions of Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrou"
