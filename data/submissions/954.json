Box 486\nBeloit, KS  67420\n\n\nFor further information contact:  Eugene Baird, Plant Manager\n\nRisk Management Plan - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n  1.  The Facility Policy\n\n    The owners, management, and employees of Boettcher Enterprises Hunter are\ncommitted to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an\naccidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire\ncompany, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the\nrelease to people and the environment.\n\n  2.  Facility Information\n\n    - Boettcher Enterprises Hunter, First St., Hunter, KS  67452, (785)529-2666\n       East side of Hunter, just north of first street.\n    \n    - The primary activity at the facility is the storage of fertilizers for sale to farmers.\n\n    - Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application.\n\n    - The maximum quantity stored would be 53,000 pounds in our 12,000 gallon\nstorage tank.  \n\n  3.  The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario.\n\n    a.  The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a\nstorage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be\n53,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent\ncapacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion\nto 200 ppm) is 1.63 miles.\n\n    b.  The alternative release scenario based on the five-year accident history (or the\nmost likely potential incident is a release from a pipe leak.  The distance to the endpoint\n(point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 0.47 miles.\n\n\n  4.  The accidental release prevention program.\n\n    The facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the\nStorage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American\nNational Standards Institute, I"

The Five-year Accident History \n\n    There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five               \n    years that:\n         - have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the           \n           facility; nor\n         - to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations,       \n           sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n  6.  The emergency response program.\n    \n    - The facility has:\n\n    a.  a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR\n        1910.38;\n\n    b.  provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community\n        right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\n    c.  a written emergency response program, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29\n        CFR 1910.120, including pre-emergency planning and employee training.\n\n  7.  Planned changes to improve safety.\n\n    Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are\nperformed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific\nanhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
