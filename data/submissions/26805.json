Applicable SIC Codes for the Geismar Complex include 2819, 2873, and 2874.  Regulated substances on site above the threshold quantity include ammonia, chlorine, and oleum.  The Geismar Complex is subject to the requirements of Program 3 as stated in 40 CFR Part 68.12 because of the SIC Code applicability.  The facility is also subject to the requirements of the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard, 29 CFR 1910.119.\n\nPCS employs numerous systems at the Geismar Complex designed to prevent the occurrence of accidental releases.  The foundation of the prevention program is strict adherence to the OSHA PSM Standard, which is an ongoing program at the facility.  Additionally, the implementation and updating of operational, maintenance, safety, and environmental procedures designed to prevent accidental releases are an integral component of operations at the facility.\n\nIn the event of an accidental release, the Geismar Complex has a proven emergency response plan that would be implemented to mitigate potential environmental damage and minimize chemical exposure to employees, the public, and the environment.  Employees trained in emergency response activities are on site 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.\n\nThe worst case scenario (WCS) for the Geismar Complex is the release of the entire contents of the refrigerated ammonia storage tank.  This scenario would result in the release of 44,000,000 pounds of ammonia into a secondary containment area.  The modeled distance to endpoint is 4.34 miles from the tank.  The alternate release scenarios (ARS) or those incidents more likely to occur, involve the release of ammonia from a pressure safety valve (PSV), the rupture of a one-ton"

Estimated distances to endpoint for the ARSs are 0.19 miles, 1.3 miles, and 0.43 miles, respectively.  Flammable substances in excess of the threshold quantity are not kept at the facility.\n\nPCS has implemented, and will continue to improve, numerous programs designed to reduce the occurrence of accidental releases.  Improved operational controls, installation of emergency control devices, enhanced monitoring, and employee awareness training have resulted in reducing accidental releases and permit violations by over 90% since 1996.  The Geismar Complex has had two accidental release in the previous five-year period that resulted in offsite sheltering in place.   Incidents that occurred in the previous five years that exceeded the reportable quantity for ammonia, but for which no offsite impact occurred total 37.  No reportable quantity releases of chlorine or oleum have occured in the previous five years.
