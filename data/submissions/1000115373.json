The product that comes to the facility for pre-cooling and short-term storage is on site anywhere from 1-6 days. The facility is a seasonally operated plant with product harvest periods picking up in the month of October and finishing in July. The remaining months see little fresh product; however, the refrigeration equipment is still operative. Major maintenance is performed during these slower months. Operational maintenance is performed on a year-round basis. Company policy requires appropriately pre-qualified personnel to perform maintenance tasks.\n\nThe Regulated Substance in use is Anhydrous Ammonia, CAS #7664-41-7, which is used in a single closed-loop mechanical refrigeration system. Refrigerating equipment consists of Compressor Units, Evaporative Condenser, Pressure Vessels, Room Evaporators, Portable HydroVac Vacuum Tubes, Pressure Coolers, Pumps, and associated valves, instrumentation, and piping. Pressure and temperature controls are installed in accordance with appropriate standards, including isolation and overpressure safety relief valves. Pressure relief valves terminate at an Ammonia-Water Diffusion System which protects these valves from venting directly to atmosphere. \n\nAn automated refrigeration control, monitoring and alarm system automatically monitors the system.

The Company endeavors to execute this policy through the daily implementation of its Safety Programs. Company safety programs include but are not limited to a comprehensive Process Safety Management Program (PSM), which is an integrated approach to the safe operation of processes using Regulated Substances. The PSM Program is specifically designed and intended to prevent accidental releases, and to deal safely with emergencies if and when they do happen. It is the goal of the company to protect its employees, visitors, and neighbors from harm due to Company operations.  \n\nA Non-Responding Facility policy has been adopted. However, the Company recognizes the need to be prepared to safely deal with emergencies. A Hazardous Material Business Plan consistent with Emergency Action Plan requirements has been developed and includes emergency procedures, requirements, and information necessary to notify public response agencies and technical resources. The Staff communicate to the Fire Department and evacuate (or shelter-in-place) if there is a release situation or fire. Managers and employees would also shepherd visitors (truck drivers receiving product or delivering product). By effectively determining all persons are safe, the Fire Department can more swiftly manage the tactical part of a response. It is the policy of the company that no-one shall respond to an emergency in a way that is beyond his or her level of training and responsibility.\n\nThe facility is supported by Western Precooling Systems (WPS) for ammonia refrigeration maintenance needs.
