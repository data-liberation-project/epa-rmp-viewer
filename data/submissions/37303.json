      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY - KFO Kennewick Area\n\n1.  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nAgrium?s ?Kennewick Fertilizer Operations (KFO)? is comprised of three facilities known as the Kennewick, Hedges, and Finley Areas.  The Kennewick Area handles anhydrous ammonia and aqua ammonia that are considered hazardous materials and are regulated substances under the Federal Accidental Release Program (ARP) and are considered in this Risk Management Plan (RMP).  The properties of these chemicals make it necessary to observe safety precautions in handling them to prevent human exposure, and to reduce the threat to the facility?s workers and nearby members of the community.  It is the facility?s policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State of Washington rules and regulations.  The prevention of accidental releases depends on adherence to the procedures used to handle anhydrous ammonia and aqua ammonia; the safety devices and systems designed and constructed into the facility; and the training of the pertinent personnel.  The various programs and documents are found in the facility?s comprehensive loss control system.\n\n2. Description of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\nAnhydrous ammonia, limestone and solid prilled or granular urea are the raw materials used to manufacture nitric acid, ammonium nitrate, UAN-32, AN-20 and CAN-17 at the Kennewick Area.  The anhydrous ammonia supply for the Kennewick Area is either transferred to the Kennewick Area via pipeline from the Finley Area, or off-loaded from railcars.  Anhydrous ammonia is stored in Sphere V-441 and in five smaller temporary storage cylinders.  Sphere V-441 is a spherical pressure vessel 65 feet in diameter that is designed to store liquid ammonia.  Sphere pressure is controlled by the sphere compressor system or by venting ammonia vapor to the Plant 9 ammonia system to make nitric acid.  The sphere compressor draws ammonia vapor from the vapor space in the sphere and comp"

      "SummaryText": "resses the vapor to a higher pressure.  The high-pressure vapor is condensed to liquid ammonia in a heat exchanger, using cooling water and returned to the sphere.  The temporary storage cylinders are used as pressure vessels for distribution of liquid ammonia to the various operating units.\nAn intermediate process stream of Aqua ammonia is generated in the Kennewick Area when the blow-down vaporizer liquid from the nitric acid plant ammonia feed system is collected.  This dilute aqua solution is consumed by pH correction during the production of UAN-32 fertilizer solution.\n\n3. Administrative Controls\nAdministrative controls are in place to prevent accidental releases.  Additional administrative controls exist to minimize the amount of anhydrous ammonia and aqua ammonia released and to limit the travel distance for each reported scenario if an accidental release were to occur.  These controls are inherent in the operational procedures for the equipment, processes and systems that use anhydrous ammonia and aqua ammonia, and are part of the training provided to the operators of these processes and systems.\n\n\n4. Mitigation Measures\nMitigation measures to limit the travel distance for each reported scenario exist that minimize the amount of anhydrous ammonia and aqua ammonia released to a minimum, if a release were to occur; and to preferably prevent a release from occurring.  The mitigation measures are inherent to the design, inspection, testing, and maintenance of the processes, systems and related equipment and components that use anhydrous ammonia and aqua ammonia.\n\n5. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\nThe facility complies with all applicable federal and state codes and regulations.  There are safety meetings and safety training.  The Process Safety Management (PSM) program is one part of the comprehensive loss control system implemented at the facility that address anhydrous ammonia and aqua ammonia processes and"

      "SummaryText": " systems.  The implementation of PSM, Administrative Procedures and Safe Work Practices represent the facility?s main active commitments to an accidental release prevention program.\n\n6. Five-year Accident History\nThere have been no qualifying accidents in the previous five-year history of this facility to be reported in this RMP.\n\n7. Emergency Response Program\nThe details of the Emergency Response Program for regulated chemical processes at the facility are contained in two documents.  One is the Emergency Preparedness Action Plan (EPAP) that contains all of the emergency response program elements.  It is intended to be a compliance, reference and training guide.  The other is the On-Scene Incident Management Guide, a field guide for response actions based on the chemical involved.  This guide is for use by response personnel while responding to an emergency event.  The Emergency Response Program incorporates public notification and alert systems and procedures for notifying personnel at the facility to shelter-in-place or to evacuate as required.  Both the shelter-in-place and evacuation procedures have designated assembly areas and personnel accounting methods included.  The facility has qualified emergency response teams trained in accordance with HAZWOPER 29 CFR 120.  The facility conducts internal emergency drills and joint drills with the Fire Department.\n\n8. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\nCurrent applicable codes and regulations are continually reviewed as part of the PSM program to determine if specific commitments need to be made to achieve increased operational safety for the regulated chemical processes and systems.  These commitments include prevention and mitigation measures for accidental releases of the regulated substances."
