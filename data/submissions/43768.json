      "SummaryText": "RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nAMAIZING ENERGY, LLC\n\nAmaizing Energy, LLC is a newly constructed facility.  Many of the reports and information have only recently been developed.  Given that Amaizing Energy, LLC is a new facility, there has been constant review and revisions to reports and information prior to the start up of the facility.  On the same note, there has never been a change in management.  The management is new and therefore, the new management was implemented with the construction of the facility. \n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Response Policies:\n\nAmaizing Energy, LLC has a commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated in the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel as well as considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility.\n\nAmaizing Energy, LLC's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, plant personnel will respond to contain the release as necessary.\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances:\n\nAmaizing Energy, LLC ethanol plant is located on West US Highway 30, southeast of Denison, Crawford County, Iowa.\n\nThe facility operates 24 hours per day, 7 days per week for the purpose of manufacturing fuel grade ethanol from grain.  The regulated substances under the RMP program are natural gasoline (denaturant), and anhydrous ammonia.  Amaizing Energy, LLC has determined that the radius of impact from a worst-case toxic release would be about 5.6 miles; due to the amount of ammonia stored onsite.  In addition, the radius of impact from a flammables release/explosion would be about 0.5 miles; due to the amount of denaturant stored onsite.  \n\nOff-site Consequence Analysis Results:\n\nThe worst case toxic scenario at the facility is the release of all 97,200 pounds of ammonia creating a toxic cloud.  The worst-case scenario is based"

      "SummaryText": "on the release of all ammonia stored on site.  The worst case vapor cloud endpoint is approximately 5.6 miles from the center of the plant.  Rural residence homes are located within this 5.6 mile radius, as are other public receptors, such as schools and parks.\n\nThe worst-case flammable scenario at the facility is the release of 560,000 pounds of denaturant creating a vapor cloud explosion.  The worst-case scenario is based on a release from entire denaturant tank.  The worst case vapor cloud endpoint is approximately 0.5 miles from the center of the facility.  There are public receptors within the 0.5 mile radius.\n\nAlthough Amaizing Energy, LLC has numerous controls in place to prevent such a release and to manage potential consequences, no credit for administrative controls or passive mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating this scenario.\n\nSince the facility qualifies as a Program 3 due to the close proximity of public receptors, Program Safety Management has to be completed for this facility.\n\nFive Year Accident History:\n\nAmaizing Energy, LLC has constructed a new ethanol facility and is subject to RMP upon delivery of substances onsite.\n\n\nEmergency Response Program Information:\n\nThe Amaizing Energy, LLC ethanol plant has several safety programs in place at the facility that incorporate emergency response, including a Health and Safety Plan.  An SPCC will be prepared and implemented in accordance with applicable regulatory standards and timeframes.\n\nThe facility also conducts employee training as part of facility activities.  Amaizing Energy, LLC's corporate policy places the utmost importance on worker, public and environmental safety, which is reflected in facility plans and training activities.\n\nA safety inspection and a review of the facility's emergency response plan are pending."
