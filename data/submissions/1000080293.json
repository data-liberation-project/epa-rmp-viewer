      "SummaryText": "Like many other food storage warehouse facilities, OK Grocery Perishables (OKP) uses anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant in its refrigeration process and system.  This is because of the following (as compared to other viable refrigerant chemicals typically used in refrigeration industry):\r\n- Cost effective\r\n- Efficient at transferring heat\r\n- Safe for the environment (non-ozone depleting)\r\n- Ammonia has a readily identifiable odor with an odor threshold concentration far below an acutely hazardous level\r\n\r\nBecause of its moderate toxicity and slight flammability (16-25% flammable range), ammonia is considered a hazardous chemical.  As such, it is on the covered chemical list for both OSHA's PSM and the EPA's RMP (29 CFR 1910.119 and 40 CFR 68) programs, both with threshold quantities of 10,000 lbs.\r\n\r\nOK Grocery is committed to maintaining a safe operation and environment for its employees, contractors, and the surrounding community. The facility's refrigeration system conforms with all relevant building and fire codes, as well as state and federal requirements and applicable industry-consensus codes and standards (such as the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration [IIAR]).  In maintaining this safe process and environment, OKP's top priority is the proactive prevention of accidental releases of ammonia instead of only reactively responding to problems.  \r\n\r\nOKP's PSM/RMP program contains all of the elements required under the standards.  This includes:\r\n- Employee Participation: OKP involves affected employees in all applicable elements of the PSM/RMP program.\r\n- Process Safety Information: Up-to-date information is maintained relating to the safety of ammonia and the refrigeration process design so that employees are fully informed of the chemical, technology, and equipment involved with the covered process.\r\n- Process Hazard Analysis: The facility conducts detailed studies on the on-site refrigeration system to identify hazards, safeguards, and potential"

These are reviewed at least annually and are promptly updated as needed to ensure the information contained within each is comprehensive and correct.\r\n- Mechanical Integrity (Maintenance and Quality Control): OKP has established a comprehensive program of inspections and preventive maintenance to prevent mechanical failures from occurring and mitigate negative consequences.  Additionally, the facility conducts periodic 3rd party mechanical integrity audits to ensure a non-biased result is obtained.\r\n- Training: Process personnel are provided comprehensive and detailed training in safe operation, procedures, and maintenance of the process equipment and refrigeration system as a whole.  Training for affected employees is provided and documented at least once every three (3) years.\r\n- Management of Change: Any potential alterations to the refrigeration process (chemical, technology, or equipment) are reviewed, assessed, and approved by technical staff to verify that they are within the original design specifications and that all safety-related considerations have been identified and addressed prior to implementation of the change.\r\n- Pre-Startup Safety Review: For certain types of major changes and extended process shutdowns, OKP conducts formal pre-startup safety reviews prior to re-initiating the refrigeration process to ensure all equipment has been designed and installed properly and all PSM/RMP-related elements have been accounted for and addressed.\r\n- Contractors: Contractors who work on or around the covered process are carefully screened to ensure that they have safe work records, relevant H&S policies and procedures, and proper knowledge and experience.
