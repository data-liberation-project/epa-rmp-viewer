This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention such as safety training and incident investigation.  Safety is considered in the design, construction, operation and maintenance of our processes.  Calumets policy is to implement reasonable control to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  In the occurrence of a release, our trained emergency response personnel shall respond to control and contain the release.  The facility has experienced two accidental releases in the past five years.  The first release occurred under the ownership of Pennzoil-Quaker State.  The unit is no longer used under the business plan of calumet Lubricants.  The second release occurred in the Lube Oil Hydrotreater.
