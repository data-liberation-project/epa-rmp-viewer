Aerosol products are primarily paint and repellants.\n\nAerosol manufacturing process is a partially automated system that consists of filling a can with paint concentrate and solvent, crimping a valve on the can, and adding propellant to pressurize the can.   The cans are tested, labeled, capped, and prepared for shipment.  \n\nPaint concentrates and other concentrates are stored in 55-gallon drums or bulk containers inside the production building.  Concentrates are stirred in the mix room and are pumped into the aerosol filling lines.  Paints to be repackaged are stirred and pumped into the liquid filling lines.\n\nSolvents are stored in above ground storage tanks located outside. Propellants are stored outside, at its vapor pressure, in cylindrical tanks. Paints, solvents, and propellants are hazardous substances as defined by OSHA PSM. However, only propellants are regulated by EPA's RMP program.  Propellants on the EPA list are flammables and include propane, butane, dimethyl ether, 1,1-difluoroethane. Inventory of each substance exceeds EPA's threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds. \n \nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\n\nEPA requires that the facility provide offsite consequence analysis for worse case release scenario and alternate case release scenario involving the four flammable propellants.  \n\nWorse Case determines the end point distance of a vapor cloud explosion when releasing the entire contents of a propellant storage tank. End point is the overpressure distance of one pound per square inch (psi) from a vapor cloud explosion.  All four propellants were modeled using EPA's RMP*Comp software.  The greatest end point is approximately 1500 feet radius when 67,000 pounds of propane is released in a vapor cloud explosion. Within this distance are residents, commercial, and industrial recepto"

      "SummaryText": "rs\n\nAlternate Case is more likely to occur than the Worse Case.  It determines the end point distance to lower flammability limits (LFL), which is the lowest concentration of propane that will burn and produce a vapor cloud fire (flash fire). This may be a ?\" effective diameter orifice represented by various leaks that includes pump seals, gaskets, pipe connections, cracks, etc. Maximum venting rate is estimated at 193lbs/min. Flammable endpoint is less than 500 feet radius from the tank farm.  \n\nThe Topographic Map in Appendix E shows the radius of exposure for each case.\n\nPREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe aerosol process is subject to OSHA's PSM program. PSM is Prevention Program 3 of 40 CFR Part 68 and identifies the effort needed to minimize the potential for an unplanned release of the flammables and prevent accidents.\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no accidents with RMP flammables in the past five years. \n \nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\n\nDesignated employees of LHB are trained to respond to only minor incidents that may occur at the facility. Minor incidents include small flash fires from a single aerosol can, paper/cardboard, or small amount of solvent or propellant, which can be extinguished with a fire hose or extinguisher.  Minor incidents also include solvent spills that are 110 gallons or less and does not cause immediate threat to life or injury and can be contained. LHB will not respond to large fires or small fires that have potential to expand, or respond to major releases of solvent or uncontrolled propellant. All untrained personnel will evacuate the area in case of the minor incident and all personnel will evacuate in case of the major incident. The Berkeley Fire Department will be called to respond in both cases. \n\nAn Emergency Response Plan is in place that meets the requirements of 40CFR Part 68. \nThe facility works with Berkeley Fire Department and LEPC to ensure that they are suitably trained and drilled in emergency response. \n\nPLANNED CHANGE"

We will continue to assess the impact of our aerosol operations and propose to design, build, operate, and maintain our facility so it remains safe and acceptable to the local community and the industrial area. We will continue to adhere to the highest standards for safe operation of our facility and the protection of the public and environment.  There are no changes planned to the facility at this time.
