At a minimum, the Contractor must (1) have in place and certify compliance with applicable and relevant DOT, OSHA, state and local regulatory requirements, (2) make available to the Facility and EPA upon request any contractor-related documentation necessary to demonstrate compliance, and (3) certify that it has in place emergency shut-down procedures for anhydrous ammonia transfer operations.  The Facility coordinates with the Contractor on Emergency Contingency procedures and will provide access to the Facility PSM/RMP upon request by the Contractor.\n\n\n\nTrained Process Operators operate the covered process which includes: (1) overseeing the transfer of anhydrous ammonia from a commercial tanker truck to the stationary PV; (2) monitoring of temperature, volume, and pressures during storage; (3) transfer of anhydrous ammonia from the stationary PV to Nurse Tanks; and (4) transfer of anhydrous ammonia from the stationary PV to the Aqua Blending Process (Covered Process 2).

The OSHA PSM and EPA Subpart D RMP standards are applicable to the two covered processes operated at this Facility.  This electronic RMP summarizes the policies and procedures implemented by the Facility to minimize the likelihood of an accident, and to ensure that a response to a release will be implemented in a proper and timely manner.\n\n\n\nPURPOSE FOR UPDATING RMP\n\n\n\nThe Facility is submitting this as a 5-year update in accordance with the rule. All accident prevention elements have been reviewed and/or updated.   \n\n\n\nIt is important to note that the maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia that is stored and handled at the Facility is 139,915 lbs.  Although the maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia that is stored and handled at the Facility is 139,915 lbs, the total quantity reported in this EPA RMP Report is 223,864 lbs.  The reason for this is because the single anhydrous ammonia pressure vessel (i.e. 83,949 lbs) is counted a second time to account for the Aqua Blending process that is connected to the single stationary pressure vessel.  Further, the maximum quantity of aqua ammonia that is stored and handled at the Facility is 47,953 lbs.  Although the maximum quantity of aqua ammonia that is stored and handled at the Facility is 47,953 lbs, the total quantity reported in this EPA RMP Report is 95,906 lbs.  The reason for this is because the single aqua ammonia AST (i.e 47,953 lbs) is counted a second time to account for the Base Blending process that is connected to the single stationary AST.  \n\n\n\nFACILITY\n\n\n\nThe operations at this Facility consist of chemical storage and handling, blending, retail sale and distribution.  Two chemicals (i.e. anhydrous ammonia and aqua ammonia greater than 20% ammon"

Covered Process 1: Anhydrous Ammonia S&H\n\n?    Covered Process 2: Aqua Ammonia Blending\n\n?    Covered Process 3: Aqua Ammonia S&H\n\n?    Covered Process 4: Base Blending\n\n\n\n\n\nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\n\n\n\nWorst case and alternative case consequence analyses were completed for all four (4) covered processes.  The worst case scenario for Covered Processes 1 and 2 assumes that all the contents in the largest single pressure vessel (i.e. 18,000 gallons) are released.  The release scenario consists of the PV being punctured on the side at the ground level and the release is modeled as a ground level horizontal jet at the maximum temperature.  For the aqua ammonia (i.e. representing Covered Processes 3 and 4), the worst case release scenario assumes that the 30,000-gallon aqua ammonia AST fails and instantaneously spills the content into secondary containment that has a total containment capacity of greater than 30,000 gallons when considering displacement of the other ASTs within the containment.  The resulting release is evaporation at the maximum temperature.\n\n\n\nDepending on the covered process, the alternative (or more likely to occur) scenario for anhydrous ammonia assumes a release of anhydrous ammonia due to (1) rupture of a 3-inch transfer hose during a loading or unloading operation associated with Covered Process 1; (2) rupture of a 1-inch transfer hose during transfer and blending at Covered Process 2; and (3) a rupture of a transfer hose and/or pipe during transfer and blending at Covered Process 3 and 4. For Covered Process 3 and 4, the release occurs within containment that has a total containment capacity of greater than 30,000 gallons when considering displacement of the other ASTs within the containment.  The resulting release is evaporation at the maximum temperature. Mitigation by engineering and admin"

The Operations Manager is assisted by other trained personnel as directed. The Operations Manager is responsible for ensuring that its employees are properly trained in the implementation of the Program 2 and 3 Accident Prevention Program elements as related to their responsibilities.  The accident prevention program elements addressed in the PSM/RMP combined program includes: Management System, Employee Participation, Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Contractor, Pre-Startup Review, Mechanical Integrity, Hot Work Permit, Management of Change, Incident Investigation, Emergency Response, Compliance Audits, and Trade Secrets.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThis is a non-responding Facility. The Facility has coordinated emergency response activities with its local emergency response agency and local fire department. \n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThere have been no on-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage; or off-site deaths, injuries, property damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place, in the past five (5) years because of the ammonia operations at this Facility.\n\n\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n\n\nThe Facility complies with the requirements of the Clean Air Act, Section 112(r).
