The facility is newly constructed and will begin operations in the spring of 2001.  Anhydrous ammonia is used in the closed-loop refrigeration system for pre-cooling and cold storage functions and is the only acutely hazardous chemical used on site  The facility consists of approximately 21,000 sq. ft. of cold storage warehouse and support space with various types of fixed and mobile pre-cooling equipment located on the approximate 15 acre site.\n     The risks to the community from this facility would come from an incident in which the ammonia normally contained within the refrigeration system was allowed to escape into the atmosphere.  In the worst-case scenario, the toxic end point is located off of the property within the surrounding agricultural area.  The alternate release scenario was selected as the most likely event that would have a toxic endpoint located off of the property.  Events which were considered possible and able to cause a release of ammonia for the purposes of the Hazard Evaluation were:  equipment failure, operator error, design deficiency, vehicular accident, acts of sabotage/vandalism, fire and earthquake.  It is expected that other specific events would have similar results as those listed above.  Direct contact with the released ammonia vapor by people inside the toxic endpoint is the main area of concern.\n     The worst case release scenario considered was as required, specifically being the release of 100% of the ammonia contained within the largest vessel over a 10 minute period.  The analytical results of this scenario show a distance to the toxic endp[oint of approximately .93 miles, which includes mainly agricultural areas.  The alternative release scenario chosen as the most likely event involves the release of 300 lbs of ammonia vapor over a 30 minute period"
