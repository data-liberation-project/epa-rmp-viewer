Ammonia vapor, High Stage Suction (HSS), from the Horizontal Recirculator (V-2) is routed to the suction inlet of three High Stage Compressor (HS-1 through HS-3).\n\nAt the High Stage Compressors (HS-1 through HS-3), ammonia vapor (HSS) is compressed to a super heated vapor (HSD). The super heated vapor (HSD) from the High Stage Compressors is routed from the engine room to the three Condensers (EC-1,EC-2A and EC-2B). At the Condensers the super heated vapor (HSD) rejects heat and converts to high pressure Condensed Liquid Drain (CD). The condenser accomplishes this by using a combinaton of air and water flow across ammonia coils. The condensers are equipped with Hydrostatic Safety Relief Valves which vent back into the system. Airflow is supplied to the condensers via fans internal to the condenser and water is supplied via condenser water pumps.\n\nWater from the condenser sump is pumped via condenser water pumps to the Condensers (EC-1,EC2A and EC-2B). At the Condensers the water is sprayed via a spray header over the ammonia coils. Water is collected at the bottom of the Condenser in a sump pan where by gravity it drains back to the condenser water pump. From here it is recirculated back to the condensers. As the water level of the condenser sump lowers it trips a water Makeup Float which opens allowing makeup water to refill the condenser sump.\n\nThe Condensed Liquid Drain (CD) from the Condensers (EC-1, EC-2A and EC-2B) drains back to the High Pressure Receiver (V-1).\n\nThe High Pressure Receiver (V-1) is used as a storage vessel for High Pressure Liquid (HPL). As HPL is needed in the system, HPL is fe"

Purged Gas (PUR) is piped from the purge point at each piece of equipment to the Auto Purger.  This system has fourteen purge points, the Condensers (EC-1, EC-2A and EC-2B) and the High Pressure Receiver (V-1). Each purge point consists of a solenoid valve with shut off valves on either side for isolation. Any non-condensables in the Vapor Stream are removed periodically by the  Auto Purger. The Auto Purger separates the Purged gas (PUR). It separates ammonia from the non-condensables by condensing the ammonia into a liquid. Any non-condensables are piped to a Water Bubbler to remove any traces of ammonia. Condensed Vapor (LSS) is piped back to the Low Temperature Horizontal Recirculator (V-4).\n\nHigh Pressure Liquid (HPL) is fed by pressure differential from the High Pressure Receiver to 50 degree dock evaporators (EV-13 through EV-16). As the liquid passes through the evaporator it absorbs heat from the air, changing to a vapor.
