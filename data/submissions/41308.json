This facility complies with the Chlorine Institute and the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP) requirements for chlorine gas storage, and it is our policy to notify 911 or (407) 703-1757, the City of Apopka Fire Communications Dispatcher, and request emergency response.  All process area leak detection equipment is connected to the facility SCADA system that immediately contacts the Fire Department in the event of leak detection for emergency assistance.  The City of Apopka\u00bfs Fire Department is equipped with a trained HAZMAT team that is qualified to respond to these types of emergencies.\n\tThis facility is a municipal drinking water treatment operation.  Chlorine is used to treat drinking water with a vacuum operated chlorination system as water is pumped into the ground storage tanks and prior to being pumped into the water distribution system.  Chlorine is stored and consumed from 1-ton (2,000 pounds) cylinders inside the chlorination storage and control room.  The chlorination system consists of two (2) 1-ton chlorine cylinders on-line at all times.  From the on-line chlorine cylinders, gaseous chlorine is ejected under vacuum for drinking water treatment.  A maximum of six (6) 1-ton cylinders (12,000 pounds) will be on hand at the water plant.\n\tThis facility consists of a small administration building, pumping facilities, two (2) above ground storage tanks and a parking lot.  An eight foot chain link fence encloses the facility\u00bfs operations.  The worst case scenario is a release of chlorine from the total failure of a 1-ton cylinder.  This event is unlikely to occur and is presented here as required by the Risk Management Program regulations.  The EPA\u00bfs RMP*Comp v.1.07 calculates the distance to endpoint for this quantity of chlorine is less than 0.90 miles.\nThe alternative release scenario is a more realistic accident that would involve a release"

This event produces a minimal release, as the chlorine gas piping operates under vacuum and will stop feeding at the moment of vacuum loss.  It is estimated that less than one pound of gas would be released in this scenario.  The EPA\u00bfs RMP*Comp v.1.07 calculates the distance to endpoint for this quantity of chlorine is less than 0.10 miles.\n\tThis facility complies with the EPA\u00bfs accident prevention rule, OSHA\u00bfs PSM rule, and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.\n\tThe chlorination system is designed, installed and maintained in accordance with the Chlorine Institute and Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP) state regulations.  The operators at the water plants are Florida State Certified Professionals.\n\tTo prepare for an emergency, plant operators have been trained in respiratory protection, emergency action, and fire prevention.  The operators have many years of experience safely handling chlorine.  They receive updated training regarding operations and safety on a regular basis.\n\tThe Grossenbacher Water Plant has not had an accident involving chlorine in the last five years that caused death, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering.\n\tIn the event of an emergency involving the chlorination system or the stored chlorine, it is our policy to notify 911 (City of Apopka Fire Communications) and request emergency response to the emergency.  Additional measures in place include all onsite leak detection equipment is connected to the SCADA system that dials directly to Fire Communications for immediate dispatch.  This measure protects for manned and unmanned operations.  This policy was formulated in cooperation with the City of Apopka Fire Department and members of the Fire Department have inspected and trained on our chlorination system."
