Executive Summary\nIntroduction:\nThe Terra Nitrogen - Blytheville Plant manufactures anhydrous ammonia, granular urea and urea ammonium nitrate (UAN) solution and the by-product carbon dioxide.  Intermediates in the manufacture of these products include nitric acid, urea solution, and ammonium nitrate solution.  The regulated substances, as defined by 40 CFR Part 68, that exceed the threshold quantity are ammonia, chlorine, and hydrogen.\n  \nIt is Terra Nitrogen's policy to prevent accidental releases from the plant by effective process safety management (PSM) programs and procedures. Terra requires participation by plant employees in every element of the PSM program.\n   \nOne way Terra prevents process incidents is by conducting regular analysis of process hazards utilizing current and accurate process safety information.  The operations personnel draft and maintain current operating procedures.  Terra provides timely and comprehensive training for all employees involved in operating and maintaining process equipment.  It is our policy to oversee the activities of contractors and ensure that they are trained to perform their jobs safely.  We follow established pre-startup safety reviews and management of change procedures to ensure that modifications are adequately evaluated for safety and administer a comprehensive mechanical integrity program to ensure that process equipment is maintained in accordance with good engineering practice and accepted industry standards.  We immediately investigate incidents when they do occur so that we can promptly correct deficiencies and learn from the experience. \n\nIt is our policy to maintain a current and accurate written emergency response plan and a well-trained and equipped onsite emergency response team.  We also maintain a system to notify neighbors in the event of a release.  We periodically coordinate emergency response planning with local authorities and participate in joint exercises.  On a regular basis, we audit th"

The Alternative Release Scenario for ammonia is a 2\" pipe break, resulting in the release of 5,400 pounds over a ten minute period. The distance to the toxic endpoint for ammonia (200 ppm) is estimated to be 0.35 miles. The Alternative Release Scenario for chlorine is a 3/8\" pipe break resulting in a release of 1,560 pounds over a 120 minute period.  The distance to the toxic endpoint for chlorine (3 ppm) is estimated to be 0.51 miles.  The effect of the alternative toxic releases is limited by the operation of excess flow valves and emergency shutdown procedures in place at the facility.  The Blytheville Plant Flammable Worst Case Scenario involves hydrogen and has offsite impact. The Alternative Release Scenario for hydrogen involves a 1\" pipe break, resulting in the release of 540 pounds over a ten minute period.  The distance to the flammable endpoint (3.3% volume - LFL) is estimated to be 0.06 miles.  The effect of the Alternative Flammable release scenario is limited by emergency shutdown procedures.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program:\nThe Blytheville Plant has a comprehensive Process Safety Management (PSM) Program and is subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's standard for process safety management of highly hazardous chemicals found at 29 CFR Part 1910.119.  Key elements of the PSM program include: 1) stringent design standards of equipment which incorporate substantial safety factors and include state of the art monitoring and control instrumentation; 2) extensive process safety information that is accurate and up to date; 3) well-trained operating, maintenance, and contract personnel; 4) written operati"

Plant personnel have participated in county-wide emergency drills with local responders including the Mississippi County Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), the Blytheville Fire Department, the Mississippi County Rescue Squad and personnel from the Blytheville Hospital.  Additionally, the plant exercises its emergency response plan regularly with in-plant drills."
