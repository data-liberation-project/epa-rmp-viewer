Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the facility:\nSumitomo Sitix Silicon (SSS) has an extensive program to control accidental chemical releases from the facility. A written Injury and Illness Prevention Program (IIPP) has been established which describes senior maangement's committment for prevention of all accidents, including chemical release within the facility. A written Hazardous Materials Business Plan and chemical inventory have also been established. Additionally, a written Hazard Communication program and a written Emergency Response Plan describe methods to control and respond to chemical release incidents. An emergency response team of 50 employees is certified in 40-hour HAZWOPER response to chemical release incidents. There are written specifications for job processes that integrate specific chemical safety requirements. A site safety committee routinely addresses chemical safety issues, as well as quarterly environmental health and safety management meetings, quarterly employee informational meetings, and daily operations meetings.\n\n2.

      "SummaryText": "ect to the RMP requirements:\nHydrochloric acid is used as a wafer etch gas. Hydrogen is used in wafer reduction, process purging, and as a dopant carrier gas. SSS stores 12,260 ibs. of Hydrogen and 21,000 ibs. of Hydrocloric acid.\n\n3. Worst-case release scenerio and alternative release scenerio:\nThe Aloha model was used to calculate release scenerios. \nA) Worst-case release scenerio: \na) Hydrogen: Vapor cloud explosion involving entire contents of largest vessel resulting in 11,848 ibs. released.\nb) Hydrochloric acid: Liquid pool formed from instantaneous spill of largest single container resulting in 3,000 lbs. released\n\nB) Alternative release scenerio:\nFor Hydrogen, the most likely consequence of the small release is a vapor cloud fire.  The endpoint distance is determined as the distance to the Lower Flamability Limit (LFL) for hydrogen, which is 3.3 mg/liter.  The Aloha model calculated this distance as 15 yards. For HCl, the toxic endpoint of 0.030 mg/liter was used to calculate the distance for a gas phase leak.  That distance is 517 yards (0.29 miles).\n\n4. General accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\nThere are daily Facility Maintenance Tours to identify hydrogen and hydrochloric acid operational non-conformances. Written specifications for chemical practices have been established, such as the Division 15 Mechanical section 15480 Process Piping procedure to ensure mechanical inytegrity and start-up specifications that covers hydrogen and hydrochloric acid. Other examples of specifications include: Leak checking of reactor gas panels, gas supply leak checking, replacing gas panel components, procedure for hydrogen gas calibration, ASM leak checking, Procedures for hydrochloric acid system, Chemical and gas pipe labeling, etc..\n\n5. Five-year accident history:\nThere have been no significant acccidents involving hydrogen or hydrochloric acid releases.\n\n6. Emergency response program:\nWritten ERT program manual with 50/150 e"
