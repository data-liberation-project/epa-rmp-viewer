Facility accidental release and emergency response policy.\n\nThe management and employees of Carroll Service Company are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of  anhydrous ammonia.  If an accident should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Lanark Fire Department, Carroll County Local Emergency Planning Committee or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. The stationary source and the regulated substance handled.\n\nThe primary activity at the facility, which is located at 24751 ILLINOIS RTE 52, is storage and sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.  The storage and handling system consists of one 30,000 gallon storage tank, loading risers, associated plumbing and nurse tanks.  Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.\n\nThe maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia that can be stored would be 140,000 pounds, this includes the amount of anhydrous ammonia that could be stored in nurse tanks.\n\n3. The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents \nof a storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 140,000 pounds which represents the volume of the largest storage tank or as limited by design standards.\n\nThe distance to the endpoint of .14 mg/L for the worst-case scenario is 1.2 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario based on the most likely potential incident is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  Emergency shutdown procedures, which include the closing of tank valves, was the only active mitigation considered to limit the amount of product released.\n\nThe distance to the en"

Compliance with these  regulations and on-going training of our employees make up our accident program.\n\n5. Five year accident history.\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\n-Have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor\n-To our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, shelter in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6.

Our emergency action plans have been coordinated with both the fire department and the Carroll County LEPC.\n\n7.
