      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\n     XTO Energy Inc. and the Willow Spring Plant have a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained Company personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n    The Willow Springs facility, located on the outskirts of Longview, Texas, uses a variety of processes to produce petroleum products (e.g., natural gas, natural gas liquids (a mixture of propane, butane, pentane, and hexanes+), and condensate).  There are no regulated toxic substances at the Willow Springs facility.  \n\n    The Willow Springs Plant is located at a compressor station that handles about 45 million cubic feet of gas per day (MMcfpd).  About 5 MMcfpd of gas is processed through a small skid-mounted refrigeration unit used to separate the natural gas liquids (NGLs) from the natural gas.  The NGLs are captured in a 30,000 gallon pressurized bullet tank.  Written operating procedures have been implemented to ensure that no more than 25,000 gallons of NGLs are present in the tank at any time.  The NGLs are loaded onto tank trucks with vapor recovery systems for sales.\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n    The worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with a release of flammable substances in Program Level 1 at a gas plant is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) involving the inventory of the largest storage tank containing 25,000 gallons (145,000 lbs).  A written operating procedure is in place to limit the storage inventory to 25,000 gallons; therefore, the reduced inventory is assumed to release and ignite, resulting in a VCE."

      "SummaryText": "The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this WCS is 0.42 miles.  Although numerous controls are in place to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for passive mitigation measures was taken into account in evaluating this WCS.  The nearest residence is located 0.44 miles away.\n\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n     The Willow Springs natural gas liquids refrigeration plant has safety features to contain and control a release.  The plant equipment and the bullet tank have atmospheric pressure relief valves to prevent a catastophic failure of any piece of equipment and valves to permit isolation of the process.  Employees have been trained on operation of the equipment, including operating limits.  The facility is unmanned, but is checked daily.  \n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY     \n     The refrigeration plant is a new facility, so there have been no accidents in the last five years. \n     \nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\n     The Willow Springs refrigeration plant maintains a written emergency response program that is in place to protect worker and public safety, as well as equipment.  The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including notification of local emergency response agencies if a release occurs and post incident cleanup requirements.  Employees receive training on the operation and maintenance of the plant equipment, fire fighting equipment, and the implementation of the emergency response plan.  The plan was reviewed with the local emergency planning committee chairman on October 18, 2001.   \n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n     The Willow Springs refrigeration plant will conduct incident investigations of any known releases and will make modifications to the process if a review of the process indicates it wo"
