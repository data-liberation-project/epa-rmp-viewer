The registration for this process is presented in the GRM-PG - Appendix A. \r\n\r\nThe JRWTP is subject to the RMP regulation because the chlorination process at the JRWTP utilizes and/or stores a greater quantity of chlorine than the threshold quantity. The JRWTP is located at 10000 Southside Road in the lower eastern portion of the City of El Paso, Texas. The JRWTP is surrounded by agricultural, residential, and vacant land.\r\n\r\nCurrently the JRWTP has the potential to store up to eleven (11) one-ton chlorine containers in the chlorination storage room, allowing the potential to store a total of 22,000 pounds of chlorine. However, the normal storage is ten (10) one-ton chlorine at any one time. The average amount of chlorine managed at JRWTP is 20,000 pounds.\r\n\r\nThe main objectives of this RMP are to: \r\n\r\n\u00bf\tCommunicate the extent of a possible chlorine release and identify potential receptors (Hazard Assessment). \r\n\r\nThe worst case scenario modeled by the ALOHA software indicates a vulnerable zone radius of 2.5 miles. The alternative release analysis indicates a vulnerable zone radius of 13 yards.  The Hazard Assessment shows an estimated population within the worst case scenario at 22,600 people; Mexico's potential affected population was unable to be determined however, a comparable population resides in the worst case vulnerable zone. The alternative \"more likely\" release estimated population is approximately 0 people.\r\n \r\nThe RMP rule requires the identification of environmental receptors within the toxic endpoint zone for both worst case and alternative scenarios. The following environmental receptors were identified:\r\n\r\n1. The Rio Grande River.  The JRWTP is approximately 1,500 feet northeast"

The Rio Bosque Park is located adjacent south of JR WWTP and is a 372-acre wetland that receives water from the Rio Grande and JR WWTP.

The Prevention Program incorporates safety information, hazard review, operating procedures, training, maintenance, compliance audits, and incident investigations.\r\n\r\n\u00bf\tFormulate contingency planning in the case of an accidental release (Emergency Response Program).\r\n\r\nThe Emergency Response Program is modeled after the EPWU-PSB's \"Emergency Response Action Plan\" and the Chlorine Institute's \"Emergency Response Plans for Chlorine Plans for Chlorine Facilities.\" The Emergency Response Program incorporates an emergency response plan, emergency response equipment procedures, training in relevant procedures for employees involved in the chlorination process, and procedures to review and update, as appropriate, the emergency response plan to reflect changes and ensure that employees are informed of changes.  \r\n\r\nMexico and The United States created the Joint Contingency Plan (JCP)for use as a rapid international response to contingencies associated with chemical hazardous substances along the inland border.
