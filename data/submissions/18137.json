Facility Policy:  The management and employees of Willow Hill Grain, Inc. are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia or propane through the use of proper equipment, regular inspections, maintenance and training of all persons that work with these materials.  Should an accidental release occur, this facility has worked with the local fire department and local emergency planning committee so they can plan for response to a release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.  Facility Information:  The primary activities at this facility are the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia and propane for sale to customers.  Anhydrous ammonia and propane is received, stored and distributed at this facility.  The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia stored at this facility is 350000 pounds.  The maximum quantity of propane stored at this facility is 310000 pounds.  This facility stores anhydrous ammonia in 5 tank(s) and propane in 4 tank(s).  \n\n3.  Toxic Worst-Case Scenario:  Failure of the largest storage tank when filled to the maximum allowed capacity of 85% would release the total contents or 80000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia as a gas in a period of ten minutes.  Company procedures and equipment design standards limit the maximum filling capacity of tanks to 85% of capacity.  The distance to the endpoint of dispersion based on the model used is 0.9 miles.\n\nFlammable Worst-Case Scenario:  Failure of the largest storage tank when filled to the maximum allowed capacity of 85% at 600 F would release the total contents or 110000 pounds of propane.  Company procedures and equipment design standards limit the maximum filling capacity of tanks to 85% at 600 F.  It is assumed that the entire contents are released as vapor, which finds an ignition source, and 10% of the released quantity is assumed to participate in the resulting explosion.

The distance to the endpoint of dispersion is 0.6 miles.\n\nFlammable Alternative-Case Scenario:  The alternative-case scenario is assumed to be a release of 69 pounds of propane caused by the rupture of a hose when a driver fails to disconnect the hoses between a storage tank and the transfer vehicle before moving the vehicle.  In this scenario, the failure involves a 25-foot length of 4\" diameter hose and the excess flow valves operate properly to stop the flow.  The contents of the hose are released and lead to a vapor cloud explosion.  The distance to the endpoint of dispersion is 0.03 miles.\n\n4.  Accidental Release Program:   This facility complies with the various rules and regulations governing the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia including ANSI K61.1, OSHA 29 CFR 1910.111 and regulations administered by the Department of Agriculture. This facility also complies with the various rules and regulations governing the storage and handling of propane including ANSI K61.1, OSHA 29 CFR 1910.110, guidelines set forth in NFPA-58 as well as all applicable state and local codes.  Training is provided on safe anhydrous ammonia and propane operations for employees.\n\n5.  Five-year Accident History:  There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia or propane for the covered processes at this facility in the past five years.\n\n6.  Emergency Response Program:  This facility has a written emergency plan in accordance with OSHA Standards 29 CFR 1910.38 and 1910.120.  Emergency planning and community right-to-know information is provided to the state emergency response commission, local emergency planning committee and local fire department as required by SARA Title III of EPCRA.  \n\n7.
