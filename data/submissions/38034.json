Solutia, Pensacola is one of the 18 chemical manufacturing facilities that make up the company. Solutia, Inc. has approximately 6000 employees. \n\nBuilt in 1953, the Pensacola Plant is situated on a 2200 acre tract, 12 miles north of the City of Pensacola, on the Escambia River. Over 600 acres are presently in use.\n\nStaffing at Pensacola is currently 970 Solutia employees and 600 permanent contract employees.   Solutia Inc. is the world's largest producer of nylon carpet staple -- all here in Pensacola. In addition the facility produces nylon polymer chips for the automotive and electrical industries. Some of the adipic acid produced is sold outside the fiber market where it goes into food additives -- jell-o and no salt to provide tartness.  The facility also produces maleic anhydride, which utilizes butane as a raw material.  The maleic anhydride facility is owned by Huntsman Corp., but staffed and run by Solutia personnel \n\nMost major raw materials (ie. Anhydrous Ammonia and Butane are the two regulated substances) arrive at the plant by barge on the Escambia River - 7 miles from the lntercoastal Waterway. Rail and truck shipments of butane supplement the barges. Butane barges can hold up to a maximum of 3.3 million pounds, remain under the control of the carrier, and normally there are no more than two barges on site at any one time. The plant could have as many as 25 rail cars of butane, with the largest containing 160,000 pounds. There could be as many as 10 tanker trucks of butane on site w"

Although we have never had more than one barge of ammonia on site, we believe there could be situations warranting two. The largest ammonia barge contains 5 million pounds. \n\nThe plant also utilizes chlorine gas to treat the plant process and domestic water systems.  All of the chlorine used in this operation is received into the plant in one-ton capacity cylinders and in 150 lb capacity bottles.  The one-ton cylinders contain a maximum net weight of 1350 lbs.  There is no more than one 1350 lb. cylinder at each of the two water treating systems.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\n\nSolutia Inc. has officially adopted the following six commitments, expressing our intention to operate responsibly:\n\n- We will ensure that our operations and distribution systems are safe for employees, visitors, site contractors, communities and the environment.\n- We will make products that are safe when used responsibly.\n- We will keep our operations open to our communities and foster open communications with all of our stakeholders.\n- We will continuously improve our raw material and energy utilization efficiencies, to reduce our impact on the environment and improve the sustainability of our businesses.\n- We will encourage active participation in and positive contributions to safety, health and environmental stewardship by our employees.\n- We will search worldwide for new technologies that bring environmental, safety and health value to all of our stakeholders.\n\nA commitment to safety is involved in everything we do at the Pensacola Site and is the responsibility of every employee. Our exemplary safety performance speaks for itself, but we can never be satisfied. Our goal is simple -to create an incident-free workplace for employees, contractors, guests and the surrounding community.\n\nWe believe in preventing accidents before the"

In addition, our manufacturing processes use state-of-the-art equipment, designed with the latest safety features.\n\nThe Pensacola plant has earned recognition for its commitment to safety as the first manufacturer in Florida to earn ?Star? designation in OSHA?s Voluntary Protection Program (VPP).\n\nSolutia endorses and supports the American Chemistry Council?s Responsible Care program -- an international initiative that has helped chemical makers achieve one of the best safety performances of any industry in North America during the 1990s\n\nSolutia, Pensacola has clear written policies regarding employee involvement in all aspects of Safety.  Both the ?Safety Program Management? policy Section IV - 1.07 and the ?Process Safety Management Employee Participation? policy Section IV - 1.13 describe this involvement.\n\nThe plant?s written ES&H procedures and standards are incorporated into two manuals.  The first manual contains 84 plant wide procedures that are revised at least every five years.  The second manual contains area-specific procedures (over 220 in number) that are reviewed and revised on a three-year cycle.  So, on average, sixty procedures are reviewed and updated each year.  The Safety Dept. manages the ES&H Manual revision program. Many of the procedures and standards are based on corporate guidelines and commitments.  \n\nEvery three years our safety and health program undergoes a Corporate Audit.\n\nManagement demonstrates its leadership through attendance at safety meetings, participation in Focus Walk-thrus, area housekeeping inspections, and compliance training.  Communication is the key to the success of management commitment.  The site manager utilizes a variety of media (e.g., the monthly newsletter, Extra Extra, site wide TV monitors, attendance at various meetings) to convey her personal commitment that completing our work safely is the vision that we must continuously have in "

The site E, S & H Safety Manual also states the Plant Manager?s commitment to safety via the forward section.  \n\n\nEmergency Response Program:\n\nSolutia uses several types of safety audits to ensure that our plant runs safely.  These include PSM and non-PSM audits, ISO audits, Corporate and insurance surveys and audits, environmental and industrial hygiene audits, and Management of Change audits.  We conduct safety reviews on new processes or process modifications at a number of stages of the project design and installation.  Pre-startup inspections are done before the process is commissioned.\n\nThe Pensacola plant is very dedicated to emergency response preparation in the event of any major incident.  The plant has 80 firefighters across all 4 shifts, giving 24/7 coverage.  These firefighters train 56 hours annually at the site on events such as flammable liquid fires, interior and exterior fire fighting, hazardous communications, and incident command.  The firefighters also train at the Texas A&M fire training school.  The plant fire department has one Class A pumper with foam capabilities to supplement the six fire pumps that take water from a 2 million gallon supply reservoir.\n\nCurrently, the plant has 16 EMTs training 48 hours annually on trauma assessment, burn care, and other medical topics.  The plant also has a fully stocked ambulance for transportation to the plant medical clinic.\n\nAll firefighters are trained as Hazardous Materials technicians, to respond to on-site or off-site chemical emergencies.  These individuals are trained to handle both railcar and highway emergencies.  The plant has a fully stocked emergency HAZMAT trailer for large scall chemical emergencies, as well as a mass casualty response trailer.\n\nThe site maintains 155 separate sprinkler systems, 68 monitor nozzles, 96 hydrants, hundreds of fire extinguishers, and other protection equipment.

Solutia also has a good working relationship with other nearby industrial facilities and with the local community fire departments.\n\nThe Pensacola site falls under compliance of the Maritime Transportation Security Act, which was implemented as a result of 9/11.  Solutia has worked with the U.S. Coast Guard, who has responsibility for the Security Act, to develop a new facility security plan which improves the security of our personnel, chemicals, and operations.
