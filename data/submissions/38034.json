Solutia, Pensacola is one of the 18 chemical manufacturing facilities that make up the company. Solutia, Inc. has approximately 6000 employees. \n\nBuilt in 1953, the Pensacola Plant is situated on a 2200 acre tract, 12 miles north of the City of Pensacola, on the Escambia River. Over 600 acres are presently in use.\n\nStaffing at Pensacola is currently 970 Solutia employees and 600 permanent contract employees.   Solutia Inc. is the world's largest producer of nylon carpet staple -- all here in Pensacola. In addition the facility produces nylon polymer chips for the automotive and electrical industries. Some of the adipic acid produced is sold outside the fiber market where it goes into food additives -- jell-o and no salt to provide tartness.  The facility also produces maleic anhydride, which utilizes butane as a raw material.  The maleic anhydride facility is owned by Huntsman Corp., but staffed and run by Solutia personnel \n\nMost major raw materials (ie. Anhydrous Ammonia and Butane are the two regulated substances) arrive at the plant by barge on the Escambia River - 7 miles from the lntercoastal Waterway. Rail and truck shipments of butane supplement the barges. Butane barges can hold up to a maximum of 3.3 million pounds, remain under the control of the carrier, and normally there are no more than two barges on site at any one time. The plant could have as many as 25 rail cars of butane, with the largest containing 160,000 pounds. There could be as many as 10 tanker trucks of butane on site w"

Solutia also has a good working relationship with other nearby industrial facilities and with the local community fire departments.\n\nThe Pensacola site falls under compliance of the Maritime Transportation Security Act, which was implemented as a result of 9/11.  Solutia has worked with the U.S. Coast Guard, who has responsibility for the Security Act, to develop a new facility security plan which improves the security of our personnel, chemicals, and operations.  Implementation of the plan has included installation of new security cameras and motion detection devices around our ammonia and butane storage facilities.  \n\n\nFive Year Accident History: \n\nThere have been no accidental releases from covered processes that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage during the previous five years.\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nWe take a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  Our management systems address each of the key features of successful prevention programs including:\n\n- Process safety information\n- Process hazard analysis\n- Operating procedures\n- Training\n- Mechanical integrity program\n- Management of change process\n- Pre-startup reviews\n- Compliance audits\n- Incident investigations\n- Employee participation\n- Hot work permit\n- Contractor management\n\nAs part of our prevention efforts, we have implemented the following chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\nAmmonia\n- The ammonia storage tank is a state-of-the-art installation.
