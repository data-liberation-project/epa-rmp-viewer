Its two water filtration plants, drawing from the Potomac and Patuxent Rivers, produce an average of 166 million gallons of potable water per day, and over 5,000 miles of water mains deliver that product to homes and businesses in Prince George's and Montgomery Counties.  The Commission operates four raw water reservoirs , with a total capacity of over 14  billion gallons, to ensure a reliable water supply for all seasons and conditions.\n\nSix wastewater treatment plants operated by WSSC provide wastewater treatment.  Every day an average of 181 million gallons of wastewater from Prince George's and Montgomery Counties move to facilities through 4,900 miles of sewers maintained by the WSSC.  The six WSSC wastewater treatment plants have a combined capacity of over 73 million gallons per day (mgd).  Under the Inter-municipal Agreement, WSSC is allocated 169 mgd of Blue Plains' capacity.  WSSC, in turn, pays a share of the Blue Plains' operating and capital expenses.\n\nIV. POWERS AND RESPONSIBILITIES\n\nA six-member commission governs WSSC - three members from each county.  The Commissioners are appointed to four-year terms by their respective county executives, and confirmed by their county councils.\n\nThe Commission's powers and responsibilities are set forth in State law and in subsequent legislative amendments.  The Maryland General Assembly conferred these powers upon the WSSC to enable it to fulfill its principal functions.\n\nThe Commission's major functions are to:\n\n? provide for the construction, operation, and maintenance of water supply and sanitary sewerage systems in Montgomery and Prince George's Counties,\n? approve the locations of, and issue permits for, utilities installed in public ways, and\n? establish waster consumption rates, sewer usage rates, connection charges, front foot benefit charges, and permit fees, and if required, cause ad valorem taxes to be levied.\n\nThe Commission also:\n\n? reviews preliminary subdivision "

WSSC'S DEDICATION TO EMERGENCY RESPONSE AND PROTECTION\nOF PUBLIC HEALTH\nHistorically WSSC has always taken its responsibilities related to accident prevention, emergency response, and the protection of public health . Our initiatives have normally been above and beyond the regulatory mandated requirements.  While extensive efforts were taken back in June of 1999 to respond to the requirements of the Risk Management Plans, the unfortunate events of September 11, 2001, prompted us to re-visit our philosophy and approach towards emergency response.  WSSC invested in a large-scale emergency response plan upgrade project on June 30, 2003.  This project was primarily intended to meet the requirements of HR 3448, Title IV - Drinking Water, Security and Safety, Section 401 - Terrorist and Other Intentional Acts, contained in the \"Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002.\" WSSC took this project to a higher elevation by updating all emergency response plans in accordance with the National Response Team's Integrated Contingency Plan Guidance (\"One Plan\").  Furthermore, while the Bioterrorism Act only required the WSSC to update our emergency response plans for drinking water treatment plants, WSSC took the initiative to update all emergency response plans for all wastewater treatment plants as well.  On September 29, 2003, the WSSC provided a Certification of Compliance of Integrated Contingency Plan with Requirements of Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002 - Emergency Response Planning.

THE PRODUCTION TEAM\n\nThe Production Team provides continuous high quality cost effective operation and maintenance of the WSSC's water supply dams, reservoirs, water filtration plants, water distribution facilities, wastewater collection facilities, wastewater treatment plants, biosolids management programs and laboratories.\n\nOne of the Production Team's primary goals is to provide a safe and reliable supply of drinking water to our customers maintaining an adequate volume and pressure of water for fire-fighting and customer use that meets or exceeds the requirements of the Safe Drinking Water Act and other federal and state regulations.  The WSSC has never exceeded a maximum allowable contaminant level (MCL) established by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in accordance with the Safe Drinking Water Act.  The Team is accomplishing this mission by maintaining and operating the Commission's raw water supply, dams, reservoirs, water filtration plants, and distribution system.  The two major water treatment plants, the Potomac and Patuxent Plants, operate in coordination with the distribution system and its various storage facilities, 65 tanks, and 13 pump stations to maximize water quality and customer satisfaction while minimizing costs.  All remote water pumping stations, storage tanks, and remote control pressure reducing stations are monitored and controlled through our supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system.  These treatment and distribution systems utilize a combination of advanced process control and human intervention to meet ever increasing regulatory demands.\n\nThe second primary goal of the Production Team is to produce a quality effluent from its wastewater treatment plants which meets discharge standards to protect public health and environment.  This process begins with the operation and maintenance of portions of the WSSC wastewater col"

These facilities are remotely monitored by our SCADA system for proper operations to minimize overflows and protect equipment against damage.  Six wastewater treatment plants, Seneca, Damascus, Parkway, Western Branch, Piscataway, and Hyattstown, along with the District of Columbia Water and Sewer Authorities (WASA) Blue Plains Plant provide wastewater treatment for WSSC's customers.  All of these wastewater treatment plants produce biosolids, the solids residuals removed from the wastewater during the treatment process.  The Production Team handles the biosolids beneficial reuse program.  \n\nAs this Team moves toward best practices, the continued and improved use of automation technology for process control and centralized control are critical to provide oversight and coordination with both the water and wastewater systems.  The use of this technology as a strategy allows automation and remote monitoring to support unstaffed or reduced staff operations and maintenance scheduling while maintaining a vigilant watch on these complicated systems.  \n\nA variety of support organizations exist within the Production Team.  Laboratory Services provides all laboratory testing and results necessary to operate the treatment processes including biological, organic and metals testing.  This laboratory data is utilized to optimize processes as well as meet the requirement of federal and state regulations.  The Laboratory also supports a variety of other teams within WSSC and performs laboratory work for other organizations.  The Production Team also provides coordination with numerous agencies regarding regional water supply, wastewater treatment and related issues.\n\nThe Production Team is responsible for providing overall supervision, management, coordination, and administration of the Water and Wastewater Groups.

The Team Chief provides the supervision, management, and administrative control of the Water and Wastewater and support Groups.\n\nVII. PATUXENT WATER FILTRATION PLANT\n\nThe Patuxent WFP is located at 6101 Sandy Spring Road, Laurel, Maryland. It is the smaller of the Commission's two water treatment plants and is designed to provide approximately 60 million gallons of water per day (mgd) to the distribution system. However, with future renovations to upgrade the plant, it is expected that the plant will deliver an emergency capacity of 120 million gallons per day. \n\nThe plant operates 24 hours a day with a minimum of two operators on every shift.

Safely operating the plant facilities to protect it and the environment is paramount. WSSC's Safety Unit, the Plant's Superintendent and Chief Plant Operator train the staff regularly on plant operations, accident prevention, and for emergencies. Annual training includes the following: CPR, Lockout/Tagout, Right-to-Know, Personal Protective Equipment, emergency repair of chlorine cylinders, Confined Space Entry, Rescue and Retrieval, etc. As a WSSC requisite for long-term employment,  Water Plant Operators must pass an examination  and have a mimimum of three years experience to become certified by the State of Maryland's Department of the Environment. This ensures that Plant Operators are fully capable of effectively operating the plant. \n\nThe plant is designed to provide reliable operations year-round. Power to the plant originates from two different electrical sources, providing electrical redundancy, thereby reducing the potential occurrence of a total power outage. The plant is designed with redundant equipment at every phase of the treatment process. Thus, when an equipment failure occurs, the process can continue producing a high quality final effluent and providing maximum protection to our environment.\n\nVIII. PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe Commission Accidental Release Prevention Program is part of the agency's overall Safety and Health Program and involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices to ensure our workers and the public a safe environment.  The RMP requirement is essentially an expansion of the OSHA Process Safety requirement and the Employee and Community Right-to-Know programs that have been in existence for a number of years.\n\nHazardous material has always been recognized as a unique hazard for our employees and the public; therefore, we have made every possible effort to ensure the proper and s"

WSSC safety professionals provide assistance on many safety matters.  They assist with developing training courses, investigating accidents, correcting unsafe conditions, providing physicals and random drug and alcohol tests for CDL drivers, and ensuring chemicals are handled properly.  Each year a safety specialist (in conjunction with the plant Safety Coordinator) performs a detailed inspection of the plant to ensure we meet all safety requirements.  All of the needed safety equipment is supplied by the WSSC.  This includes coveralls, rain suits, chemical-handling suits, hard hats, breathing apparatus, various types of gloves, eye protection equipment, manhole retrieval equipment, atmosphere testing meters, and well maintained vehicles.  Our position is that all needed safety equipment and training is provided to each employee.  Therefore, we accept no excuses for failure to work safely.\n\nThe Safety Program is clearly a success.  Accidents and injuries are at very low levels.  A plant record of 1,070 consecutive days without a lost-time accident was set recently.  The rare lost-time accident is usually minor, does not involve serious injury, and does not involve chemical handling. \n\nManagement decided years ago that formal recognition of safe working employees was a good idea.  For each injury-free quarter, the plant receives an award.  For each injury-free year, the plant receives a plaque.  Individuals are also recognized.  Every two consecutive injury-free years are rewarded with a safety jacket or other safety incentives.  It is felt that recognition demonstrates the management commitment to safety.
