As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible and updated as necessary.\n\nOur RMP/PSM Program promotes overall plant, worker, public, and environmental safety. The program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of hazardous chemicals. Overall, the program is designed to prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, illnesses, and physical property damage.\n\nFacility and Process Description\n\nPlains Dairy is a distributor of a variety of bottled drink products to the consumer market at our facility located in Amarillo, Tx. We have a strong commitment to operate our facility in a safe and responsible manner. The SIC code for the operation is 5143; NAICS code is 42443. The facility  operates 24 hours/day, 7 days/week, and 52 weeks/year.\n\nAmmonia is used at our facility as the cooling medium in our refrigeration system. The ammonia is contained in a closed loop system; it is designed to remain inside the piping and vessels in our facility.  We believe that ammonia provides the safest and most efficient cooling choice for our operation. 40 CFR 68.130 lists anhydrous ammonia as a hazardous chemical subject to the RMP regulation with a threshold quantity of 10,000 lbs., the refrigeration system exceeds this threshold.\n\nGeneral Accident Release & Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n \nWe take many precautions to prevent or minimize accidental releases of ammonia from the refrigeration system.  These precautions include safety controls (alarms and automatic shutdown devices) which are designed to identify and prevent potentially unsafe conditions like pressure increases that"

We also have a preventive maintenance program designed to maintain the on-going integrity of the systems, a training program designed to ensure that the systems are operated by qualified personnel, and emergency response procedures that enable trained personnel to respond quickly to system upsets. Walking inspections are conducted on intervals not longer than 8 hours. System parameters are logged in a permanent record, as are routine maintenance activities.\n\nThe Engineer/Assistant Engineer is responsible for the management of these ammonia safety programs. \n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled \nAmmonia is the only substance covered by the Accidental Release Prevention Regulations handled at this facility. \n\nDescription of the Accidental Release Prevention Program \nThe facility has an accident release prevention program that complies with Occupational Safety and Health  Act's Process Safety Management Standard and EPA's Risk Management Program Rule. \n\nFive-Year Accident History \nNo ammonia-related accidents have occurred at the facility over the past five years that resulted in significant onsite or offsite consequences. Facility personnel are trained to safely control small, incidental releases of ammonia, in the event they should occur.\n \nEmergency Action Program \nAn emergency action program has been implemented at the facility. This program contains procedures describing how the facility will respond to ammonia spills and other emergencies, including evacuation procedures; section 302 & 303 of the Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act (EPCRA), by notifying the State Emergency Response Commission (SERC), Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), and the local Fire Department.

Our employees will not respond to accidental releases of ammonia. In lieu of responding to accidental releases, Plains Dairy is implementing the following protocols:\n- The facility is included in the community emergency response plan developed under Title 42 USC \u00a711003.\n- Since the only regulated chemicals at the facility are flammable substances, Plains Dairy coordinates emergency response actions with the local fire department. \n- Appropriate mechanisms are in place to notify emergency responders when there is a need for a response.\n- Annual emergency response coordination activities are performed .\n- Annual notification exercises are performed.\n\nEmergency Response Coordination Activities\nThe purpose of emergency response coordination activities is to coordinate response needs with local emergency planning and response organizations. The intent is for local response organizations to be made aware of the regulated substances at Plains Diary, their quantities, the risks presented by the covered processes, and the resources and capabilities at our facility to respond to an accidental release of a regulated substance. The emergency response coordination activities will consist of the following:\n- Coordinations will be completed at least annually.

Alternatively, the facility may meet the notification requirements through other exercises conducted to meet other Federal, state or local requirements, provided that the necessary notification is performed. Additionally, if a notification is made in response to an accidental release, this would also satisfy the notification requirement.\n\n\nThe facility files a Tier 2 Chemical Inventory each year with the SERC, LEPC and the Fire Department as required by sections 311 and 312 of EPCRA.\n\nA release of 100 lbs or more must be reported to the National Response Center, SERC, and LEPC in accordance with section 304 of EPCRA.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety \n\nPlains Dairy has implemented many policies and procedures to promote overall plant, worker, public, and environmental safety.
