The emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of local authorities and notification of any potentially affected neighbors.\n\nThe Lilly Materials Center, through the Lilly Technology Center, plays an active roll in its Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  A primary goal of the LEPC is to protect local citizens by developing and maintaining a coordinated emergency response plan and working with industry to minimize the impacts of chemical hazards.  Through the LEPC, citizens can obtain information about hazardous substances handled at local facilities and about emergency planning efforts designed to successfully cope with accidents if they occur.  The LEPC maintains a coordinated emergency response plan for the community detailing operational procedures to be followed in the event of an accident involving hazardous materials.  The plan is available for public inspection.\n\nThe Lilly Materials Center, through the Lilly Technology Center, actively supports local community outreach efforts through Community Advisory Panels and neighbor groups.  These panels provide useful feedback from the community and advise Lilly on community issues. Lilly also host plant tours and informative evening programs for nearby neighbors.\n\n2. THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED:\n\nThe Lilly Materials Center receives, stores, and ships a variety of chemical raw materials used in the production of various pharmaceutical products.

The following are brief summaries of these scenarios, including information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the exposure distances for each scenario:\n\nWorst-case Release Scenario(s) - Regulated Toxic Chemical - Hydrochloric Acid \n\nLilly uses hydrochloric acid primarily to adjust pH in our various pharmaceutical processes at the Lilly Technology Center. This worst-case release scenario involves the instantaneous spill and subsequent evaporation of one tote of hydrochloric acid outdoors (i.e., at the loading dock) in a 10 minute time frame. According to the EPA RMP Comp and EPA's standard weather conditions, the distance to the toxic end point is 0.5 miles. No residents are estimated to be affected by this release. The Site emergency response team has trained on the mitigation of this scenario with the use of plugging and patching training.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario(s) - Regulated Toxic Chemical -- Hydrochloric Acid\n\nThe alternative case release scenario involves a spill in the Acid Room, such as a forklift knocking over a storage rack of hydrochloric acid drums or bottles and spilling many containers. According to the CHARM (Complex Hazardous Air Release Model) model using typical weather conditions for Indianapolis, the distance to the toxic end point is 0.53 miles. No residents are estimated to be affected by this release. The Site emergency response team has trained on the mitigation of this scenario with the "

THE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND THE SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS: \n\nThe Lilly Materials Center is subject to OSHA's Process Safety Management requirements, as well as other OSHA requirements.  The facility is also subject to regulation by other agencies, including the Indiana Department of Environmental Management and the United States Environmental Protection Agency. \n\nSpecific prevention programs include proactive maintenance programs, routine vessel inspections, emergency response training, safe to work programs, employee and contractor safety programs, and accident investigation programs.\n\nAs a member of the Chemical Manufacturers Association (CMA), Lilly participates in a program known as Responsible Care . . The purpose of Responsible Care . is to commit companies to performance improvement in health, safety, and environmental quality. The Responsible Care . initiative is driven by the following guiding principles: \no respond to community concerns\no develop chemicals and products that have a safe life cycle\no make health, safety and environment a priority for new processes\no report hazards to employees, customers and the public\no counsel customers on safe use, transportation and disposal of products\no operate plants in an environmentally safe manner\no increase knowledge of product and process safety\no solve historical contamination problems\no participate in government regulation development\no promote Responsible Care . with other chemical companies\n\nIn order to participate in CMA's Responsible Care . program, Lilly has committed to meet these guidelines and incorporate them into the way it does business.

Based upon the criteria in EPA's RMP rule, we have had no chemical releases of hydrochloric acid during the past five years.\n\n6. THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\n\nEMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AT LILLY MATERIALS CENTER\nThe Lilly Materials Center emergency response plan is linked to the plans of the Marion County Emergency Planning Committee. The site's response is coordinated by plant security using the plant's emergency response teams and equipment. The emergency response plan spells out the \"hows\" of emergency response and the roles and responsibilities of the incident response and management response teams. It includes response procedures for each building/area of the plant. Regular drills test readiness and help employees practice responses to alarms and incidents. The emergency response plan has been written based on the \"one-plan\" EPA guidance and covers all topics based on that guidance. \n\nCOMMUNITY ALERT NETWORK (CAN) SYSTEM\nThe Lilly Materials Center, through the Lilly Technology Center, has implemented an innovative community emergency notification system in 1996. The Community Alert Network, or CAN, is an automated phone messaging system. Within ten minutes it can send a recorded message to everyone who lives or works within one mile of the plant site. The system calls every number up to three times if there is no answer initially. It also generates a report advising what phones were not answered. In conjunction with the Marion County emergency planning organizations, Lilly tests the CAN system annually. \n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE TEAMS Emergency Management \nSite emergency response teams from the Materials Center undergo regular training by emergency response coordinators and the curriculum team.
