The terminal functions as a storage and distribution facility for fertilizer used by local farmers to grow the crops that provide high-quality, low-cost food for families around the world.\n\nFacility snapshot\n\nAn annual volume of 60,000 to 100,000-tons of ammonia is distributed through the facility, which has been supplying farmers in central Kansas for more than 20 years.  As a terminal, the facility provides a vital link in the chain of KNC inputs.  Anhydrous ammonia, produced at KNC\u00bfs nitrogen manufacturing facilities or obtained elsewhere, is shipped to the Conway Terminal where it is stored until needed by local farmers.  \n\nImpact on the community\n\nKNC is a solid, reliable member of the Conway, KS community.  Its employees are committed to customer service and the facility is available to service farmers as needed throughout the year.  KNC\u00bfs Conway employees know their customers are also their neighbors and strive to \u00bfalways be there if someone needs us.\u00bf\n\nEmployee snapshot \n\nKNC has two full-time and two part-time employees, as well as an area manager, with nearly 50 years of combined operating experience.  Although few in number, these employees have a large impact on the community in which they live.  They have conducted facility tours for the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) ensuring plant familiarity with the community organization.\n\nKNC employees recognize community involvement and volunteerism as the most effective way to improve the communities they live in.\n\nPollution Prevention Policy \n\nKNC is committed to protecting the environment and preserving our natural resources for future generations.

The RMP Rule requires facilities handling threshold amounts of certain substances to develop a RMP and submit a Risk Management Plan.  The Program requirements include submission of the Risk Management Plan, including a  hazard assessment defining possible off-site impacts of certain regulated substance release scenarios, a five-year accident history, a description of the accidental release prevention program, and an emergency response program.\n\nThe following is the Executive Summary of the RMP for the KNC Conway Terminal near McPherson, Kansas.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances \n\nInitial construction and operation of the Conway Terminal began in 1976.  Several changes, additions and improvements since that time have resulted in the current design of the facility.  The anhydrous ammonia distributed from this facility is used as agricultural fertilizer.\n\nThe Conway Terminal is a distribution facility for anhydrous ammonia consisting of a 30,000-ton atmospheric storage tank with a secondary containment dike, a 30,000-gallon pressurized ammonia storage vessel, a product heater, refrigeration compressors and assorted vessels and piping.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is the only chemical substance regulated by the EPA\u00bfs RMP rule that is used or stored at the Conway Terminal.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Program\n\nIt is K"

KNC is committed to implement the plan in response to any accidental release to minimize the impact to employees, the community and the environment.  The response plan is coordinated with the LEPC and emergency response agencies.

The impact of these potential releases must be quantified in accordance with release criteria dictated in the rule.  The projected impact distance is determined using EPA-defined atmospheric conditions and is intended to provide a conservative estimate of the maximum possible area that might be affected.  According to the EPA, the hypothetical \u00bfworst-case\u00bf scenario is intended to ensure that no potential risks to public health are overlooked, but the distance to an endpoint estimated under worst-case should not be considered a \u00bfpublic danger zone\u00bf.  Possible causes or the extreme improbability that such releases may occur are not considered.\n\nThe alternative release scenario definition is a release that is more likely to occur than the worst-case release; however, as with the hypothetical \u00bfworst-case\u00bf, the alternative release improbability is not taken into consideration.\n\nWorst-Case Toxic Release \u00bf Anhydrous Ammonia \n\nAnhydrous ammonia is a colorless gas with a strong pungent odor and is one of the most widely used industrial chemicals.  It is prepared industrially from natural gas, steam and air.  Some of this ammonia is used for direct injection into croplands as a fertilizer.  A large amount of industrial ammonia is reacted with carbon dioxide to make urea fertilizer or reacted to make ammonium nitrate f"

Direct liquid contact to the skin can cause severe burns.\n\nKNC has considered potential \u00bfworst-case\u00bf releases from the refrigerated atmospheric storage tank which is passively mitigated by a secondary containment dike and the bullet tank, the two largest vessels onsite.\n\nKNC\u00bfs hypothetical \u00bfworst-case\u00bf scenario involves an anhydrous ammonia release from the terminal\u00bfs 30,000-ton atmospheric storage tank.  As required by the rule, the hypothetical \u00bfworst-case\u00bf release assumes that this entire quantity is released in 10 minutes as a result of a catastrophic failure of the tank.  This unlikely event was modeled with a publicly available model (DEGADIS), which has been demonstrated to provide reasonable estimates of concentrations and distances associated with this type of release event.  The impact of this release scenario is predicted to extend beyond the facility boundary and impact public receptors.\n\nWe believe this scenario is a hypothetical \u00bfworst-case\u00bf event dictated by the rule and extremely unlikely to occur for many reasons.  In addition to the stringent design controls for this type of pressurized vessel, facility maintenance and inspection programs address the integrity of process and storage vessels, including this one, and largely preclude such massive and unlikely failures.\n\nAlternative Toxic Release \u00bf Anhydrous Ammonia \n\nMore likely release events than the hypothetical \u00bfworst-case\u00bf tend to concentrate in areas where the ammonia product is handled, such as loading and other transport activities.  Generally, significantly lower quantities are involved due to numerous shutdown safeguards present throughout the terminal.  Operator intervention tends to mitigate and limit the consequences of failures.\n\nThe hypothetical ammonia alternative release scenario considered for this process is a relea"

The impact of such a release was modeled with the DEGADIS model which shows that the impact of the release would extend off-site under typical ambient conditions.  \n\nPlanned Changes for Safety Improvements \n\nSafety improvements are a continual and ongoing process at the facility which is facilitated by the Prevention Program/PSM Program.  Formal process hazard analysis is conducted at least every five years, but review is constant through management of change procedures, operator training, incident investigation and mechanical integrity programs.  As a result, changes relevant to safety occur continuously as needs are identified through these procedures and policies."
