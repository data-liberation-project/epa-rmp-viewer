This commitment is integral to the effectiveness of the site-specific programs and policies developed to prevent an accidental release of hazardous materials. Accident release prevention has been established through the development and implementation of design and installation specifications, operating procedures, maintenance programs, employee training, and continuous improvement practices. The purpose of an accidental release prevention effort is to prevent the occurrence of a highly hazardous chemical incident or to minimize the potential consequences of an accidental release. In the event of a highly hazardous chemical incident or emergency, employees, visitors, and contractors are trained to act according to the site-specific Emergency Action Plan. \n\n\n\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nVirginia Poultry Growers Cooperative, Inc. located at 6349 Rawley Pike, Hinton, Virginia 22831, is a poultry processing and storage facility, operating as VPGC, LLC. For this facility, the Risk Management Program (\"RMP\") regulated substance present is anhydrous ammonia (ammonia), which is utilized as a refrigerant for the closed-loop mechanical refrigeration systems. The closed-circuit ammonia refrigeration systems provide process cooling and refrigerated warehouse storage capabilities to maintain product quality. Ammonia, when properly used, has proven to be a safe, reliable, and efficient refrigerant, though, because of moderate toxicity and slight flammability, ammonia is considered a highly hazardous chemical.\n\n\n\nDue to the operating inventories of the ammonia refrigeration systems, as well as Process Safety Management (\"PSM\") applicability, this facility is covered under Program Level Three [3] requirements of the RMP r"
