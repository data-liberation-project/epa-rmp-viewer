The Fayetteville Fire Department will be contacted if an ammonia alarm indicates a concentration that exceeds 300 ppm.  PWC Employees are not trained to respond and remediate ammonia releases.  If possible, employees are allowed to eliminate the release source (i.e. closing valves, shutting down pumps, etc.) or contain the release.  \n\nDescription of the Facility\n\nThe BWGP is located on SR 1723 (Custer Ave.), Fayetteville, North Carolina.  BWGP is situated about four miles northeast of the city of Fayetteville area and approximately 1.5 miles east of the Cape Fear River.\n\nBWGP is an intermediate peaking electrical generating facility consisting of eight gas turbine generating units (2 simple and 6 combined cycle) rated at 28.5 MW each, burning natural gas as the primary fuel, with #2 fuel oil as a backup.  In addition, there is a Thermal Energy Storage (TES) Unit, cooling tower, and various support buildings and structures located at the site.  With anhydrous ammonia as refrigerant and ice as the thermal storage medium, the TES increases output by cooling the air entering the turbines that generate electricity.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia (AA) is a cryogenic utilized as a cooling agent within in the refrigeration system that makes the ice.  Anhydrous ammonia is a chemical made up of one part nitrogen and three parts hydrogen.  The physical and chemical properties of this chemical make it one of the most potentially dangerous chemicals.  Anhydrous means without water.  When AA contacts water, it rapidly combines with the moisture and forms ammonium hydroxide.  If the liquid or gas contacts body tissue, especially the eyes, skin and respiratory tract, it will rem"

Emergency equipment is maintained in prime condition and includes SCBA for protection during evacuations.  During Emergencies the Lead Operations staff member will serve as the Incident Coordinator, until the area respondents take charge of the incident.\n\nBecause of the rural nature of the location, BWGP coordinates training programs with the local fire and rescue teams.
