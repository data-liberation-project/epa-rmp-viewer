Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n\nIt is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules, regulations, and requirements.  Safety depends upon the manner which we handle these products combined with the safety devices, policies, and procedures and good engineering design and practices in the operation of the process.  These include aggressive safety programs such as our Basic Safety Process and our Responsible Care Codes of Management Practice.  \n\n2. The stationary source and regulated substance:\n\nThe applicable stationary source and regulated substance is the processing of Arsine.  This is manufactured under vacuum using a chemical reaction to generate the gas.  The aggregate storage of this product makes RMP applicable.\n\n3. Clarifications to the Alternate Case Scenario include: Quantity released is less than one pound (0.2 pounds). The EPA default value is one pound.  Rate of release is less than 0.1 pound/minute (0.02 pounds/minute). The miniumum EPA value is 0.1 pounds per minute.\n\n4. The general accident release prevention program and specific prevention steps:\n\nThe facility complies with the EPA Accidental Release Prevention Plan and OSHA?s Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals regulation.  In addition, the facility implements the American Chemistry Council?s Responsible Care codes of management practice and complies with all local and state specific regulatory requirements.\n\n5. Five Year Accident History:\n\nOn July 11 2001, a loss of containment occurred with an in-process arsine cylinder in which emergency services responded.  There were no confirmed injuries.  Dozens were evaluated as a precaution.\n\n6. The emergency response program:\n\nThe facility complies with all EPA, OSHA, and Compressed Gas Association requirements for emergency response.  There are emergency programs and plans specific to the facility and surrounding industry.\n\n7. Planned changes to improve safe"
