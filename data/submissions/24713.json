Chlorine is used in the potable water treatment process for disinfection.  Changes were made to the chlorination system that are reflected by the bold text herein.\n\nThe existing chlorination system utilizes gaseous chlorine and is comprised of equipment in two main locations, the Pretreatment Chemical Building and the Filter Building Head House.  The primary chlorine supply for each location is a single, 90-ton railroad tank car located near the Filter Building Head House.  Liquefied chlorine is supplied from the rail car to each equipment location.  At each location there are two to three, one ton containers of chlorine which are used as back-up to the railroad tank supply.  At the Pretreatment Chemical Building, an additional four, one-ton chlorine containers may be stored.  The total possible quantity of chlorine stored at the Akron WSP is 200,000 pounds.\n\nChlorination equipment at each location includes chlorine container scales, an evaporator and chlorinators.  The average daily chlorine usage at the Akron WSP is approximately 2,000 lbs. per day.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe City of Akron Water Supply Plant's (WSP) approach to chemical safety focuses on training and safety awareness.  Plant operators are annually trained on operational and safety practices associated with chlorine and chlorine feed equipment.  The training program currently utilizes videotape presentations in addition to presentations by local chlorine supply professionals to routinely refresh operators' understanding and knowledge base on the safe handling procedures and accident prevention procedures for chlorine.  The Akron WSP is a secure facility and only authorized plant personnel maintain and handle the chlorine containers and feed equipment.  "

A new, updated Emergency Response Plan has been prepared.  The City will continue to coordinate emergency preparedness with the City of Kent Fire Department and the Portage County Local Emergency Planning Committee.  A new management program, training program and Operations and Maintenance Manual have also been developed and will be utilized by the WSP staff to safely manage and operate the chlorine facilities in the near future.\n\nThe City is currently planning to eliminate the use of chlorine by the beginning of 2004.  Disinfection of the finished water will be accomplished by application of liquid sodium hypochlorite upon completion of construction of a new Chemical Building.\n\nWORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nThe Akron WSP uses one 90-ton rail car along with a back-up system utilizing one ton containers.  The one ton containers are used only when switching the rail cars.  The chlorine piping from all sources of chlorine are interconnected, thus making it one source.  The piping conveys liquid chlorine to evaporators which, in turn, feed gas to the chlorine ejectors.\n\nThe worst case scenario assumes the complete release of the 90-ton rail car within the prescribed 10-minute period.  The model used for this scenario is USEPA's RMP Comp.  No passive mitigation factors were used in the RMP Comp model as the rail car is outside when in use.  The outcome of the worst case scenario suggests that an area greater than 14 miles from the WSP may be affected by the complete, instantaneous release of 90-tons of chlorine.  The estimated population affected by this scenario is 411,356 according to the U.S. Department of Commerce, Landview III program, 1997.\n\nALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nA Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) was completed by Akron"

Through the PHA process the \"most likely\" release scenario was determined to be leakage through valve packing on a 3/4-inch isolation valve.  Model scenarios were not found for this specific scenario.  However, the American Water Works Association Research Foundation Compliance Guidance and Model Risk Management Program for Water Treatment Plants provides useful, similar scenarios in Table 5-5.

The release rate of 0.44 pounds per minute from this scenario was applied to the Akron WSP identified alternative case scenario and considered a 10-minute reaction time to address such a leak.  The modeling was completed using RMP Comp and no mitigation factors were used.  The outcome of this alternate case scenario suggests that an area less than 0.1 miles from the WSP may be affected.
