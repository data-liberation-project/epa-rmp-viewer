The accidental release prevention and emergency response policy includes working with the surrounding community and local emergency response agencies to promote a spirit of cooperation and teamwork, to orchestrate an effective contingency plan in the unlikely event of a process incident occurring at the facility. The emergency response plan includes procedures for notifying the Lynn Fire Department, if necessary.\n\n(b) The Stationary Source and Substance Handled: The Lynn Water Treatment Plant is a stationary source operating for the purpose of treating surface water for use in households, businesses, and industries within the Lynn and surrounding communities.  Chlorine, which is a regulated, toxic substance, is used as part of the treatment process.\n\n(c) General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:  The City of Lynn has implemented a comprehensive program to safely manage chlorine at the Lynn Water Treatment Plant located at 390 Parkland Avenue in Lynn, Massachusetts.\n\nThe Lynn Water Treatment Plant is a public utility operated by a private contractor (Veolia).  Operations are subject to OSHA standards enforced through the federal Department of Labor.  There have been no accidents occurring within the last five years at the facility and a wo"

Additionally, facility personnel receive ongoing safety training, including First-Aid/CPR, Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response (HAZWOPER), and ongoing training to maintain professional certifications.\n\n(d) Five Year Accident History:  There have been no accidental releases meeting the definition contained in 40 CFR \u00a768.42(a) within the last five years of operation, or in the history of the plant.\n\n(e) Emergency Response Program And Exercises:\n\nNOTE: The facility is considered a \"non-responding stationary source\" for chlorine releases, per 40 CFR \u00a768.90(b).\n\nThe Lynn Water Treatment Plant has developed a comprehensive Emergency Action Plan. The plan addresses fires, explosions, spills or releases of hazardous chemicals (including chlorine), severe weather, and other potential emergency conditions. The plan details response actions by facility personnel for such emergencies, safety and emergency equipment, communication responsibilities, and coordination with off-site responders, as well as notification of local, state, and federal agencies.\n\nThe Emergency Action Plan includes emergency response to chlorine releases. Should an emergency release of chlorine occur at the facility, the facility will be evacuated, the Lynn Fire Department will be notified, and the Fire Department will assume Incident Command.\n\nNotification Exercises:  Annually, the Lynn Water Treatment Plant coordinates emergency response duties (or actions) with the Fire Department.  A Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) is developed from these exercises. \n\n(f) Planned Changes to Improve Safety: The Lynn Water Treatment Plant completed its most recent Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) in the first quarter of 2024. As a result of the PHA review, a number of improvements to the risk management program have either been completed or are planned.  The improvements are intended to improve the safety of the process and minimize the potential for a release."
