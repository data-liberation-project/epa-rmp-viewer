      "SummaryText": "The Rust-Oleum Distribution Center in Kenosha, Wisconsin warehouses products to be shipped for wholesale and retail purchase.  Included are up to 25 million aerosol cans, each of which uses liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) as the carrier propellant (CAS 68476-86-8).  The LPG mixture is 69% propane / 31% isobutane with approximately 1 ounce of propellant in each aerosol can. Although LPG is not a 112(r) chemical as identified in 40 CFR 68.130 for flammable substances, both propane (74-98-6) and isobutane (78-28-5) are listed.  Based on the propellant composition, Rust-Oleum has prepared a Risk Management Plan (RMP) to manage the storage of a flammable mixture (0-11-11).\n\n\n\nFor this RMP, a worst-case Offsite Consequence Analyses (OCA) for the flammable mixture was prepared.  This worst-case OCA scenario assumes a release from a single aerosol can which represents the largest capacity vessel in storage.  While approximately 1 ounce of the aerosol can is propellant, the remaining contents include a mixture of flammable solvents which would also ignite as part of the release scenario.  As such, the OCA assumes the weight of the entire 17 ounce aerosol can igniting in a vapor cloud explosion, combusting 1.06 pounds of the 112(r)-listed substances and aerosol can contents mixture.  \n\n\n\nThe overpressure endpoint is calculated to be 0.008 miles away from the centroid of the warehouse building.  Mitigating factors for fire walls, sprinkler systems, and the building itself were not used to reduce the estimated impact area.  The blast distance does not exceed the warehouse footprint, making it unlikely that any public receptor would be exposed. \n\n\n\nBased on the results of the OCA and facility location, there are no public or environmental receptors within the worst-case OCA scenario radius of 0.008 miles, such that this facility is eligible for Program 1 status.\n\n\n\nNo accidents have occurred during the previous five years.\n\n\n\nThis RMP is being updated and resubmitted as a direct r"

During this inspection the Risk Management Program Guidance for Warehouses (40 CFR Part 68) was reviewed and discussed with an agreement of determination that a single aerosol can should be used when considering the worst-case OCA.  Based on the results of the OCA, the facility level status changed from Program 2 to Program 1. "
