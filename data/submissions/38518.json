Senior Management of the City of Kennewick and the Public Works Department coordinate efforts to minimize the possibility of a release and respond in a unified way to any such releases. All City of Kennewick field employee's use a safety standard incorporated through a Field Risk Management Committee and general safety policies.  Public Works applies Process Safety Management (PSM), which is implemented through an employee, initiated safety standard. Incident Command System (ICS) is mandated for all releases.

Efforts are coordinated through Benton County Emergency Management during a release scenario.    \n\nTHE FACILITY AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCE:\nThis facility is located at 416 North Kingwood between the streets of East Bruneau and East Columbia Drive in the city of Kennewick, Washington.

      "SummaryText": "EVENTION PROGRAM:\nProcess Safety Management (PSM) as defined in OSHA and WISHA was implemented in 1996 with the program becoming the safety standard in 1997.  This is a Public Works safety program is for the highly hazardous chemicals chlorine and ozone.  This is unique safety standard for the City of Kennewick.  It revolves around employees working with these hazardous chemicals.  PSM is initiated through a committee of seven employees.  Only two of these employees represent management.  Management did not dictate what, when and where for this safety standard.  The key points of this very pro active safety program are:\n1. Dissemination of Process Safety Information to all entering the workplace including employees, contractors and the public.\n2. Operating Procedures laminated to all process equipment.\n3. Training for all public works personnel with mandatory written exams.  Special training by factory representatives on all new equipment installed.\n4. A pre-start up safety review annually or after any extended outage of more than twenty four hours.\n5. Mechanical integrity of process components assured through change out written procedures.\n6. Management of change to process procedures which are instituted through levels of responsible persons.\n7. Incident investigation mandated through an independent safety committee of the City of Kennewick.\n8. Emergency Planning and Response Training mandated yearly.\n9. Compliance Audits to be conducted every four years by an independent City of Kennwick Safety team with assistance from Washington State Department of Labor and Industries and bi-annually by the PSM Committee.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\nThere have been no releases of chlorine gas at this facility ever.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\nThe ERP is coordinated through Benton County Emergency Management.

In 2003, Compliance Audits will be completed along with a scheduled safety inspection from Washington State Labor and Industries Inspector.  The Waste Water Treatment Plant is in the process of changing disinfection processes from chlorine to ultra violet light.  The completed changes were done in the year 2000."
