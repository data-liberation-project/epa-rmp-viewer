Senior Management of the City of Kennewick and the Public Works Department coordinate efforts to minimize the possibility of a release and respond in a unified way to any such releases. All City of Kennewick field employee's use a safety standard incorporated through a Field Risk Management Committee and general safety policies.  Public Works applies Process Safety Management (PSM), which is implemented through an employee, initiated safety standard. Incident Command System (ICS) is mandated for all releases.  ICS is planned around a unified command system between the City of Kennewick's Fire, Police, and Public Works Departments.  Efforts are coordinated through Benton County Emergency Management during a release scenario.    \n\nTHE FACILITY AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCE:\nThis facility is located at 416 North Kingwood between the streets of East Bruneau and East Columbia Drive in the city of Kennewick, Washington.  It is the fenced compound at the City of Kennewick's Waste Water Treatment Plant.  As you enter the treatment plant by the Bruneau Street gate, it is the first structure on your right (South).  The building is constructed of metal.  Chlorine gas is stored in one ton cylinders.  The capacity of this facility is twelve full containers.      \n\nPrimary disinfection at this facility is ultra violet light and a standby chlorine gas system used in the disinfection process at the Waste Water Treatment Plant is located at the City of Kennewick's Water Treatment Plant.  The chlorine gas is injected into process water and piped to the Waste Water Treatment Plant.  All gas injection process equipment is off site of this facility.\n\nGENERAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PR"

This is a Public Works safety program is for the highly hazardous chemicals chlorine and ozone.  This is unique safety standard for the City of Kennewick.  It revolves around employees working with these hazardous chemicals.  PSM is initiated through a committee of seven employees.  Only two of these employees represent management.  Management did not dictate what, when and where for this safety standard.  The key points of this very pro active safety program are:\n1. Dissemination of Process Safety Information to all entering the workplace including employees, contractors and the public.\n2. Operating Procedures laminated to all process equipment.\n3. Training for all public works personnel with mandatory written exams.  Special training by factory representatives on all new equipment installed.\n4. A pre-start up safety review annually or after any extended outage of more than twenty four hours.\n5. Mechanical integrity of process components assured through change out written procedures.\n6. Management of change to process procedures which are instituted through levels of responsible persons.\n7. Incident investigation mandated through an independent safety committee of the City of Kennewick.\n8. Emergency Planning and Response Training mandated yearly.\n9. Compliance Audits to be conducted every four years by an independent City of Kennwick Safety team with assistance from Washington State Department of Labor and Industries and bi-annually by the PSM Committee.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\nThere have been no releases of chlorine gas at this facility ever.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\nThe ERP is coordinated through Benton County Emergency Management.
