      "SummaryText": "Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nWe at Bayer HealthCare are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is the basis of having a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. If such a release does occur, we are prepared to work closely with the Berkeley Fire Department which provides highly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\n\nThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nOur facility's primary activities encompass biotechnological pharmaceutical manufacturing and research.  We have one regulated substance present at our facility, anhydrous ammonia, which is used for process equipment refrigeration.  The maximum inventory of anhydrous ammonia at our refrigeration facility is 15,000 lbs.\n\n\nThe Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\n\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used EPA's RMP Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration Reference Tables/Equations.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from the ammonia refrigeration process.  The scenario involves the spill of liquid ammonia resulting in release of 4,140 lbs.  in a gaseous form over 10 minutes.  Passive mitigation controls, the building enclosure was taken into account to calculate the consequences of the scenario.  Under worst case weather conditions, namely Class F atmospheric stability and 1."

      "SummaryText": "5 m/s windspeed, a maximum distance of 0.4 miles from the source is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L.\n\nThe alternative release scenario submitted for Program 3 toxic substances as a class involves a heat exchanger tube failure in an ammonia condenser.  Ammonia, at higher pressure than the cooling water, would readily be absorbed by the cooling water, and would flow to the top of the cooling tower in the water.  As it discharges from the pipe, some ammonia would evolve from the aqueous ammonia solution and would drift downwind.  Under atmospheric conditions of Class D atmospheric stability and 3.0 m/s windspeed specified by the Guidance for alternative scenario releases, a maximum distance of 0.1 miles from the source is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L, which for almost all wind directions, causes the plume to remain within the site's property lines.\n\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  The anhydrous ammonia refrigeration process at our facility is subject to the California OSHA PSM standard under 8 CCR 5189.\n\nThe following sections briefly describe the elements of our release prevention program currently in place at our stationary source.\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nBayer HealthCare maintains a detailed record of written safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with the anhydrous ammonia refrigeration process.\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that potential hazards associated with the anhydrous ammonia refrigeration process are identified and controlled.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is a Hazard and Operability Study (HAZOP).  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified pe"

Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered process, Bayer HealthCare maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved with the processes.\n\n\nTraining\n\nBayer HealthCare has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees that are operating the covered process are completely competent in the operating procedures associated with this process.  New employees receive basic training in process operations followed by on-the-job supervision until they are deemed competent to work independently.  Refresher training is provided at least every year and more frequently as needed.\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nBayer HealthCare carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper functionality.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\n\nManagement of Change\n\nWritten procedures are in place at Bayer HealthCare to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.

These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nBayer HealthCare conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nBayer HealthCare promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nBayer HealthCare truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation to the RMP rule in particular information resulting from process hazard analyses.\n\n\nContractors\n\nOn occasion, our company hires contractors to conduct specialized preventive maintenance and construction activities.

Due to our stringent release prevention policies, there has been no accidental release during this period.\n\n\nEmergency Response Plan\n\nBayer HealthCare carries a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.\n\nCity of Berkeley is the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) with which our emergency plan has been coordinated and verified.\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSeveral developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program.  Identifying quantitatively the impact to the environment of aqueous ammonia being discharged from the Diffusion Tank to the sanitary sewer following a release from the process of ammonia through a safety relief valve is representative of the steps we are taking to identify hazards to improve safety at our facility.  All changes proposed are expected to be resolved by 6/30/2004."
