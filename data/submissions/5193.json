As one of only three municipal waste water treatment plants in the City of Clearwater (the City), the Facility is a critical part of the City's municipal waste water treatment system.  \n\nThe City is committed to operating this and its other facilities in a manner that is protective of the health and safety of City and Contractor employees, the public, and the environment.  In addition, the City is committed to operating this and its other facilities in full compliance with all applicable Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulatory requirements.\n\nTo ensure that the Facility is operated in a safe manner and in compliance with applicable OSHA and EPA regulations relevant to accidental release prevention, the City has developed a separate Process Safety Management (PSM) Plan and a Risk Management Plan (RMP).  Among the important components of the RMP are the City's system of policies and procedures for operation and maintenance of the regulated processes and the City's Emergency Response Plan (ERP) specific to this Facility.  \n\nThe City has designated their Water Pollution Control Superintendent as the individual with primary responsibility and accountability for seeing that the RMP and its associated components accurately reflect Facility conditions and that the RMP is fully implemented at the water pollution control facilities.   \n\n\n1.2 STATIONARY SOURCE DESCRIPTION\n\nThe Facility is designed to treat waste water from the City's sanitary sewer system.  Among the various processes that comprise the overall treatment operation are disinfection (to remove potentially harmful biological contaminants) and dechlorination (to control the concentration of residual chlorine in the tr"

These are essential processes to the overall performance of waste water treatment.  \n\nDisinfection is accomplished by the addition of chlorine to the waste water. Chlorine is delivered to the Facility and stored in one-ton containers as a liquid under pressure.  Within the container, chlorine gas is present in the head space.  When a container is placed in use, chlorine gas is drawn off the head space for use in the process, and additional liquid volatilizes within the container.  \n\nThe maximum intended chlorine inventory at this location is 20,000 pounds, stored in ten one-ton containers.  Only two containers (4,000 lb) are on-line and in use at any given time.  Two additional containers (4,000 lb) remain in a stand-by mode connected to a manifold associated with the process such that when the two active containers are empty, the two stand-by containers can be brought on line without interruption to the disinfection process.  The remaining six one-ton containers (12,000 lb) are stored on trunnions adjacent to the process so that they are readily available as replacements for empty containers.  Based on the need for uninterrupted waste water treatment, the critical importance of the disinfection process, and the anticipated flow rate through the Facility, 20,000 lb of chlorine is considered to be the minimum feasible inventory.   \n\nDechlorination is accomplished using sulfur dioxide, which is delivered to the Facility and stored in one-ton containers as a liquid under pressure.  Within the container, sulfur dioxide gas is present in the head space.  When a container is placed in use, sulfur dioxide gas is drawn off the head space for use in the process, and additional liquid volatilizes within the container.  \n\nThe maximum intended sulfur dioxide inventory at this location is 12,000 pounds, stored in six one-ton containers.

The remaining four one-ton containers (8,000 lb) are stored on trunnions adjacent to the process so that they are readily available as replacements for empty containers.  Based on the need for uninterrupted waste water treatment, the importance of the dechlorination process in conditioning the effluent prior to discharge, and the anticipated flow rate through the Facility, 12,000 lb of chlorine is considered to be the minimum feasible inventory.  \n\n\n1.3 WORST CASE AND ALTERNATIVE CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nThe worst case release scenario involves a release of 2,000 lb of chlorine over a period of ten minutes.  This is the quantity of a full ton container, which is the largest single vessel associated with the process, and the time period for release required by the regulatory definition of the worst case scenario.  Consideration was given to a release of 2,000 lb of sulfur dioxide, however, this resulted in a shorter distance to toxic endpoint, and thus, did not represent the worst case release.  There are presently no chlorine system passive mitigation measures in place at the Facility that would limit the quantity of the release as defined by the regulatory requirements.\n\nIn addition to assuming a release of the total quantity of chlorine in a full ton container, the worst case scenario included other worst case assumptions, such as a low wind speed (1.5 meters per second (m/s)), a highly stable Class F atmosphere, and the maximum ambient temperature over a three year period (100oF).  These worst case assumptions contributed to a highly conservative, large distance to the chlorine toxic endpoint of 0.0087 milligrams per liter (mg/L), or 3 parts per million (ppm), as defined by the regulations.  Under these worst case conditions, the toxic endpoint for chlorine was"

There were no known environmental receptors, such as wildlife refuges, within this area.  \n\nIt is important to recognize that the regulations require the identification of the potentially impacted population using a circle with a radius that is the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint.  In actuality, the released gas would most likely take the form of an elongated plume, impacting the population within only a portion of the circle located in the downwind direction from the source.  The size of the actual impacted population would therefore likely be only a fraction (estimated to be on the order of 20%) of the potentially impacted population identified in the worst case release scenario analysis.  Thus, a more reasonable estimate of the potentially impacted population, assuming the worst case release scenario, would likely be on the order of 7,200.\n\nIt is also important to note that the toxic endpoint of 3 ppm used to determine the maximum distance from the source for estimating potential impacts is at the low end of the 3 ppm to 5 ppm range likely to cause mild health effects comprising a slight irritation of the nose and upper respiratory tract, and not more serious health consequences or death. \n\nTwo, more realistic, alternative release scenarios were also examined.  These are summarized below.\n\n A whip, the zinc-clad copper tube used to connect containers to the manifold, breaks resulting in the release of the contents of a half-full container of chlorine over a 30-minute period.

This program is documented in this RMP.

This ERP has been communicated to the Clearwater Fire and Rescue Department (CFRD) and the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  It is the City's policy with regard to emergency response that its personnel are trained to the First Responder Awareness Level.  These are individuals who are likely to witness or discover a hazardous substance release and who have been trained to initiate an emergency response sequence by notifying the proper authorities of the release.  They would take no further action beyond notifying the authorities of the release.  Thus, it is the City's policy for employees to call 911 in the event of a release emergency and allow the local Hazardous Materials (HazMat) Response Team to mitigate the release conditions.  The CFRD is presently responsible for determining when evacuation of off-site areas is necessary, and for public notification.\n\n\n1.7 PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe RMP incorporates a number of modifications to Facility procedures designed to improve employee safety awareness, enhance safe operations and maintenance of the chlorine and sulfur dioxide systems, reduce the potential for accidental releases to occur, and increase the speed and effectiveness of the Facility's response should a release occur."
