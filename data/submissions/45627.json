      "SummaryText": "We use anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant to provide cold areas for our meat processing operations. Anhydrous ammonia is a very effective refrigerant, and does not contribute to ozone depletion or greenhouse gases. However, it is considered hazardous by EPA and OSHA. The hazardous and toxic properties of anhydrous ammonia make it necessary to observe certain precautions when handling and using anhydrous ammonia for refrigeration purposes. Overall, the prevention of unnecessary human exposures, reducing the threat to our own personal health as well as our co-workers, and reducing the threat to nearby members of the community is the main goal of incorporating this Risk Management Plan into our daily operations. It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations. Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle and use anhydrous ammonia combined with the operations and maintenance procedures provided by the manufacturer of the ammoniarefrigeration system, as well as the training of our employees.\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is to process meat from carcasses. To aid in the quality of our process, we use an ammonia refrigeration system for cooling and freezing our products. The refrigeration system supplies several rooms throughout the facility. Anhydrous ammonia is circulated through equipment in the facility in a closed system to provide areas with temperature control from 40 F to ?40 F. Anhydrous ammonia is liquefied under pressure in the storage vessel which is located outside, on ground level, north of the utility building. The maximum amount of anhydrous ammonia in the system is 98,000 pounds.\n\nOur employees conduct proper start-up procedures as listed in the manufacturer's Operation & Maintenance manual for the refrigeration system. These personnel also review the operating procedures and maintenance tasks, when needed, to ensure the proper and safe use of the ammonia in the refrigeration system and to ensure the preven"

Any actual system maintenance is completed safely when required. The mechanical integrity of the system is completed by keeping a listing of parts recommended by the manufacturer for change-out when needed. Maintenance personnel on staff assist in the mechanical integrity and general maintenance up-keep of the system. The facility has a Process Safety Management program that is being incorporated into the daily routine to comply with the Level 3 Prevention Program Requirements under EPA?s RMP requirements, and to comply with OSHA's Process Safety Management requirements. Creekstone Farms also has a lockout/tagout program, hazard communication program, confined space entry program, and an emergency action plan to aid in the prevention of accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.\n\nThere has been one accident at the facility requiring reporting under the RMP regulation during the previous five-year period. This accident resulted in recordable injuries to two employees. The approximate amount of ammonia released during this incident was 10 pounds. There was no off site impact, and emergency responders were not required to respond to the facility.\n\nThe emergency action plan was developed and has been coordinated with the Arkansas City Fire Department and the Cowley County LEPC. If an anhydrous ammonia release occurs at the facility, employees will notify emergency and maintenance personnel on duty to inform them of a release. Maintenance employees will determine the extent of a release, and take other notification/evacuation procedures if the release warrants such action. The emergency action plan consists of maintenance personnel isolating the release point by shutting off supply valves to the affected release point, or by a manual shutdown of the entire refrigeration system if necessary. If this action does not stop/mitigate t"

Employees at Creekstone Farms will be evacuated from the facility, and will assemble at an area up-wind from the facility. At this time, a head count will be made to insure all employees are accounted for according to area managers.\n\nThe worst case scenario identified for this facility is the failure of the storage vessel and an immediate release and vaporization (within 10 minutes) of its maximum fill volume. This would result in a release of 47,000 pounds of ammonia vapor into the atmosphere. The worst case scenario does not allow for active mitigation systems, and no credit was taken for any mitigation systems. This release would result in a distance to endpoint of 4.0 miles. The area surrounding the facility is considered rural based on the flat terrain and little obstructions in the immediate area. The worst case scenario would impact approximately 13,000 persons in the entire 4.0 mile radius. This is the entire area, and does not reflect actual numbers that may be impacted due to wind direction. This information was determined by the use of EPA?s guidance documents and the Landview software program.\n\nThe alternate release scenario for this facility is based on the rupture and uncontrolled release from an ammonia loading hose. The loading operation occurs very infrequently, is manned continuously, and is conducted by trained operators using equipment that is frequently inspected. Ruptures of ammonia loading hoses are extremely rare events. The estimated rate of ammonia released during such an event would be approximately 1,800 pounds per minute. This type of release results in a distance to endpoint of 0.80 miles. There are an estimated 300 persons residing within this distance to endpoint of the facility.\n\nIt is Creekstone Farms Premium Beef?s intention to fully comply with the Risk Management Plan and the corresponding Process Safety Mana"
