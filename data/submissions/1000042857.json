Because processes at the gas plant that are regulated by the Environmental Protection\r\nAgency's (EPA's) risk management program (RMP) regulation are also subject to the\r\nOccupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM)\r\nstandard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the\r\nmanagement system in place to implement the accident prevention program.  \r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\n\r\nThe Trinidad Gas Plant encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety\r\nmanagement and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating\r\nand compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a\r\nprocess hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of\r\nthe gas plant accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the\r\naccident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is\r\nmaintained at the gas plant and addresses each accident prevention program element.  In\r\naddition, the gas plant has a number of initiatives in place that address process safety and\r\nemployee safety issues.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\n\r\nThe Trinidad Gas Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe\r\noperation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated\r\nhazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment\r\ndesign basis/configuration information.

As a company Enbridge adheres to all applicable federal, state, and local laws to ensure a safe and healthy environment for all.\r\n\r\nEmployees who enter the Trinidad Plant complete a thorough training, both in the classroom and on-the-job, that enables them to address emergency issues as they arise.  This preparation includes standard operational, emergency operational, and release prevention training.  In addition, periodic refresher courses help to keep operators' problem solving abilities up to date and in sync with our recurring safety improvements.\r\n\r\nA DESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nThe Trinidad Gas Plant, located in rural Henderson County, Texas, operates a natural gas liquids extraction process and other processes to recover petroleum products from field gas.  There are regulated flammables present on-site in excess of the threshold quantities, and as such the Trinidad Plant is an RMP Tier 3 facility. The Trindad Plant is one of the many facilities operated by Enbridge G&P (East Texas) L.P.  The facility is a natural gas compressor station that also receives, stores and introduces natural gas liquids (NGLs) into the pipeline for sale to wholesale markets.  Natural gas entering the plant is filtered and passes through molecular sieve beds where it is dehydrated.  The dehydrated gas is then compressed to a higher pressure by one of the three inlet compressors prior to entering the ethane recovery plant.  The ethane recovery plant separates ethane from the heavier hydrocarbons at a very low temperature and high pressure.  Following separation, the residue gas is compressed and enters the pipeline for sale.  The liquid component from the ethane recovery plant enters an amine unit, where the unit r"

The reference documents and their location is\r\nreadily available as part of the written employee participation plan to help employees locate any\r\nnecessary process safety information.\r\n\r\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure\r\ntreatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).  This information is\r\nsupplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known\r\nhazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For specific process areas, the gas\r\nplant has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature,\r\nlevel, composition).  The gas plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits\r\nusing process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective\r\ninstrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\r\n\r\nThe gas plant also maintains technical documents that provide information about the design and\r\nconstruction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design\r\npressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment.  This information provides a\r\nbasis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as evaluating proposed\r\nchanges to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\r\n\r\nThe Trinidad Gas Plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with\r\nthe various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is\r\nsystematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to\r\nmanage these hazards.\r\n\r\nThe gas plant primarily uses the Hazop technique to perform these evaluations.  The\r\nanalyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience\r\nas well as engineering expertise."

      "SummaryText": "as necessary to\r\nsafely perform their job task.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\n\r\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Trinidad Gas Plant has\r\nimplemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a\r\nprocess.  New employees receive basic training in gas plant operations if they are not already\r\nfamiliar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is\r\npaired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators\r\ndemonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the\r\nduties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all\r\noperators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their\r\nskills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted\r\nat least every three years.  This training is documented for each operator, including the means\r\nused to verify that the operator understood the training.\r\n\r\nContractors\r\n\r\nThe Trinidad Gas Plant uses contractors to supplement its work force during periods of increased\r\nmaintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process\r\nequipment, the gas plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work\r\nin a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in\r\ntheir workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand\r\nand follow plant safety rules, and (6) inform gas plant personnel of any hazards that they find\r\nduring their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview,\r\n(2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and\r\n(4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.  In addition, the Trinidad Gas Plant\r\nevaluates contractor safety programs and p"
