One of the major chemical ingredients used in the PU foam manufacturing process is Toluene diisocyante (mixed isomers) (TDI), CAS #  26471-62-5. Our TDI inventory is maintained above 10,000 lbs.  In accordance with the provisions of 40 CFR Part 68 (Chemical Accident Prevention Regulations), the worst case scenario was defined as the rupture of, and the immediate spillage of, the contents of a TDI railcar into a designed and constructed subsurface concrete spill containment area.  The impact of this spill was evaluated using the ALOHA model (ver. 5.4.1.2.) and resulted in the area of concern not affecting any public receptors.  The release rate, as calculated by the ALHOA model, was 0.0200 lbs./min.  \n\nThis facility has an OSHA HAZWOPER trained Hazmat Team, which will provide initial response to any and all spills, despite the substance or .  \n\nThis facility also has contracted professional emergency responders as back-up.  If required, the assistance of the Fort Smith fire department will be requested.  This facility's Emergency Response Plan has been coordinated with the LEPC and the local fire department. All facility employees responsible for the handling of hazardous substances are provided initial and refresher training in proper procedures as required by the USEPA, OSHA and DOT regulatory requirements.\n\nThere have been no accidents"
