      "SummaryText": "Central Ohio Farmers Co-op is a farmer-owned cooperative located in North Central Ohio.  Our Mt. Gilead Branch, in addition to handling grain, is also involved with providing crop services and supplies to local farmers.  Part of this supply business includes the selling of anhydrous ammonia.  Farmers use this anhydrous ammonia as a source of nitrogen for their corn.  In terms of processes, ours is a very simple one.  We purchase anhydrous ammonia in bulk truck transports and then it is transferred to smaller nurse tanks which are transported to farms to be applied primarily prior to planting.\r\n\r\nWhen our anhydrous ammonia storage area was established, it was inspected and certified by the State of Ohio Department of Agriculture.   Our storage tanks are locked out at all times.  What this means is that the valves are padlocked for safety and security.  In addition to locking out the tanks, there are other safety features such as excess flow valves, and pressure release valves to insure that the highest level of safety and security are maintained.Four Emergency Shut-offs were installed in 2016 at the tank risers, bulkhead and remotely. Digital security cameras were installed in 2014 to monitor plant activity 24 hours a day. These safety features are indicative of the commitment to safety that is shared by all employees of Central Ohio Farmers Co-op from the top down.  This commitment to safety is evident by the mandatory attendance to regular safety meetings, the training updates and reviews, and an overall genuine concern for our employees well being.                                                           \r\n\r\nWe are happy to report that we have had no incidents in the past five years.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Plan - We have an entire emergency response plan established and ready if the need arises.  It has been deemed that the Mt. Gilead Fire Department will be the primary First Responders and will be in charge of any emergency situations; the Fire Dept. and Hospital"

Our employees have been trained to know where to go and what to do in case of an emergency.  We also have good relationships with utilities and contractors if need be, and have designated emergency coordinators in place to help keep things calm and to direct operations until the fire department shows up.  We also have emergency procedures in place to help the coordinators deal with several different emergency situations.  We currently have a full-time safety director to monitor regulatory issues such as this program."
