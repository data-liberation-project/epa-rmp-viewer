We warehouse and sell fertilizers, pre-packaged agricultural chemicals, and seeds to farmers  in Tulare and Kings counties.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention - \n   The owners, management, and employees of Valley Warehouse Company at 31071 Road 68, Visalia, California, are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of Anhydrous Ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment. A detailed emergency response plan has been developed and will be implemented in the event of an accidental release.\n\nFacility Information - \n  The primary activity at the VWC facility is the storage and sale of fertilizers, in addition to, the sale of pre-packaged agricultural chemicals and seeds to farmers.\n  The regulated substance Anhydrous Ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application.\n  Anhydrous Ammonia is received by tanker truck and stored in an above ground pressure storage tank at the site. The maximum quantity of Anhydrous Ammonia handled at VWC is 65,500 pounds.\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario  -\n  Failure of the largest storage tank when filled to the greatest amount would release 65,500 pounds of Anhydrous Ammonia, which is the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.7 miles.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario - \n  The alternate release scenario, based on the five-year accident history (or the most likely potential incident) is a release from a transfer hose failure at VWC. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion 200 ppm) is 0.5 miles.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program - \n  The facility has implemented the provisions of the \"Safety Requirements for Storage and Handl"
