Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n\nThe Wacker Chemical Corporation, Polymers Division (Wacker) plant, which is located on Highway 95 in Calvert City is a Program 3 facility in the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Risk Management Plan (RMP). Under RMP, the Calvert City plant is classified as two sources:\n\n1.\tThe main plant stationary source on Highway 95 and\n2.\tThe storage, pipeline, and barge unloading source at the Tennessee River.\n\nThe largest quantity raw material feedstock, Vinyl Acetate Monomer (VAM), is used in the production of Wacker's VAE Emulsions and Sekisui Polyvinyl Alcohol. Ethylene and VAM are also used in the production of VAE and EVCL Dispersions and are present at the main plaint above threshold quantities.\n\nWacker is committed to continuous improvement in all aspects of safety and environmental performance. It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal, Commonwealth of Kentucky, and local rules and regulations. The Wacker Site Manager at the Calvert City plant is responsible for facility operation.\n\nAs a site that is compliant with the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation, the Calvert City plant strives to prevent chemical emergencies. Prevention of chemical emergencies includes specifying that all equipment, piping, vessels, tanks, etc. meet all applicable design codes and specifications. Documentation of these codes and specifications form the basis of our process safety information including flow diagrams, piping and instrument diagrams, process descriptions, and other documentation. Trained and qualified employees work with sophisticated control systems that include instrumentation, alarms, and shutdowns to keep our processes operating in safe limits that minimize adverse impacts on the employees, the surrounding community and/or environment.\n\nOperating instructions, start-up/shutdown instructions, and conseque"

Under PSM, employee involvement in all aspects of plant operations, its safety and environmental programs is required and met at the Calvert City plant. Employees are regularly trained, certified, and subject to random substance abuse checks to ensure the safety of the plant. Our Polymers Safety Process (PSP) contains many other elements including management of change, hot work procedures, and regular process hazards analysis using the hazard and operability (HAZOP) methodology.\n\nAll contractors working at the plant are subject to the same rules and procedures that Wacker employees must follow under the contractor safety program.\n\nThe emergency response plan includes Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response (HAZWOPER) training and qualifications for on-site employees. Wacker shares emergency response resources on the plant site with the Sekisui PVOH plant and Evonik. Wacker, Evonik and Sekisui participate in a partnership among the Calvert City area industries named the Calvert City Industrial Mutual Aid Program or CIMAP. This organization collaborates with community emergency responders and citizens to form a strong Local Emergency Planning Committee or LEPC. Wacker is an active member of the LEPC and the Calvert City Community Advisory Team (CAT).\n\nThis document has been prepared in accordance with the EPAA\u0092s RMP regulation (40 CFR Part 68). The substances and processes considered during the preparation of this document, the scenarios described, and modeling techniques selected were chosen based on the criteria established in the regulation.\n\n2. The stationary source and regulated substances handled:\n\nThe stationary source is the Wacker main production facility located on Highway 95 in Calvert City, Kentucky. The RMP covered processes are the Dispersions unit and the VAM storage and di"

A number of other chemicals that are not covered by the RMP regulations, may be used to adjust emulsions product properties for specific end uses. Emulsions products are used in many applications including adhesives, latex paints, and paper coatings. In the Dispersions unit, only ethylene is stored above threshold quantities and is the only chemical covered by RMP.\n\nThe VAM storage and distribution area at the main production facility receives VAM from tanks at the Tennessee River and stores it on site to continuously supply the dispersions production facility and the Sekisui PVOH production facility.\n\nThe regulated substances handled at this stationary source are:\n\n1.\tVinyl Acetate with the maximum quantity in an individual storage tank of 436,800 pounds (FB-1510). Worst case scenario for a toxic substance is a complete failure of this tank with containment within the dike. The alternative case for a toxic substance is leakage of the tank contents into the dike. If a situation presents that is unsafe to enter the dike and stop a leak, Wacker will close valves to isolate the leak.\n\n2.\tEthylene with the maximum quantity in an individual storage tank of approximately 260,000 pounds. The worst case for flammables is failure of this tank (FB-7507) and ignition of the vapor cloud, causing a vapor cloud explosion. The alternative case for flammables is a vapor cloud fire due to a release and ignition of material from this tank.\n\n3.\tThe general accidental release prevention program and specific prevention measures:\n\nKey to the plant's prevention programs are the layers of protection provided for each process. This protection starts with the facility design and construction. Wacker meets or exceeds all design and construction codes when implementing new projects in the plant.

These checks are done using non-destructive testing techniques and kept in the permanent equipment files.\nTrained operators working with current operating procedures and process safety information keep the processes operating safely and in environmental compliance. Control systems and instrumentation provide the tools to keep the process within these limits and provide the information and control to properly operate each process in normal, startup/shutdown, and emergency conditions. Instrumentation alarms alert plant operators to deviations and provide early warning to process upsets.\nIn the event an upset leads to an uncontrolled condition, process safety devices including critical interlocks that activate automatic shutdowns, pressure relief valves, rupture disks, and flame arrestors are in place to safely control upset conditions. Process areas are covered by fire sensors and flammable vapor sensors, fire sprinkler systems, monitor nozzles, dry chemical extinguishers, etc. Containment dikes around storage tanks and process areas are curbed to contain small spills and direct them to drains to the plant's chemical sewer and the wastewater treatment plant.\nEach process design is subject to detailed process hazard reviews during design, construction, and start-up. All process changes must be reviewed and approved under a detailed Management of Change procedure before any changes are made. At periods not to exceed five years, Operational Plant Hazard Reviews (OPHR's) are conducted by multi-disciplinary teams.\nThe elements of the prevention program are audited regularly at the plant and corporate levels. These audits are documented as part of the basic safety process with corrective action defined and tracked through the plant management systems.\n\n4.\tFive year accident history:\n\nNone of the stationary sources or covered processes at the Wacker plant at Calvert City has had an incident in the last five years th"

There have been no releases of VAM that have had any off-site consequences, resulted in any employee injuries, or resulted in any significant equipment damage.\n\n5.\tThe emergency response program:\n\nThe facility's emergency response program is operated jointly with its neighbors, Sekisui and Evonik, and is based on the OSHA HAZWOPER standard. Each shift has a fire and rescue squad that is led by the shift safety officer. In an emergency, the Evonik safety officer assumes on-scene command of any incident. On-site emergency resources include a fire/foam truck, a rescue truck, and a Hazmat Response trailer. In addition to these resources, Wacker is a member of the Calvert Industrial Mutual Aid Program (CIMAP) and can draw from pooled resources from surrounding plants and communities. As a member of the LEPC, Wacker regularly stages emergency response drills on and off the plant site with emergency responders from the public and private sector. LEPC members and other emergency responders regularly tour the facility to familiarize themselves with the plant, its hazardous materials, equipment, layout, personnel, and emergency procedures.\n\n6.\tPlanned changes to improve safety:\n\nThe process safety information and systems are evaluated regularly through the Operational Plant Hazard Reviews, with industry wide changes in standards, and as a result of incidents that have occurred within the chemical industry. The VAM storage tanks and the Dispersions plant have no outstanding upgrade recommendations.\n\nThe Calvert Area Emergency Warning System (CAEWS) is an emergency notification system to alert the community of a chemical and/or weather-related emergency. The system is composed of a siren network in Calvert City and Livingston County that is activated by the 911 operator.

Once a citizen has heard the siren, they can tune in to the local Calvert City radio station (WCCK) and listen for special instructions. The sirens are routinely tested one day per month.\n\nCAEWS also has a telephone notification system that can be activated by any of the ten participating plants. In the event of a chemical emergency, a plant could activate the system to notify everyone in the community within a five-mile radius of the complex. These calls notify people of the emergency, instruct them to Shelter-in-place, and tune to their local radio station for more information. The system can make an All-Clear call to notify everyone that the emergency has passed. In the event of an incident with no off-site consequences, plants can activate the system to notify emergency responders, plant personnel, and the media that no emergency exists."
