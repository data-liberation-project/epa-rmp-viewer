The Facility Policy:  The owners, management and employees of the facility are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia by utilization of proper equipment, regular inspections and maintenance, and training of all persons that work with the material.  Should an accidental release occur, the facility has coordinated with the local fire department and the local emergency planning committee to respond to any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.  Facility Information:  The primary activity at the facility is the storage of anhydrous ammonia for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.  Ammonia is stored in two (2) pressurized, steel storage tanks and multiple smaller nurse tanks.\n\n3.  The worst case release scenario is not listed in the executive summary for security reasons.  The alternate case release scenario is not listed in the executive summary for security reasons.\n\n4.  The Accidental Release Program:   The facility complies with Iowa Administrative Code Part 21, Chapter 43, Rule 43.6(200) relating to the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.  These regulations administered by the Department of Agriculture are consistent with ANSI K61.1 and OSHA 29 CFR 1910.111 regarding the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.\n\n5.
