This includes provisions of CFR 29 1910.119 (OSHA PSM) and 40 CFR part 68 E.P.A. RMP) which are systemic approaches for chemical process hazards management designed to eliminate or minimize the potential for major catastrophes caused by the release of highly hazardous chemicals.  GPC will employ these measures to ensure that the means for preventing a catastrophic release, fire, or explosion are understood and to ensure the necessary preventative measures and lines of defense are installed and maintained.  Every person on site is included in these measures and management will ensure they are properly established and utilized.\nB. GPC is located in Davies County, Washington Indiana.  The facility is built on an area that covers 800 acres.  GPC is a corn wet miller.  GPC produces beverage and denatured alcohol, animal feed, starchs, maltrodextrins and corn syrup solids.  GPC facilities include storage tanks and processes typical of a corn wet milling plant.  \n\n[The primary plant operations of concern include:]\n7 Railcar and tank truck unloading areas.\n7 Ethylene oxide storage and transfer systems.\n7 Sulfur Dioxide (Anhydrous) unloading, storage and transfer system.\n\nUse of regulated substances.\nEthylene oxide is used in the process to produce various starches.\n\tSulfur Dioxide is used in the corn steeping process.\n\t\tQuantities handled or stored.\n\tEthylene Oxide\n\t\tMinimum inventory\t\t-0-\n\t\tMaximum inventory\t\t231,000 lbs.\n\tSO2 \n\t\tMinimum inventory\t\t16,850 lbs.\n\t\tMaximum inventory\t\t198,130 lbs.\n\t\nC. Off-site consequences analysis, worst case and alternative case release scenarios-dispersion modeling, etc., etc. (LaFayette)\n\nD. The general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps at GPC includes but are not limited too:\n7 All elements of CFR 29 1910.119 (OSHA PSM)\n7 NFPA (National Fire Protection Association)\n7 E.P.A.,"

Based on the findings and recommended actions of the P.H.A.'s changes to improve safety will be implemented as deemed necessary.\n\nE. The facilities emergency response program is coordinated with the city of Washington's Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).\nSafety committees consisting of salaried and hourly operating personnel will evaluate and implement, as deemed prudent, safety recommendations.  In addition, plant-wide safety meeting for all GPC personnel will be held.  The Production Superintendent and the Plant Safety Director will meet on a regular basis to insure recommendations are being addressed in a timely and practical manner."
