Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nThe ConAgra Foods frozen foods facility located in Louisville, Kentucky is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent to our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with our regulated ammonia refrigeration.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of ammonia.  If such a release does occur, we are completely coordinated with the Worthington Fire Department and the Metro Louisville LEPC for emergency response support.\n\n\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nThis facility primarily produces frozen bakery (e.g., pancakes & biscuits) products and a newly installed cheese stick line.  The only Risk Management Program (RMP) regulated substance present is ammonia, utilized as the primary cooling media in our closed-loop refrigeration system.  Here is a summary of some of our recent RMP activity:\n\n\n\n?    June 1999 - Initial RMP Submittal\n\n?    June 2004 - RMP Update\n\n?    December 2008 - RMP Correction\n\n?    September 2009 - RMP Update\n\n?    October 2013 - RMP Update\n\n?    February 2016 - RMP Update (New Ownership - Ralcorp to ConAgra - Voluntary Update) \n\n\n\n The purpose of the refrigeration system(s) is to provide cold storage capabilities for perishable products.  Due to the size and characteristics of our ammonia refrigeration system, as well as Process Safety Management (PSM) applicability, this facility is covered under Program 3 of the RMP regulations.\n\n\n\n \n\n3.

The methodology used to carry out these analyses is What If Scenarios.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in refrigeration engineering and process operations, and are re-evaluated at a minimum of every five (5) years.  Any findings related to the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nFor the purpose of safely conducting activities related to our ammonia refrigeration system, ConAgra Foods Frozen Products Louisville maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation including startup, normal operations, emergency operations, normal shutdown, emergency shutdown, and pump out.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to all operators who work with the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\n\n\nThe ConAgra Foods Frozen Products Louisville facility has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that authorized employees, who are working with the ammonia refrigeration system, are competent in all relevant operating procedures.
