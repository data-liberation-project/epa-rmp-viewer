A primary aspect of this commitment is the City of Baltimore Montebello Water Filtration Plant system to help ensure the safe operation of the water chlorination process.  Our commitment is also demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our process, as well as, extensive training of our operating personnel.\r\n \r\nIn the event of an accidental release, the City of Baltimore Montebello Water Filtration Plant has procedures that are designed to control and contain the release in a manner that will be safe for our employees and will help prevent injury to the public and the environment.  The City of Baltimore Montebello Water Filtration Plant's emergency response personnel receive thorough training in handling accidental releases.  An emergency response coordinator has been assigned to oversee response activities and to coordinate response efforts with local emergency agencies. Communications with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) have been ongoing throughout the preparation of this plan and policies.\r\n\r\nIn order to effectively implement these policies, the City of Baltimore Montebello Water Filtration Plant established a management system headed by the RMP Coordinator to ensure the proper implementation and effectiveness of our Risk Management Program.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.0  City of Baltimore Montebello Water Filtration Plant and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nThe City of Baltimore Montebello Water Filtration Plant handles one substance, in two separate processes, regulated by the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard and the EPA Risk Management Program Rule ("

The regulated substance was evaluated for a possible worse-case release scenario and alternative release scenario.  It is important to understand that the City of Baltimore Montebello Water Filtration Plant has invested extensive resources to prevent releases, and the potential for a worse-case release is extremely small.  The alternative release scenario represents a more realistic potential for occurrence and is based on historical data from our process or other similar processes.  By identifying these potential releases, the City of Baltimore Montebello Water Filtration Plant has developed an extensive program to prevent such an occurrence.  This program is discussed in detail in the Prevention Program section of this plan.\r\n\r\nThe primary objective of performing the offsite consequence analysis is to determine the distance at which certain effects might occur to the public and/or the environment as a result of an accidental release.  This point is called the endpoint distance.  At distances less than the endpoint distance, the effects would be greater; at distances farther than the endpoint, the effects would be less.\r\n\r\n3.1  Hazard Assessment - Toxic Substances\r\n\r\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with Regulated Toxic Substances is a failure of a full, one ton (2000 lb) cylinder of li"

A toxic cloud formed by the evaporating chlorine would reach offsite endpoints and public receptors.\r\n\r\n\r\n4.0  Accidental Release Prevention Program - Program 3\r\n\r\nThe City of Baltimore Montebello Water Filtration Plant Chlorination Process is covered by the OSHA Process Safety Management standard.  The requirements of the OSHA Process Safety Management standard are nearly identical to the RMP Rule Program 3 Prevention Program requirements.  The Chlorination Process Prevention Program consists of the following elements.\r\n\r\n4.1  Process Safety Information\r\n\r\nThe City of Baltimore Montebello Water Filtration Plant maintains a variety of technical documents that help ensure the safe operation of our processes.  These documents address:\r\n\r\n* physical properties of hazardous substances handled,\r\n* chemical properties and associated hazards of those substances,\r\n* operating parameters and limitation(s) of the process equipment,\r\n* design basis and configuration of the equipment, and\r\n* specific chemical inventories.\r\n \r\nThe City of Baltimore Montebello Water Filtration Plant ensures that the process safety information is available to all City of Baltimore Montebello Water Filtration Plant employees, the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), and the local fire department.  The EHS & T Coordinator is responsible for maintaining and updating this information, as needed.\r\nChemical specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).
