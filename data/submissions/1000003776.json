Our prevention and emergency response practices are developed to protect the public as well as our own employees. It is our policy to comply with applicable laws, and to support and work with local emergency response agencies.\n\nDFA-Springfield has a refrigeration system which contains anhydrous ammonia (ammonia) in an amount greater than the threshold under the Risk Management Program (RMP) of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) according to Section 68 of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (40 CFR 68). The refrigeration system is designed and operated according to good engineering and safe work practices.   DFA-Springfield is coordinated with the Springfield Fire Department and the Greene County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  DFA-Springfield has an excellent safety record in preventing and minimizing releases of ammonia.\n\nFacility Information\nThe DFA-Springfield facility processes and packages dairy related products.  DFA has on-site an ammonia refrigeration system used to maintain product freshness, to meet processing requirements, and to provide cooling for employee comfort. DFA-Springfield is subject to the requirements of 40 CFR 68 because the refrigeration system contains more than the 10,000-pound threshold for ammonia, a regulated hazardous substance.\n\nAccidental Release Program \nDFA-Springfield has an accidental release prevention program to prevent and minimize the effects of a spill or release of ammonia. This program includes a training program for all operators and maintenance personnel, written maintenance and operating procedures, and a preventative maintenance program that includes regular inspections and tests of all equipment within the ammonia system."

DFA-Springfield is coordinated with the Springfield Fire Department and the Greene County LEPC.  In the event of a release, we would immediately notify our affected employees, the Springfield Fire Departments, the Greene County LEPC and initiate emergency shutdown procedures.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at this facility.  Periodic inspections and evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe practices and operations.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
