D\u00bfArrigo has developed their Risk Management Plan / Process Safety Management (RMP/PSM) Manual to document D\u00bfArrigo policies that address the implementation of these regulations. The PSM sections pertain to the prevention of accidental releases and include the Process Hazard Analysis study and procedures for operating, training, maintenance, emergency response, and others. The RMP sections pertain to management systems and include the Hazard Assessment (Offsite Consequence Analysis) Report.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE ACTIVITIES AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\nThe D\u00bfArrigo -Spreckels facility provides product cooling and short-term storage for fresh vegetables. \n \nThe facilities are located in a rural area of Spreckels.

(These areas are addressed under Management of Change, Contractor Qualifications, Hot Work Permit, and Pre-Start-up Safety Review chapters.)\n7. Verification of D\u00bfArrigo's compliance with the RMP/PSM program. This self-audit process is an important tool to confirm whether each of the elements in the Prevention Program (and the Risk Management Program) has been implemented and properly documented by D\u00bfArrigo personnel. D\u00bfArrigo has established a Management System procedure to address any shortcomings, which the audit may find. (Addressed under Compliance Audit chapter.)   \n8. Minimize employee injury and illness. (Addressed under D\u00bfArrigo's Illness and Injury Prevention Program.)\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThe D\u00bfArrigo facility had no reportable accidental ammonia releases in the last five years. The facility is currently under construction.\n  \nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nD\u00bfArrigo's Emergency Response Program is described in their Emergency Response Plan for the Spreckels facility.\n\nThis plan includes planned responses and procedures for evacuations, notifying responders and governmental agencies. The plan also includes first aid procedures for immediate care and instructions for follow-up medical care when necessary. The plan addresses training requirements for employees including production employees, supervisors, managers, and operators. Evacuation drills are an important part of the training. \n\nUnder D\u00bfArrigo's Emergency Response policy, D\u00bfArrigo employees who have been trained as First Responders may initially respond to releases that can be addressed without entering the danger area (i.e., de-energizing equipment). D\u00bfArrigo will evacuate affected area, begin notification process, and rely on off-site responders (e.g., the fire department,  refrigeration contractor).\n \nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nThe Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) study team developed recommendations to improve safety.\nKey recommendations identified du"

      "SummaryText": "ammonia quantity in each system is over 10,000 lbs.\n\nAll refrigeration systems are direct, mechanical refrigeration systems. The facility is under construction and is scheduled for operation July 2006  for the Main System. The Portable Systems are schedule for operation in August 2006. The ammonia equipment is located outside, in the Refrigeration Room and in the Refrigerated Rooms. All Main System equipment is permanently mounted.\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT\nThe regulation requires that the Worst-Case Release Scenario use the ammonia quantity in the largest vessel or pipe.\n\nNOTE: It is important to consider that the Worst-Case Scenario is extremely unlikely to occur since this scenario does not consider any safety features of the system - in either design or operation.  The scenario parameters are established by the regulation to provide uniformity for dialog between the industry, community, and regulatory agencies.\n\nThe regulation allows the facility to select the Alternate-Case Scenario.\n\nPREVENTION PROGRAM\nD\u00bfArrigo's Prevention Program is described in the RMP/PSM Manual. The RMP Prevention Program is equivalent to OSHA's Process Safety Management Program (PSM). The Prevention Program implemented by D\u00bfArrigo is essential to help prevent releases and to minimize the effects if a release does occur.\n\nKey objectives of D\u00bfArrigo's Prevention Program are briefly described below:\n\n1. Maintain current and complete refrigeration system technical information. (Addressed under the Process Safety Information chapter)\n2. Provide thorough team evaluation of the refrigeration system. The evaluation considers a number of potential problems including: mechanical problems, human errors, and external events (e.g., earthquakes). All safety recommendations developed by the team are reviewed and addressed by D\u00bfArrigo. (Addressed under Process Hazard Analysis chapter.)\n3.

Certification of refrigeration operators to safely operate the refrigeration system. D\u00bfArrigo certifies operators following completion of operator training and D\u00bfArrigo's confirmation of the operator's ability apply what they have learned. (Addressed under Training chapter.)\n5. Employee involvement in the Prevention Program. This is addressed on two levels. First, refrigeration equipment operators participate in the planning and evaluation of the Prevention Programs (e.g., Process Hazard Analysis study team, writing and/or reviewing operating procedures, Incident Investigation team, etc.). This involvement encourages ownership of the Prevention Program and positively affects the operators' day-to-day activities.  \nSecond, all D\u00bfArrigo employees (direct hires and contract) at this facility receive ammonia awareness training. Additionally, they have access to the RMP/PSM information. These activities improve the overall safety of the employees. (Both levels are addressed under Employee Participation chapter)\n6. Implementation of additional measures when changes are planned (procedural or mechanical). These measures begin before any changes are made and may include a Process Hazard Analysis, operator training, and Process Safety Information updates plus other measures required by D\u00bfArrigo's Management of Change Procedure.  \nIf a mechanical change is required and for maintenance contracts, D\u00bfArrigo has a procedure for selecting a contractor based on the company's experience and safety history. Additionally, if welding, grinding, or other Hot Work occurs inside the building and close to the refrigeration system, a D\u00bfArrigo Hot Work permit is required. The purpose of the permit and the associated Hot Work procedure is to minimize the possibility of a fire. \nFollowing completion of a mechanical change, a pre-startup safety review is requir"
