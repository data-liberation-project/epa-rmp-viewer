A primary aspect of this commitment is the CoorsTek system to help ensure the safe operation of our processes.  Our commitment is also demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our processes, as well as, extensive training of our operating personnel. \nIn the event of an accidental release, CoorsTek has procedures which are designed to control and contain the release in a manner which will be safe for our employees and will help prevent injury to the public and the environment.  The CoorsTek emergency response personnel receive thorough training in handling accidental releases.  An emergency response coordinator has been assigned to oversee response activities and to coordinate response efforts with local emergency agencies. Communications with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) have been ongoing throughout the preparation of this plan and policies.\nIn order to effectively implement these policies, CoorsTek established a management system headed by the Production Manager to ensure the proper implementation and effectiveness of our Risk Management Program.\n\n\n2.0  CoorsTek and Regulated Substances\n\n\nCoorsTek, located in Benton, Arkansas, is primarily involved in the manufacture of aluminum oxide, silicon carbide and tungsten carbide products.  To manufacture one of our products, CoorsTek utilizes two regulated substances with one substance in sufficient quantities to be covered by the Risk Management Program Rule (RMP Rule) and OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.

The regulated substances were evaluated for a possible worst-case release scenario and alternative release scenario.  It is important to understand that CoorsTek has invested extensive resources to prevent releases, and the potential for a worst-case release is extremely small.  The alternative release scenario represents a more realistic potential for occurrence and is based on historical data from other similar processes.  By identifying these potential releases, CoorsTek has developed an extensive program to prevent such an occurrence. This program is discussed in detail in the Prevention Program section of this plan.\nThe primary objective of performing the offsite consequence analysis is to determine the distance at which certain effects might occur to the public and/or the environment as a result of an accidental release.  This point is called the endpoint distance.  At distances less than the endpoint distance, the effects would be greater; at distances farther than the endpoint, the effects would be less.\n\nCoorsTek completed the Hazard Assessment and the results have been appropriately communicated to the local emegency response agencies. The Hazard Assessment has recently been updated to reflect changes in population estimates.\n\n\n4.0  Accidental Release Prevention Program Program 3\n\n\nThe CoorsTek Silicon Carbide Chemical Vapor Deposition Process is covered by the OSHA Process Safety Management standard.

Within this program, the Silicon Carbide Chemical Vapor Deposition Process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\nTo perform the PHAs, CoorsTek primarily uses the What-if/Checklist technique.

The CoorsTek mechanical integrity program includes:\n\n\u00b7 an inspection and testing program to help identify equipment deterioration and damage before the \n  equipment fails,\n\u00b7 a quality assurance program to help ensure that the new and replacement equipment meet the design \n  standards required for service in our process,\n\u00b7 procedures for safe work practices such as lockout/tagout, hot work, confined space entry and line or \n  equipment opening,\n\u00b7 training of maintenance personnel, and\n\u00b7 documentation of maintenance activities.\n\n4.6  Management of Change\n\nCoorsTek has a comprehensive program to manage changes to processes.  Under this program, all proposed changes to chemicals, equipment, and procedures for the Silicon Carbide Chemical Vapor Deposition Process must be evaluated and approved to help ensure the change does not negatively affect safe operations.  Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, and procedures are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided with any necessary training related to the change.\n\n4.7  Pre-startup Review\n\nCoorsTek performs a safety review of all new or modified processes prior to their being placed into service to ensure that these processes have been prepared to operate safely.

The review involves field verification of the construction elements and serves as a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\n4.8  Compliance Audit\n\nCoorsTek conducts periodic audits of the Silicon Carbide Chemical Vapor Deposition Process to ensure the CoorsTek Prevention Program has been effectively implemented and addresses the safety issues of our operations.  Compliance audits are conducted at least every three years by a team of hourly and management personnel who are knowledgeable of the RMP Rule and the Silicon Carbide Chemical Vapor Deposition Process.  The team evaluates the CoorsTek Prevention Program and other aspects of the CoorsTek Risk Management Program.  The results of the audit are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate enhancements to the Prevention Program are implemented.  CoorsTek maintains records of at least the last two audits conducted. The most recent Compliance Audit was conducted in December of 2003.\n\n4.9  Incident Investigation\n\nCoorsTek promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The results of the investigation are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate process e"

      "SummaryText": "nhancements are implemented.\n\n4.10  Employee Participation\n\nCoorsTek developed a written employee participation program for the Silicon Carbide Chemical Vapor Deposition Process and other aspects of our operations to ensure that the safety concerns are addressed.  CoorsTek encourages the active participation of our employees in the Prevention Program for all processes and tasks at our facility.  Employees are consulted on and informed of all aspects of the CoorsTek Risk Management Plan (RMP) and participate on PHA and Compliance Audit teams.\n\n4.11  Hot Work Permits\n\nCoorsTek established a Safe Work Permit program to control spark or flame producing activities that could result in fires or explosions in the processes at our facility.  CoorsTek utilizes a Safe Work Permit form designed after the OSHA fire prevention and protection requirements found in 29 CFR 1910.252(a).  Personnel who are to perform the Hot Work are required to complete the form which is reviewed by the area supervisor.  The form must be approved before work can proceed.  Training in the use of the Safe Work Permit form is provided to all affected personnel.\n\n4.12  Contractors\n\nCoorsTek established a program to help ensure that contractors who are used to supplement the workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction conduct their work in a safe manner.  Under the program, the record of all contractors is reviewed to ensure that CoorsTek hires contractors who can safely perform work on or near covered process equipment.  Our program ensures that contractors:\n\n\u00b7 perform their work in a safe manner,\n\u00b7 have the appropriate knowledge and skills,\n\u00b7 are aware of the hazards in the workplace,\n\u00b7 understand what to do in the event of an emergency,\n\u00b7 understand and follow the CoorsTek safety rules, and\n\u00b7 inform CoorsTek personnel of any hazards identified during their work.\n\nProgram efforts are accomplished by providing contractors with:\n\n\u00b7 a process overview,\n\u00b7 information about safety and"
