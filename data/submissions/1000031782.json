The five-year accident history\r\n\r\nA five-year accident history has not been prepared and included in the RMP since there have been no reportable incidents within the last 5 years. To prevent and/or minimize any potential future release of anhydrous ammonia, Kwik Trip, Inc (La Crosse, Wisconsin) is implementing a detailed Process Safety Management program (Preventive Program 3).\r\n\r\n6. The emergency response program\r\n\r\nEmergency response is discussed in Section 5 of the RMP. Kwik Trip, Inc (La Crosse, Wisconsin) has a detailed Emergency Response Plan (ERP) for their facility. The purpose of this plan is to provide the means for rapidly determining the appropriate response for any emergency that may develop at the facility such as an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia. Kwik Trip, Inc (La Crosse, Wisconsin) conducts scheduled drills of the emergency response plan. The Emergency Response Program is written, includes specific actions to be taken in response to an accidental release, includes procedures for informing the public and local agencies responsible for responding to an accidental release, and includes information on emergency health care.\r\n\r\n7. Planned changes to improve safety\r\n\r\nKwik Trip, Inc (La Crosse, Wisconsin) is incorporating and addressing any recommendations resulting from the Process Hazard Analysis, Offsite Consequences, and program audits. The flexibility of the program allows Kwik Trip, Inc (La Crosse, Wisconsin) to respond effectively to prevent or minimize any potential exposure of Kwik Trip, Inc (La Crosse, Wisconsin) employees, the surrounding public, and/or the environment to a release of anhydrous ammonia. Specific actions taken to improve safety are the implementation of the Program 3 Prevention Program described above, improved operator training, administrative controls, and computerized system controls.\r\n\r\n8."

This expansion involved the building of a second independent ammonia refrigeration system.  While this system is a second closed loop ammonia refrigeration system and completely independent of the original system, the two systems share the same roof line.  In some roof locations, these two systems' piping are in proximity that could allow both systems to fail simultaneously (roof collapse, air crash, major fire, etc).  For this reason, the new system was included with the 'old' system and not identified as a separate facility for the purposes of reporting.  Documentation of the equipment in the 'new' system was included as a Management of Change with the 'old' system."
