The Facility Policy\n        The owners and managment are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur , the facility is prepared to work with the local fire company , or other authorities , to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the releaseto people and the environment. \n2. Facility Information \n        The primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.\n       - Anhydrous ammonia is received , stored and distributed for direct application . \n       - The maximum quantity stored would be 51000 pounds in our 12000 gallon storage tank. \n3. The worst -case release scenario and alternative release scenario\n        a. The worst- case release scenario would be the releaseof the total contents of the storage tank released as gas for 10 minutes . The maximum quanity released would be 44000 pounds , which represents the volume of the storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards. The distance to the end point ( point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.1 miles. \n         b. The alternative release scenario is based on the most likely potential incident is a release from a break in a transfer hose . The distance to the endpoint ( point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .22 miles.\n4.  The accidental release prevention program.\n          The facilityhas implemented the provisions of \" Safety Requirements for the storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia , K-611\" published by the American National Standards Institute , Inc. and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety an Health Administration ( OSHA ) , 29 CFR 1910.111 , Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia . \n5. The Five-year Accident History \n           Ther have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the p"
