(Rose Packing), Chicago facility, for the reduction of accidental releases of hazardous materials. This Program summarizes the management, administrative, procedural, and technological controls that work together to minimize the risk to site personnel, contractors, visitors, and the community and environment at large of hazardous chemical releases. The Risk Management Plan (RMP) is organized to correspond with specific U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) RMP, Program 3 of 40 CFR 68, definitions and requirements of Subpart G, including: \n?    Introduction;\n?    Rose Packing?s policies to protect health, environment, and safety;\n?    Facility identification and regulated substances covered processes;\n?    Hazard Assessment;\n?

Rose Packing?s Policies To Protect Health, Environment, and Safety\nRisk management and safety are important concerns at Rose Packing; this RMP formalizes and documents these activities. Rose Packing is committed to conducting its operations in a safe and responsible manner and to reducing risks to human health and to the environment. It is Rose Packing?s policy to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local rules and regulations.\n\nThis RMP has identified potential hazards and has taken steps to design and maintain a safe facility in order to prevent releases, and minimize the consequences of accidental releases, which could occur. RMP addresses potentially catastrophic chemical releases that could result in immediate harm and acute health effects to offsite receptors (public and environmental).

Facility Identification\nThe Rose Packing facility is located at 4900 South Major Avenue in Chicago, Illinois. The facility is a manufacturer of fresh, smoked and processed pork products for the retail and food service industries.  Operations include packing, cooking and processing meats. Rose Packing produces Canadian Style Bacon and a full line of raw and fully cooked pork sausage, ethnic sausage and back ribs.  The facility also makes hams, smoked pork shoulder butts, sectioned and formed processed pork, fresh boneless backs, pork roasts and pork tenderloins.\n\nThe facility uses ammonia for refrigeration, and is regulated under 40 CFR Part 68, the EPA RMP Rule. There is one recirculating closed-loop refrigeration system onsite. The system originally contained a charge of 34,000 pounds of ammonia. It was recently modified via the addition of a compressor. The amount of ammonia present in the modified refrigeration system is approximately 36,000 pounds, which is above the minimum threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds. \n\nA topographic map identifying the site location is included as Appendix A. An area map is included as Appendix B. \n\nIV.    Hazard Assessment ? Worst Case Scenarios (WCS)\nAppendix C consists of the RMP*Submit Printout and contains additional information on the worst-case scenario.

This prevention program covers those processes that handle ammonia above the threshold quantity for both PSM and RMP rules. The next audit of the PSM program will occur in August of 2006 in compliance with the requirement to conduct PSM audits every three years.  The elements of the PSM / Program 3 prevention program and a brief description are listed below.\n?    Employee Participation ? Rose Packing has developed a site-specific employee participation plan that ensures employees and their representatives are consulted when conducting and developing process hazard analyses and other information required to be developed under the PSM/RMP regulation.  In addition, the employee participation program ensures employees and their representatives have access to process hazard analyses and all other information required to be developed under PSM/RMP.  Employees at Rose Packing have assisted in developing the initial PHA for the ammonia process and will participate in updating and revalidating the PHA every five years.  In addition, employees have assisted in the development of other PSM/RMP information such as the development of operating and preventative maintenance procedures.\n?    Process Safety Information ? Rose Packing has developed a site-specific PSI program that ensures information pertaining to the hazards, technology, and equipment of the process are properly developed and maintained. Process safety information for the ammonia process has been compiled and was last reviewed and updated as of February 28, 2004.\n?    Process Hazard Review ?

The Standard Operating Procedures manual was completed on January 19, 2004. Annually, the operating procedures will be reviewed and certified as accurate.\n?    Training ? Rose Packing has developed a site-specific training procedure that ensures employees operating the ammonia process have the knowledge to safely operate the process, are aware of the potential hazards of the process, and understand the causes of process problems.\n?    Management of Change ? Rose Packing has developed a site-specific management of change procedure that ensures changes (except for replacement in kind) to the ammonia process, such as additions of new equipment or changes in operating, maintenance, or other procedures are documented. \n?

Incident Investigation ? Rose Packing has developed a site-specific incident investigation procedure that ensures each incident that either results in a release or could have resulted in a release of anhydrous ammonia is investigated, within 48 hours, by a team of at least one person knowledgeable in the process.  This procedure also makes provisions to ensure a report is prepared at the conclusion of the investigation and findings are promptly addressed. \n?    Compliance Audit ? The facility completed an original RMP on June 17, 1999 for the ammonia refrigeration system that held a charge of 34,000 pounds of ammonia.

Response activities are coordinated with the Forest View Fire Department (which coordinates response activities with the Mabis 10 HAZMAT Team). This coordination effort includes providing the fire departments with site diagrams and hazardous material information, meeting with fire department personnel to discuss facility operations/processes, and periodic on-site inspections by fire department personnel.\n\nThe facility maintains an ERP on file at the plant. According to the ERP, facility employees are responsible for investigating and assisting the fire department (if necessary) with response to accidental releases of ammonia. The plan includes annual training of all employees on evacuation procedures and emergency notification procedures. The plan also includes annual training for emergency response team members. It identifies the Emergency Response Coordinators, Evacuation Coordinators and alternates. In addition to the facility ERP, the plant is included in a community emergency response plan developed by the Suburban Cook County Central Section Local Emergency Planning Committee Local Emergency Planning Committee.
