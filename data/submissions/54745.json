Inc. are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia by utilization of proper equipment, regular inspections and maintenance and training of all persons that work with that material. Should an accidental release occur, the facility has orientated the local fire department and the local emergency planning committee so they can plan for response to any release and minimize the impact of the release to the people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information: A primary activity at the facility is the storage of anhydrous ammonia to be used in the conversion process of mixed liquid fertilizers. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and used in mixed liquid fertilizers. The maximum quantity stored would be 145,000 pounds in the facilities 3 trailers The capacities of these trailers are 50,722 pounds, 48,601 pounds, and 45,677 pounds. We also store ammonia in our nurse tanks for a total storage of over 374000 lbs.\n\n3. The worst- case release scenario Information is withheld for security.\n\nThe alternate-case release scenario Information is withheld for security.\n\n\n4. The accidental release program: The facility complies with the Rules and Regulations relating to The Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia and Low Pressure Nitrogen Solutions, Equipment, Containers and Storage Facilities. These regulations administered by the Illinois Department of Agriculture are consistent with ANSI K61.1 and OSHA 29 CFR 191 0.1 II regarding storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.\n\n5. The Five-year Accident History: There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia for the covered process in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage onsite; nor to our knowledge, have any accidental releases resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property, or environmental damage.\n\n6.
