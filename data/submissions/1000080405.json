(CSW) is a public refrigerated warehouse \r\ncompany founded in 1949, operating multiple facilities in the state of Wisconsin. \r\nThe CSW Madison plant provides dry, refrigerated and frozen storage and \r\nlogistics services for manufacturers and commercial distributors. Food and food \r\ningredients are the primary items handled. CSW employees are typically involved \r\nin the forklift unloading trucks and rail cars, placing items into storage, retrieving \r\nordered items, and reloading transportation assets, as well as the administrative, \r\nsupervisory, and maintenance functions in support of these operations. \r\nApproximately 15,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia is used as a refrigerant at \r\nthis location, circulating throughout the plant in a pressurized system.
