ONE INCIDENT WAS PROBABLY UNPREVENTABLE, HOWEVER, A NEWER STYLE PUMP SEAL HAS BEEN INSTALLED TO PREVENT FUTURE INCIDENTS. THIER WAS NO OFFSITE CONSEQUENECES AND ONLY ONE EMPLOYEE WAS TAKEN TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM BECAUSE SHE FELT NAUSEATED. HOWEVER THE ATTENDING PHYSICIAN FELT THIS MAY HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY MORNING SICKNESS (SHE WAS 3-MONTHS PREGNANT) THAN AMMONIA ODORS. WE HAD ANOTHER INCIDENT WHERE ONE OF OUR EVAPORATORS WAS FROZEN IN THE VAULT AND A MAINTENANCE MECHANIC USED AN ICE PICK TO CLEAN OFF ICE AND ACCIDENTLY PUNCTURED A HOLE IN AMMONIA TUBE. WE  EVACUATED THE FACILITY WITH NO OFFSITE INCIDENT.  THIS INCIDENT MADE US REALIZE THAT OUR PROGRAMS NEEDED TO BE UPDATED AND ALL PERSONNEL INVOLVED WITH ANY AMMONIA (OR ANY ENERGIES) WILL BE TRAINED AND CERTIFIED PRIOR TO MAKING REPAIRS &/OR OPERATING EQUIPMENT. ON THE OTHER TWO OCCASIONS WERE VERY MINOR, PACKING LEAKING AND ALSO EVACUAATED THE FACILTIY FOR A FEW MINUTES. NONE OF THESE INCIDENTS WE HAD TO CALL LOCAL EMERGENCY AND OUR AMMNOIA LEVELS NEVER EXCEEDED 100 PPM. \n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\n WE FEEL THAT OUR EMERGENCY EVACUATION PROGRAM IS VERY EFFICIENT AND EVERY TIME WE HAVE HAD AND EVACUATION WHETHER PLAN"
