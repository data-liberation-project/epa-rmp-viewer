It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the New Salem Fire Department, and the Oliver County Disaster Emergency Coordinator, Francis Pulver Jr., and request that they repsond to our emergency.\n\nThis facility handles dry fertilizer, and Anhydrous Ammonia for sale to the public.  We own and operate two fertilizer and Anhydrous Ammonia plants.  This one, which is located 10 miles north of New Salem, ND, and another which is located 2 miles southwest of Hebron, ND.\n\nOur worst case scenerio for the New Salem plant, is the pull away breaking 25 ft. section of a 4 in. hose, causing vapor release.  According to the EPA's look-up endpoint, there is a .10th of a mile radius, with a total population of none, within the distance to the endpoint.  This facility complies with the EPA's accidental prevention rules and all applicable state and local code regulations.  We have never had an accident involving Anhydrous Ammonia that caused death, injury, property damage, or evacuations.\n\nThis plant, Anhydrous Ammonia Storage Facility AA-007, is inspected every 5 years by the Department of Insurance of the State of North Dakota, by the Chief Boiler Inspector, and seasonally by our plant supervisor."
