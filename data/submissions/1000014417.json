The facility is located at the retired wastewater facility, previously operated by the City of Fort Walton Beach, at the end of the North Beal Extension in Fort Walton Beach, Florida. \nChlorine gas is a regulated substance under 40 Code of Federal Regulation (CFR) part 68, and the North Beal Extension Site is a Program Level 3 facility.  This Risk Management Plan (RMP) contains OCWS practices, programs, and procedures used to prevent accidental releases of chlorine gas.  This RMP is set up to directly correspond to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\u00c2\u00bfs RMP e*submit online registration system on the Central Data Exchange (CDX).\nThe Okaloosa County Water and Sewer\u00c2\u00bfs (OCWS) approach to chemical safety is prevention. This is accomplished at the North Beal Extension Site (NBES) by ensuring personnel are properly trained in operational and safety procedures for chlorine gas cylinders. Authorized personnel at the NBES conduct regular facility and equipment self-inspections to ensure proper function.  A preventive maintenance schedule is also followed to keep equipment in good working order. \nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\nThis RMP provides written safety information relevant to chlorine gas including: hazards, chemical and physical properties of chlorine; precautions necessary to prevent exposure, including engineering controls, administrative controls, personal protective equipment, and detection and alarm equipment; control measures to be taken if physical contact or airborne exposure occurs.  Safety information can be found in Section 7.1-7.3 of this RMP.  A process hazard analysis was conducted by OCWS employees for this facility and is included in Section 7.4 of this RMP.  An"

      "SummaryText": "offsite consequence analysis, including a worst case (Section 2) and alternative release scenario (Section 3) was conducted using RMP*Comp, and considers a passive mitigation system.  \nOperational, maintenance, and general employee training is provided for employees involved with the chlorine process at the NBES, as described in Section 7.5 of this RMP. All employees presently involved in handling chlorine, and prior to operating a newly assigned process at the NBES, are trained for their job tasks.  Operational training includes an overview of the process, operating procedures, emphasis on the safety and health hazards, emergency operations including shutdown, and safe work practices applicable to operations at the NBES.  Each employee has access to this RMP which contains the written operating procedures for safely conducting operations for normal, temporary, and emergency conditions, including start-up, and shut-down during each condition. Operating limits, including consequences of deviation and ways to avoid deviation, are included. Operating procedures can be found in this RMP in Section 7.6.\nOCWS has developed and implemented a maintenance program to ensure the continued integrity of all of the equipment used for storage, handling, safety and emergency response associated with chlorine.  Chlorine is the only chemical stored at the Facility.  The purpose of the maintenance program is to reduce the risk of chlorine releases as a result of equipment failure and/or poor equipment maintenance. The maintenance program can be found in Section 7.7 of this RMP.\nSection 7.8-7.15 of this RMP also includes the following aspects of the prevention program: management of change procedures, pre-startup safety review procedures, compliance audits, incident investigation protocol, employee participation plan, hot work procedures, and contractor safety procedures. \nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThe North Beal Extension Site is a new RMP site for OCWS in 2010, and has not had an ac"

      "SummaryText": "cidental release in the last five (5) years. The protocol for responding to accidental releases is outlined in Section 6 of this RMP.\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nIn the event of a chlorine release, the Ocean City Wright Fire Department would be contacted by OCWS personnel to respond to the situation.  The Director of Okaloosa County Water and Sewer, Okaloosa County Emergency Management, and the Florida State Warning Point would be contacted in the event of a chlorine release. Section 9 of this RMP outlines emergency response procedures including the community emergency response plan, and important contact numbers.\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nThe first process hazard analysis conducted for the North Beal Extension Site identified the importance of handling chlorine cylinders with care and providing dollies for use in transporting cylinders, and conducting routine testing of the detection and alarm system on a weekly basis. This is the first process hazard analysis conducted for this site, and these findings will be incorporated into the Risk Management Program prior to start-up.  Since this is a new process at this facility, beyond what is outlined in this RMP there are no additional changes planned to improve safety at this time."
