Accident prevention is the preferred alternative. When a release occurs, we are committed to responding with the maximum of company resources and cooperate with local emergency response agencies. We will provide training and information, as requested, to local emergency response agencies. Corporate and management levels support complete compliance for all safety and environmental laws and are committed to implement a RMP/PSM plan and achieve plan goals. We encourage and require employee participation in chemical safety.\n\n\n\n1.2    FACILITY DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\n\n\nHASA, Inc. uses chlorine at its Eloy, Arizona facility. The chlorine is received in rail car quantities (180,000 lb.), above the 2,500 lb. regulatory threshold for chlorine. All processes that use the chlorine are classified as regulated process for purposes of the RMP/PSM rule. For HASA, Inc., only the sodium hypochlorite production process uses chlorine and is therefore regulated for RMP/PSM purposes. All other processes at HASA's Inc., Eloy facility do not use or have regulated chemicals above the regulatory thresholds.\n\nThe sodium hypochlorite (bleach) manufacturing process reacts liquid chlorine with a sodium hydroxide solution to produce the bleach in a continuous flow reactor. The reaction is controlled and monitored under redundant automatic control monitored by an operator. The bleach is then sent to a bleach filtering system then to storage tanks. The bleach is packaged as needed or sold in bulk tanker quantities for water treatment. Typical water treatment customers use the sodium hypochlorite to treat swimming pools, potable water disinfection or treated sewerage disinfection. HASA, Inc. also packages other water treatment chemicals and inventories and ships others.\n\n\n\n1.3    WORST CASE SCENARIO\n\n\n\nThe required worst case scenari"

The specific results are not included in the RMP filing due do security concerns.\n\n\n\n1.5    ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nHASA, Inc. has prepared a comprehensive accidental release prevention program. The program topics include:\n\n?    Hazard analysis\n\n?    Operator training\n\n?    Mechanical maintenance and inspections\n\n?    Management of change\n\n?    Pre-startup Review\n\n?    Incident investigation\n\n?    Contractor safety\n\n?    Compliance audits\n\n\n\nHASA has completed a rigorous Security Vulnerability Analysis (SVA) and has implemented all recommendations. In addition, HASA has implemented a comprehensive transportation security plan for hazardous materials.\n\n\n\n1.6    FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nHASA, Inc. has not had any chlorine releases during the previous 5 years.\n\n\n\n1.7    EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nHASA has prepared an extensive emergency response program. The program includes an emergency response plan, training and coordination with local emergency response agencies and the Pinal County Local Emergency Planning Committee (Pinal LEPC).\n\n\n\n1.8    PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nThe revised process hazard analysis of the regulated process yielded the following recommendations for further evaluation and consideration by HASA:\n\n\n\n1.
