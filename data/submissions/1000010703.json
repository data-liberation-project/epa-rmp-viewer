      "SummaryText": "The Conley Gas Plant (Conley), an Echo Production, Inc. facility is located near Quanah, Texas in a rural area.  The facility has a propane tank with a capacity of 147,000 pounds and two butane tanks with a capacity of 81,600 pounds each, for use in natural gas extraction operations. The worst case scenario was modeled for a vapor cloud explosion of the propane tank. The distance to the end point was determined to be 0.4 miles by the RMP Comp program. Since no offsite receptors are affected at this radius, the Conley facility is eligible for Program Level 1.\n\nThe Conley facility has not had an accidental release in the past five years that led to death, injury, or responders or restoration activities for exposure to a receptor.\n\nMr. Lloyd Coates is the Conley facility plant foreman and is familiar with procedures during an emergency situation.  Ricky Burton, a representative of the Quanah Fire Department, was given a tour of the Conley facility on May 28, 1999, was informed of the existing hazards at the Conley facility, and obtained emergency contact information for the Conley facility."
