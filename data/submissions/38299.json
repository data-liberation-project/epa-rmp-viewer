Simplot Company Pasco Washington facility is complying with OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard (called Process Safety Management or PSM), Title 29 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 1910.119, and EPA's Risk Management Program regulations (called RM Program), Title 40 CFR Part 68, to deal with the risks involved with the storage, handling, and processing of hazardous chemicals.  In this way we promote overall plant, worker, and public safety.\n\nThese programs enable our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents.  Overall, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.\n\nOur safety programs are applied to any activity involving hazardous chemicals including any use, storage, manufacturing, handling, or the on-site movement of such chemicals, or combination of these activities.  Any group of vessels that are interconnected and separate vessels, which are located, such that a hazardous chemical could be involved in a potential release shall be considered a single process.\n\nOur safety programs prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices which govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment.  These rules are detailed and improved as necessary.  They are also communicated to and accepted by all employees at the facility.\n\nJ.R. Simplot Company operates a vegetable processing facility in Pasco, Washington.  The only chemical that was found to be present above its respective RM program quantity threshold at this facility is anhydrous ammonia.  There is a single Program Level 3 ammonia refrigeration process.  The RM program for the Pasco Facility, which is separately documented in detail, consists of the specific elements listed below.\n\nManagement Plan:\nT"

The Plant Manager is the designated facility RM Program Manager and therefore has the overall responsibility for the Pasco facility RM Program.  As Plant Manager, this individual has the authority to assign company resources to develop, implement, update, and integrate all applicable RM program elements at the Pasco facility.  The Plant Manager/RM Program Manager has identified a team of Pasco facility personnel that have been granted the responsibility for implementing and maintaining the RM Program.  Members of the RMP/PSM Team include the Plant Engineer, the Safety Coordinator, Environmental & Regulatory Coordinator, Boiler and Refrigeration Lead, and Boiler & Refrigeration Mechanics.  The RMP/PSM Team is responsible for all five elements of the RM program, including management, prevention, hazard assessment, emergency response, and RM plan updates. \n\nThe RMP/PSM Team members are responsible for implementing and maintaining of the Pasco RM Program. The RMP/PSM Team has responsibilities that are shared among its members and others that are assigned to specific team members.  Typically, the responsibilities that are shared among the RMP/PSM Team are those responsibilities that can be performed prior to an emergency such as emergency planning, RM Program development, and RM Program maintenance activities.  Responsibilities that must be performed during an emergency are assigned to specific individuals to lower the potential for confusion over responsibilities during emergency response.  Each member of the RMP/PSM Team must delegate their specific responsibilities to an alternate during periods of prolonged absence and/or vacation.\n\nThe RMP/PSM Team reports to the RM Program Manager and receives direction and support from Senior Vice President Secretary & General Counsel, Director of Environment and Regulatory Affairs, and the Corporate Safety Manager.

The chain of management above the plant manager is as follows: 1) the Vice President and General Manager Vegetable Division; 2) the General Manager North America;  3) the Food Group President; and lastly 4) the Chief Executive Officer.\n\nChemical Release Prevention Program:\nThe facility has a chemical release prevention program for the ammonia system.  This prevention program is required by both RM Program and Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations, which are quite similar with respect to release prevention.  The prevention program for the ammonia process was developed to comply with PSM regulations, and was most recently updated in the second quarter of 1999.  Key provisions of the facility release prevention program are as follows:\n\n? Employees who operate these systems must receive training initially and periodically on safe startup/shutdown, operations, and emergency shutdown of the processes.  \n? Release incidents are investigated, and the results are used to improve the safety of the process. \n? The ammonia refrigeration system is maintained through the mechanical integrity program, which minimizes the risk of accident and maximizes process safety.\n? Results of incident investigations are also shared with employees who could be affected by the process.  \n? Employees participate in a process hazard analysis (PHA) which identifies potential hazards and ways to improve the safety of the process every five years, or whenever significant changes are made to the process.\n? The facility has a management of change (MOC) program in place that mandates that changes to the ammonia system are reviewed prior to implementing the change to ensure that the change would not compromise safety.\n? A pre-startup review is also completed after a major change and prior to a new process coming on line.  \n? A hot work (spark producing) permit program is in place. \n? Contractors who are"

The Pasco facility has an ammonia alarm system that notifies refrigeration system operators and night-shift security staff of a potential release, which allows for rapid response minimizing the duration of accidental releases.\n\nFive Year Accident History:\nOffsite consequence analyses need to consider the release history of each process.  In the past nine years (the facility has only been operational since 1995), the ammonia refrigeration system has not had releases that have resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage (i.e. no reportable accidents as defined in 40 CFR Part 68.42).  \n\nEmergency Response Program:\nThe Pasco facility's emergency response program is based on the OSHA requirements for Emergency Action Plans (29 CFR 1910.38 and 1910.119) and HAZWOPER (29 CFR 1910.120).  We have trained employees for emergency response and maintain a written emergency response plan.  This plan is coordinated with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and the local fire department.  We conduct annual drills for implementation of the emergency response plan at the facility.\n\nRM Program Reporting:\nThe timely submittal of the RMP*Submit program meets the RM program reporting requirements.  The J.R. Simplot Pasco facility will update this submittal every five years, or sooner if necessary, based on RM program regulation requirements or process modifications."
