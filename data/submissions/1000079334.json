      "SummaryText": "the Trona Facility is part of Searles Valley Minerals, which is a subdivision of Nirma Limited.  The company's Searles Valley facilities, tap into one of the richest sources of diversified minerals and chemicals on earth - the location contains 98 of the world's 110 known chemical elements.  Searles Valley Minerals extracts, chemically processes and ships minerals and inorganic chemical compounds to customers all over the world.  The company currently produces soda ash, sodium borates, boric acid and natural sulfate.  \n\n\n\nProcess Description (P20)\n\nA unique liquid-liquid extraction (LLX) process for manufacturing boric acid has been operated at the Facility since 1962.  An organic extractant was developed and patented for use in this process.  The boric acid process is based on the ability of the organic extractant to form a compound with certain boron compounds found in the Searles Lake brines to form a compound that has very specific properties.  \n\n\n\nBoric acid production consists of 2 processes: liquid-liquid extraction (LLX) and evaporation-crystallization.  The liquid-liquid extraction process consists of 2 sections:\n\n1.    A loading section where boron, sodium and potassium are extracted from the lake brine, and combined into the organic extractant used in the LLX Plant. \n\n2.    A stripping section where the boron, sodium and potassium are stripped from the organic extractant by contact with a dilute acidic aqueous solution to form an aqueous solution of boric acid and sodium and potassium sulfates (called the strip solution), and to regenerate the extractant for re-contact with Lake Brine.\n\n\n\nIn the evaporation-crystallization section the dilute aqueous strip solution is evaporated and the boric acid is separated from the mixed sulfates by fractional crystallization.\n\n\n\nDescription of Regulated Substance Use\n\nThe extractant is produced at the Facility by mixing a manufactured product (called P20) with kerosene in predetermined volumes according to specific procedur"

The purpose of P20 is to provide the raw material for making the extractant utilized at the LLX plant.\n\n\n\nThe P20 Plant boundaries encompass approximately 5000 square feet of the LLX plant.  P20 is manufactured in a batch process (currently one batch per day on average) in which each batch consists of approximately 900 gallons of P20 product.  P20 product is stored in a tank for use at the LLX Plant to produce extractant.\n\n\n\nChlorine and 37-percent concentrated formaldehyde solution (both of which are regulated substances) alongwith other raw materials are used in the manufacture of P20 Product.  Chlorine, in one ton containers, is used in a batch process in which a measured amount of liquid chlorine is fed from a one-ton container, through a chlorine vaporizer, to an intermediate process reactor in which para-nonylphenol is chlorinated.  This intermediate product (chlorinated para-nonylphenol) is then used as one of the raw materials alongwith 37-percent concentrated formaldehyde solution in the presence of sodium hydroxide, water and borax at controlled temperatures and retention times for the manufacture of the P20 Product.  \n\n\n\nThe storage, handling and use system for chlorine at the Trona Facility consists of the following:\n\n?

Process instrumentation and detection and monitoring devices;\n\n\n\nProcess Description (SUPO)\n\nThe primary purpose of the Trona Facility's SUPO Plant is the production of Potassium Sulfate.  As part of its operations, the SUPO Plant operates an anhydrous ammonia-based refrigeration system.  The refrigeration system contains approximately 11,510 pounds of anhydrous ammonia in a closed loop process.  The system, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, then back to high pressure liquid) to provide refrigeration chilling of glycol which is used in the manufacture of Potassium Sulfate.  The refrigeration system (i.e., the use of anhydrous ammonia) is a 24-hour per day, 365-day per year operation that is essential to manufacturing operations conducted at the SUPO Plant.  \n\n\n\nThe anhydrous ammonia storage, handling and use system at the SUPO Plant consists of the following major components:\n\n?    Two ammonia brine condensers;\n\n?    One ammonia centrate condenser;\n\n?    Three ammonia compressors;\n\n?    The main high-pressure receiver;\n\n?    Vertical flash economizer;\n\n?

Transfer piping and supports; and\n\n?    Process instrumentation, detection and monitoring devices.\n\n\n\nWater Based Anhydrous Ammonia Diffusion System\n\nALL system pressure relief valves are piped to a main header and into an above-ground water storage tank (with an approximate volume of 9,700-gallons of water).  All pressure relief valves are piped to the diffusion tank for mixing with water in the event of a release from one of the system"

Additionally, the Facility is protected via manned 24-hour security.  These site security provisions are intended to prevent unauthorized access to Facility areas including those areas where chlorine and formaldehyde are stored, handled or used, thus adding a level of safety for the storage of chlorine and formaldehyde at the Facility.\n\n\n\nES 2.0    ACCIDENTAL RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\n\n\nThe Federal RMP regulations and the CalARP RMP regulations require that at least two types of release scenarios be evaluated for their potential to impact off-site populations:\n\n\n\n?    the worst case release; and\n\n?    an alternative release (an accident scenario that is more credible than the worst-case release scenario).\n\n\n\nA number of hypothetical accidental release scenarios were postulated and evaluated for the Five Year Federal RMP/CalARP RMP Update.  These scenarios were categorized into worst-case release scenarios and alternative release scenarios.  Each of these categories of hypothetical accidental release scenarios is discussed below.\n\n\n\nCHLORINE\n\n\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario\n\nIn this scenario, one of the five one-ton containers of chlorine on site experiences a catastrophic failure due to an unknown event.  This scenario could be initiated by an external event (i.e., an airplane, missile or meteorite impacting the chlorine storage area where the one ton containers are located).  It is highly improbable that this scenario would be initiated by a seismic event. However, the possibility of this scenario being initiated by a seismic event cannot be completely discarded.

Utilizing the USEPA's Reference Tables, the distance to endpoint for this hypothetical accidental release scenario is approximately 0.2-miles.\n\n\n\n\n\nES 3.0    FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nDuring the five years preceding the submittal of the Year 2019 Five Year Federal RMP/CalARP RMP Update (i.e., from June 30, 2014 through July 1, 2019), the Trona Facility has NOT had any releases of chlorine, formaldehyde, or anhydrous ammonia that have resulted in:\n\n?    Onsite deaths, injuries, or significant property damage; or\n\n?    Known offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place.\n\n\n\nES 4.0    ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nThe Accidental Release Prevention Program at the Trona Facility consists of a series of programs, procedures and policies designed to minimize the risk of accidental releases involving chlorine and/or formaldehyde.  These programs include design and operating controls such as compliance with specified codes, the Company's health and safety program, numerous standard operating procedures, the equipment inspection and maintenance program (i"

Details of each of these components of the Facility's Accidental Release Prevention Program are provided in the document entitled Federal Risk Management Plan (Federal RMP), California Accidental Release Prevention Program Risk Management Plan (CalARP RMP), OSHA Process Safety Management (OSHA PSM) Program, Volume I - Prevention Program.  \n\n\n\nThere are a number of detection and monitoring devices and alarms designed to ensure the continued safe operation of the Trona Facility's P20 Process (i.e., which encompasses the storage, handling and use of chlorine and formaldehyde) and the SUPO Process (i.e., which encompasses the storage, handling and use of anhydrous ammonia).  These devices are located throughout the P20 and SUPO Process Areas and monitor various aspects of Operations involving chlorine, formaldehyde and anhydrous ammonia. \n\n\n\nES 5.0    EMERGENCY RESPONSE\n\n\n\nSearles Valley Minerals recognizes that emergency preparedness, emergency planning and emergency response are an integral component of risk management.   As such, two extensive and detailed emergency response plans have been developed and implemented at the Trona Facility.  These Plans include ALL aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuation and notification of LERC/LEPD and the Public.\n\n\n\nALL emergency response equipment is frequently tested, inspected and serviced to ensure proper functioning.  The emergency evacuation sirens are tested every Friday at noon.  In addition, the emergency response"

      "SummaryText": " plans are reviewed periodically and updated (as needed) to reflect pertinent changes in processes, operations and/or personnel that may require a modified emergency response.  Emergency response drills and exercises are conducted periodically to ensure rapid response and effectiveness of the emergency response team.  ALL employees and contractors are trained in the requirements of these emergency response plans.\n\n\n\nIn the unlikely event that a release does occur, Searles Valley Minerals Safety, Security, Health and Environmental (SSHE) staff and HazWOper trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  Searles Valley Minerals coordinates its emergency response actions and efforts with several State and County Agencies.  These activities provide additional emergency response expertise to both the community and Searles Valley Minerals facilities.\n\n\n\nES 6.0    PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nA detailed hazard and operability study update (i.e., process hazards analysis update) was performed on ALL operations involving chlorine and formaldehyde in 2017 in order to enhance the safety of the facility and to evaluate the potential for accidental releases.  As a result of that PHA Update, a number of recommendations were made.  ALL recommended actions have been completed and closed out.  \n\n\n\nThe SUPO process is newly constructed and a detailed hazard and operability study (i.e., process hazards analysis) was performed on ALL operations involving anhydrous ammonia in November 2018 in order to enhance the safety of the facility and to evaluate the potential for accidental releases.  As a result of that PHA , a number of recommendations were made.  ALL recommended actions will be completed and should be closed out by November 14, 2019.  \n\n\n\nES 7.0    FOR MORE INFORMATION\n\n\n\nSearles Valley Minerals recognizes that some persons may be interested in obtaining more detailed information regarding the Five Year Federal RMP and Cal"
