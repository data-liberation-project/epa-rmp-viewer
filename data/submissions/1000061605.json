Marshall Hub\n\n\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n\n\nEOG Resources has a longstanding commitment to public welfare and worker safety.  EOG addresses accidental release prevention through four factors:  design, training, operating parameters and regular maintenance.  Through design efforts, we have limited the public exposure.  Through training, we have prepared our personnel to respond effectively.  Limiting the operating parameters reduces the stress on process equipment.  And regular maintenance serves to prolong equipment life as well as discover potential problems before they become a safety issue.\n\n\n\nShould an accidental release of a regulated substance occur, EOG personnel will evaluate the  conditions, take actions within their capabilities to minimize the risk and notify the appropriate outside agencies.\n\n\n\nFACILITY BACKGROUND INFORMATION\n\n\n\nThe Marshall Hub is located in a rural area in Gonzales County, Texas.  This facility is a natural gas dew point control plant with condensate stabilization utilizing fixed and skid mounted processing equipment as well as liquid storage tanks. \n\n\n\nMarplot indicates that there is no population within the area affected by the worst case scenario and no residential housing units.  However, the gate to the lease is unguarded and open.  Potential agricultural operations within the area defined by the worst case scenario endpoint may occur.\n\n\n\nThere are no public receptors within the area of the alternate release scenario. Additionally, there are no environmental receptors in either the worst case scenario or the alternate release scenario area.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM \n\n\n\nThe referenced process at the Marshall Hub is regulated under both the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Risk Management Plan (RMP)) and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standards.

The PHA systematically evaluates each process for potential hazards and then recommends change where needed.  These PHAs are revalidated every five years.\n\n\n\nThe PHA team is selected from management and employees.   Members are chosen based on their knowledge in operating and maintaining the process and engineering expertise.\n\n\n\nThe Marshall Hub considers a variety of factors when conducting the PHA using a combination of the \"What if\" and HAZOP methods for evaluating potential hazards.  Some of the factors considered are:\n\n 1.  Process Safety Information (PSI).\n\n 2.  Cause and Effects.\n\n 3.  Human factors.\n\n 4.  Public health.\n\n 5.  Environmental factors.\n\n 6.

Marshall uses these procedures for reference by experienced personnel and to provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.\n\n\n\nOperating procedures are reviewed and modified whenever there are changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and/or facility.  Reviewing operating procedures is an element of the Management of Change (MoC) procedure.  In addition, the accuracy of all operating procedures are recertified annually.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\n\n\nThe Marshall Hub has implemented a comprehensive training program to prepare potential process operators to safely and efficiently operate the facility.  Operators-in-training are taught an overview of the process, operating procedures, lock out/tag out, consequences of deviation, emergency response and operating parameters.  After an initial training phase, each candidate is paired with a senior operator for a minimum of 90 days to learn process specific tasks and duties.  The operator-in-training may remain paired with a senior operator beyond the 90 days if necessary, until they can demonstrate enough proficiency to satisfy the Operations Foreman.  The final step in becoming an operator is passing a rigorous written exam called the Compressor Operator Signoff (COS).  After all these requirements have been met, the new Operator can work independently.  New Operators are monitored by the Operations foremen.  Education is an ongoing process and as such, all operators receive periodic training related to their job duties.  In addition to all of this instruction, formal refresher training is conducted every three years. Each step of the operator training course is documented and becomes a permanent part of the employee's file.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, process maintenance personnel receive detailed training in each of the maintenance procedures as well as knowledge to diagnose and repair the process equipment.

Like the Operators, maintenance personnel receive ongoing training in their field and a formal refresher every three years.\n\n\n\nContractors\n\n\n\nThe Marshall Hub uses contractors to supplement its workforce for construction, maintenance and testing.  To ensure that these contractors meet the safety and workplace standard, Marshall personnel complete contractor evaluation forms at regular intervals.  These completed forms are evaluated by safety and management to determine compliance with the established policies, procedures and guidelines.  Contractors must maintain an acceptable score on these reviews to continue working at the facility.  In addition, the Safety Group reviews the contractor's written safety program, its implementation, training and accident history to ensure that it complies with the Marshall Hub requirements.\n\n\n\nThe Marshall Hub provides contractors with:\n\n 1.  A process overview\n\n 2.  Safety orientation and ensures their understanding through testing.\n\n 3.  Information about health and safety hazards.\n\n 4.

The program includes pressure vessels, atmospheric tanks, piping, relief and vent systems, process equipment, pumps, compressors as well as dehydration, hot oil and flaring equipment.\n\n\n\nMaintenance personnel receive training including:\n\n(1) an overview of the process, \n\n(2) safety and health hazards, \n\n(3) applicable maintenance procedures, \n\n(4) emergency procedures, and \n\n(5) work practices to help ensure that they can perform their jobs in a safe manner.\n\n\n\nWritten inspection, testing and maintenance procedures provide that work is performed properly, and serve as a basis for training maintenance personnel in their assigned duties\n\n\n\nInspections and tests are performed to ensure that the equipment functions as intended and to establish a baseline for future monitoring. If a deficiency is identified that presents a safety concern, Marshall Hub personnel will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service.\n\n\n\n\n\nSafe Work Practices\n\n\n\nSafe work practices at the Marshall Hub are defined by  (1) the corporate safe practices manual, (2) a lockout/tag out procedure to isolate energy sources for equipment and piping undergoing maintenance, (3) a permit and procedure to control spark producing activities (i.e., hot work), and (4) a permit and procedure to verify that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space. (5) procedures to control entry into the facility.  These practices along with training and procedures help to ensure that operating and maintenance activities at the hub are performed safely.\n\n\n\nManagement of"

      "SummaryText": " Change\n\n\n\nThe Marshall Hub has a comprehensive system to manage changes to all covered processes. This system requires that changes such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including operating conditions of the process), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented. Changes are reviewed to (1) determine that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change. Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, equipment information, and operating procedures are updated prior to incorporating these changes. In addition, operating and maintenance personnel and affected contractors are provided any necessary training on the change.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\n\n\nThe Marshall Hub promptly investigates all incidents related to a covered process that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury. The goal of each investigation is to determine the factors that may have led to the incident, and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team documents its recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to Marshall Hub management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's recommendations are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the recommendations. Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future and revalidated PHAs.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\n\n\nTo determine that the Accident Prevention Program is functioning properly, the Marshall Hub conducts compliance audits every thre"
