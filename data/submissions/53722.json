The plant is situated at about 90 feet above sea level at the southern border of the city limits of Modesto along Crows Landing Road, south of Service Road.  \n\nWinCo Foods operates this facility as a food distribution center for its retail outlets.  The facility was built in 2004 and the ammonia refrigeration system began operation in April 2004.  WinCo Foods uses anhydrous ammonia for maintaining refrigerated and frozen food products.  The products stored are required to be kept frozen or chilled until placed in refrigerated trucks for delivery to retail and wholesale outlets.\n\nPlant security is provided by a guard located at the truck gate entrance to the facility and by Main Office personnel at the front desk. The security guard provides emergency response support under the direction of the Emergency Coordinator.  The entire plant is enclosed by a chain-link fence, except at the Main Office entrance.\n\nRegulated Substance Handled\n\nPROCESS DESCRIPTION\n\nThis food distribution facility operates a multi-temperature, anhydrous ammonia (R-717) refrigeration system with an engine room capacities of 366 TR @ +35\u00b0F high temperature suction, 671 TR @ +12\u00b0F medium temperature suction, and 210 TR @ -24\u00b0F low temperature suction.

Compressor high-temperature system (+35\u00b0F @ 51.6 psig).\n\nSYSTEM STAGES\n\nThis system operates in part as a single-stage system and also a two-stage compression system.  Thirty-two (32) evaporative air-units operate at a +35 \u00b0F suction temperature.  Forty-two (42) evaporative air-units operate at a +12 \u00b0F suction temperature using the two-stage intercooler as a recirculator vessel.

      "SummaryText": "thermosiphon oil coolers on the screw compressors are fed from this vessel and return a liquid-vapor mix back through the thermosiphon return piping.  Most of the liquid ammonia from the condenser drains through this receiver to the high temperature recirculator.\n\nCONDENSERS\n\nThe evaporative condensers use axial fans in a draw-through configuration.  High-pressure ammonia vapor flows from the high-stage compressors to the evaporative condenser where heat is removed.  The vapor is condensed into a high-pressure liquid using air and water flowing over the outside of the condensing pipe coils.  High-pressure liquid from the condenser is drained to the thermosiphon pilot receiver and overflows to the controlled-pressure receiver.  The saturated condensing temperature is 95\u00b0F (181 psig) at a corresponding 71\u00b0F WB.  The condenser has connections with the compressor discharge lines, the thermosiphon pilot receiver, and the purger.\n\nPURGER\n\nThis system incorporates an automatic gas purger for removing non-condensable gases from the ammonia system.  The presence of non-condensable gases in the condenser penalizes the system performance through the artificial elevation of condensing pressure.  The non-condensable gases add their partial pressures to the ammonia partial pressure against which the compressors must pump.  The system has several purge point connections, typically at each of the condenser liquid outlet pipes. \n\nHOT GAS DEFROST\n\nThe compressor discharge hot gas is used to defrost the evaporators.  During defrost, the hot gas refrigerant gives up heat and condenses.  With the fans shut down, the ability of the coil to transfer that heat to the air is severely limited.  Thus, the heat from the hot gas is absorbed by metal in the coil.  As the metal absorbs heat, its temperature rises.  Once the surface temperature is high enough, any ice and/or frost on the coil surface will melt and drain off.  Defrosting the evaporators occurs automatically on a time sequence, by"

This efficiency of this system is increased by circulating up to three times the amount of the refrigerant needed by the evaporator for the rated capacity.  This system operates in part as a single-stage system and also as a two-stage compression system.\n\nAMMONIA PIPING AND VALVES\n\nThe ammonia piping and valves in the system are labeled.  The identification system is recognized by IIAR.  P&ID prints are available for review.  Pipe, fittings, and connections specifications for ammonia refrigeration systems shall meet or exceed ASME/ANSI B31.5 specifications.\n\nTHE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND THE CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThis facility complies with the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program, the federal Accidental Release Prevention Program and OSHA\u00bfs Process Safety Management (PSM) Program.  Key prevention steps taken by this facility to maintain safety are outlined in the PSM Program.  These include the description of all system and equipment information, process hazard analysis, operator training, contractor qualification, operating procedures, pre-startup safety review, hot work permitting, management of change, mechanical integrity, incident investigation, compliance audits, and emergency response.\n\nThose who operate, maintain, or supervise the system are trained to understand the principles of ammonia refrigeration and ammonia properties, an understanding of the process equipment and proper operating and maintenance procedures, recognition of abnormal conditions and the steps to correct deviations, and emergency shutdown procedures as appropriate to the level of involvement each employee or contractor will have with the process.
