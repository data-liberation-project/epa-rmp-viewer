As a reflection of our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations, we submit this plan to address the hazards inherent with the use of ammonia.  Our program addresses safety precautions regarding the handling and operation of this covered system as well as proper training for those who operate and maintain the system.  The company training policy requires that all employees will be properly trained for a job position before assignment to that job.\n\nOur accidental release prevention program is clearly defined by the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Program for this facility.  This prevention program follows industry-recommended standards for preventing unnecessary human exposures and reducing the threat to the health of our employees as well as to members of the community and the surrounding area.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle these chemicals, the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility and its processes, and the training that we provide our personnel.  This Plan is updated as required by law.\n\nOur Emergency Action Plan (EAP) details the actions this facility will take in the event of an emergency.  The Plan includes procedures for notification of the local emergency responders and safe evacuation of personnel on-site.  A primary Emergency Coordinator (EC) has been assigned to implement the required actions and a secondary Emergency Coordinator has been assigned as a backup to the primary EC.  This Plan is current and updated as required by law and conforms to the requirements for an Emergency Action Plan as per 29 CFR 1910.38 and 8 CCR 3220.\n\nThis facility has also coordinated with the local emergency respond"

The plant is situated at about 90 feet above sea level at the southern border of the city limits of Modesto along Crows Landing Road, south of Service Road.  \n\nWinCo Foods operates this facility as a food distribution center for its retail outlets.  The facility was built in 2004 and the ammonia refrigeration system began operation in April 2004.  WinCo Foods uses anhydrous ammonia for maintaining refrigerated and frozen food products.  The products stored are required to be kept frozen or chilled until placed in refrigerated trucks for delivery to retail and wholesale outlets.\n\nPlant security is provided by a guard located at the truck gate entrance to the facility and by Main Office personnel at the front desk. The security guard provides emergency response support under the direction of the Emergency Coordinator.  The entire plant is enclosed by a chain-link fence, except at the Main Office entrance.\n\nRegulated Substance Handled\n\nPROCESS DESCRIPTION\n\nThis food distribution facility operates a multi-temperature, anhydrous ammonia (R-717) refrigeration system with an engine room capacities of 366 TR @ +35?F high temperature suction, 671 TR @ +12?F medium temperature suction, and 210 TR @ -24?F low temperature suction.  The total system charge of anhydrous ammonia is approximately 35,000 lbs.\n\nSYSTEM CLASSIFICATION\n\nThis refrigeration system is a liquid recirculation system and is designed to operate with an overfeed-"

Thirty-two (32) evaporative air-units operate at a +35 ?F suction temperature.  Forty-two (42) evaporative air-units operate at a +12 ?F suction temperature using the two-stage intercooler as a recirculator vessel.

      "SummaryText": " thermosiphon oil coolers on the screw compressors are fed from this vessel and return a liquid-vapor mix back through the thermosiphon return piping.  Most of the liquid ammonia from the condenser drains through this receiver to the high temperature recirculator.\n\nCONDENSERS\n\nThe evaporative condensers use axial fans in a draw-through configuration.  High-pressure ammonia vapor flows from the high-stage compressors to the evaporative condenser where heat is removed.  The vapor is condensed into a high-pressure liquid using air and water flowing over the outside of the condensing pipe coils.  High-pressure liquid from the condenser is drained to the thermosiphon pilot receiver and overflows to the controlled-pressure receiver.  The saturated condensing temperature is 95?F (181 psig) at a corresponding 71?F WB.  The condenser has connections with the compressor discharge lines, the thermosiphon pilot receiver, and the purger.\n\nPURGER\n\nThis system incorporates an automatic gas purger for removing non-condensable gases from the ammonia system.  The presence of non-condensable gases in the condenser penalizes the system performance through the artificial elevation of condensing pressure.  The non-condensable gases add their partial pressures to the ammonia partial pressure against which the compressors must pump.  The system has several purge point connections, typically at each of the condenser liquid outlet pipes. \n\nHOT GAS DEFROST\n\nThe compressor discharge hot gas is used to defrost the evaporators.  During defrost, the hot gas refrigerant gives up heat and condenses.  With the fans shut down, the ability of the coil to transfer that heat to the air is severely limited.  Thus, the heat from the hot gas is absorbed by metal in the coil.  As the metal absorbs heat, its temperature rises.  Once the surface temperature is high enough, any ice and/or frost on the coil surface will melt and drain off.  Defrosting the evaporators occurs automatically on a time sequence, by "

The identification system is recognized by IIAR.  P&ID prints are available for review.  Pipe, fittings, and connections specifications for ammonia refrigeration systems shall meet or exceed ASME/ANSI B31.5 specifications.\n\nTHE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND THE CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThis facility complies with the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program, the federal Accidental Release Prevention Program and OSHA?s Process Safety Management (PSM) Program.  Key prevention steps taken by this facility to maintain safety are outlined in the PSM Program.  These include the description of all system and equipment information, process hazard analysis, operator training, contractor qualification, operating procedures, pre-startup safety review, hot work permitting, management of change, mechanical integrity, incident investigation, compliance audits, and emergency response.\n\nThose who operate, maintain, or supervise the system are trained to understand the principles of ammonia refrigeration and ammonia properties, an understanding of the process equipment and proper operating and maintenance procedures, recognition of abnormal conditions and the steps to correct deviations, and emergency shutdown procedures as appropriate to the level of involvement each employee or contractor will have with the process.  Contractors that perform maintenance or that design changes to the system are qualified by the facility based upo"

The Emergency Action Plan includes release notification for emergency responders and the procedures for evacuation.  The Emergency Coordinator implements the response in coordination with the local emergency responders (i.e. the fire department).  It is the policy and practice to conduct evacuation drills regularly.\n\nThis facility is included in the community emergency response plan.  The Primary Local Emergency Response Agency with which the response activities are coordinated is:\n\nLocal Emergency Planning Committee\nRegion IV\n3650 Schriever Avenue\nMather CA  95655\n916-845-8480\n\nIn addition to the PSM/ARP requirements, this facility is also subject to RCRA regulations at 40 CFR 264, 265, and 279.52; Emergency Action Plan requirements under 40 CFR 1910.38 and 8 CCR 3220; and, state EPCRA rules and laws.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nAn update Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) was performed as required prior to implementation of the major changes for the 2008 freezer expansion project.  The five-year revalidation of the PHA was completed concurrently approximately six months prior to the anniversary date to secure cost and time efficiencies.  The 2008 PHA team developed a list of recommendations to improve safety by reducing potential hazards of the process.  All recommendations have "
