The Facility complies with OSHAs 29 CFR 1910.106 requirements for flammable liquids, and it is the Facility's policy to adhere to applicable federal, state, and local laws. If an emergency were to occur, it is Facility's policy to notify the applicable outside agencies that might be called upon for assistance (i.e: police department, fire department, etc.).\r\n\r\nA description of the Facility and the regulated substances handled\r\nThe Facility stores one 60,000 gallon natural gas liquid tank (500,220 pounds), one 3,900 gallon propane tank (32,514 pounds), one 3,000 gallon liquid petroleum gas surge tank (25,011 pounds), seven 16,800 gallon condensate tanks (140,061.6 pounds each), one 90,000 gallon surge condensate tank (750,330 pounds) and one 3,000 gallon propane (refrigerant) tank (25,011 pounds). \r\n\r\nThe Facility has amine units to remove acid gas.  The chemicals used in the amine units are not RMP regulated.  \r\n\r\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps\r\nThe Facility complies with EPAs chemical accident prevention rule (40 CFR 68) and applicable state and local codes and regulations. Two worst-case release scenario (WCRSs) were evaluated.  The first scenario was the explosion of one 90,000 gallon condensate surge storage tank.  The second scenario was the explosion of one 3,900 gallon propane tank.  WCRS has potential of the formation of a vapor cloud that could explode when exposed to an ignition source.\r\n\r\nPer 40 CFR 68.10, Program 1 applies if all the following conditions are met:\r\n\u00bf\tNo five year accident history\r\n\u00bf\tDistance to toxic or flammable end point is less than the distance to any public receptor; and\r\n\u00bf\tEmergency response procedures have been coordinated between the stationary source and local emergency planning and response or"

      "SummaryText": "ganizations.\r\n\r\nUsing the EPA's Risk Management Program Guidance for Risk Management Plan (RMP) Data, the WCRS distance was calculated to be 0.7 miles (worst case of both the scenarios) from the process.  The population of 0 was estimated to be in the WCRS. No public/environmental receptors were identified in the WCRS. The Facility utilizes a well-trained operation and maintenance staff that periodically visit and inspects the facility. Other safeguards at the Facility include high pressure/overpressure relief valves, high-pressure shutdowns, high temperature shutdowns, high level shutdowns, etc.\r\n\r\nThe Facility has determined that Program Level 1 applies to this facility.  The Facility has had no accidents since start of operations. The distance to flammable end point is 0.7 miles and there is no public receptor in this distance. The emergency response procedures have been coordinated with the local emergency planning and response organization.\r\n\r\nAn alternative scenario is not required for this facility because it is classified as a Program 1 site.  Since this facility is a Program 1, a documented prevention program is not required.\r\n\r\nFive-year accident history\r\nThe Big Lake Gas Plant is a new Facility (started operation in February 2015). An accidental release of condensate/propane gas resulting in death, injuries, significant property damage, sheltering in place, or causing environmental damage on-site or off-site has not occurred within the past 5 years.\r\n\r\nThe emergency response program\r\nThe Facility has a written Emergency Response Program that includes include specific actions to be taken in response to accidental releases of natural gas liquid, procedures for informing the public and local agencies responding to accidental releases, and information on emergency health care.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlanned changes to improve safety\r\nNone identified at this time."
