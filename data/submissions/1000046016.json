Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nWe at Farmers Union Oil in Terry, MT are strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is an inherent part of our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  We coordinate our response efforts with the Terry Fire Department, which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n\n\n2.    Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nOur facility's primary activities include support services for crop production.  We have anhydrous ammonia stored in one 30,000-gallon tank and Ten 1,000-gallon nurse tanks at our facility in Terry, MT (Figure 1).  The maximum amount stored is 34,000 gallons (175,100 pounds) at 85% maximum storage capacity including the capacity of the on-site nurse tanks.   The largest single storage vessel at our facility contains 131,325 pounds at 85% standard maximum storage capacity.\n\n\n\n3.    Worst Case Release and Alternative Release Scenarios \n\n\n\n4.    General Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the EPA's accidental release prevention requirements as set forth in 40 CFR part 68.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nFarmers Union Oil maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associated with all processes (Appendix E).\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associa"
