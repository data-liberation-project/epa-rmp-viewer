      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\n\nThis Process Safety Management (PSM) and Risk Management Plan (RMP) Program document (PSM/RMPr) was prepared on behalf of Helena Chemical Company (HCC) pursuant to the requirements of the Clean Air Act ? 112(r) as codified by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) at 29 CFR ? 1910.119 and by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) at 40 CFR ?68.  The OSHA PSM and EPA Subpart D RMP standards are applicable to operations at the Central Ferry Facility, Pomeroy, WA.  At this Facility, HCC engages in the formulation, distribution and sale of chemicals (i.e. retail) to customers, most of who use HCC's products to support agricultural operations.  \n\n\n\nThis electronic submittal provides conservative estimates of the offsite consequences of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia and aqua ammonia from the Central Ferry Facility located approximately 23 miles northwest of Pomeroy, WA at 82 Central Ferry Road, Pomeroy, WA 99347.  The electronic RMP summarizes the policies and procedures implemented by the Central Ferry Facility to minimize the likelihood of an accident.  The electronic RMP also summarizes the actions that the Central Ferry Facility has taken to ensure that a response to a release (even though a release is unlikely) will be implemented in a proper and timely manner.\n\n\n\nPURPOSE FOR UPDATING RMP\n\n\n\nHCC is submitting this plan as a resubmission of all applicable sections of the PSM/RMP as it recently acquired this Facility from Nuchem.  All relevant sections for a Program 3 PSM/RMPr Facility have been addressed.  \n\n\n\nFACILITY\n\n\n\nThe Operations at the Central Ferry Facility consists of agricultural chemical storage and handling, manufacturing, retail sale and distribution.  As related to the PSM/RMPr, the Central Ferry Facility stores and handles two covered chemicals (anhydrous ammonia and aqua ammonia) at quantities that exceed the threshold quantity established by EPA, and operates seven (7) covered processes that"

The seven covered processes include:\n\n\n\no    Covered Process 1: Railcar Storage (Anhydrous Ammonia)\n\no    Covered Process 2: Railcar Storage (Aqua Ammonia)\n\no    Covered Process 3: Anhydrous Ammonia transfer to Tanker Truck\n\no    Covered Process 4: Aqua Ammonia Transfer to Storage Tanks\n\no    Covered Process 5: Aqua Ammonia Blending\n\no    Covered Process 6: Storage and Handling (Aqua Ammonia)\n\no    Covered Process 7: Ammonium Polyphosphate Blending\n\n\n\nThe Central Ferry Facility receives anhydrous ammonia and aqua ammonia (29% Nitrogen) by railcar.  The railcars are temporarily stored on the Facility spur until the material is transferred from the railcar to one of the other covered processes.  Railcars containing anhydrous ammonia are transferred to (1) Covered Process 3 for retail distribution to the client location; (2) Covered Process 5 for the manufacturing of aqua ammonia fertilizer; and (3) Covered process 7 for the manufacturing of ammonium polyphosphate (10-34-0) fertilizer.  Railcars containing aqua ammonia (29% Nitrogen), is mixed with water at Covered Process 4 while transferring the aqua ammonia (20% Nitrogen) to five (5) aboveground storage tanks (AST) for storage and handling (Covered Process 6).  The aqua that is blended at Covered Process 5 (Aqua Ammonia Blending) is transferred from the Blenders to the five (5) ASTs for storage and handling (Covered Process 6).  The aqua ammonia at Covered Process 6 (Storage and Handling) is transferred to Commercial Tanker Trucks for transportation to the client location.  HCC trains all of its Process Operators and Maintenance Personnel in the relevant operating and maintenance procedures provided in the PSM/RMPr.\n\n\n\nIt is important to note that the total quantity of anhydrous ammonia that can be stored at the Facility is 3,302,072 lbs (assuming that 20 34,000-gallon railcars are filled to their administrative capacity), and the total aqua ammonia that can be sto"

The worst case scenario release assumed that all the contents in the largest single vessel were released.  For the anhydrous ammonia (i.e. representing Covered Processes 1, 3, 5, and 7), the worst case release was modeled as if a 34,000-gallon anhydrous ammonia railcar was punctured on the side at the ground level and the resulting release being a ground level horizontal jet at the maximum temperature.  For the aqua ammonia, two releases were modeled.  One worst case release scenario assumes that a 22,000-gallon aqua ammonia (29% Nitrogen) railcar failed and instantaneously spills the content into an area with no secondary containment resulting in a release being evaporation at the maximum temperature.  The other worst case release scenario assumes that the 50,000-gallon aqua ammonia (20% Nitrogen) AST fails within the secondary containment resulting in a contained release being evaporation at the maximum temperature.\n\n\n\nDepending on the covered process, the alternative (or more likely to occur) scenario for anhydrous ammonia assumes a release of anhydrous ammonia due to (1) the failure to fully close a vapor valve on a railcar (Covered Process 1), and (2) rupture of a 3-inch transfer hose during a major loading or unloading operation associated with Covered Processes 3, 5, and 7.  Although these events are classified as an alternative scenario, even an accident of this type is unlikely to occur due to the safety equipment (excess flow devices, emergency shutoff valves, and internal safety valves on the tanker truck) and operating procedures that HCC uses to safeguard ammonia transfer operations.\n\n\n\nThe alternative (or more likely to occur) scenario assumes a release of aqua ammonia (29"

The Central Ferry Manager is assisted by other trained HCC staff, as directed.  The Central Ferry Manager is responsible for ensuring that HCC Staff are properly trained in the implementation of the Program 2 and 3 Accident Prevention Program elements: Management System, Employee Participation, Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Contractor, Pre-Startup Review, Mechanical Integrity, Hot Work Permit, Management of Change, Incident Investigation, Emergency Response, and Compliance Audits.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nHCC's Central Ferry Facility is a non-responding facility. HCC has coordinated emergency response activities with its local emergency response agency and local fire department.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThere have been no on-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage; or off-site deaths, injuries, property damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place, in the past five (5) years because of the ammonia operations at the Central Ferry Facility.\n\n\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n\n\nThe Risk Management Plan implemented by HCC at the Central Ferry Facility complies with the requirements of the Clean Air Act, Section 112(r).  The RMP will be updated as the Central Ferry Facility adds, deletes, or chang"
