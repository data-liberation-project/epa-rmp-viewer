With respect to the potential exposure to anhydrous ammonia contained in the refrigeration system at the Madison, Tennessee facility, appropriate monitoring, maintenance and upgrade of all system equipment will be performed in a timely manner to prevent the release of ammonia from the system.  That policy also limits operation and maintenance of the system to appropriately trained and qualified personnel only.\n\nIn the event of a release, Odom\u00bfs staff trained to provide emergency response will respond immediately to stop, control and mitigate any release.  Notification of a release will be made to appropriate outside agencies and emergency response organizations.\n\nII.\tSource and Substances Handled\n\nThe stationary source consists of a two-stage mechanical refrigeration system that employs anhydrous ammonia.
