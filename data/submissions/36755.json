      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\nThe Risk Management Program (RMP) has been updated to enable Roche Carolina, Inc. (RCI), Florence, South Carolina Plant, to satisfy the required elements of the United States Environmental Protection Agency?s (USEPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) rule (40 CFR 68).  Specifically, the RMP has been updated to reflect the deletion of phosphorous oxychloride as a Program 3 chemical.  Phosphorous oxychloride is not currently used at the RCI site.  Also, the RMP is being updated to reflect the new data elements as required in the Amendments to the Chemical Accident Prevention Rule as outlined in the April 9, 2004 Federal Register.  RCI is subject to the RMP rule since it utilizes titanium tetrachloride above the threshold quantity.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and ER Policies\n\nRoche Carolina Incorporated (RCI) develops and manufactures active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and has implemented the strategies outlined in the American Chemistry Council Responsible Care Program.  The RCI property is a 1,400 acre site of which approximately 120 acres have been developed for industrial use.  The developed portion is located in the center of the property, ensuring a significant buffer or distance to the property boundary.  RCI has implemented environmental and safety systems in order to minimize the potential release of a hazardous chemical.  These systems include: a complete review and hazards analysis for all regulated processes operated on-site, detailed safety and environmental standards, a fully automated process control system (DCS) with built in safety interlocks, management of change program, pre-start up safety reviews and an on-going audit program.  Prior to the start of a new process, all affected personnel are trained on the hazards, the safe use, storage, handling and emergency response procedures for all regulated compounds.\n\n    Facility Description and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nManufacturing at the RCI site occurs from the Launch Bulk "

      "SummaryText": "Manufacturing Building, which is comprised of 3 enclosed, multi-purpose production units.  Support functions at the site include environmental, health and safety, maintenance, engineering, warehousing, utilities and administrative services.  RCI currently uses Titanium Tetrachloride (CAS# 7550-45-0) in the manufacture of a bulk pharmaceutical intermediate.  The titanium tetrachloride is received in steel cylinders containing approximately 1,600 lbs. of TiCl4 per cylinder.  During the manufacturing campaign, up to two cylinders may be located together in the liquid dispensing room within the Launch Manufacturing Building.\n\nStationary Source and Accidental Release Prevention Overview\n\nThe cylinders of titanium tetrachloride are delivered to the production building where the material is used in the liquid dispensing room.  Based on the manufacturing procedure, the appropriate amount of material is charged directly from the cylinder to the empty process feed tank.  Methylene chloride is added to the titanium tetrachloride in the process feed tank.  This process solution is then charged to the process reactor vessel where the solution reacts with other compounds in the vessel  in order to produce the desired pharmaceutical intermediate compound.  The cylinder, process feed tank and process reactor vessel are closely monitored using automatic control system software, and the status of each vessel is displayed on computer terminals in the production control room.  High level alarms and automatic shutoff controls are used in the event process parameters exceed predetermined setpoints.  Each production unit includes an emergency stop, which enables a complete shutdown of the process to a fail-safe state.  All three vessels are protected with a sprinkler system to ensure the tanks and cylinders are cooled in the event of fire impingement.\n  \n    The Worst-Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario\n\nManufacturing operations are strategically located at the center "

The hazard assessment was completed using the PHAST model - DNV Technica, Version 6.0.  \n\nWorst Case Release Scenario \n \nThe worst case release scenario for the RCI site was evaluated following all Risk Management Program regulations as required by EPA.  The identified worst case scenario is a rupture of two cylinders releasing a total of 3,200 pounds of titanium tetrachloride into the production building.  It is assumed the material is spilled and forms a liquid pool within the building sump.  Worst case conditions using very conservative assumptions include a wind speed of 1.5 m/sec, atmosphereic Stability Class F, no response from on-site emergency response personnel and no safety interlocks or devices.  At the LOC concentration, individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects that could impair their abilities to take protective actions.  See section 3 of the RMP submit report for more detailed information on this release scenario.\n  \nAlternative Release scenario\n \nAs outlined in the RMP regulations, an alternative release scenario is not required since the results of a worst case scenario do not go beyond the RCI property boundary.  Therefore, no alternate release scenario is included. \n\n    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical specific Prevention Steps\n\nRCI has implemented the Responsible Care Process Safety Code, OSHA Process Safety Management Standard and EPA's Risk Management Plan.  Process hazards analysis (PHA) have been completed for all manufacturing process equipment as well as the individual batch processes introduced since start up of the facility.  The Zurich risk analysis methodology is used for all manufacturing processes which exceed OSHA PSM and EPA RMP threshold limits. "

A management of change procedure is in place and is used to ensure that all new processes or changes to existing processes are reviewed by appropriate personnel.  These reviews are followed by pre-start up safety reviews and extensive training.  Specific administrative procedures have been implemented to minimize the amount of titanium tetrachloride stored and used in any one area.  In order to minimize the impacts of a potential release, specific procedures have been written to ensure operating personnel monitor the transfer of titanium tetrachloride.  Emergency response procedures have been reviewed with all affected personnel.  \n \n    The 5-Year Accident History\n\nIn reference to the RMP requirements, there have been no accidental releases of titanium tetrachloride from the facility within the past 5 years.\n\n    The ER Program\n\nRCI maintains a complete emergency response program for all process operations and functions at the site.  The purpose of the site emergency response plan is to establish actions that would be taken in the event of an emergency condition.  The procedures outlined in the plan will be followed in the event of a release of a hazardous material from the RCI Site.  The Incident Command System (ICS) has been established in order to provide for the orderly and consistent leadership during an emergency situation.  All Hazardous Materials responders are trained to the technician Level as outlined in the OSHA Standard.  In the event of a chemical release, the site maintains a hazardous materials response vehicle, which is fully equipped to respond to the types of chemicals stored and used on-site.  Also, spill cabinets are located throughout the process areas in order to minimize the impacts of chemical releases.\n\n    Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nRoche Carolina believes continuous improvement of all environmental and safety systems is an essential function of de"
