The residue gas stream will be compressed and sent back into the customer's natural gas transmission pipeline.  The Natural Gas Liquids (NGLs) are recovered via the designed cryogenic process and will be collected and stored on-site.  The NGLs will then be loaded and transported to another facility for further processing.  The facility is regulated by both the EPA and OSHA by EPA's Risk Management Plan (RMP) and OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM)safety management system.  This scrutiny is placed on this facility due to the fact that more than 10,000 pounds of flammable material can be stored on site.  The flammable material is made up of mostly propane, but also contains regulated quantities of butane, pentane and ethane when considering maximum storage capacity.\n     Exterran Energy Solutions, L.P. is the owner and operator of the Schultz NGL Facility and is committed to ensure the safety of the work force and the citizens of the surrounding community, as well as, being good stewards of the environment in which we work and live.  The entire facility has been designed with process safety as a critical component of the operations of the site.  There are early warning devices such as gas and flame detectors, fire extinguishers positioned at appropriate locations throughout the facility.  There are control devices controlled by the computer operating system designed to automatically shut down specific pieces of equipment and the plant if necessary depending on the operating conditions.  The operating technicians are highly trained and have been trained in responding to emergencies as stipulated in our Emergency Action Plan (EAP).  Facility personnel will also actively engage with the Pleasants County LEPC and support the community emergency response plan.  The site personnel are continually participat"
