For our prevention program we follow the requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) process safety management regulation and also the Environmental Protection agency (EPA) Risk Management Plan (RMP). A revalidation of the Process Hazard Analysis was conducted in 2017, recommendations made from the study were acted upon to enhance process safety in the covered process and ensure compliance with OSHA & EPA PSM/RMP programs.\n\n\n\nTraining is provided for operators and mechanics so that the ammonia system is properly operated and maintained.  There is a mechanical integrity program in place to provide procedures for technicians and preventative maintenance schedules for the equipment in the covered process.  A management of change program is in place to ensure system change is properly designed, fabricated, and completed.  The refrigeration system is maintained following current codes and guidelines and standards from the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration. There are written standard operating procedures which are reviewed annually. Periodic audits are performed in house and external 3rd party auditors are used for process hazard analyses and compliance audits.\n\n",

We use anhydrous ammonia to freeze salmon and other species of seafood whole or filleted.  Our ammonia inventory is in excess of 10,000 pounds, and in accordance with the OSHA and EPA requirements, we have developed a Process Safety Management and a Risk Management Program.\n\nThere is a management system describing overall responsibility for the program and there is a person responsible for each element of the PSM/RM program. Initially there was a Process Hazard Analysis completed for the facility.  Every 5 years or more often, this process hazard analysis will be reviewed and updated.  Most of the elements of our program are reviewed and updated yearly.  Every three years there will be a complete audit to ensure compliance of the PSM/RM standard.  The refrigeration facility has been constructed following local, state and industry code requirements and guidelines.\n\nThe freezing plant combines with an existing cannery and flake ice making machinery to provide for the best utilization of seafood products.  The Process Safety Management/ Risk Management program combines with other Trident Safety Programs which involves participation from top management to the entry level worker.\n\nA Hazard Assessment has been completed which considers a worse case ammonia release scenario as well as several alternate or more likely to occur accidents.  This study has been used to develop the facility emergency action plan.  \n\nThere have been no accidents, injuries, or property damage resulting from an ammonia release in the last 5 years.  \n\nIn the event of an ammonia release, the facility Emergency Action Plan would be implemented.  The facility first responders will provide proper measures to safely evacuate plant personnel to pre-arranged muster areas.
