The City of Tampa Water Department (TWD) accidental release policy involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices.  All applicable federal and state prevention program guidelines are adhered to.  The TWD emergency response policy involves the preparation of response plans which are tailed to each facility and to the emergency response services available in the community.  Emergency response plans include coordination with the local fire departments and COT emergency response units.\n\n\nb.  The HRWTP is a surface water treatment facility producing potable water from the Hillsborough River is Tampa, Florida, utilizing an enhanced coagulation treatment process. HRWTP maintains an inventory of liquid chlorine in two 90 ton rail cars located within an enclosed chemical building.  Chlorine is used as the primary disinfectant in the potable water treatment process.  Secondary disinfection for potable water storage and distribution is achieved with chloramine, a combination chlorine and anhydrous ammonia.    Anhydrous ammonia is stored in two 2000 gallon horizontal pressurized tanks. .  Anhydrous ammonia storage tanks are filled only to 85% capacity as required under manufacturer specifications.  Each tank has a maximum weight storage capacity of 9,675 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  The treatment facility is currently manned 24 hours per day, 7 days per week.  The HRWTP has been designed for the safe storage and handling of chlorine and ammonia as referenced in the Combined Process Safety Management Program for the City of Tampa Water Department, Production Division.  These are the only chemicals used in a process at this facility covered by the RMP rule.\n\n\nc.The offsite consequence analysis includes consideration of two chlorine release scenarios, identified as worst case release and alternative case release,"

The worst case release scenario is defined by EPA as a chemical  release of the maximum quantity in the largest vessel released in a 10 minute period, due to an unspecified failure.  The alternative release scenario is defined as more likely to occur than the worst case release scenario.\n\nAtmospheric dispersion modeling has to be performed to determine the distance traveled by the chlorine released before its concentration decreases to the toxic endpoint' selected by EPA under the Emergency Response Planning Guideline 2.   The defined endpoint used for chlorine was the ERPG2 concentration of 3 PPM chlorine.  The Emergency Response Planning Guideline 2 (ERPG2) is the maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms which could impair an individual's ability to take protective action.   The residential population within a circle with a radius corresponding to eh toxic endpoint has to be defined to estimate the population potentially effected.\n\nFor the processes of chlorine and anhydrous ammonia at the HRWTP, distances to the toxic endpoints are concentric, with liquid chlorine release having the greatest distance to the toxic endpoint.  Therefore, a chlorine release was modeled for the worst case scenario.  The worst case release scenario for a chlorine release at HRWTP would be the instantaneous release of one full railcar in a ten minute period.  The amount of chlorine released would be 180,000 pounds.  Release conditions are defined in the RMP rule to be an atmospheric stability factor F, wind speed @ 1.5 m/s, and a roughness coefficient set for urban.  Mitigation for an enclosed building considered to be accessed at 55% of the released quantity.  Under this condition a mitigated release quantity would be 99,000 pounds of chlorine.  For"

Liquid chlorine was mistakenly bypassed from a full 90 ton rail car to  a gas chlorinator during utility maintenance procedure to disconnect an empty chlorine rail car.  It is estimated a volume of 5 gallons of liquid chlorine was released before the excess flow valve on the full rail car set to stop the leak.  A remote control air actuator closing valve was utilized to shutdown the rail car angle valve moments after the incident occurred.  Three employees were injured during the release in responding to the alarm situation.   The chlorine system HRWTP has been completely changed out with new piping, evaporators, chlorinators, and independat feeds to each rail car to prevent a cross connection condition from occurring in the future.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe area of concern distance radius to the ERPG2 endpoint is 9.9 miles."
