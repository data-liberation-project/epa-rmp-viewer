Facility accidental release and emergency response policy. \r\n\r\nThe management and employees of Southern FS, Inc are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\r\n\r\n2.  The stationary source and the regulated substances handled.\r\n\r\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.  The storage and handling system consists of 1 storage tank (30,000 gallons), loading risers, associated plumbing and nurse tanks.    Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.  The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia that can be stored would be 320,000 pounds. This includes anhydrous ammonia that could be stored in nurse tanks.\r\n\r\n3.  THE WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND ALTERNATIVE-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO\r\n\r\n    This facility has developed a worst-case and alternative-case release scenario.\r\n    However since this is security sensitive information it has been withheld form this\r\n    executive summary as required by EPA regulations.\r\n\r\n4.  The accidental release prevention program.\r\n\r\nThis facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulation.  This facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc. as adopted by state regulation and the standards of the U S Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".
