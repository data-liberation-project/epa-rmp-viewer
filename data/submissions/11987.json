This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  \n\n\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activity encompasses Poultry Processing.  We have 1 regulated substance present at our facility.  This substance is  Ammonia.  The regulated substance at our facility is involved in the use of poultry processing.  \n\nThe maximum inventory of Ammonia at our facility is 136000.00 lbs.\n\n\n3.\tThe Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the look-up tables and equations provided by the EPA in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from ammonia refrigeration.  The scenario involves the release of 80000 lb. of Ammonia in a gaseous form over 10 minutes.  Under worst case weather conditions, namely Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 3.14 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L.\n\nOne alternative release scenario for Ammonia involves a release from the Preston refrigeration system in the ammonia refrigeration"

Prepared Foods, Pilgrim's Pride Corporation has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related the contractor's work and the processes.  Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\n\n\n5.\tFive-year Accident History\nPrepared Foods, Pilgrim's Pride Corporation has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies, the number of accidental releases has been reduced to a minimum.\n\nThere have been 7 accidental releases of regulated substances from our facility within the last 5 years.  The first release took place on 05/14/95 and involved 1000 lbs. of Ammonia.  The incident was a result of equipment failure.  The accident resulted in a gas release.  There were no known impacts either onsite or offsite.  However, several improvements were issued as a precautionary measure.  \n\nAnother release, of 500 lbs. of Ammonia, occurred on 08/09/98 due to human error during a maintenance procedure. On 06/03/96 the wastewater treatment facility reported having to use extra chemical and power to handle excess ammonia. With further investigation it was determined a leak in the tubing of one of the evaporative condensers was the cause. It had gone unnoticed because the ammonia was being diluted by the overflow of the condenser. Also, on 06/21/96 there was a release of 300 lbs. of Ammonia, due to a pallet jack pushed into a pipe bracing, causing a pipe coupling to break loose.  Revised training was implemented. On 09/07/96 a high head pressure caused a pop off valve to release 1000 lbs. of ammonia. On 06/06/97 a compressor shut down causing a high head pressure to build which in turn caused a pop off valve to release. On 10/28/98 ammonia piping r"
