Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies \nWe at Alltrista Zinc Products, L.P. are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety, This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled \nWe have one (1) regulated substances present at our facility.  This substance is Chlorine.  The regulated substance at our facility is involved in a single use.  Chlorine is used for wastewater treatment.\n\nThe maximum inventory of Chlorine at our facility is 360,000 pounds.\n\n\n3.    The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\n\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the calculations derived from the RMP*Comp software program supplied by EPA.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from Chlorine Storage.  The scenario involves the release of 180,000 lb. of Chlorine in a gaseous form over 10 minutes.  Under worst case weather conditions, namely Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of >25 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L.\n\nOne or more alternative release scenarios have been submitted for each toxic substance present in Program 3 processes cumulatively.\n\nOne alternative release scenario for Chlorine involves a release from Ra"

The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1998 Edition.  A number of processes at our facility are subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.\n\nThe following sections briefly describe the elements of our release prevention program that are in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nAlltrista Zinc Products, L.P. maintains a detailed record of written safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is \"What-if\" Analysis. The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of every three years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Alltrista Zinc Products, L.P. maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a shutdown.
