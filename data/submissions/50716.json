Additional training schedules have been established and implemented for the operators of the ammonia refrigeration system.  6.  Contractors:  All contractors will be screened and evaluated prior to any work on or near the ammonia refrigeration system.  The contractors will also be periodically evaluated to ensure they perform their work duties safely.  All contractors that work on the refrigeration system will also be required to have an ongoing safety program that includes compliance with 29 CFR 1910.38 and 1910.11.  7.  Pre-Startup Safety Review: A Pre-Startup Safety Review will be completed for all new ammonia projects prior to its start-up to verify that all safety programs are established, all the training has been completed by all individuals involved, and construction has been completed according to design standards and guidelines.  8.  Mechanical Integrity:  A Mechanical Integrity program is established to ensure that the ammonia refrigeration system is built to the established codes and is maintained to the manufacturer's recommendations.  Preventative maintenance procedures are also established to ensure the refrigeration system is maintained properly to minimize unexpected breakdown and failure.  9.  Hot Work Permit:  A hot work program has been established and implemented so that any cutting, welding, or burning operation on the ammonia refrigeration system must be authorized by the general manager or the maintenance manager.  10.  Management of Change:  These procedures ensure that the general manager and the maintenance manager properly review all changes made to the systems.  11.  Incident Investigation:  These procedures ensure that any incident (and near missed) are investigated, reviewed, and documented using an investigation team.  12.  Compliance Audit:  An audit of the Process Safety Management Program and Risk Management Plan will be performed on a regular scheduled to ens"

Employee Participation:  This program ensures that the employees are involved in establishing and implementing the prevention program.  Employees are also involved when a process hazard analysis is conducted.  This program also ensures that the employees have complete access to the program on company property.  Regularly scheduled meetings are held to discuss any concerns.  2. Process Safety Information:  Written information has been collected which enables the employees or members of the general public to identify and understand the potential hazards in the refrigeration system.  This written information includes the MSDS program as well as a description of the design of the refrigeration system.  The written information also includes the MSDS on the ammonia in the refrigeration, standards, guidelines, and basic information about the chemistry of therefrigeration system, and the thermodynamic properties of the refrigeration system.  3.  Process Hazards Analysis:  A formal analysis using the What-if/ Checklist Technique was conducted prior to the start-up of the system to identify potential hazards.  For each Management of Change and at regularly scheduled intervals, a Process Hazard Analysis will be conducted and the corporate review team will review its recommendations.  4. Operating Procedures:  Written operating procedures have been developed that describe the steps to be followed to operate the refrigeration system safely.  Every Management of Change and any operation involving the refrigeration system that was not previously identified will have an operating procedure developed and implemented for the actions required.  5.  Training:  A training schedule has been established and implemented which ensures that all employees understand their responsibility during an emergency situation, whether its evacuating the building, responding to a release,"
