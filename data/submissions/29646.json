IF AN ACCIDENTAL RELEASE SHOULD OCCUR, THE FACILITY IS PREPARED TO WORK WITH THE LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENT, OR OTHER AUTHORITIES, TO MITIGATE ANY RELEASE AND MINIMIZE THE IMPACT OF THE RELEASE TO PEOPLE AND THE ENVIRONMENT.\n\n2.  FACILITY INFORMATION.\n\n     THE PRIMARY ACTIVITY AT THE FACILITY IS THE STORAGE AND BLENDING OF FERTILIZER FOR SALE TO FARMERS.\n\n     ANHYDROUS AMMONIA IS RECEIVED, STORED AND DISTRIBUTED FOR DIRECT APPLICATION.\n\n     THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY STORED WOULD BE 421,688 POUNDS IN OUR TWO STORAGE TANKS AND NURSE TANKS.  THE STORAGE TANK SIZES ARE 30,000 AND 18,000 GAL. THE NURSE TANKS ARE \n1,000, 560, 500, 350 AND 300 GAL.\n\n3.  THE WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO.\n\n     A.  THE WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO WOULD BE THE RELEASE OF THE TOTAL CONTENTS OF A STORAGE TANK RELEASED AS A GAS OVER 10 MINUTES.  THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY RELEASED WOULD BE 130,000 POUNDS, WHICH REPRESENTS THE VOLUME OF THE STORAGE TANK AT 85 PRECENT CAPACITY AS LIMITED BY DESIGN STANDARDS.  THE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT IS 1.12 MILES.\n\n     B.  THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO BASED ON THE FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY IS A RELEASE FROM A BREAK IN A TRANSFER HOSE.  THE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT IS .56 MILES.\n\n4.  THE ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM.\n\n     THE FACILITY HAS IMPLEMENTED THE PROVISIONS OF SAFETY REQUIREMENTS FOR THE STORAGE AND HANDLING OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA, K-61.1, PUBLISHED BY THE AMERICAN NATIONAL STANDARDS INSTITUTE, INC., AND THE STANDARDS OF THE U.S. OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ADIMINISTRATION {OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, STORAGE AND HANDLING OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA.\n\n5.
