THE PLAN POLICY\n\n       THE OWNERS, MANAGEMENT, AND EMPLOYEES OF MEADOWLAND FARMERS COOP ARE COMMITTED TO THE PREVENTION OF ANY ACCIDENTAL RELEASES OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA AND PROPANE. IF AN ACCIDENTAL RELEASE SHOULD OCCUR, THE FACILITY IS PREPARED TO WORK WITH THE LOCAL FIRE COMPANY, OR OTHER AUTHORITIES, TO MITIGATE ANY RELEASE AND MINIMIZE THE IMPACT OF THE RELEASE TO PEOPLE AND THE ENVIRONMONT.\n\n2. FACILITY INFORMATION\n\n      THE PRIMARY ACTIVITY AT THE FACILITY IS THE STORAGE AND BLENDING OF FERTILIZERS FOR SALE TO FARMERS, AND PROPANE SALES AND DELIVERY.\n\n      ANHYDROUS AMMONIA IS RECIEVED, STORED AND DISTRIBUTED FOR DIRECT APPLICATION. ANHYDROUS AMMONIA IS USED FOR CROP PRODUCTION NUTRIENTS. PROPANE GAS IS RECIEVED STORED AND DISTRIBUTED FOR DELIVERY FOR HOME HEATING, FARM AND COMMERCIAL BUSINESS USES.\n\n      THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY OF AMMONIA STORED WOULD BE 380,000 POUNDS IN OUR ONE 30,000 GALLON AND ONE 18,000 GALLON STORAGE TANKS AND NURSE TANKS. THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY HANDLED WOULD BE THE UNLOADING OF A TANK TRUCK HOLDING 40,000 POUNDS.\n\n      THE MAXIMUN QUANTITY OF PROPANE GAS STORED WOULD BE 230,000 POUNDS IN OUR TWO 30,000 GALLON STORAGE TANKS. THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY HANDLED WOULD BE THE UNLOADING OF A TANK TRUCK HOLDING 40,000 POUNDS.\n\n3. THE WORST CASE SCENARIO AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\n     A. THE WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO FOR ANHYDROUS AMMONIA WOULD BE THE RELEASE OF THE TOTAL CONTENTS OF STORAGE TANK RELEASED AS A GAS OVER TEN MINUTES. THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY RELEASED WOULD BE 140,000 POUNDS WHICH REPRESENTS THE VOLUME OF THE 30,000 GALLON STORAGE TANK AT 85 PERCENT CAPACITY AS LIMITED BY DESIGN STANDARDS. THE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT (POINT OF DISPERSION TO 200 PPM) IS 1.12 MILES.\n\n      THE WORST CASE SCENARIO FOR PROPANE WOULD BE THE FAILURE OF ONE 30,000 GALLON TANK "

ACCORDING TO THE EPA LOOKUP TABLES, THE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT IS .43 MILES.\n\n      B. THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO FOR ANHYDROUS AMMONIA BASED ON THE HAZARD REVIEW IS A TWO MINUTE RELEASE FROM A BREAK IN A 3 INCH PIPE. THE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT (POINT OF DISPERSION TO 200 PPM) IS .78 MILES.\n\n      THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO FOR PROPANE WOULD BE THE FAILURE OF ONE 30,000 GALLON STORAGE TANK  WHEN FILLED TO 85 PERCENT CAPACITY (115,000 POUNDS) RESULTING IN A TWO-THIRDS OF A VAPOR CLOUD EXPLOSION, CAUSING A 1 PSI OVERPRESSURE. ACCORDING TO THE EPA LOOKUP TABLES, THE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT IS .29 MILES.\n\n4. THE ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PROGRAM\n\n      THE FACILITY HAS IMPLEMENTED THE PROVISIONS OF \"SAFETY REQUIREMENTS FOR THE STORAGE AND HANDLING OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA, K-61.1\", PUBLISHED BY THE AMERICAN NATIONAL INSTITUE INC. AND THE STANDARDS OF THE US OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"STORAGE AND HANDLING OF PROPANE\". IN ADDITION, MINNESOTA DEPT OF AG RULES, FOR PROPANE NFPA-58 RULES.\n\n5. THE FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n     A. THERE HAVE BEEN NO ACCIDENTAL RELEASES OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA OR PROPANE IN THE PAST FIVE YEARS THAT:\n      HAVE CAUSED ANY DEATH, INJURIES OR SIGNIFICANT PROPERTY DAMAGE AT THE FACILITY;\nNOR TO OUR KNOWLEDGE, HAVE RESULTED IN OFFSITE DEATH, INJURIES, EVACUATIONS, SHELTERING IN PLACE, PROPERTY DAMAGE OR ENVIROMENTAL DAMAGE.\n\n6. THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\n\n      THE FACILITY HAS:\nA. A WRITTEN EMERGENCY ACTION PLAN, IN ACCORDANCE WITH OSHA STANDARD, 29 CFR 1910.38; \n\nB. PROVIDED STATE AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES WITH THE EMERGENCY PLANNING AND COMMUNITY RIGHT-TO-KNOW INFORMATION AS REQUIRED UNDER SARA TITLE III (EPCRA).\n\nC. COORDINATED WITH LOCAL EMERGENCY RESPONDERS.\n\n7. PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n      SAFETY IMPROVEMENT IS AN ON-GOING PROCESS AT THE FACILITY. PERIODIC EVALUAT"
