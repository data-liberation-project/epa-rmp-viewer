THE PLAN POLICY\n\n       THE OWNERS, MANAGEMENT, AND EMPLOYEES OF MEADOWLAND FARMERS COOP ARE COMMITTED TO THE PREVENTION OF ANY ACCIDENTAL RELEASES OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA AND PROPANE. IF AN ACCIDENTAL RELEASE SHOULD OCCUR, THE FACILITY IS PREPARED TO WORK WITH THE LOCAL FIRE COMPANY, OR OTHER AUTHORITIES, TO MITIGATE ANY RELEASE AND MINIMIZE THE IMPACT OF THE RELEASE TO PEOPLE AND THE ENVIRONMONT.\n\n2. FACILITY INFORMATION\n\n      THE PRIMARY ACTIVITY AT THE FACILITY IS THE STORAGE AND BLENDING OF FERTILIZERS FOR SALE TO FARMERS, AND PROPANE SALES AND DELIVERY.\n\n      ANHYDROUS AMMONIA IS RECIEVED, STORED AND DISTRIBUTED FOR DIRECT APPLICATION. ANHYDROUS AMMONIA IS USED FOR CROP PRODUCTION NUTRIENTS. PROPANE GAS IS RECIEVED STORED AND DISTRIBUTED FOR DELIVERY FOR HOME HEATING, FARM AND COMMERCIAL BUSINESS USES.\n\n      THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY OF AMMONIA STORED WOULD BE 380,000 POUNDS IN OUR ONE 30,000 GALLON AND ONE 18,000 GALLON STORAGE TANKS AND NURSE TANKS. THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY HANDLED WOULD BE THE UNLOADING OF A TANK TRUCK HOLDING 40,000 POUNDS.\n\n      THE MAXIMUN QUANTITY OF PROPANE GAS STORED WOULD BE 230,000 POUNDS IN OUR TWO 30,000 GALLON STORAGE TANKS. THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY HANDLED WOULD BE THE UNLOADING OF A TANK TRUCK HOLDING 40,000 POUNDS.\n\n3. THE WORST CASE SCENARIO AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\n     A. THE WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO FOR ANHYDROUS AMMONIA WOULD BE THE RELEASE OF THE TOTAL CONTENTS OF STORAGE TANK RELEASED AS A GAS OVER TEN MINUTES. THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY RELEASED WOULD BE 140,000 POUNDS WHICH REPRESENTS THE VOLUME OF THE 30,000 GALLON STORAGE TANK AT 85 PERCENT CAPACITY AS LIMITED BY DESIGN STANDARDS. THE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT (POINT OF DISPERSION TO 200 PPM) IS 1.12 MILES.\n\n      THE WORST CASE SCENARIO FOR PROPANE WOULD BE THE FAILURE OF ONE 30,000 GALLON TANK "
