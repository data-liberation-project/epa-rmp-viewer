      "SummaryText": "Lowman RMP Executive Summary\nFor EPA Report\n\nThis executive summary provides a brief overview of the risk management plan as it has been developed and implemented at the Lowman Power Station, one of several facilities owned and operated by PowerSouth Energy Cooperative, Inc. (PowerSouth).\n\nI. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nEmployee safety and environmental protection are the drivers for PowerSouth policies at our Lowman Power Station.  In our view, environmental protection includes the health and welfare of the community surrounding Lowman.  This is why PowerSouth has installed selective catalytic reduction (SCR) equipment to reduce air pollution and use ammonia as the most efficient chemical in the industry to accomplish this reduction.  The use of ammonia means that PowerSouth must develop and implement a risk management plan to prevent the accidental release of ammonia to the atmosphere.  We have done so and provide a description of that plan here.\n\nPowerSouth is committed to environmental leadership in managing its generating station for the public benefit, including the production of reliable, competitively priced power.  PowerSouth also assures that employees are aware of their environmental responsibilities, which include the safe and responsible use of chemicals for air pollution reduction.  PowerSouth management and employees are responsible for maintaining compliance with environmental requirements and striving for environmental excellence in performing their respective duties.  Beyond the development and implementation of this RMP, PowerSouth?s commitment to environmental protection extends to the review of new developments in safe technologies, operating procedures, and emergency preparedness.

      "SummaryText": "r residents and businesses in 39 Alabama counties and 10 Florida counties. Lowman Power Station was built in the 1960?s to answer the increasing electric demand of a growing rural area.  The first Lowman generator placed on line was Lowman 1 in 1969, with a maximum capacity of 86 MW.  It was followed by Unit 2 and 3, 258 MW units in 1979 and 1980, respectively.  \n\nAll Lowman units are designed to burn coal.  Particulate emissions from the three units are controlled by electrostatic precipitators. In addition, all three units are now equipped with flue gas desulfurization systems (scrubbers) to control sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions. Additionally, Units 2 and 3 are also now equipped with SCR units for the reduction of NOx emissions.\n\nThe SCR process requires ammonia.  The anhydrous ammonia storage and handling facility includes two 30,000-gallon storage tanks with supporting unloading equipment, forwarding pumps, piping to convey the liquid ammonia, vaporizers to convert ammonia from a liquid to a gas, and a gas dilution and injection components to inject ammonia into the SCR emission control system.  For the purpose of the RMP, anhydrous ammonia is the only regulated substance at the facility above a RMP reporting threshold amount.  With two 30,000-gallon storage tanks, the maximum amount of anhydrous ammonia in the storage facility at any time is 285,000 pounds and the maximum amount contained in the largest single vessel is 139,950 pounds.\n\nThe Lowman Plant also uses chlorine to disinfect process water used for the wet scrubbers used to removed particulate matter and sulfur dioxide and to disinfect cooling tower water and clarifier effluent.  The facility uses chlorine in one-ton containers and 150-pound cylinders to achieve the disinfection of process water for reuse.\n\nIII. Summary of Worst Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nThe worst-case release scenario and an alternative release scenario for each toxic chemical were identified and analyzed to determine t"

Worst-case and alternative release scenarios have been determined after careful review of the regulation and consideration of the storage vessel configuration at the facility. \n\n IV. Description of Release Prevention Program\n\nThe prevention program is arguably the most important element of the RMP.  Its successful implementation requires the active participation of plant employees and managers in conducting activities aimed at preventing accidental releases of regulated chemicals.  If a prevention program could be perfect, there would be little need for emergency response activities, since no unexpected releases would occur.  Accordingly, a well-developed and properly implemented prevention program lowers the possibility of an accidental release and minimizes the consequences of a release should once  one occur.  The prevention programs for the Lowman SCR and chlorination processes consist of twelve elements, which are briefly described here.\n\nA.  Process Safety Information - PowerSouth maintains documentation of the needed safety information concerning chemical hazards, system operating parameters, and process equipment designs and specifications.  This information was used as the basis for the Process Hazard Analyses and is readily available for review and reference by employees.\n\nB.  Process Hazard Analysis - PowerSouth conducted detailed process hazard analyses (PHAs) of the process to ensure that the hazards associated with the process were identified and controlled effectively. The What-If analysis methodology was used to assess these hazards for the SCR process.  The analyses, in the form of workshops, were conducted by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering, control logics, and process operations and facilitated by a person trained in the assessment methodology used.  The findings and recommendations that resulted from the workshops were addressed.  The What-If analysis was conducted on "

The HAZOP methodology was used to assess the hazards for the chlorination process.  The HAZOP was conducted by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering, safety, and process operations and facilitated by a person trained in the assessment methodology used.  The findings and recommendations that resulted from the HAZOP were addressed.  The chlorine HAZOP was conducted on May 28, 2008.  A pre-startup safety review of the system was conducted prior to startup of the chlorination process.\n\nC.  Operating Procedures - PowerSouth has established and maintains procedures for safely conducting activities related to the SCR and chlorination processes.  The procedures cover the required operational phases including initial startup, normal startup, normal shutdown, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, and startup following a turnaround or emergency shutdown. The information is readily available to operators and maintenance personnel involved in the process and the information is periodically reviewed to assure it is current.\n\nD.  Training - PowerSouth's training program, as it relates to the SCR and chlorination processes, has been implemented to ensure that all personnel involved in the operation and maintenance of the process are properly trained in the workings of the process and are knowledgeable of the hazards of the process.  These personnel were given initial training and will be provided with refresher training at least every three years or more often if needed.\n\nE.  Mechanical Integrity - PowerSouth conducts well-documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure safe and reliable operations. All process equipment routinely checked includes storage tanks and pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and venting systems, controls and pumps, emergency shutdown systems, and monitoring devices.

Equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected promptly and safely.  Procedures and frequencies for all process equipment inspections and service are performed in accordance with the manufacturer?s specifications.  The facility maintains a computerized maintenance management system (CMMS) that enables timely inspections and serves as a repository for documentation of work performed.\n\nF.  Management of Change - PowerSouth maintains written procedures to manage changes in the process equipment, procedures and monitoring technology.  Personnel whose job tasks are affected by a modification in the process are promptly apprised of the modification and provided training to address new requirements.\n\nG.  Pre-Startup Review - A pre-startup safety review was conducted prior to the startup of each new process.  Established pre-startup safety review procedures assured that construction, equipment, and operating and maintenance procedures were suitable for a safe startup before actually placing the process equipment into operation.\n\nH.  Compliance Audits - PowerSouth will conduct compliance audits of the risk management plan at least every three years and develop a written report of the findings.  Any corrective actions required as a result of the audits will be promptly and safely implemented.\n\nI.

In addition, our employees have access to all information developed through implementation of the RMP, including information resulting from process hazard analyses.  These policies are contained in a written employee participation plan that is part of the RMP.\n\nK.  Hot Work Permits - PowerSouth has developed and implemented a hot work permit program to be used whenever hot work operations are conducted on or near the SCR process or chlorination process.  The hot work permit must be issued and signed by the appropriate supervisory personnel. \n\nL.  Contractors - PowerSouth develops partnerships with contractors to effectively conduct business and maintain generation facilities, especially in maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, PowerSouth evaluates the qualifications of the contractor including its safety performance.  Written procedures are in place to ensure that contractors are properly informed of known potential hazards related to the contractor's work on or near the regulated process, including the emergency response procedures to follow in the event of an accidental release of ammonia.\n\nV. Five Year Accident History \n\nBoth the ammonia and chlorination processs are new processes to the Lowman Plant and therefore do not have an accident history.\n\nVI. Emergency Response Program\n\nThe Part 68 rule distinguishes between those facilities that will respond to accidental releases of regulated substances and those that will not.  The requirements for non-responding facilities are covered in Section 68.90 of the rule.  For these facilities, an emergency action plan is required.

It is the definition of response used in the OSHA HAZWOPER standard in 29 CFR 1910.120(a)(3) and is defined as ?a response effort by employees from outside the immediate release area or by other designated responders ? to an occurrence which results, or is likely to result, in an uncontrolled release of a hazardous substance.?  This definition specifically excludes responses to incidental releases, which are those ?where the substance can be absorbed, neutralized, or otherwise controlled at the time of release by employees in the immediate release area, or by maintenance personnel.?  If the release of chemical is substantial or clearly growing in size, the leak is no longer considered incidental and employees should not respond unless they are specifically trained in response procedures and the facility has an emergency response program that meets the requirements of 40 CFR 68.95. \n\nFor non-responding facilities, an emergency action plan must include these elements:  (1) emergency escape procedures and emergency escape route assignments; (2) procedures to be followed by employees who remain to operate critical plant operations before they evacuate; (3) procedures to account for all employees after emergency evacuation has been completed; (4) rescue and medical duties for those employees who are to perform them; (5) the preferred means of reporting fires and other emergencies; and (6) names or regular job titles of persons or departments who can be contacted for further information or explanation of duties under the plan.\n\nPowerSouth has an emergency action plan in place to address and react to accidental releases of hazardous materials.
