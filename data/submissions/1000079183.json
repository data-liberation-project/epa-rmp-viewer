This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the use of chlorine at out facility.\n\nIf a release were to happen, we are fully coordinated with the Rock Island Fire Department, which provides trained response personnel.  They in turn are the agency who contacts the County and State.\n\n\n\n2. The Stationary Source and regulated Substance Handled.\n\nWe have one (1) regulated chemical at our facility which is CHLORINE. The maximum inventory is 14,000 pounds. No one container holds more than 2000 lbs.\n\n\n\n3. The Worst Case Scenario and Alternative Release Scenario.\n\nWe used the look up tables and equations provide by the EPA in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis. The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\n\n\nToxic Worst Case Analysis:\n\nThe worst case scenario involves a catastrophic release from a cylinder (one cylinder) broken or damaged outside the contaiment building, while unlaoding. This scenario involves the release of all 2000 lbs of chlorine from one cylinder over a period of 10 minutes. The distance to endpoint would be 1.3 miles, which effects an estimated 22,261 people.\n\n\n\nToxic Alternative Case Analysis:\n\nThis scenario involves the release of chlorine from a cylinder while inside the containment building, due to damage to piping or valves. This would involves the release of 200 lbs of chlorine over a period of 4,762 minutes. The release rate would be 0.04 lbs per minutes. The distance to endpoint is 0.08 miles.  The population affect would be 27, if it were allowed to escaped. All releases of chlorine within the containment building would be handled by the Scrubber system and no chlorine gas would escape.\n\n\n\nFla"

Any findings are documented and implemented, with the SOP modified as needed.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures:\n\nOur facity maintains detailed operating procedures. This information is periodically reviewed and is readily accessible to plant ersonnel.\n\n\n\nTraining:\n\nOur facility conducts training for all new employees and we conduct specific training regarding chlorine along with the Rock Island Fire Department every year. The supplier of chlorine comes to our facility to provide chlorine safety training at least every 3 years.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity:\n\nThe Water Treatment plant has a systematic maintenance program. There are 2 mechanics on the Maintenance Staff.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits:\n\nWe have obtained and use the EPA Level 2 Compliance Audit forms to conduct our own audit of our Risk Management Plan every 3 years. The next one will be in 2017.  A team is used to complete the Audit and any findings will be documented and implemented.\n\n\n\n5. Five Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidents in the last 5 years.\n\n\n\n6. Emergency Response Plan\n\nThe facility is included in the Written Community ER Plan.  The local coordinating agency for the plan is the Rock Island Fire Department; 309-732-2800. \n\n\n\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThere are no planned changes to the current plan."
