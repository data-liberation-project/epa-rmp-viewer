Public and environmental receptors that could possibly be affected by the scenarios were determined through the use of LANDVIEW 5 mapping system software and US Census Bureau 2000 data. \n\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe facility has taken all necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set forth in 40 CFR Part 68.

The facility maintains a written Emergency Response Plan to document specific procedures to be implemented in the event of various emergencies, including ammonia release. The Emergency Release Plan includes procedures for facility evacuation, as well as for notification o the local emergency response agencies, which are responsible for notifying the public. The plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within the facility that would require modified procedures.\n\nFood Lion Distribution Center # 3 has devised a comprehensive emergency response program, designed to protect both employees"

These personnel are trained in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.120, Hazardous Operations and Emergency Response regulations according to their duties and function. These personnel also receive initial training and annual update training thereafter.   \n\nTo assure that the local governmental response agencies are familiar with Food Lion Distribution Center # 3 emergency response procedures, Food Lion Distribution Center # 3 has provided copies of the ERP for review and approval by the local agencies. \n\nTo plan for an ammonia release with off-site effects, Food Lion Distribution Center # 3 ERP includes procedures/equipment to mitigate the release, procedures to inform local response agencies, transportation maps for response agencies, evacuation route maps, and procedures for public communication.\n\nIn addition to the above local response agencies, Food Lion Distribution Center # 3 has arranged emergency response backup and assistance with a local clean-up contractor.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\nFood Lion Distribution Center # 3 aim is to provide a professional service as efficiently as possible while minimizing the use of toxic materials wherever and whenever prudent.
