Once the action item has been completed, the resolution can be documented using PSMWriter as well. A list of current or past due action items can be accessed at any time by those with access to PSMWriter.\n\nIn addition to utilizing PSMWriter to create, schedule, track, and document events, Wawona Frozen Foods has also entered into a contract with Resource Compliance to obtain help with RMP-PSM program implementation.\n\nFor the future, Wawona Frozen Foods now thinks of the RMP-PSM program as a living document. It is an interactive framework that guides safe action for Wawona Frozen Foods employees, but allows for feedback and continual improvement. Through the RMP-PSM program Wawona Frozen Foods will continue to maintain overall plant worker and public safety."

Both employees were using a full face respirator and freezer gear equipment (Jacket ,Cold Suit, Gloves). The employees proceeded to immediately evacuate the area by lowering the scissor lift. As the employees made their way out of the Warehouse #1 at approximately 12:18 pm, they called their supervisor to let him know that they needed help. The supervisor assisted the two injured employees as they were trying to catch their breath. Paramedics were called to assist the two employees and it was then determined to evacuate everyone else on site. An investigation was performed and the following recommendations were made and have been completed:\nWawona Frozen Foods employees did not properly follow the SOP for line breaking. Pressure still remained in the piping when opening the Parker CK2 Valve. Ensure to train all employees on the Line Break SOP to ensure pressure is not present in the line before opening.\nEnsure to perform and document a formal training event going over the details of the ammonia release from the Warehouse 5 Evaporator. The training should include an overview of the steps that resulted in the release and procedures for preventing incidents of this nature from occurring in the future.\n\nWawona Frozen Foods has determined that the Line Break SOP could be improved with the an additional verification procedure on pressurized equipment when performing line break. Future Line Breaks will include a second person to verify that pressure has been adequately removed from the line. Ensure to update the Line Break SOPs to include this step.\n\n1.5 Emergency Action and Response Plan\n\nWawona Frozen Foods' emergency action and response program has been developed to satisfy the following requirements:\n- Cal/OSHA's Emergency Action Plan - Title 8 CCR \u00a73220\n- U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Admi"

During these meeting we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\n\nWawona Frozen Foods has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the ammonia refrigeration processes. These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release. The results of the analyses are reported in PSMWriter and hard copy binders. \n\n1.3.2 Anhydrous Ammonia\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration process at the Wawona Frozen Foods facility is an integral part of the overall business and operates most of the year. It is extremely important that this process is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner. Management is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.\n\nOur refrigeration personnel monitor the ammonia refrigeration process and keep active records of all procedures and transactions that pertain to ammonia. In addition, the process is checked frequently by one of the outside refrigeration contractors that we use. These contractors also assist in performing the annual mechanical integrity inspection of our ammonia equipment.\n \n1.4 Five Year Accident History\n\nOn 5/26/2023 Wawona Frozen Foods had an incident involving two refrigeration employees. The employees were working in Warehouse #1, where they were troubleshooting freezer evaporator #5 using a scissor lift. The evaporator line was isolated, and the two employees proceeded to remove the Parker CK2 valve cover. They removed the valve cover without an issue and placed it to the side of the equipment. After the cover was removed, the employees then continued working on the gas powered suction valve. Around 1"
