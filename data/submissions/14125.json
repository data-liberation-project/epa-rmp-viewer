We shall, as a minimum: (1) consult with employees and their representatives on the conduct and development of the process hazard review and other elements of the risk management plan, and (2) provide to our employees and their representatives access to the process hazard review and all other information required to be developed under that standard.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe City of Galveston believes that preventative maintenance is the key to minimizing the potential for accidental releases.  Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) have been reviewed and revised to enable the employees to perform their work in a safe and efficient manner.\n\nThe EPA has adopted a policy for non-responding facilities (another entity has agreed in advance to respond to the release).  This facility is a non-responding facility.  The Fire Department is the first responder.\n\nThis emergency response program does not include responses to incidental releases of hazardous substances, including chlorine, where the substances can be \"adsorbed, neutralized, or otherwise controlled at the time of the release by employees in the immediate release area, or by maintenance personnel\".\n\nThe City has taken steps to train the operators, supervisors, and maintenance crews to be knowledgeable in the emergency respon"

Above all, all employees know where the phone numbers of the first responders are located should a release occur.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Main Water Pump Plant utilizes chlorine for disinfection.  The maximum inventory and threshold quantity for this chemical are shown below.\n\nChemical                                      Maximum Inventory (lb.)

A dense-gas dispersion model (SLAB) was used to determine endpoint distances for both scenarios.  A dense-gas model is required since chlorine is heavier than air.  The model's input parameters are summarized in the table below.\n\nSLAB Input Parameters\n                                                            Worst-Case Scenario                                    Alternative Scenario\nWindspeed (m/s)                                 1.5                                                                  3\nAtmospheric Stability Class                 F                                                                     D\nTemperature (0 F)                                 104                                                                 104\nHumidity (%)                                         50                                                                   50\nHeight of Release (m)                           0                                                                     1\nSurface Roughness                              1                                                                    1\n                                                              Chlorine                               "

This Program includes:  safety information on the covered chemicals, hazard reviews, operating and maintenance procedures, training, compliance audits, incident investigations, and emergency response procedures.\n\n\nFive-year Accident History\n\nIn the last 5 years, there have not been any accidental releases from the covered processes that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering-in-place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe city will address the recommendations of the process hazards assessment for all areas of the prevention program and the emergency response program.  These updates will be completed by October 1999."
