      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\r\n\r\nIntroduction and Background\r\n The Ft. Pierce Utilities Authority (FPUA) is committed to delivering quality drinking water and responsive service to its customers, and strives to be good a neighbor to the people who live near its treatment plants. This document is the FPUA Water Reclamation Facility (WRF) Risk Management Program/Process Safety Management Plan (RMP/PSMP), which details the prevention programs that have been implemented at the WRF to prevent and minimize the emergency release of chlorine gas. \r\n Because the WRF stores chlorine gas above the threshold quantity shown in Table ES-1, the FPUA is required to develop a plan to prevent and minimize emergency releases of chlorine gas to the atmosphere in quantities that could potentially affect the public beyond the facility's boundaries. The RMP regulations are from the in U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, which are detailed and codified in 40 CFR Part 68. The PSMP regulation is from the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) Standards, which are detailed in OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119. \r\n\r\nTable ES-1 RMP/PSMP Threshold Quantity for Chlorine Gas\r\nChemical Name - Chlorine\r\nLocation Used or Stored  - Chlorine Storage Area \r\nChemical Abstract Service Number - 7782-50-5\r\nEPA RMP Threshold Quantity (pounds) - 2,500\r\nOSHA PSMP Threshold Quantity (pounds) - 1,500\r\nMaximum Quantity on Site (pounds) - 24,000\r\n\r\n The chlorination process at the WRF is subject to the most stringent of the three RMP programs, Program 3, which has three major requirements. The first requirement is a Hazard Assessment, in which the effects that a release of a regulated substance could have on the public are determined. The Hazard Assessment for the WRF has been completed and can be found in the document titled Offsite Hazard Assessment for the Ft. Pierce Wastewater Treatment Plant. This report can be found in the Control Room of the WRF. The second requirement is a Prevention"

      "SummaryText": "Program, which consists of 12 elements designed to improve the system safety and decrease the likelihood of a release. The third requirement is an Emergency Response Program, which requires development of a plan for dealing with a release in the unlikely event that one would occur. The second and third requirements have also been satisfied and are detailed in this document, which will also be located in the Control Room of the WRF.\r\n Because the RMP and PSM regulations are very similar, the Prevention Program and the Emergency Response Program of the RMP also serve as the OSHA PSMP; therefore, this document is referred to as the RMP/PSMP. This RMP/PSMP is divided into 13 sections, each representing a paragraph of requirements from the OSHA PSM Standard.\r\n \r\nHazard Assessment\r\n A Hazard Assessment was performed for the FPUA WRF to determine the effects a chlorine gas release would have on the public. In this assessment, the distance a set endpoint concentration (3 mg/L) of chlorine gas would travel was estimated. In addition, an estimate of the population that could be affected by a release of chlorine gas was determined and sensitive receptors, such as hospitals, schools, and nursing homes, were identified. The Hazard Assessment considers two release scenarios-a worst-case and an alternative case. As part of the June 21, 2004 RMP Update the Hazard Assessment has been updated using the 2000 Census data.\r\n In fulfillment of the newly revised regulations, the worst-case and alternative case scenarios are not being presented in the executive summary.\r\n\r\nPrevention Program\r\n The Prevention Program, together with the Emergency Response Program, makes up the core of the RMP/PSMP. The Prevention Program consists of 12 elements, listed below, which are designed to improve system safety and decrease the likelihood of a release. These elements were developed by the FPUA with the assistance of CH2M HILL. \r\n* Employee Participation\r\n* Process Hazard Analysis\r\n* Process"

Employee participation is valuable because it increases the safety awareness of the staff and it allows the staff's experience in operating and maintaining the processes to be incorporated into the plan.\r\n FPUA WRF staff participated in the development of the Prevention Program through a series of meetings and workshops. They also participated in the development of the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA). The PHA was conducted on June 8, 1999. A list of recommended improvements to the chlorination system was developed in the PHA meeting. The most recent PHA was conducted on April 22, 2002.\r\n Staff who operate and maintain the chlorine gas processes were trained in how to safely maintain and operate the chlorine gas processes. Initial training was held on June 17, 1999. Other WRF staff received RMP/PSMP awareness training on June 18, 1999, which detailed how the new requirements may impact their jobs. The most recent RMP/PSMP refresher training was held on June 2, 2004.\r\nThe remaining elements of the Prevention Program were developed with the assistance of the Water Resources/Wastewater Systems Superintendent and the Water/Wastewater Maintenance Superintendent. These elements went into affect on June 21, 1999 and have been updated for the June 21, 2004 submittal.\r\n\r\nPrevention Measures\r\n To protect the welfare of the community, staff, and the environment, the FPUA has taken many proactive steps over the last decade to minimize potential hazards related to chlorine gas. It has satisfied and exceeded the requirements of RMP/PSMP, and has a number of preventative measures in place to guard against the release of chlorine"
