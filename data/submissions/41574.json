      "SummaryText": "The Agriprocessors facility located in Postville, Iowa is a beef and poultry processing facility that handles ammonia in it's refrigeration process, which is considered toxic by EPA.The primary purpose of this faciliy is to process live cattle and poultry into food products for distribution to retailers.\nAmmonia is used at the facility to refrigerate areas to maintain safe storage and processing of food products.Ammonia ia a valuable chemical used in the facility refrigeration system, providing the means to remove heat from the products being handled, a process typically used by food processors throughout the United States and around the world. The main supply of ammonia is stored in steel tanks located in the ammonia refrigeration compressor room. Ammonia is contained in equipment in the facility and is compressed and evaporated to remove heat from ares within the facility.\nSince ammonia is classified by the EPA as toxic chemical, it is necessary to observe certain saftey precautions in its handling to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the health threat to our own workers, and reduce the threat to nearby members of the community. It is our policy to adhere to all known Federal and state rules and regulations. Saftey depends upon the manner in which we handle ammonia combined with the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility, combined with the safe handling procedures that we use and the training of our personnel.\nAn accidental release prevention program is in place at this facility to maintain the integrity of the ammonia refrigeration system and minimize the potential for an ammonia release. Equipment was designed and installed following the codes and standard in effect at time of construction. Equipment up grades have been scheduled as warranted to maintain the equipment. It is the intent of this food processing facility, (Agriprocessors Inc.) to comply with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all known applicable state cod"

      "SummaryText": "es and regulations.\nAll of our ammonia refrigeration operators are trained using on the job training programs and experienced operators. The operations of the ammonia refrigeration system has been under the control of a stable work force. The key operator at the facility have worked here for at least 11 years.The plant program consists of having an effective preventitive maintenance program. The facility has a plan to replace saftey relief valves on a regular basis.\nOur emergy response program is based upon federal guidelines as they apply to this facilty. The emergency action plan includes procedures for notification of the local fire authority, local emergency response agencies, and notification of any potentially affected nieghbors. The facility emergency response plan is based on all known applicable regulations and requirments. The emergency response plan has been discussed with the Postville Fire Department and other agencies involved with a response. Representitives of the Postville Fire Department visited this plant on an annual basis. Other faciilty inspections occur routinely by other agencies such as USDA, insurance companies, OSHA, and our own internal quality control teams.\nThere have been no recordable accidents in the past 5 years related to the ammonia system.\nIn regards to the worst case release scenario as defined by EPA, the worst case release for ammonia from the high pressure reciever could travel 1.2 miles. An alternitive, more likley, release scenario could travel slightly less than 0.1 miles. \nIn all cases, of potential release, the extent of downwind areas affected is dependent on the amount of chemical released, weather conditions, wind speed and direction, etc."
