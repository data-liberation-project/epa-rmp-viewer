This program is designed to insure proper work practices and an on-going mechanical integrity program.  The primary methods used by this facility are a part of the Process Safety Management Program as follows:\n    A.  Written Plan of Action - Process Safety Information.\n    This part of the program is one of the most involved and included the development of a written plan of action regarding the implementation of employee participation in the program.  In accordance with a specific schedule outlined by the standard, as per 29 CFR 1910.119, Wabash Alloys has completed a compilation of written process safety information concerning the process and operations involved with Chlorine of these standards of operating procedures.  For purposes of defining a process covered under this program, the use of Chlorine in the demagging system has been considered \"a process,\" whereas a production or usage system/function is considered an \"operation.\"   By identifying each functional operation, a team was able to ascertain the potential and develop preparation plans in the case of a release.  This compilation of information is to enable Wabash Alloys and the employees involved in the operations related to Chlorine to identify and understand the hazards posed by these processes.  This process safety information includes information pertaining to the toxicological and physical hazards of the chemical listed.\n    B.  Hazard Analyses/Abatement Schedule.\n    This analysis is the heart of Wabash Alloys ' process safety management or Risk Management release prevention program.  The safety and health staff, engineering and maintenance personnel, and certain operational personnel performed an initial process hazard analysis (hazard evaluation) on each operation within the chlorine process.  The analysis was completed by a team with expertise in the operations.  The team included employees who have experience and kno"

The hazard analyses will be updated as needed and at least every five (5) years.\n    This analyses involved a review of each operation of the process to address steps for each operating phase, operating limits, safety and health considerations, and safety systems and their functions.  The assessment also included information concerning the emergency action plans related to the process; development and implementation of safe work practices in the format of Job Safety Analysis also in regards to the control of entrance and exit of personnel in the process areas; pre-startup safety; mechanical integrity of equipment; inspection and testing, correction of deficiencies in equipment, planned or unexpected changes to the process, equipment, and procedures to the processes.\n    C.  Written Operating Procedure.\n    Wabash Alloys has developed and implemented written operating procedures to provide clear instructions for safely conducting activities involved in the processes at each operation by our employees, consistent with the process safety information and to address steps for each handling phase, limitations, safety and health considerations, and safety systems and their functions.

Each contractor must also complete the Wabash Alloys Visitor and Contractor Safety Rules form prior to entry into the facility.\n    In those cases where contractors will perform work directly to or on the process equipment in which the Chlorine is present, the Safety Coordinator and Maintenance Supervisor provide an orientation section to them prior to beginning operations.  This orientation includes an introduction to the Wabash Alloys Process Safety Management Program, information concerning the toxicological and physical hazards of Chlorine, and the emergency response plan in the case of an incident involving a release.  Upon completion, the contractor is issued a permit by the Maintenance Supervisor to begin work.\n    F  Inspection and Testing.\n    A program has been developed for inspection and testing, correction of deficiencies in equipment, quality assurance, management of changes in the handling of the Chlorine, and procedures to the process, and compliance audits.\n(1) Mechanical Integrity Program and Assessment - To insure the integrity of the mechanical components of the chlorine process, a professional engineer, in collaboration with Wabash, LLC personnel has developed an On-going Written Mechanical Integrity Program.  This development included a thorough assessment of the process in an attempt to assess the age and present integrity of the component parts.  This assessment included the identification of the component parts for comparison with the manufacturer's specification for maintenance and replacement with \"like in-kind components\" on a scheduled basis.
