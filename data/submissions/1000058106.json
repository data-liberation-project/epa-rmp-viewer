The three propane storage tanks are administratively controlled to hold and not exceed 80% of their capacity.  The facility consists of pressure storage tanks, a truck loading dock, a propane dehydration system, an LPG odorization system and associated piping, valves and other miscellaneous equipment.    \n\n\n\nIn our process we use the following chemicals that the EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequence in the event of a substantial accidental release:\n\n\n\nToxics\n\n\n\nThere are no toxic materials contained on site above the threshold limits.\n\n\n\nFlammables\n\n\n\nPropane is a finished product which is received into the three storage tanks.  This material is routed from these tanks to the loading docks for  delivery into LPG tank trucks.  Ethyl mercaptan, which is used to odorize the propane delivered to the tanker trucks, is also present above the threshold quantity.\n\n\n\nKey Offsite Consequence Analysis Scenarios\n\n\n\nThe EPA's RMP rule requires that we provide information about the worst-case scenarios(s) and alternative release scenario(s) for our facility.  The following are brief summaries of these scenarios, including information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the exposure distances for each scenario.\n\n\n\nWorst Case Release Scenario - Regulated Toxic Chemical\n\n\n\nNo toxic material above the threshold quantity on site.\n\n\n\nAlternate Release Scenario(s) - Regulated Toxic Chemical\n\n\n\nNo toxic material above the threshold quantity on site.\n\n\n\nWorse Case Scenario - Regulated Flammable Chemicals\n\n\n\nThis simulation involves the rupture or failure of a propane storage tank resulting in a simulated vapor cloud explosion.  This scenario assumes there would be no mitigation.  All emergency response and early warning procedures to inform employees and the community would be exercised"

The quantity and endpoint of the simulation and the specifics of the simulation are available in the reporting of the Risk Management Plan\n\n\n\nAlternate Case Scenario - Regulated Flammable Chemicals\n\n\n\nThe alternate release scenario is a simulated rupture of a delivery hose at the loading docks resulting in a two minute release and simulated vapor cloud explosion.  This scenario assumed the pump continued to operate at its normal flow rate after the hose break, with a simultaneous failure of the primary excess flow shutdown device at the loading dock.  Mitigation measures were taken into account when selecting the alternative release scenario.  These measures consisted of reviewing the use of relief valves, check valves, manual shutoff valves, automatic shutoffs, startup and operating procedures, grounding equipment, and excess flow devices.  Activation of the Emergency Shutdown system after an assumed maximum time of two  minutes would isolate the source of the material and secure the facility.  All emergency response and early warning procedures to inform employees and the community would be exercised immediately if this were to occur.  The quantity and endpoint of the simulation is contained in the RMP registration data elements.\n\n\n\nWe are using this information to help us ensure that our emergency response plan and the community emergency response plan address all reasonable contingency cases.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\n\nEnterprise maintains an integrated contingency plan, which consolidates all of the various federal, state, and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning and reporting.  The program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  Furthermore, the plan is coordinated with the Lamar County Sheriff's Department Emergency Management District, which includes the local Police Department, Lamar Count"
