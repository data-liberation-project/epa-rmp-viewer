Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Villisca Elevator Incorporated in Villisca, Iowa are strongly committed to employee, public,\nand environmental safety.  This commitment is an inherent part of our comprehensive accidental\nrelease prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures,\nmaintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to\nimplement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If such a release\ndoes occur, we coordinate our response efforts with the Villisca Fire Department and the\nMontgomery County LEPC, which provide emergency response expertise to help limit the release\ndistances and lower the potential risk of  impacts.\n\n  2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities include retail sale of agricultural products including seed, feed,\nchemicals, and fertilizer.   We have anhydrous ammonia stored in a 12,000 gallon tank  at our east\nfacility in Villisca (Figure 1).  The maximum amount stored is 52,530  pounds at the maximum fill\ncapacity.\n\n\n  3. Worst Case Release and Alternative Release Scenarios\nWe utilized RMP PRO for the worst case and alternate case scenarios of the required offsite\nconsequence analysis for our facility.  The following details these scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario involves a catastrophic release of the entire contents of the          \nfixed anhydrous ammonia storage tank (52,530 pounds) in gaseous form over a 10-minute period. \nAt Class F atmospheric stability, 1.5 m/s wind speed, and a urban topography, the maximum\ndistance to a toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L is 3.4  miles (Figure 2).

The scenario involves the release of 11,326.85 pounds of ammonia in a liquid form\nover a period of 30 minutes.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic\nendpoint of 0.14 mg/L of ammonia is 0.31 miles (Figure 3).  The estimated population within a 0.31\nmile radius of the facility is 550 people.\n\n  \f  4. General Accidental Release Prevention Program\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the EPA's accidental release prevention\nrequirements as set forth in 40 CFR part 68.  The following sections briefly describe the elements\nof the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nThe Villisca Elevator maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical\nhazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associated with all processes (Appendix D).\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are\nidentified and controlled effectively.  Any findings from the hazard analysis are addressed in a\ntimely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nThe Villisca Elevator maintains written operating procedures to ensure that activities within our\ncovered processes are conducted safely.  These procedures address various modes of operation; the\ninformation is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes\n(Appendix B).\n\nTraining\nThe Villisca Elevator has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who\nare operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nThe Villisca Elevator conducts documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure\nproper operation.

      "SummaryText": "checks are conducted by qualified personnel with previous training\nin maintenance practices.  Examples of process equipment that would receive maintenance checks\ninclude:  pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency\nshutdown systems, controls, and pumps.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance\nchecks are corrected in a safe and timely manner (Appendix C).\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at the Villisca Elevator to manage changes in process chemicals,\ntechnology, equipment, and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or other\nemployees whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly notified\nof the modification and offered training to deal with it.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nThe Villisca Elevator routinely conducts pre-startup safety reviews related to new processes and\nmodifications in established processes.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction,\nequipment, and operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing\nequipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nThe Villisca Elevator conducts compliance audits on a regular basis to determine whether the plan's\nprovisions, set out under the 40 CFR part 68, are being implemented.   In addition, this facility is\ninspected annually by the Iowa Department of Agriculture and by our insurance company.  Any non-\ncompliance issue discovered during the audit is promptly corrected. \n\nEmployee Participation\nThe Villisca Elevator truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a\nteam effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning\naccident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access\nto all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP, particularly\ninformation resulting from process hazard analyses.\n\n  5.

Due to our stringent release prevention policies, no accidental release has occurred during this\nperiod.\n\n  6. Emergency Response Plan\nThe Villisca Elevator maintains a written Emergency Action Plan to deal with accidental releases\nof hazardous materials.  The plan addresses all aspects of emergency response including first aid and\nmedical treatment, evacuations, and notification of local emergency response agencies and the public\n(Appendix A).  Copies of the Emergency Action Plan are provided to both the local fire department\nand the LEPC.\n\n  7.   Planned Changes to Improve Safety\nSeveral developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various\nelements of our accidental release prevention program.   Public awareness and employee\nrefresher training are some of the major steps we want to take to improve safety at our facility. \nThese changes are being implemented annually."
