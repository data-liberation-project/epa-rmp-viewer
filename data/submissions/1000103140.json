Five-year accident history:\nLinde Gas & Equipment - Suffield Warehouse has not had an accident involving release of Hydrogen chloride, Chlorine and Trichlorosilane since beginning of operation in September 2022.\n\n5. Emergency Response Program:\nLinde has an emergency response program in place to minimize the effects of accidental release of regulated substances on employees, the public, and the environment. In the event of an emergency accidental release involving our Hydrogen chloride, Chlorine and Trichlorosilane storage systems, it is Linde Inc.'s policy to immediately notify the Suffield Fire Department and Linde\u0092s Emergency Response Team Support, either directly by call to team leadership, or via Linde\u0092s Emergency Response Hotline. We have communicated this policy with the Suffield Fire Department. All members of the Linde team are properly trained to respond to emergencies at the facility. All employees have access to Linde Emergency Action Plan. Emergency response training, including fire drills, is conducted annually.\n\n6. Planned changes to improve safety:\nLinde has a commitment to safety that is expressed in a company-wide goal of \u0093Zero/Zero\u0094, which means zero accidents and zero injuries or illnesses at each location. We look to constantly improve the safety of our processes using recommendations developed through the prevention program and a program soliciting safety suggestions from our employees."
