Personnel are expected to evacuate the facility and meet at a designated area outside the facility.  The plant manager or shift supervisor will either contact 911 or pull the fire alarm linked through the security system that dials 911 automatically.  Training and a practice drill are performed once per year.  The General Manager coordinates all public notifications.  The facility is included in the Monroe County LEPC \u00bfHazardous Materials Response Plan\u00bf.  This plan includes additional support to the facility in the event of an ammonia release.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nBased on the Process Hazard Analysis conducted on June 17, 2004, changes to the current facility safety program are not necessary."

      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nAccidental Release Prevention\n\nBodycote Thermal Processing\u00bfs overall intent is to minimize, where possible, the storage and use of highly hazardous chemicals in our heat treating facilities.  When highly hazardous chemicals are required to properly perform our heat treat processes, facility management is expected to ensure the safety of Bodycote associates and protection of the environment.  All managers must comply with Bodycote\u00bfs Policy on Environmental Issues.\n\nFacility and Substances Handled\n\nBodycote Thermal Processing operates a 15,000 square foot plant that provides heat-treating services to the metal working markets throughout upstate New York.  The facility uses ammonia in gaseous form along with hydrocarbon gases to create a hard, wear resistant surface on steel parts. Processes that require the use of ammonia are carbonitiding and nitrocarburizing.  Both of these processes are common to the heat treating industry.  Ammonia is used to supply nitrogen in a form readily absorbed by steel surfaces.  Commercially available nitrogen cannot be readily absorbed by steel and therefore is not a less hazardous substitute. \n\nThe ammonia is stored in a 9,200-gallon steel tank as a gas liquefied by pressure. The tank was installed in 1976.  The tank and all associated piping were repainted in August 2001.  Secondary containment was provided for the tank and product transfer area in July 2001.  A low line pressure alarm was also installed in July 2001.  Vaporized ammonia is drawn off the tank and delivered to the heat treat process via a piping system.  The supplier fills the ammonia tank approximately once every three months.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe facility maintains compliance with OSHA standard 1910.119, \u00bfProcess Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals\u00bf.  Also the supplier of the chemical, LaRoche Industries, has supplied the facility with recommended practices for the storage and handling of ammonia.  \n\nFive-Ye"
