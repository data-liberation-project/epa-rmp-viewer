In our manufacturing facilities we take special measures to ensure the safety of all involved.\n\n\n\nThe policy on chemical safety at the Liberty Plant is to prevent the release of chemicals through high standards of design and operation, and to provide measures to mitigate releases should they occur.  Baze Chemical is committed to operating and maintaining the facility in a safe and responsible manner and has the goal of no accidents or injuries.\n\n\n\nFACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nThe Liberty Plant is a chemical formulation facility that produces a range of specialty chemicals for use predominantly in the oil and gas industry.\n\n\n\nRegulated materials at the facility are Ammonium Hydroxide (up to 47,150 lbs., or 6,300 gallons) and carbon disulfide (up to 51,600 lbs., or 4,700 gallons).  The other raw materials used in the process as well as the products are not regulated.  Both Ammonium Hydroxide and carbon disulfide are stored in pressurized horizontal storage vessels maintained under an automated nitrogen cushion system.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe facility complies with the OSHA PSM rules as defined in 29 CFR 1910.119 and Program 3 requirements under EPA CAPP rules as defined in 40 CFR 68.\n\n\n\nSpecific design features and operating practices at the facility relevant to the control of Ammonium Hydroxide and carbon disulfide are:\n\n- Purging with nitrogen after each transfer operation to purge atmospheric oxygen from lines.\n\n- The provision of a scrubber system to remove trace vapors of NH4OH from vent discharges.\n\n- Padding of Ammonium Hydroxide and Carbon Disulfide storage tanks with nitrogen to maintain the vapor space in the non-decomposable range.\n\n- All penetration for liquid and vapor lines to the CS2 and NH4OH tanks are via top entry, thereby eliminating nozzles below the liquid level.\n\n- Secondary containment around the CS2 or NH"

The program addresses all the requirement of OSHA regulations for emergency action plans (per 29 CFR 1910.38).\n\n\n\nCoordination with local emergency responders is ongoing.  Baze Chemical has hosted meetings at the plant with the City of Liberty, Police Department and Liberty Fire Fire Department, to discuss possible emergency conditions at the plant.  Information on RMP worst credible scenario and alternative scenarios have been provided, together with a copy of the site's Emergency Response Plan.  The Liberty emergency services will act as \"first responders\" in the event of an emergency at the site.  Discussions with response agencies and familiarization of first responders with the facility are ongoing with annual visits from each department.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nThe Liberty Plant is a facility built to high standards.  While there are no specific planned changes, the facility will be managed in accordance with established process safety and environmental protection procedures.  The PHA of operation the employees identify one or more opportunities to improve safety and/or operations through improvements to plant and/or procedures.  The opportunities  were properly evaluated and managed through the site's management of change procedure (LIB-PSM-010) prior to implementation.\n\n\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\n\n\n\nAn offsite consequence analys"

As such, the rules require that the worst case release be the entire inventory of the largest container released over a 719-minute period.  As detailed elsewhere in this RMP submission, the endpoint for this scenario is 1.4 miles.\n\n\n\nAdditional offsite consequence analyses addressed in this RMP are:\n\n- Alternative release of CS2, based on a release during transfer of CS2 from truck to storage tank.  Release was assumed to be stopped after 1 minute by activation of emergency shutdown devices.  Distance to end point for this scenario was calculated at 0.3 miles.\n\n\n\n- Worst case release of Ammonium Hydroxide (NH4OH) (treated as a toxic liquid per RMP rules).  The entire contents of the NH4OH storage tank is assumed to be released into the dike and vaporize over time.  Distance to end point for this scenario was calculated at 0.7 miles.\n\n\n\n- Alternative release of Ammonium Hydroxide (NH4OH), based on a release during transfer of NH4OH from tank truck.  Release was assumed to be stopped after 1 minute by activation of emergency shutdown devices.  Distance to end point for this scenario was calculated at 0.1 miles.\n\n\n\n\n\n"
