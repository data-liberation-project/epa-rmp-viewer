The study included a detailed seismic analysis, a visual inspection, and evaluation of the seismic performance, recommended strengthening procedures and an engineering estimate of rehabilitation costs for each of the study buildings.  The analysis was carried out in sufficient detail to determine the structural adequacy of the buildings and its elements when considering either mission essential or life safety criteria.  These criteria are as follows:\n\n    Mission Essential Criteria:  The building is to remain functional after the design earthquake.\n    Life Safety Criteria:  The building is to resist collapse after the design earthquake.\n\nThe vulnerability of non-structural elements (equipment, architectural components and life-line utilities) are evaluated during visual inspections of the buildings.\n\nElements capable of disabling the operations of a building or of creating a falling hazard during an earthquake are identified.  This applies only to those elements available to the visual inspection.\n\nSince Building 00005 consists of two separate structures, thirteen individual reports were made.

The facility is bordered by the City of Ridgecrest on the south and west boundaries.  To the east lies the town of Trona and the north and east boundaries of NAVAIRWPNSTA China Lake are bordered by Wilderness Areas of the Bureau of Land Management (BLM).  Except for the BLM lands, land use around NAVAIRWPNSTA China Lake is residential, commercial, and Navy-related.  NAVAIRWPNSTA China Lake is located in three counties: Kern, San Bernardino, and Inyo.\n\nThe Navy has stewardship of approximately 34,700 acres in Kern county; 537,000 acres in Inyo county; and 527,000 acres in San Bernardino county. The Kern county acreage represents about 3% of the NAVAIRWPNSTA controlled properties in the Indian Wells Valley, the Searles Valley and the Superior Valley. The Mainsite area is the closest designated area to the city of Ridgecrest, California.  The Armitage Airfield is several miles Northwest of Mainsite.  142,000 acres of aircraft target ranges are located in the Northeastern corner of Kern county and continue into Inyo and San Bernardino Counties to the North and East, respectively.  The SNORT Track area is located in the Southwestern corner of the NAVAIRWPNSTA China Lake.  This area is bordered on the West and South by rural residents of the City of Inyokern. \n\nThe Inyo county property represents approximately 49% of the NAVAIRWPNSTA China Lake  controlled properties in the Indian Wells Valley area.

The following are brief summaries of these scenarios, including information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the exposure distances for each scenario:\n\nWorst-case Release Scenario(s) \u0017 Regulated Toxic Chemicals\n\nFailure of a storage tank containing 2,000 pounds of chlorine,  10 minute release.

Nearest offsite exposure is 0.20 miles.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario(s) \u0017 Regulated Toxic Chemicals\n\nLeaking cylinder containing 28.0 pounds of chlorine,  10 minute release.  Under stipulated weather conditions the substance could travel 0.40 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a significant hazard to the public. Nearest offsite exposure is 0.20 miles.\n\nWorst-case Release Scenario(s) \u0017 Regulated Flammable Chemicals\n\nStorage tank rupture containing 119,000 pounds of propane.  Storage capacity is limited to 90% of tank's capacity by the facilities procedures.  Under stipulated weather conditions the substance could travel 0.4 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a significant hazard to the public..  Nearest offsite exposure is 0.2 miles.

The Safety and Industrial Hygiene offices perform routine inspections and problem areas are cited for immediate correction.\n\nMITIGATION:  Efforts are under way to reduce the amount of Hazardous Materials being used.  The storage of smaller amounts of material will lessen the chance of a significant incident.\n\nABATEMENT:  In an emergency situation the Fire Department is immediately notified.  The incident is then evaluated for hazardous consequences.  Either the spill cleanup crew or the Emergency Response Team is notified and the proper regulatory agencies are contacted.  The incident is then dealt with in an approved manner which will curtail any negative impact on the biosphere and any surrounding areas of cultural or historical value.  \n\nTRAINING: NAVAIRWPNSTA China Lake training is"

The NAWCWD/NAVAIRWPNSTA China Lake Fire Department briefs employees on disaster preparedness.  They also hold classes on how to use equipment such as fire extinguishers.  In addition, all work areas hold periodic safety meetings to discuss site specific hazards.  Hazardous materials worker training records are kept in a database maintained on site for three years by the Hazardous Materials Division.\n\nSEISMIC EVALUATION OF BUILDINGS AT NAWS CHINA LAKE\n\nSeismic evaluation of the buildings at NAVAIRWPNSTA China Lake is conducted for the ground motion specified by the Western Division, Naval Facilities Engineering Command.  The seismicity of the region and the development of a site response spectrum have been presented in the report Earthquake Vulnerability Study of the Naval Weapons Center, China Lake, California, Phase I: Preliminary Study (TM No. 51-80-27), by T. K. Lew, dated November 1980.  The response spectra was established for a design earthquake with an 80% probability of not being exceeded in a 50 year period.\n\nAll buildings are analyzed utilizing linear-elastic mathematical models of the structures.  These mathematical models are developed based on data obtained from the drawings supplied by China Lake, site visits, field measurements, photographs and specifications.  Seismic loads are determined by a linear-elastic dynamic analysis for the previously described earthquake ground motions.  Anticipated damage to structures is evaluated by comparing the seismic induced loads with the performance criterion.  The assumption of a linear-elastic model is consistent with the relatively low stress levels found in the majority of the structural elements.  This approach is considered the acceptable standard for seismic evaluation studies.\n\nThe response spectra are site specific for the China Lake area an"

CERTIFICATION STATEMENT FOR PROGRAM 1 PROCESSES:\n\nBased on the criteria of 40 CFR 68.10, the distance to the specified endpoint for the worst-case accidental release scenario for the following processes is less than the distance to the nearest public receptor for the following processes: \n\na Propane Storage Site #2, \na Propane Storage Site #3, \na Propane Storage Site #4, \na Propane Storage Site #5, \na Propane Storage Site #7, and \na Propane Storage Site #8.  \n\nWithin the last five years, the processes have had no accidental release that caused offsite impacts provided in the risk management program rule (40 CFR 68.10 (b) (1)).  No additional measures are necessary to prevent offsite impacts from accidental releases.  In the event of fire or explosion, or release of a regulated substance from the processes, entry within the distance to the specified endpoints may pose a danger to public emergency responders.  Therefore, public emergency responders should not enter this area except as arranged with the emergency contact indicated in the RMP.  The undersigned certifies that, to the best of my knowledge, information, and belief, formed after reasonable inquiry, the information submitted is true, accurate, and complete.\n\n\n2.
