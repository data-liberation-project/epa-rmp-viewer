THIS FACILITY IS DESIGNED AND MAINTAINED WITH STRICT ADHERANCE TO ALL LOCAL, STATE AND FEDERAL RULES AND REGULATIONS.  THE KANSAS DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE INSPECTS OUR FACILITIES ON AN ANNUAL BASIS AND WE COMPLY TO ALL THEIR REQUESTS. \n\nTHE WORST CASE SCENARIO WOULD HAVE A TOXIC GAS RELEASE OF 131,000 POUNDS WITH A DISTANCE TO END POINT OF 2.5 MILES AND HAS THE POTENTIAL OF AFFECTING APPROXIMATELY 1350 AREA RESIDENTS.  PUBLIC RECEPTORS WOULD INCLUDE SCHOOLS, RESIDENCES, PRISON, PUBLIC RECREATIONAL AREAS AND THE DOWN TOWN AREA.  ADDITIONALLY,  WE HAVE A STATE LAKE WITHIN OUR DISTANCE TO END POINT AND COULD BE AFFECTED AS WELL.\n\nTHE EMPLOYEES WHO WORK IN THE AMMONIA PLANT ARE TRAINED IN SAFETY INFORMATION, HAZARDS, OPERATION PROCEDURES AND MOST IMPORTANTLY THE MAINTENANCE PRACTICES OF AN AMMONIA PLANT.  EMPLOYEES ALWAYS WEAR GOGGLES AND THE APPOPRIATE GLOVES WHEN FILLING NURSE TANKS.  MOREOVER, SAFETY WATER IS ALWAYS PROVIDED IN THE EVENT OF AN ACCIDENTAL RELEASE.\n\nWITH OUR TRAINING RECORD IN MIND, IT MAKES IT EASY TO REPORT TO THE EPA THAT NO INJURY ACCIDENTS HAVE OCCURED AT THE STORAGE FACILITY WITHIN THE LAST FIVE YEARS.\n\nTHIS COMPANY'S EMERGENCY ACTION AND RESPONSE PLANS HAVE BEEN SHARED WITH OUR LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENT AND THEY HAVE AGREED TO ASSIST US IN THE EVENT OF AN EMERGENCY."
