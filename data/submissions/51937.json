We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public, as well as protection of the environment.\n\nThe Dixie Pipeline Cheraw Terminal is owned by Enterprise Products L. P. and operated by Dixie Pipeline Company. The Cheraw Terminal is a LPG pipeline terminal connected to Dixie\u00bfs interstate LPG pipeline system.    The process is regulated by the OSHA Process Safety Management program for highly hazardous chemicals.\n\nWe use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help provide for the safety of our employees and the public, as well as protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n\u00bf\tA description of our facility and use of substances required by EPA's RMP regulation and the processes involved\n\u00bf\tEmergency Response Programs\n\u00bf\tGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\u00bf\tA five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals at the Cheraw Terminal that are regulated by EPA\u00bfs RMP rule.  \n\nFacility Description\n\nThe Cheraw Terminal engages in the pipeline receipt and storage of liquefied propane under pressure, and the loading of the propane into tank trucks.    The process is regulated by Federal OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119 and EPA 40 CFR Part 68.  We have registered the facility as an RMP Program Level 3 facility.\n\nThe facility receives, stores and distributes propane LPG.  There are four storage tanks at the Cheraw Terminal, a"

This material is routed from these tanks to the loading docks for distribution.\n\nKey Offsite Consequence Analysis Scenarios\n\nWorst Case Release Scenario \u00bf Regulated Toxic Chemical\n\nNo toxic material above the threshold quantity is present at the Cheraw Terminal.\n\nAlternate Release Scenario(s) \u00bf Regulated Toxic Chemical\n\nNo toxic material above the threshold quantity is present at the Cheraw Terminal. \n\nWorse Case Scenario \u00bf Regulated Flammable Chemicals\n\n\nThe Cheraw Terminal Risk Management Program registration includes information on a worst case scenario calculated according to the requirements of the RMP regulation.   All emergency response and early warning procedures to inform employees and the community would be exercised immediately if this were to occur.  The quantity and endpoint of the simulation and the specifics of the simulation are available in the Risk Management Plan regiatration\n\nAlternate Case Scenario \u00bf Regulated Flammable Chemicals\n\nAn alternate release scenario has been determined and the possible consequences calculated for the Cheraw Terminal.

The quantity and endpoint of the simulation are contained in the RMP registration data elements.\n\nWe are using this information to help us ensure that our emergency response plan and the community emergency response plan address all reasonable contingency cases.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nEnterprise maintains an integrated contingency plan, which consolidates all of the various federal, state, and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning and reporting.  The program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  Furthermore, the plan is coordinated with the Chesterfield County Sheriff\u00bfs Department Emergency Management District, which includes the local Cheraw Police department, Chesterfield County Sheriff\u00bfs Department, Cheraw Fire Department, and Emergency Medical Service.\n\nIn the event of an accidental release, local Enterprise personnel are trained to sound the alarm, shut off the source from a safe location and contact 9-1-1 and secure the area.  The 9-1-1 system is used to notify the local Police and Fire Departments.  \n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nEnterprise takes a systematic, protective approach to preventing accidental release of hazardous chemicals.
