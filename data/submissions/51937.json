We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public, as well as protection of the environment.\n\nThe Dixie Pipeline Cheraw Terminal is owned by Enterprise Products L. P. and operated by Dixie Pipeline Company. The Cheraw Terminal is a LPG pipeline terminal connected to Dixie?s interstate LPG pipeline system.    The process is regulated by the OSHA Process Safety Management program for highly hazardous chemicals.\n\nWe use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help provide for the safety of our employees and the public, as well as protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n?    A description of our facility and use of substances required by EPA's RMP regulation and the processes involved\n?    Emergency Response Programs\n?    General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n?    A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals at the Cheraw Terminal that are regulated by EPA?s RMP rule.  \n\nFacility Description\n\nThe Cheraw Terminal engages in the pipeline receipt and storage of liquefied propane under pressure, and the loading of the propane into tank trucks.    The process is regulated by Federal OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119 and EPA 40 CFR Part 68.  We have registered the facility as an RMP Program Level 3 facility.\n\nThe facility receives, stores and distributes propane LPG.  There are four storage tanks at the Cheraw Terminal, a"

The facility consists of pressure storage tanks, a truck loading dock, associated piping, valves and other miscellaneous equipment.  The process and storage is a wholesale product distribution terminal for propane LPG.    \n\nIn our process we use the following chemicals that the EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequence in the event of a substantial accidental release:\n\nToxics\n\nThere are no toxic materials contained on site above the threshold limits.\n\nFlammables\n\nPropane is a finished product which is received into four storage tanks.  This material is routed from these tanks to the loading docks for distribution.\n\nKey Offsite Consequence Analysis Scenarios\n\nWorst Case Release Scenario ? Regulated Toxic Chemical\n\nNo toxic material above the threshold quantity is present at the Cheraw Terminal.\n\nAlternate Release Scenario(s) ? Regulated Toxic Chemical\n\nNo toxic material above the threshold quantity is present at the Cheraw Terminal. \n\nWorse Case Scenario ? Regulated Flammable Chemicals\n\n\nThe Cheraw Terminal Risk Management Program registration includes information on a worst case scenario calculated according to the requirements of the RMP regulation.   All emergency response and early warning procedures to inform employees and the community would be exercised immediately if this were to occur.  The quantity and endpoint of the simulation and the specifics of the simulation are available in the Risk Management Plan regiatration\n\nAlternate Case Scenario ? Regulated Flammable Chemicals\n\nAn alternate release scenario has been determined and the possible consequences calculated for the Cheraw Terminal.  Details of the alternate case scenario and the endpoint of the simulation are contained in the RMP registration.  Mitigation measures were taken into account when selectingand estimating the effects of  the alternative release scenario.   A"

All emergency response and early warning procedures to inform employees and the community would be exercised immediately if the assumed or any other alternate release were to occur.  The quantity and endpoint of the simulation are contained in the RMP registration data elements.\n\nWe are using this information to help us ensure that our emergency response plan and the community emergency response plan address all reasonable contingency cases.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nEnterprise maintains an integrated contingency plan, which consolidates all of the various federal, state, and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning and reporting.  The program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  Furthermore, the plan is coordinated with the Chesterfield County Sheriff?s Department Emergency Management District, which includes the local Cheraw Police department, Chesterfield County Sheriff?s Department, Cheraw Fire Department, and Emergency Medical Service.\n\nIn the event of an accidental release, local Enterprise personnel are trained to sound the alarm, shut off the source from a safe location and contact 9-1-1 and secure the area.  The 9-1-1 system is used to notify the local Police and Fire Departments.  \n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nEnterprise takes a systematic, protective approach to preventing accidental release of hazardous chemicals.  Our Process Safety Management systems address each of the key features of successful prevention program, including:\n\n?    Process safety information\n?    Process hazard analysis\n?

If something out of the ordinary is found, it is reported to management in order to expediently resolve any problems.\n\nThe engineering and administrative controls in place have been established to reduce the risk of an accidental release of identified hazards.  Enterprise is committed to operations that are safe for employees and the surrounding community.\n\nAccident History\n\nRecords are kept for all significant accidental chemical releases that occur at our facility.  The following is a brief summary of accidental chemical releases involving materials covered under EPA's RMP rule during the past five years:\n\nBased on the criteria set forth in 40 CFR 68.10, this facility has not had an accidental release.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe following is a list of improvements that are planned for implementation at the facility to help prevent and/or better respond to accidental chemical releases:\n\n?    The PSM system is constantly being subjected to critical reviews with an objective of improving the programs.\n?    The written PSM management system is presently undergoing a review, with specific emphasis being placed on the written mechanical integrity program.\n?    The Emergency Preparedness Plan is presently being reviewed and updated and will be coordinated with local officials when complete.\n?    The Safety Procedures and Policies Manual is presently being reviewed and updated and should be completed in the fall of 2006."
