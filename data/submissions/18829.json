By doing so, we believe the community will better understand how safe and ecologically sound BASF operations are.\n\nPolicies\n\nBASF Corporation has the following Corporate Guidelines related to environmental, health and safety:\n\n7 We produce products that are safe to manufacture, use and dispose of.\n7 We assist our customers to use our products safely and in an environmentally sound manner.  We provide them with information on correct handling of our products.\n7 We minimize the impact on mankind and the environment during production, storage, transportation, marketing and use of our products.\n7 Economic considerations do not take priority over environmental protection, health and safety.\n7 An important contribution to \"Sustainable Development\" is our involvement in the \"Responsible Care\" initiative worldwide.  This applies to our products and services in all our businesses and affiliates.\n7 We are committed to making continuous improvements in safety, health and environmental protection.  We do this acting on our own initiative and in consultation with recognized regulatory authorities.

Our goals are to promote and strengthen mutual understanding and deepen trust in what we do.\n\nThe BASF Corporation Beaumont Site implements these policies through site-specific programs and procedures.\n\nFacility Description\n\nThe BASF Corporation Beaumont Site produces several brands of trade name herbicides.  These include Banvel(R), Clarity(R), Distinct(R) and , Frontier(R) as well as a variety of other formulations which are used in the farm sector to enhance growth, to eliminate weeds, and to improve the yield in general.  Chlorine, dimethylamine, and methyl chloride are used to produce some of these products. \n\n\n\n\n\nRelease Scenarios\n\nWorst Case\n\n7 Toxic gas release of chlorine with off-site impacts resulting from rupture of a chlorine rail car.\n\n\n7 Vapor cloud explosion resulting from the release of dimethylamine from a rail car with off-site impacts.\n\n\nAlternative\n\n7 Vessel leak of chlorine with minimal off-site impact.  Passive mitigation includes a dike.  Active mitigation that is available but not accounted for in determining the off-site impact includes firewater sprays to limit gas evolution as well as  a flow-limiting valve.\n\n\n\n7 Vessel leak of methyl chloride with no off-site impact.  Passive mitigation considered is a dike and active mitigation includes a foam sprinkler system.\n\n7 Vapor cloud explosion resulting from the release of dimethylamine with minimal off-site impact.  Active mitigation consists of diluting anhydrous dimethylamine with water upon receiving it which drastically reduces its flammability.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nTo prevent accidental releases, this facility is in compliance with the EPA Risk Management Program and the OSHA Process Safety Management standard.    Extensive efforts have been made to avoid situations that could provide the conditions which could lead to the release of any ch"

The site is a member of the Sabine Area Chiefs Association, which is a mutual aid group, and assists the Jefferson County Local Emergency Planning Commission.  The site maintains a complete fire fighting facility manned by volunteer employees who receive extensive training.  This training consists of off site training as well as regularly scheduled on site drills.  A plant wide system of fire water piping with emergency pumps and power.  A system of foam generators are available where ever flammable solvents are stored and throughout the tank farm.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nFacility processes are routinely changed to improve safety as a result of employee suggestions, process hazard analyses, incident investigations, etc."
