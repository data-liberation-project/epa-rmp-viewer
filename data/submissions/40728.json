As a part of the public service sector, we are committed to protecting the public and the environment. Our programs include an aggressive preventative maintenance program, extensive training and coordination with local emergency response personnel to efficiently react to an emergency.\n\nDescription of the Facility:  We treat the wastewater for our area.  Part of the process requires insuring that disease-causing pathogens do not cause outbreaks of illnesses in the public. Chlorine is used to kill bacteria and other pathogens in our process.\n\nOur system includes automatic alarms and we have procedures in place to respond to emergency situations.\n\nThere are strict licensing requirements to be a plant operator.  In addition to our on-site training and safety procedures, the Michigan MIOSHA and environmental agencies regulate our activities.\n\nAs part of the requirement of this EPA  program, we carefully reviewed our accident history for the last 5 years and we found that we have operated without a reportable chlorine related incident. We are dedciated to safety and our record proves it.\n\nIn case of an emergency, our personnel will work with local fire department responders and the Local Emergency Planning Committee.  We have training every year for our people and we coordinate with the fire department on a regular basis.  Althrough we take extensive precaustions to prevent a chlorine release, we firmly believe in having a plan in case of an emergency.  This is the same philosophy, which leads to fire drills and first aid training.\n\nWe are constantly looking for methods to improve. As part of this program we performed an extensive self-eva"
