      "SummaryText": "1.Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n\nThe owners, management and employees of Royster-Clark, Inc., West Point,VA., are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of ammonia from Anhydrous Ammonia and Aqua Ammonia.  If any accidental release should occur at the facility, personnel have been instructed and are prepared to work with the King William County Emergency personnel, the West Point Fire Department and other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release on people and the environment.\n\n2. The stationary source and regulated substance handled:\n\nThe primary activity at the West Point facility of Royster-Clark, Inc., is the blending and storage of fertilizer for sales to agricultural users (farmers). Additionally, the facility converts Anhydrous Ammonia to Aqua Ammonia for use in blending of fertilizer at this location and other Royster - Clark, Inc. fertilizer blending facilities in the region.\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia is received by railroad tank cars and used from the railroad tank car in the conversion process to Aqua Ammonia. The Aqua Ammonia is stored for use in the blending of fertilizer for plant nutrients or for shipment by tank trucks. \n\nThe maximum quantity of Anhydrous Ammonia stored at this facility would be 160,000 pounds in a Railroad Tank Car. The maximum quantity of Aqua Ammonia at this facility would be 1,130,000 pounds, stored in 7 - 20,000 gallon storage tanks and 1 - 11,000 gallon storage tank. The Aqua Ammonia contains a maximum of 30% Ammonia and all of these storage tanks are in a diked area. There could be a maximum of 500,000 pounds of Ammonia at this facility if all storage tanks were full and there was a full Anhydrous AmmoniaTank Car in place for processing. This maximum storage would only happen in the rarest of circumstances because of inventory monitoring and control procedures.\n\n3. The worst-case release scenario and the alternate release scenario:\n\na. The worst-case rel"

      "SummaryText": "ease scenario would be the release of the entire contents of Anhydrous Ammonia from a fully loaded Railroad Tank Car released as a gas in a 10 minute period. The maximum quantity of Anhydrous Ammonia released would be 160,000 pounds, which is the capacity of the Railroad cars. The distance to the end point of 200ppm of Ammonia, as determined by The Fertilizer Institute's Model - Degadis, is 1.22 miles. The release would affect 700 residents, schools, hospitals, recreation areas, commercial and industrial areas, offices and wild life preserves. The possibility of this worst - case release occurring is extremely unlikely as the railroad tank car is placed on an isolated siding at the facility and these railroad tank cars are periodically inspected and maintained according to Department of Transportation requirements.\n\nb.The Alternate Release Scenario, based on the most likely potential incident, is a release of Anhydrous Ammonia from a leak in a 2 inch transfer hose, during the unloading procedure, with the release discontinued in 2 minutes. The calculated quantity of Anhydrous Ammonia released would be 11,900 pounds. The distance to an end point of 200 ppm of Ammonia, as determined by The Fertilizer Institute's Model-Degadis, is 0.56 miles. This release would affect 214 residents and an industrial and commercial area and an office area. The possibility of this alternate release scenario occurring is extremely unlikely as West Point personnel periodically inspect, repair, and replace related equipment according to established standard procedures.\n\n4.The General Accidental Release prevention program:\n\nThe West Point facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\" published by the American National Standard Institute, Inc., the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration ( OSHA ) 29CFR 1910.111 \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\" and the provisions of Aqua Ammonia "

The Five-Year Accident History:\n\nThis facility has had no accidental release of  Ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or has resulted in any off site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6. The Emergency Response Program:\n\nThis facility has:\n\na. A written emergency response plan which is incorporated in the written community emergency response plan of King William County.\n\nb. Provided state and local authorities with emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\nc.A written response program, in accordance with the OSHA    standard 29 CFR 1910.120, including pre-emergency planning and employee training.\nThis facilitie's Emergency Response Program has been discussed with and reviewed by The West Point Volunteer  Fire Department which annually inspects the facility.\n\n7. Planned changes to improve safety:\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at all the facilities of Royster-Clark Inc..   Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the effectiveness of safety  practices and the proper maintenance of this facility. There are no additional specific Ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this facility at this time."
