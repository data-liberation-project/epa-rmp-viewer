      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\n\n\nThe Galliker Dairy Company (Galliker) facility in Johnstown, Pennsylvania has two separate ammonia refrigeration systems that are not interconnected but are co-located within a single engine room.  Based on calculations of the inventories in each system previously prepared, each system contains less than 10,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  However, the combined inventory of the two systems is more than 10,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  The applicability requirements at 40 CFR Part 68 do not make a clear distinction regarding the minimum distance needed for processes to be considered separate.  Therefore, the facility is making this submittal presuming that the systems are located in a way that an incident that affects one system, such as a fire in the engine room, would affect the other system. \n\n \n\nA. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nIt is the intent of Galliker to provide a safe work environment for every employee, and to protect them from injury and illness resulting from unsafe acts or conditions during hours of employment. Galliker will also comply with all Federal, State, and local laws. The Plant Manager has the responsibility for leadership of the safety and health program, for its effectiveness and improvement, and for providing the safeguards required to ensure safe conditions.\n\nAmmonia safety programs are key items in the plant safety and health program. Galliker takes many precautions to prevent or minimize accidental releases of ammonia. These precautions include safety controls (alarms and automatic shutdown devices) which are designed to identify and prevent potentially unsafe conditions such as pressure increase that could cause a system failure, a preventive maintenance program designed to maintain the ongoing integrity of the systems, a training program designed to ensure that the systems are operated by qualified personnel, and emergency response procedures which enable trained personnel to re"

Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe Galliker Johnstown, Pennsylvania facility utilizes anhydrous ammonia for refrigeration of raw milk, juice concentrate, and product storage, among other articles.  Ammonia is the only regulated substance handled at the Johnstown facility. \n\n\n\nC. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe Johnstown facility has implemented a program level 3 accidental release prevention program for the ammonia refrigeration systems that complies with OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard and EPA's Risk Management Program Regulation.  The ammonia prevention program consists of the following elements:\n\n-    Employee Participation Program\n\n-    Process Safety Information\n\n-    Process Hazard Analysis\n\n-    Operating Procedures\n\n-    Training Program\n\n-    Contractor Management Program\n\n-    Pre-Startup Safety Review Procedures\n\n-    Mechanical Integrity Program\n\n-    Hot Work Permit Procedures\n\n-    Management of Change Procedures\n\n-    Incident Investigation Procedures\n\n-    Emergency Planning and Response Procedures\n\n-    Compliance Audit Procedures\n\n\n\nD. Five-Year Accident History\n\nIn the last five years, there have been no accidental releases that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known off site deaths, injuries evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n\n\nE. Emergency Response Program\n\nThe Johnstown facility's emergency response plan complies with the OSHA requirements for Emergency Action Plans (29 CFR 1910.38 and 1910.119).  This plan contains procedures describing how the facility will respond to fires, ammonia leaks and other emergencies, including evacuation procedures.  \n\nThe plan is coordinated with the local community response plan and is available to those responding agencies.

The facility interacts with various local agencies in its emergency planning such as the Local Emergency Planning Committee, fire departments, law enforcement agencies, and hospitals.  Employees receive training in the response plan and in the competencies relative to their required roles in the plan.  Periodic drills are conducted at the facility and may include participation by outside responding agencies.\n\n\n\nF. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSafety improvements are a continual and ongoing process at the plant.  A formal process hazard analysis will be conducted every five years, but review is constant through management of change procedures, operator training, incident investigation, and mechanical integrity programs.  As a result, changes relevant to safety occur as needs are identified through these procedures and policies.\n\n"
