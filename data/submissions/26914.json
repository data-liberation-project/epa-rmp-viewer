In order to achieve these objectives, this RMP presents information on facility registration, off site consequence analysis, five year accident history, prevention program for \"Level 3\" processes, and the emergency response program for the facility.\n\nSpecifically, this program was written for the City of Tarpon Springs Wastewater Treatment Plant(WWTP) in accordance with section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act and 40 CFR Part 68- Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions. This facility is permmitted by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection to operate as a 4.0 MGD Annual Average Daily Flow Type 1 Bardenpho BNR domestic wastewater treatment plant\n\nThe WWTP uses chlorine gas for disinfection at the facility and sulfur dioxide (anhydrous) for dechlorination prior to dischagre to the Anclote River. The chlorine storage and dosing process is located within the perimeter of the facility, while the sulfur dioxide storage and dechlorination system is located at the outfall to the Anclote River.\n\nThe chlorination system uses two 500 pound per day chlorinators to combine in its gaseoous form with water to create an aqueous chlorine solution. The chlorine solution is injected into the filter effluent flow as theee water leaves the filter structure. The chlorine solution dose is determined using an ultrasonic meter that measures the flow of the filter effluent.\n\nThe effluent is then pumped to the chlorine contact chamber. The chlorine chamber serves to provide the detention time needed for effective disinfection. Effluent flow from the contact chamber flows to the adjacent 2.0 million-gallon reuse water ground storage tank. After the ground storege tank fills to its maxium cap"

      "SummaryText": "acity, the effluent level in the chlorine contact chamber increases until it overflows to the pipe transporting it to the outfall.\n\nPrior to discharge to the Anclote River, the effluent is dechlorinated using sulfur dioxide. The sulfonators operation is similar to the chlorinators. An equeous sulfur dioxide solution is dispensed just upstream of the outfall weir.\n\nBoth the chlorination and dechlorination processes are subject to 40 CFR Part 68 Level 3 requirements.\n\nIn order to have a sufficient amount for treatment, five 2000 lbs chlorine cylinders are kept at the WWTp at a time. The cylinder containers are stored in an elevated 17 by 31 foot concrete building, approximately 70 feet to the west of the ioperations building. The cylinders are maneuvered and placed on trunnions with an electric chain hoist. The EPA threshold quanity for chlorine is 2500 lbs.\n\nFour 2000 lbs sulfur dioxide (anhydrous) cyclinders are kept at the dechlorination building, which is approximately 850 feet north of the WWTP. The cylinder containers are stored in a concrete building similar to that for the chlorine storage. The cyclinders are maneuvered and placed on trunnions with an electric chain hoist. The EPA threshold quanity for sulfur dioxide (anhydrous) is 5000 lbs. Both storage buildings have exhaust fans, emergency breathing apparafus, and are protected from vehicle impacts.\n\nA series of Off-Site Consequence Analyses (OCA)  were conducted to provide information to the employees, emergency responders, and public about the potential  consequences of an accidental chemical release at the WWTP. The OCA for each chemical (i.e., chlorine and sulfur dioxide) consistes of two scenarios:\na. Worst -case Release Scenarios; and\nb. Alternative Release Scenarios.\n\nThe detailed analysis for each scenerio for each is presented in section 3- Off site Consequences Analysis. The following matrix presents the combined resultsof the OCA for both chlorine and sulfer dioxide:\n\nResults of the Off-Site Cons"

On May 29, 1998, an undetermined quanity of sulfer dioxide (anhydrous) was released from a 2-inch feed line at the outfall. No known off-site impacts were reported as a result of this incedent. As a result of this incedent investigation, a number of operational and process changes were made.\n\nPrevention Program for Level 3 Process identifies the elements that are the foundation of a sound prevention practices: process safety information, process hazard analysis, operating procedures, training, mechanical integrety, incedent investigation, and compliance audits. It is critical that these prevention practices be implemented in the operation of the WWTP on a daily basis.\n\nEmergency notification, response, and first aid procedures provided in this RMP were written in accordance with 40 CFR Part 68 and take into account existing measures established bt the City, emergency responders, and WWTP operations experts. These procedures are not intended to take the place of sound and reasonable judgement."
