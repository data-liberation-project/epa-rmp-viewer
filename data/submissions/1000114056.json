Dead River management philosophy goals are achieved through the implementation of the environmental, health and safety management systems, by the personal commitments of employees and contractors and through open communication with employees, customers, neighbors, and regulators. \nThe purpose of this Risk Management Plan (RMP) is to provide information about operations at the facility, programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, emergency response plans in the event an accidental release should occur, the five-year history of the facility and planned changes to improve safety at the facility. This will meet the requirements of EPA\u0092s Risk Management Program in 40 CFR 68.\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance \nThe Ely Siding in Fairlee, VT, is leased by Dead River Company. At the facility, railcars are stored on the property until procurement can find a suitable market for the liquids. Odorized propane is the only substance regulated under the Risk Management Plan (RMP) that is present at the Ely Siding in amounts above the threshold quantity. The facility is classified as Program Level 2 under the regulation because it is a remote, unmanned facility used for storage of railcars only.\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs in place at the facility are part of the high standards striven for by Dead River. These high standards include:\n\u0095\toperating in compliance with required environmental permits and regulations; \n\u0095\toperating and maintaining the assets in such a manner that unintentional releases are minimized; \n\u0095\toperating and maintaining assets in such a manner that small releases associated with norm"

      "SummaryText": "al operating and maintenance will be minimized to the extent possible; and\n\u0095\tcorrecting non-compliance found during regular audits of the facility.\nPrevention Program\nThe Ely Siding facility does not operate under the guidelines of the Occupational, Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Program since the facility is normally unmanned and remote. The facility does, however, operate under the requirements of Program Level 2 in the RMP regulations. Analysis of the potential hazards of the process, training of employees and emphasis on safety has helped avoid serious accidental releases since operations began. Part of this program involves identifying and taking steps to avoid potential accidental releases.\nFive Year Accident History\nNo incident resulting in onsite injuries, death, property damage, or offsite impacts from a propane release has occurred at the Wells River Passing Siding Facility within the last five years.\nEmergency Response Program\nDead River has never had an accident involving propane that caused or might have caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or shelters-in-place.  In the event of an emergency involving the propane facilities described herein, it is Dead River\u0092s policy to notify the Ryegate Fire Department and Vermont Rail System officials to coordinate an emergency response.  Dead River will also utilize its in-house trained fire brigade.  Dead River maintains a First Response Vehicle at its Bellows Falls,VT, location that is available for use at any location during emergencies.  For major emergency response, Dead River has agreements with private emergency response contractors to provide these resources when and where needed on a 24-hour basis.  \nThe worst-case release scenario is the rupture of a 30,000-gallon railcar resulting in a vapor cloud explosion. The resulting distance to the endpoint extends offsite 0.4 miles, and there are approximately 38 people in residences within"
