Facility Information\n\n     This facility is an agricultural based organization which not only produces and processes seeds, but also markets agricultural fertilizers and chemicals to farmers.  One fertilizer, Anhydrous Ammonia is received, stored, and distributed to farmers to be used as a crop production nutrient.  The maximum quantity stored at our facility, in locked storage tanks, is 620,000 pounds.  The largest tank size is 30,000 gallons and contains 140,000 pounds.  The maximum quantity handled at one time would occur during the unloading of a delivery tanker holding approximately 40,000 pounds.\n\n3.  The Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n     The facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements of the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S.  Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.\"\n\n4.  Five-year Accident History\n\n     There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:  have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property dam"
