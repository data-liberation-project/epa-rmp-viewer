PSM is an integral part of working safely at Crompton Manufacturing Company, Inc. facilities.  PSM ensures that proper safety information is in place; operating procedures are followed; chemical hazards are identified; employees and contractors are trained; and critical equipment is properly inspected and maintained.  PSM satisfies the accidental release prevention requirements of the RMP.\n\nSome of the many, specific safety features to prevent chemical accidents include:\n\n\u00bf  Computer controlled safety systems on the phosphorous trichloride storage and transfer systems to ensure that any deviations from the intended operating conditions are immediately identified and corrected;\n\n\u00bf  Safety procedures that reduce the potential for human error which could lead to a storage tank overfill;\n\n\u00bf  Secondary containment dikes around storage tanks and tank truck unloading areas to contain a spill;\n\n\u00bf  Building enclosures around phosphorous trichloride tank truck unloading and storage equipment to contain a leak;\n\n\u00bf  Transfer of phosphorous trichloride liquid is done with a double-walled or pipe-within-a-pipe system to prevent leaks to the atmosphere - includes a leak detection system;\n\n\u00bf  Gas sensors to detect and warn of a release of phosphorous trichloride;\n\n\u00bf  Phosphorus trichloride unloading operations are continuously attended by operators trained in DOT regulations;\n\n\u00bf  Extensive safety information about the processes reviewed with employees;\n\n\u00bf  Written operating procedures that include emergency response actions;\n\n\u00bf  Comprehensive employee and contractor training programs to promote consistently safe work-practices;\n\n\u00bf  Maintenance programs to ensure ongoin"

Even minor incidents are investigated to identify what went wrong and to learn how to prevent future occurrences.\n\nEPA requires that all incidents involving RMP-regulated chemicals that resulted in any off-site impact or significant on-site impacts are reported in this document.  During the previous five-year period, no such incidents have occurred at the plantsite involving phosphorous trichloride.\n\n7.0  EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe Morgantown, WV site maintains a written emergency response program designed to protect workers, the public, and the environment in the event of a major accidental release.  All of our employees are trained in the proper response to an incident.  We also invest in the equipment needed to respond to emergencies, both on-site and off-site.  Our medical and chemical response teams work closely with area hospitals, industries, and other response organizations in the Monongalia County area.\n\nFor example, recent emergency drills, organized and directed by the Crompton emergency teams, have included:\n\n\u00bf  A simulated liquid waste incident conducted in September 1996 with Monongalia County Emergency officials, and police departments from the City of Westover, West Virginia;\n\n\u00bf  A simulated chemical tanker truck incident with Monongalia County Emergency services conducted during January 1997;\n\n\u00bf  A simulated phosp"

These are known as the \u00bfNorth Plant\u00bf and the \u00bfSouth Plant\u00bf.  Both plants were built in 1965 and currently employ about 200 people in the Morgantown area.  Crompton Manufacturing Company, Inc. manufactures millions of pounds of antioxidant chemicals marketed under trade names such as ULTRANOX\u00ae, WESTON\u00ae, and others.  Our products are used in various plastics, inks, coatings, and adhesives for improved ultraviolet (UV) heat, color, and processing stability.\n\nThis site is also home to a Technology Center, where Crompton Manufacturing Company, Inc. conducts advanced research in specialty chemical technology.\n\n4.0  Hazard Assessment Results\n\nAs part of our risk management planning, we have specifically identified the type of event that, should it ever occur, would have the most negative impacts on our workers and our neighbors.  This is known as the Worst-Case Scenario (WCS).  As defined by EPA, we are required to assume that the numerous engineering and administrative safety controls we have in place to prevent or mitigate such accidents have all failed at once.  EPA defines a worst-case scenario as a catastrophic failure, which is an event that essentially results in the instantaneous release of the contents in the largest single vessel on-site.\n\nA worst-case and alternative release scenario were developed for the North and South Plants using the RMP Comp software and ALOHA software.
