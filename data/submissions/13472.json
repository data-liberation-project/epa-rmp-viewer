      "SummaryText": "The KIK Corporation is a manufacturer/packager/shipper of consumer household cleaning products for retail outlets.  KIK also has a plastics blow-molding operation; making all of the containers for their products.  There are several chemicals stored in bulk at the facility; Methanol, Caustic, Chlorine, and High Density Polyethylene,   The finished products are typically stored in one gallon or smaller polyethylene bottles and packaged in cardboard cases for shipment to retail outlets.  These cases are palletized for ease of handling and shipment.  KIK also has an on-site waste water treatment facility for the management of miscellaneous aqueous streams.The only chemical meeting the threshold quantity as determined under 68.115 is Chlorine.  KIK recieves 90 ton rail cars of chlorine.  This chlorine is used to make the varying grades of household bleach.  KIK has a chlorine monitoring system and an automatic shut-off system.  These systems consist of four (4) chlorine monitoring devices, four (4) automatic shut-off valves (Avs), two (2) chlorine expansion chambers, and asssociated relays and signal lines.  The automatic valves are air activated and close automatically in the event of a power failure.  The monitors are an electrolytic cell design.  Spare cells are maintained at the facility.  The monitors are located at each bleach unit, the two rail car stations, and on the chlorine line near the middle of the length from the rail cars to the bleach unit.  The chlorine line monitor is co-located with the automatic shut-off valve.  The other automatic shut-off valves are located at the bleach unit and at the rail car stations.  The two chlorine expansion chambers are located on the chlorine line on either side of the automatic shut-off valve.  The monitors are set to activate the automatic shut-off valves and sound an alarm at a concentration of one (1) part per million (ppm) of chlorine.  Each monitor at the rail cars and the monitor at the chlorine line are designed t"

      "SummaryText": "o shut down the system  Scenario #1:  If one monitor at a rail car senses  chlorine at or above 1ppm, the automatic shut-off valves activate at both rail car locations and at the chlorine line.  Scenario #2:  The monitor at the bleach unit activates only the automatic shut-off valve at the bleach unit.  The chlorine expansion chambers built into the chlorine line are also provided to allow for gas expansion in the event of an automatic system shut down.  Each chamber is sized to manage the chlorine gas contained within 125 feet of line.  The total length of the line is 160 feet.  The devices have internal rupture discs to allow the gas into the chamber.  Spare rupture discs are maintained on site.  The Chlorine line/system is constructed of one (1) inch schedule 80 pipe.  Three hundred pound fittings are used at all pipe junctures.  The system operates at 110 to 120 pounds per square inch; the piping is over designed to prevent any pipe or fitting failure.  The entire system is inspected weekly and preventitive maintenance is performed quarterly by qualified personnel.  The entire system is built to the recommendations of the Chlorine Institute.  The chlorine delivery line is completely indoors, except for a short section between the building and the unloading connection.  KIK utilizes 2 heat exchangers to maintain over design of the cooling capacity on the system, exceeding Tier Two control requirements.  Automatic high temperature shut-offs are in place, in addition to redundant sensors and alarms.  As an added safe guard, KIK employs local pressure indicators on the chlorine tank car and feed line.  The Department of Transportation mandates in 49CFR179.102 DOT specificatin 105A500W, that a tank car is to be constructed of two steel shells.  The internal shell is the pressure vessel holding the material and is to be constructed of 1-11/16 steel plate with a minimum bursting pressure of 1250 pounds per square inch (49CFR179.101-1).

      "SummaryText": "ressure of 500 psi is to be held by the tank car with no signs of leakage or distress for a period of 10 minutes, as set forth in 49CFR179.100-18.  Between the internal shell and the external shell there must be a 4 thickness of either cork board or 2 minimum of 4 lb/cubic foot dense polyurethane foam insulation (49CFR179.102.2).  The external jacket is to be of not less than 11 gauge steel as set forth in 49CFR179.100-4.  Safety valves are to have a maximum flow rating of 412 psi and be vapor tight at a minimum of 300 psi.  The typical pressure used as padding by KIK is 120 psi.  The padding pressure is significantly below the designed vapor pressure for the valves.  Again, the system is over desgned to insure employee and public safety.  KIK follows the procedures and safety measures recommended by the Chlorine Institute for the safe handling and use of chlorine.  The facility has written procedures for the unloading of Chlorine tank cars.  The employees managing the chlorine unit are specifically trained in the proper connection and disconnection protocols for rail cars.  A C-kit is on site in the event of a leaking valve, line, or leaking shipping container.  The operators responsible for the Chlorine system are trained by KIK's vendor Occidental in the proper usage of a C-kit.  The most catastrophic event that could occur at the KIK site is the rupture of a fully loaded 90 ton rail car.  Although an event of this nature has not occurred in the United States, KIK has taken steps to reduce the possibility of such an accident.  The most likely cause of a ruptured car would be from the impact of a locamotive or other rail car.  In order to prevent this, KIK has a derailer in use at all times, except when spotting cars for delivery.  During the delivery event, an operator is present to supervise the proper exchange of rail cars.  The most likely release event would involve the failure of an unloading line.
