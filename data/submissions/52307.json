There are a total of 6 screw compressors that handle the refrigeration loads.  There are 3low stage compressors and 3 high stage compressors acting either as low suction or high suction machines which is dictated by the load situations.  \r\n\r\nThere are two separate recirculator packages: one low temperature system operating at -38\u00f8F and a high temperature unit operating at +20\u00f8F.  The low temperature recirculator package feeds two spiral freezer evaporator units. The high temperature recirculator unit feeds 2 spiral cooling units. Hot gas defrost is employed for daily defrosting chores.\r\n\r\nThere are two evaporative condensers.  A Hansen auto-purger is also used to remove non-condensable materials.   \r\n\r\n\r\nProcess Description\r\n\r\nLiquid Side\r\n\r\nThe liquid supply for the system starts at the Condensers.  The Condensers change superheated vapor discharged from the Compressors and remove a sufficient amount of heat such that the vapor changes to a liquid (condenses).  This condensed liquid leaves Condenser units EC-1 and EC-2 via 4-inch pipes and flows to the thermosyphon header and the Thermosyphon Receiver (V-1).  \r\n\r\nThe Thermosyphon Receiver supplies liquid to each screw compressor for cooling of the oil.  These oil coolers are mounted on the side of SCB 1-3 and SCH 1 screw compressor units.  The refrigerant in the oil coolers naturally recirculates to and from the Thermosyphon Receiver when there is a heat load. On SCH 2-3 liquid goes into liquid injection system.\r\n\r\nThe high-pressure liquid also leaves the Thermosyphon Receiver via a 4 line and feeds the Hansen auto-purger unit and High Temperature Recirculator (HPR).  The High Temperature Recirculator is operated at +20\u00f8F.  The liquid supply to V-2 is controlled by a float and solenoid.\r\n\r\nThe liquid from the Low Temp Reci"

Ammonia Leak Plan of Action:\r\n\r\nUpon discovery of an ammonia leak, the liquid line feeding the ammonia room will be turned off.  At first, this may be the valve on the manifold in the engine room, but the valve closest to the leak is the most important one to close.  When this valve is off, others should be turned back on.  The King Valve will not be turned off except for necessary work in the engine room itself.\r\n\r\nThe suction side of the leak will be inspected to determine if a valve there can be closed to isolate the affected area.  An inspection must be make to determine if a vacuum needs to be maintained to remove ammonia or to allow the balance of the ammonia to waste into the room.\r\n\r\nDamage(s) will be repaired ASAP in order that refrigeration may be restored.  Broken parts will be saved for inspection by the insurance representative, if applicable.  Ventilation will be initiated simultaneously, being careful not to contaminate odor free storage areas.
