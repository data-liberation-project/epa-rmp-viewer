There are a total of 6 screw compressors that handle the refrigeration loads.  There are 3low stage compressors and 3 high stage compressors acting either as low suction or high suction machines which is dictated by the load situations.  \n\n\n\nThere are two separate recirculator packages: one low temperature system operating at -38?F and a high temperature unit operating at +20?F.  The low temperature recirculator package feeds two spiral freezer evaporator units. The high temperature recirculator unit feeds 2 spiral cooling units. Hot gas defrost is employed for daily defrosting chores.\n\n\n\nThere are two evaporative condensers.  A Hansen auto-purger is also used to remove non-condensable materials.   \n\n\n\n\n\nProcess Description\n\n\n\nLiquid Side\n\n\n\nThe liquid supply for the system starts at the Condensers.  The Condensers change superheated vapor discharged from the Compressors and remove a sufficient amount of heat such that the vapor changes to a liquid (condenses).  This condensed liquid leaves Condenser units EC-1 and EC-2 via 4-inch pipes and flows to the thermosyphon header and the Thermosyphon Receiver (V-1).  \n\n\n\nThe Thermosyphon Receiver supplies liquid to each screw compressor for cooling of the oil.  These oil coolers are mounted on the side of SCB 1-3 and SCH 1 screw compressor units.  The refrigerant in the oil coolers naturally recirculates to and from the Thermosyphon Receiver when there is a heat load. On SCH 2-3 liquid goes into liquid injection system.\n\n\n\nThe high-pressure liquid also leaves the Thermosyphon Receiver via a 4\" line and feeds the Hansen auto-purger unit and High Temperature Recirculator (HPR).  The High Temperature Recirculator is operated at +20?F.  The liquid supply to V-2 is controlled by a float and solenoid.\n\n\n\nThe liquid from the Low Temp Reci"

A float and solenoid device controls the liquid supply to V-1.  The liquid from the Low Temperature Recirculator is pumped to the -38? F spiral freezer air units LT- 3 and LT -4.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVapor Side\n\n\n\nThe Compressors remove the vapors from both the High Temperature Recirculator and the Low Temperature Recirculator vessels.  \n\n\n\nScrew compressors: SCH 1-3 remove the vapors from the High Temperature Recirculator.  Screw Compressor SCB 1-3 removes vapors from the Low Temperature Recirculator.   Screw Compressors SCH-1 and SCH-2 are capable of being used to remove vapors from either the High Temperature Recirculator or the Low Temperature Recirculator.\n\n\n\nThe discharge of all the compressors, SCH-1 through SCH-3, is sent to the main discharge header, which feeds the Condenser units.  The Condensers change superheated vapor discharged from the Compressors and remove a sufficient amount of heat such that the vapor changes to a liquid (condenses).  \n\n\n\nAdditionally, as required, some of the superheated discharge vapors (hot gas) are diverted for use as a defrosting medium.  This defrost gas is sent to the Air Units.\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinitions\n\n\n\nThermosyphon System\n\n\n\nA thermosyphon system is a means by which an uninterrupted supply of liquid refrigerant can be supplied to the compressor units.  This liquid utilizes a shell and tube or plate heat exchanger to keep the compressor's oil cooled and thus allowing the units to operate at the Manufacturer's recommended temperature.  \n\n\n\nLiquid ammonia is supplied to the inlet of the heat exchanger.  When a heat load is applied to the heat exchanger, some of the liquid is vaporized.  This vapor-liquid mixture that is less dense than a pure liquid.  The denser liquid (supply) displaces the lighter vapor-liquid mixture thus pushing the mixture out of the heat exchanger and b"

This difference in density creates a natural circulation.\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo Stage Compression System\n\n\n\nA two stage compressor system utilizes one or more compressors to pump the refrigerant vapor from the intermediate-pressure side to the high-pressure side of the refrigeration system.  Each compressor discharges directly to the condenser units via a common header. Booster compressors pump the refrigerant vapor from the low pressure side to the intermediate side of the refrigeration system.\n\n\n\n\n\nRecirculator System\n\n\n\nA recirculator system is a combination of a vessel, pumps, valves and other components used to feed a refrigeration circuit.  The pumps supply liquid to the various evaporators.  The outlet of the evaporators (consisting of liquid and vapor) is returned to the recirculator vessel for separation of the liquid and vapor.\n\n\n\nThe application can be either a low temp or high temp application. The liquid feed can be sub-cooled through an intercooler or fed directly from the receiver.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nGoglanian Bakeries Inc. practices preventative maintenance procedures to ensure the mechanical integrity of the refrigeration system. By having these procedures in place, it allows for the detection of any variations or issues before any risk or accidental release could occur. In addition, selected employees have been trained in Emergency Response and have annual refreshers as required. \n\n\n\nFacility and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nGoglanian Bakeries Inc. is the producer of flour based baked goods and uses the regulated substance anhydrous ammonia to help cool in the production process.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Emergency Response Plan\n\n\n\n1.) In case of an accidental release of ammonia gas, the Plant Emergency Response Plan will be initiated.\n\n\n\n2.)

That all appropriate valves and switches have been shut down or activated, whichever is applicable.\n\nf.

Ammonia Leak Plan of Action:\n\n\n\nUpon discovery of an ammonia leak, the liquid line feeding the ammonia room will be turned off.  At first, this may be the valve on the manifold in the engine room, but the valve closest to the leak is the most important one to close.  When this valve is off, others should be turned back on.  The King Valve will not be turned off except for necessary work in the engine room itself.\n\n\n\nThe suction side of the leak will be inspected to determine if a valve there can be closed to isolate the affected area.  An inspection must be make to determine if a vacuum needs to be maintained to remove ammonia or to allow the balance of the ammonia to waste into the room.\n\n\n\nDamage(s) will be repaired ASAP in order that refrigeration may be restored.  Broken parts will be saved for inspection by the insurance representative, if applicable.  Ventilation will be initiated simultaneously, being careful not to contaminate odor free storage areas.  Carbon Dioxide in cylinders will be placed in the area of the leak and valves will be carefully opened.  Enough ga"
