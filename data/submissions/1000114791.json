It is Materion\u0092 s policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  Materion takes a proactive approach regarding chemical safety and compliance by keeping abreast of any regulatory changes that may affect the Delta facility and/or the way the facility interacts with the local community.  Materion believes that it is extremely important to provide their employees with the best available safety information and equipment.  Materion believes that well-trained and informed employees are the key to preventing or minimizing chemical accidents that may affect the community and has several training programs in place for the safe handling of all chemicals and their facility, not just ammonia.\n\u00a0\nThe Emergency Response Program\u000bMaterion has several emergency response teams in place and ready to respond in the event of an emergency at the Delta facility.  These teams have specialized knowledge and training in order to safely and effectively respond to first aid, fire, chemical releases, and rope rescue incidents.  If an emergency were to occur, Materion emergency response teams would respond to the best of their abilities to control the situation.  If needed, Materion would request the assistance of the Delta Fire Department or the Millard County LEPC, depending on the emergency.\n\u00a0\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-specific Prevention Steps\nMaterion\u0092 s prevention program based on this regulation relies on employee participation.

The facility uses one ammonia storage tank with a capacity of 196,864 pounds.  Potential problem areas such as valves, hoses, connections points, etc. are visually inspected on a daily basis to ensure that the system is operating properly and there are no indications of potential equipment failure.\nMaterion\u0092 s facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.  The ammonia system has been designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with state law.\n\u00a0\nThe Five-Year Accident History\nMaterion had an accident involving ammonia that has resulted in injuries in the past five years.  The accident occurred on 1/21/2020 and resulted in 97 lbs of ammonia to be released.  One employee hurt his back jumping from a platform to get to the shutoff valve.  In the event of an emergency, Materion would implement its emergency response plan, and notify the Millard County LEPC.\n\u00a0\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nThe PSM team will be responsible for conducting routine Process Hazard Analyses (PHAs) for the Materion Delta site in order to meet the PSM requirements on both safety and regulatory compliance.
