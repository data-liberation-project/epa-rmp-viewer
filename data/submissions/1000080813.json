Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\r\n\r\nThe PVOH plant must maintain greater than 15,000 pounds of vinyl acetate monomer in inventory to safely and efficiently manufacture polyvinyl alcohol.  In the quantities handled by our facility, vinyl acetate monomer is considered to be a toxic liquid by the EPA.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local rules and regulations as well as our own environmental, health, and safety standards.  Sekisui manages the safety of our facility by designing for safe operation, operating the plant safely, maintaining the plant, and by auditing our operations. \r\n\r\nOur accident prevention program is based on OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation and our emergency response program is based on OSHA's HAZWOPER regulation. The emergency response plan includes procedures for the request of local fire support through Channel Industries Mutual Aid so that appropriate measures can be taken by local emergency responders if necessary.\r\n\r\nSekisui is committed to continuous improvement in all aspects of safety and environmental performance.  The Pasadena facility is actively involved with local organizations concerned with the safety of our community and the environment such as the East Harris County Manufacturer's Association, the Southeast Regional Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), and the Pasadena Citizen's Advisory Council.\r\n\r\nThis document has been prepared in accordance with EPA's Risk Management Plan regulation (40 CFR, Part 68).

To produce polyvinyl alcohol, vinyl acetate liquid is polymerized in reactors to form polyvinyl acetate.  The polyvinyl acetate is then converted to polyvinyl alcohol as a wet solid material which is processed and dried into a granular or powder-like material.  The product is shipped by railcar and bulk trucks to industrial customers for applications such as coating fibers in the textile industry and making water-based adhesives.  Vinyl acetate monomer is present on site in storage tanks, piping and the processing unit to maintain continuous and efficient production of polyvinyl alcohol.  \r\n\r\n\r\n3.  The general accidental release prevention program and specific prevention steps:\r\n\r\nThe PVOH plant is covered as a Level 3 Program as defined by the RMP regulation.  Our accident prevention program is based on OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation.  \r\n\r\nThe facility is designed for safe operation through the use of emergency shutdown systems and alarms, water deluge systems, fail-safe valves, and storage tank dikes.  Systems and equipment are designed  to applicable engineering standards and codes.  Safety reviews are conducted for all new installations and modifications to existing processes.  \r\n\r\nThe plant is operated safely by trained operators who follow documented standard operating procedures with defined safe operating limits. Process safety meetings are held regularly for all operating and maintenance personnel including contractors.  Investigations are conducted for all incidents.\r\n\r\nSafe operations are maintained through preventive maintenance and equipment inspection programs.  Contractors are held to the same high safety training standards as our employees.\r\n\r\nWe routinely audit our operations for compliance with federal, state, and local regulation.  We also have a program to audit the plant's performa"

Five year accident history:\r\n\r\nThere has been one spill of vinyl acetate monomer from the pipeline in the past five years that resulted in environmental damage. \r\n\r\n5.  The emergency response program:\r\n\r\nThe facility's emergency response program is based on the OSHA HAZWOPER and NFPA 600 standards. Sekisui has ~20 trained emergency responders on the Emergency Response Team. This includes a fire brigade, rescue team, a haz-mat team, and personnel certified by the Texas Department Of Health as EMS personnel.  In an emergency, an emergency response team member assumes on-scene command of the incident and establishes a \"Unified Command\" with an operations person from the affected area. On-site emergency resources include a quick attack truck, rescue trailer, and command vehicle.  In addition to these resources, the facility is a member of Channel Industries Mutual Aid (CIMA) and coordinates programs with the Southeast Regional LEPC, the Pasadena Fire Dept. and CIMA members. The plant Emergency Response Team members participate with the CIMA organization drills yearly at various plants in the area. \r\n\r\n6.  Planned changes to improve safety:\r\n\r\nPermanent repairs on the vinyl acetate monomer pipeline have been completed. Fixed fire protection systems have been upgraded. The Polyvinyl Alcohol facility was started up in 1991 under Air Products.  The facility was sold to Celanese Ltd. in 2000, and was purchased by Sekisui on July 1, 2009.  Process safety is evaluated regularly through conducting operational plant hazard reviews and studying incidents which have occurred within the chemical industry."
