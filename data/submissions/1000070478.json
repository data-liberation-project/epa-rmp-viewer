      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY - Omega Gas Plant\r\n\r\nMarkWest Oklahoma Gas Company, L.L.C (MarkWest), owner and operator of the Omega Gas Plant, has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\r\n\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nThe Omega Gas Plant Processes raw gas from the field gathering system. The unprocessed gas is brought into the plant via the inlet slug catcher which separates the condensate and free water from the natural gas stream. The gas is then compressed, CO2 removed and then dehydrated. The gas then enters a cryogenic process where it is cooled and the heavy natural gas liquids (NGLs) are removed. The remaining natural gas is sent to sales just off site. The NGLs, also known as Y-Grade are also sent to sales just off site.\r\n\r\nRegulated substances on site include flammable mixtures containing methane, ethane, butane, pentane, and propane. Pure refrigerant grade propane is also present on site. Determination of quantities calculations are available upon request.\r\n\r\nWORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS\r\n\r\nThe worst-case accident scenario was determined to be a release of the entire contents of a 126,000 gallon surge vessel containing condensate.  The release quantity for each regulated substance was modeled using EPA's RMP-COMP and was calculated using a typical condensate composition and density.\r\n\r\nThe alternative release scenario was determined to be the release of the entire contents of a 30,000 gallon NGL surge tank. The release quantity was modeled using EPA's RMP-COMP and was calculated"

Because the processes at the facility that are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) risk management program (RMP) regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\n\r\nMarkWest keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  The reference documents are maintained on file at the facility to provide open access.\r\n\r\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in safety data sheets (SDSs).  This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For the process, the facility has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in key process parameter documents.  The facility ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\r\n\r\nThe facility also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature"

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.  \r\n\r\nMarkWest will use one or more of the following techniques to identify hazards: what-if, checklist, what-if/checklist, hazard and operability (HAZOP), failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA), or fault tree analysis (FTA).  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques and will be utilized for each major process change or renovation.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\r\n\r\nEach PHA will address the following:\r\na)\thazards of the process,\r\nb)\tprevious incidents with likely potential for catastrophic consequences,\r\nc)\tconsequences of failure of engineering and administrative controls,\r\nd)\tengineering and administrative control applicable to the hazards an their inter-relationships,\r\ne)\tfacility siting issues,\r\nf)\thuman factors.\r\n\r\nThe PHA team findings are compiled in a written report and are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution.

The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\r\n\r\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the facility periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operative.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.  \r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\n\r\nMarkWest maintains written procedures that address various modes of operations, such as: unit startup; normal operations; temporary operations; emergency shutdown; normal shutdown; emergency operations, and initial startup of a new process.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.

Hot work permits are kept in a place that is easily accessible for the workers and on file at the office until the completion of hot work operations.\r\n\r\nContractors\r\n\r\nThe Omega Gas Plant uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors: perform their work in a safe manner; have the appropriate knowledge and skills; are aware of the hazards in their workplace; understand what they should do in event of an emergency; understand and follow site safety rules; and inform facility personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with: a process overview; information about potential fire, explosion, or toxic release hazards; emergency response plan requirements; and safe work practices prior to their beginning work.  In addition, the Omega Gas Plant evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.  Facility personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\r\n\r\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nThe processes at the Omega Gas Plant have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.  The following is a description of existing safety features applicable to prevention of accidental releases of regulated substances in the facility.  \r\n\r\nUniversal Prevention Activities\r\n\r\nThe accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all RMP-covered processes at the Omega Gas Plant.  Collectively, these prevention program activities prevent or mitigate potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\r\n\r\nSpecialized Safety Fea"

After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all knowledge is maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training. \r\n\r\nEach employee will be trained in the correct procedures affecting a process before they are allowed to operate equipment unsupervised. Training will cover an overview of the process, operating procedures, safety or health hazards, emergency operations and safe work practices. Competency will be documented.  Each employee will be retrained and/or reviewed on each procedure at least every 3 years. Competency will be documented.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\n\r\nMarkWest has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.  The basic aspects of this program include: training; written procedures; inspections and tests; correcting identified deficiencies; and applying quality assurance measures.  In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.\r\n\r\nMaintenance personnel receive training on an overview of the process, safety and health hazards, applicable maintenance procedures, emergency response plans, and applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their jobs in a safe manner.  Job plans/written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training.  Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended and to verify that equipment is"

      "SummaryText": "tures\r\n\r\nThe Omega Gas Plant has safety features on many units to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release.  The following types of safety features are used in the covered process: \r\nRelease Containment/Control\r\n\r\n1.  Process relief valves that discharge to a flare to capture and incinerate episodic releases.\r\n\r\n2.  Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual and automated).\r\n\r\n3.  Automated shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high temperature)\r\n\r\n4.  Curbing or diking to contain liquid releases.\r\n\r\n5.  Redundant equipment and instrumentation (e.g., uninterruptible power supply for process control system).\r\n\r\nRelease Mitigation\r\n\r\n1.  Trained emergency response personnel.\r\n\r\n2.  Personal protective equipment (e.g., chemical protective clothing).\r\n\r\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nThe Omega Gas Plant started operation in June 2018 and has had no accidents within the past 5 years.    \r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\r\n\r\nThe Omega Gas Plant maintains a written emergency response program, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  In addition, the facility has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform the"

Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years.  Both hourly and staff personnel participate as audit team members.  Team membership will include at least one person knowledgeable of the system being audited.  One member of the team must be qualified to lead the audit and be familiar with the auditing protocol being administered.  Audits will be conducted using the OSHA Verification Checklist CPL2-2.45a and the EPA Audit Guidance Checklist.  The Plant Compliance Coordinator will maintain a listing of all non-conformances identified during an audit and document closure of compliance audit action items.  The two most recent audit reports will remain on file with the documentation of closed items. \r\n\r\nThe audit team develops findings that are forwarded to facility management, engineering, and corporate for resolution.
