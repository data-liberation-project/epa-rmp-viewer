To ensure the safety of the public, Safeway Phoenix Ice Cream Plant personnel, and the environment, the plant has implemented a management system that integrates the elements of OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, 29 CFR 1910.119 and EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) rule, 40 CFR part 68.  The policies and procedures integrated under the Safeway Phoenix Ice Cream Plant's management system specifically address prevention of the release of anhydrous ammonia, and emergency response to an accidental release of ammonia.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe Safeway Phoenix Ice Cream Plant operates refrigerated storage freezers and process equipment.  Anhydrous ammonia is used as a refrigerant in the mechanical compression refrigeration system at the facility.  Ammonia is handled in a closed-loop process that consists of the following general stages: liquid storage; expansion; evaporation; compression; and condensation.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is the only process at the Safeway Phoenix Ice Cream Plant which is subject to the EPA RMP rule ( and the OSHA PSM standard).  Anhydrous ammonia is the only regulated substance handled in the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\nThe refrigeration cycle begins with the transfer of high pressure liquid ammonia from the Thermosyphon Receiver to the Controlled Pressure Receiver 2.  The Thermosyphon Receiver also supplies liquid ammonia to the Ice Cream Barrel Freezer Evaporators and Storage Silos.  In addition, liquid ammonia is routed to the compressors for thermosyphon oil cooling or liquid injection oil cooling.  As heat is absorbed at the evaporators and process equipment, the ammonia is partially vaporized.  The liquid/v"

The partially vaporized ammonia from the evaporators and chiller is drawn back to the High Temperature Accumulator.\n\nThe Intercooler provides subcooled liquid ammonia to the Low Pressure Recirculator 1 and 2 and the Palletizing/Ante Room Evaporators, East and West Dock Evaporators.  The temperature inside the Intercooler is maintained by the high side suction drawn by Compressors 1-4.  The partially vaporized ammonia at the evaporators is returned to the High Temperature Accumulator.  \n\nThe Low Pressure Recirculator 2 provides pumped low temperature liquid ammonia to the Penthouse and South Maintenance Warehouse Evaporators.  The partially vaporized ammonia at the evaporators is returned to the same vessel.  The temperature inside the Low Pressure Recirculator 2 is maintained by Booster Compressors 4-6.   \n\nThe Low Pressure Recirculator 1 provides pumped liquid to the Spiral Freezers and the Poly Tray Evaporators.  The partially vaporized ammonia is returned to the same vessel.  Following defrost of the evaporators, the defrost return is routed to the High Temperature Accumulator. Booster Compressors 1-3 maintain the pressure inside the Low Pressure Recirculator 1. \n\nThe High Temperature Accumulator receives high temperature suction from the Glycol Chiller, Silos, Palletizing/Packing Evaporators, Spiral Freezer and Poly Tray Evaporator defrost return, Palletizing/Ante Room Evaporators, Dock Evaporators and the Heat Exchanger.  High side suction is drawn from the accumulator by the Compressors 1-4.  Excess liquid is transferred"

      "SummaryText": " by the two Liquid Transfer Units to the Controlled Pressure Receiver 2.\n\nThe four compressors draw ammonia vapor from the Intercooler and High Temperature Accumulator.  At the compressors, the pressure and temperature of the vapor is increased.  The compressed vapor is discharged through a common header to the three evaporative condensers and to the evaporators, where the hot compressor discharge is used for defrost purposes.  At the condensers, water and fans are used to remove heat from the compressor discharge, and the resulting high pressure liquid ammonia flows back to the Thermosyphon Receiver, where the cycle begins again.  Booster Compressors 1-3 draw suction from the Low Pressure Recirculator 1, while the Booster Compressors 4-7 draw suction from the Low Pressure Recirculator 2.  Booster Compressor #7 is a swing compressor and is piped to draw suction from either the Low Pressure Recirculator 1 or 2.  After the pressure and temperature of the vapor is increased, the Booster Compressor discharge is routed to the Intercooler where it is cooled. The relief valves on the high pressure vessels and compressors are set at 250 and 300  psig and 150 for the low pressure vessels.  The relief valves vent to atmosphere outside the engine room. \n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe Safeway Phoenix Ice Cream Plant has many safety features, including those implemented on the ammonia refrigeration system.  Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system.  For example, the facility operates in accordance with the OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM), and Federal EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP), Program 3 requirements.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system at the Safeway Phoenix Ice Cream Plant was designed and constructed in accordance with the Uniform Mechanical Code, which specifically outlines requirements for the safe operation of the ammonia refrigeratio"

These safety features include ammonia sensors throughout the plant, pressure relief valves to protects vessels' integrity, and automatic shut down systems that prevent equipment damage and ammonia releases.  In the event of ammonia detection, audible and visual alarms are triggered throughout the facility. \n\nAmmonia refrigeration systems do not experience any chemical reactions or internal corrosion.  The only composition change that occurs within the systems are phase changes, as ammonia is cycled through various stages of liquid and vapor, similar to a household refrigerator.  The refrigeration system is a closed-loop system without any regular emissions or releases.  Any leaks are noted and repaired immediately.\n\nIn addition to the Uniform Mechanical Code, the facility will operate in accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines.  In particular, the IIAR Bulletin 110, \"Startup, Inspection, and Maintenance of Ammonia Refrigeration Systems.\"\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe facility was purchased from Shamrock Dairy by Safeway in 2002.  Renovations began in 2002 and were completed in early 2003.  Safeway, Inc. opened the facility as the new owner/operator in March 2003.  There have been no reportable releases in past five years.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe Safeway Phoenix Ice Cream Plant has an emergency action plan in effect.  The Emergency Action Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the PSM/RMP document, which is maintained at the facility.  Emergency response activities are coordinated with the Phoenix Fire Department and the local fire houses.  If necessary, the facility will call 9-1-1 to alert the local Police and Fire Departments.\n\nOther responders will be called as needed, including the Phoenix Fire Department.  If a release exceeds the federal reporting quantity of 100 pounds for ammonia, the National Response Center will be called.\n\nThe Safeway Phoenix Ice Cream"
