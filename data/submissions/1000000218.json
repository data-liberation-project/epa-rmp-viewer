In the event an\naccidental release should occur, we are prepared to work with our Local Fire Company(s), \nEmergency Response Personnel, and other appropriate authorities deemed applicable depending on\nthe specific incident, to best mitigate any release and to minimize the impact of the release to people\nand the environment.\n\nFacility Information:\n\nThe primary activity of our company is NAICS code 422910 \"Farm Supply Wholesaler\" because we\nare engaged in providing \"agricultural inputs\" that include the receiving, storage, and reloading of\nAnhydrous Ammonia for delivery to farmers in our area.  The NAICS code we feel most applicable\nfor receiving, storing, and reloading is # 493130 \"farm product warehousing and storage\".  Although\nAnhydrous Ammonia is the only product subject to the EPA Risk Management Plan at this time, it\nshould be noted that we also handle Propane for both agricultural uses and home heating, which is\nunder consideration as a listed substance.  We include Propane (as well as all crop protectents and\npetroleum products) in our planning, training, and maintenance programs,  however only the\nAnhydrous Ammonia facilities will be included in this report.    \n\nAnhydrous Ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application to farm fields during\nthe early and fall months.  During the balance of the year little if any product transfer occurs.   \nThe maximum quantity handled at a given time wou"

Total annual hours for these needs do not meet the 2,080 hour\nrequirement to qualify as a \"full time employee\" on site.  Rounding the fraction of these total hours\nto one significant digit produces one \"full time employee\" for item number 1.11. Our facilities have\nadequate lighting, and are inspected  at various times of day and night throughout the year.   Time\nexpended for these inspections is not included in our staffing calculation.\n\nWorst-case release scenario:\n\nThe \"worst-case release scenario\" is considered to be the release of the total contents of our largest\nAnhydrous Ammonia tank.  The maximum quantity released based on 85 % tank capacity as limited\nby design standards, and the distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) miles based on\nEPA's RMP -Comp Program (Version 1.06), as well as possible public and environmental receptors\nwithin the area have been provided to the County LEPC (Local Emergency Planning Committee) to\nassist them in their planning.   \n\nAlternative release scenario:\n\nThere has not been an actual release of Anhydrous Ammonia during the last 5-years at the site.  We\nbelieve the most likely release would be caused by a break in a transfer hose.  Transfer hoses are\nprotected by manual,  self closing excess flow , and \"pull away\" valves so our alternative release\nscenario is based on the loss of contents from the largest hose used (off loading transportation\nequipment).  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm), as well as, environmental and public\nreceptors has been provided to the County LEPC.\n\nAccidental Release Program:\n\nOur Anhydrous Ammonia accidental release program is based on guidelines found in the American\nNational Standards Institute, Inc.
