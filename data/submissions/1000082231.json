Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nWe at GEO Specialty Chemicals, Inc. (GEO) Deer Park, Texas are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of all substances.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handles                                                                                  \n\nGEO - Deer Park primary activities encompass Chemical Manufacturing.  We have four regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include Ammonia (anhydrous), Formaldehyde (44.5 % solution), and Hydrocyanic Acid.  The primary businesses are the manufacturing of a surfactant called DAXAD and Glycine. The DAXAD manufacturing process regulated raw material is Formaldehyde.  The Glycine manufacturing process regulated raw materials are Anhydrous Ammonia, Formaldehyde, and Hydrocyanic Acid.\n\n\n\nThe maximum inventory of Formaldehyde (44.5 % solution) at our facility is 408,276 lb. while Ammonia (anhydrous), and Hydrocyanic Acid,  are present at our facility in quantities of 284,438 lb., and 262,219 lb., respectively.\n\n\n\n3.    The Worst Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenarios, including administrative controls and mitigation measures\n\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equations.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\n\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from Hydrocyanic Acid Storage "

The released quantity is 100 % of the maximum capacity of the source.  At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 17 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.011 mg/L.\n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Hydrocyanic Acid involves a release from Hydrocyanic Acid Storage System.  The scenario involves the release of 5487 lb. of Hydrocyanic Acid.  Toxic liquid is assumed to be released to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated after 10 minutes.  The release is also assumed to be controlled by an emergency shutdown system and water monitor.  These active mitigation systems have the effect of reducing the liquid release and vapor suppression.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.011 mg/L of Hydrocyanic Acid is 1.4 miles.\n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Formaldehyde (44.5 % solution) involves a release from the Formaldehyde Storage System.  The scenario involves the release of 19180 lb. of 44.5 % Formaldehyde solution.  Toxic liquid is assumed to be released to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated after 1918 minutes.  The release is also assumed to be controlled by  an emergency shutdown system and water monitor.  These active mitigation systems have the effect of reducing the liquid release and vapor suppression.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.012 mg/L of Formaldehyde (44.5 % solution) is 0.43 miles.\n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Ammonia (anhydrous) involves a release from the Anhydrous Ammonia Storage System.  The scenario involves the release of 158 lb. of Anhydrous Ammonia.  The Toxic gas is assumed to be released"

The General Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with industry accepted design practices and engineering standards.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nGEO maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.  For example, this information can be found in our Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS), process design files, equipment specification files and process safety information files.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nOur facility conducts comprehensive reviews to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The reviews are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated every 5 years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  The most recent PHA/update was performed on 1/16/2016.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, GEO maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround."

Refresher training is provided at least every three years and more frequently as needed.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nGEO carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change\n\nA written procedure is in place at GEO to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  The most recent review/revision of maintenance procedures was performed on 6/4/2007.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\n\n\nPre-startup Reviews\n\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at GEO.  The most recent review was performed on 6/20/2009.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nGEO conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.

These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nGEO truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses in particular.\n\n\n\nContractors\n\nOn occasion, our company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance, construction and various other activities. Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out.  Hampshire Chemical Corporation has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related the contractor's work and the processes.  Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\n\n\n\n\n\n5.    Five-year Accident History\n\nGEO has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases with off-site imnpact over the last 5 years.
