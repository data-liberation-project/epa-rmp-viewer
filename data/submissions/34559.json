      "SummaryText": "The Seneca Foods Corporation, Montgomery, Minnesota plant makes frozen food products.  We use anhydrous ammonia for refrigeration.  We follow the federally required process safety management program (29 CFR 1910.119) to prevent anhydrous ammonia leaks and other refrigeration system accidents.  We hire outside contractors to audit our ammonia refrigeration safety performance.  We have a trained emergency team and we coordinate our emergency plans with the Montgomery Fire Department and the Montgomery Police Department through an offsite emergency plan, onsite tours, drills, and discussions.  Alternative and worst-case release scenarios have been completed for anhydrous ammonia.  Contact us if you would like to review or discuss these scenarios.  No accidents that are reportable under the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency?s Risk Management regulation (40 CFR 68.42) have occurred in the last five years.  We are continuously reviewing and upgrading our safety, health, and environmental programs."
