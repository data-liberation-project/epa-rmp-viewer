      "SummaryText": "The Lindsay-Strathmore Irrigation District (District) owns and operates the Trauger Pumping Plant. Chlorine is utilized to disinfect water that is served to land and residences within the District. One-ton cylinders are installed on a scale and the chorine is injected through three Wallace and Tiernan V-notch chlorinators to a sump located beneath the chlorine room.\n\nThe Trauger Pumping Plant is remotely located and is situated behind a high-banked canal with the prevailing wind away from any populated areas. Only a few residences are located within the Estimated Distance to Toxic Endpoint. Although the Trauger Pumping Plant is remotely located and poses only a minimal risk to the surrounding population, administrative and engineering controls are in place to respond to a chlorine leak. These administrative and engineering controls include:\n\n1.  All employees involved in the chlorinating process will be properly trained. Training will include leak control procedures as well as emergency measures in the event of a leak.\n\n2.  All employees who perform work operations around the chlorine storage areas, including but not limited to changing chlorine containers, will be equipped with and trained to use the proper protective gear including air packs.\n\n3.  All employees who change chlorine containers will be trained in the use of A and B patch kits for leak repair.\n\n4.  Employees will be instructed that if a chlorine leak is uncontrollable, then the District Emergency Response Plan is to take effect.\n\n5.  All chlorinating rooms, where practical, will be equipped with a chlorine leak detector that alarms when chlorine is detected.\n\nThe District's Emergency Response Plan directs the Plan Coordinator to alert several agencies including local police and sheriffs offices, environmental health offices, hospitals and the Visalia Fire Department, the designated HAZMET team for Tulare and Kings counties.\n\nThe Trauger Pumping Plant is occupied 24-hours per day.
