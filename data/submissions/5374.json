The Emergency Response Program \nincorporates an emergency response plan, emergency response \nequipment procedures, training in relevant procedures for \nemployees involved in the chlorination process, and \nprocedures to review and update, as appropriate, the \nemergency response plan to reflect changes and ensure that \nemployees are informed of changes.\n\n2 STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE HANDLED\n\nThe Lindbergh Station is located in west El Paso on Charl \nAnn Road south of Lindberg Avenue. The regulated substance \nhandled at this facility is chlorine. The enclosed"

      "SummaryText": " \nchlorination process room at this facility is located at the \nrear of the pump station. The chlorination process room \nhouses two (2) one-ton pressurized liquid chlorine \ncontainers, gas dispensers, ejectors, residual analyzers, \nand a chlorine leak detector. The leak detection system is \ncapable of alarming when the chlorine levels reach or exceed \n3.0 parts per million(ppm). The audible and visual alarm \nsystem alerts personnel in case of a chlorine release.\n\nThe level of concern or `toxic endpoint' for chlorine is 3.0 \nppm (40 CFR 68.22).  An accidental release of a regulated \nsubstance is considered to result in no adverse impact to \npublic health at distances, from the point of release, \nextending beyond the toxic endpoint.\n\n3 WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO(S) AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE \nSCENARIO(S)\n\nThe RMP rule requires the EPWU-PSB to conduct offsite \nconsequence analyses for two chlorine release scenarios, \nidentified as `worst case release' and `alternative release' \nscenarios. The worst case release scenario is defined by the \nRMP rule as `the release of the largest quantity of a \nregulated substance from a vessel or process line failure \nthat results in the greatest distance to [the toxic] \nendpoint' (40 CFR 68.3). The alternative release scenario is \ndefined as a release more likely to occur than the worst \ncase scenario.  \n\nThe release scenarios were modeled using the air dispersion \nmodel Areal Locations of Hazardous Atmospheres (ALOHA). The \nworst case release scenario is the release of the entire \ncontents of a one-ton container under the conditions \nprescribed by the RMP rule. The distance to the toxic \nendpoint for the worst case release scenario is 2.5 miles. \nThe alternative release scenario is the release of chlorine \nfrom a pipe leak with a hole diameter of 1/8 inch. The \ndistance to the toxic endpoint for the alternative release \nscenario is 150 yards (0.09 mi.).\n\n4 GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL \nSPECIFIC PREVENTION S"

      "SummaryText": "TEPS\n\nThe EPWU-PSB accidental release prevention program is based \non the following elements:\n\n(1) Preventive maintenance program;\n(2) Use of accurate and effective operating procedures;\n(3) Performance of a hazard review of equipment and \nprocedures; and\n(4) Implementation of an auditing and inspection program.\n\nChemical-specific prevention steps include availability of \nself-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA), worn by the \noperators during connection/disconnection of chlorine \nsupply, awareness of the hazardous and toxic properties of \nchlorine, and presence of chlorine detectors.\n\n5 FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nNo accidental releases have occurred at the facility in the \npast five years (June 1994 - June 1999).\n\n6 EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe Emergency Response Program for this facility is based \nupon the EPWU-PSB's `Emergency Response Action Plan' and the \nChlorine Institute's `Emergency Response Plans for Chlorine \nFacilities.' The Emergency Response Program has been \ncoordinated with the El Paso County Local Emergency Planning \nCommittee (LEPC) and the El Paso Fire Department Hazardous \nMaterials Division. This program is in compliance with the \nRMP Emergency Response Program requirements. \n\n7 PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe EPWU-PSB plans to review and revise, as necessary, the \nchlorination process operating procedures in order to make \ncertain that the operators understand the human factors that \nmay lead to accidental releases."
