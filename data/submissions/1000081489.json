The plant provides electricity, steam and chilled water to meet current and future campus demand. The CUP contains two gas turbine generators rated at 4.75 megawatts (MW) each, two heat recovery steam generators (HRSG's) and associated duct burners, one steam turbine generator (rated at 3.75 MW), two auxiliary boilers (each rated at 90,000 lb/hr of steam), and three diesel generators (each rated at 2 MW each) for emergency electric power.\n\nIn order to meet nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions limit required by the Bay Area Air Quality Management District's (BAAQMD) Regulation 9, Rule 7, the two HRSG's and two gas turbines are equipped with a selective catalytic reduction (SCR) system.  The SCR system uses ammonia, in the presence of a catalyst, to convert NOx contained in the gas turbine exhaust into nitrogen gas and water vapor.  The ammonia gas is obtained from vaporization of a 29.5% solution of aqueous ammonia (aqua ammonia) stored in an 8,000-gallon steel underground storage tank located on UCSF property at the corner of Parnassus Avenue and Medical Center Way.  Aqua ammonia was chosen over anhydrous ammonia because it is significantly less hazardous.  The aqua ammonia system consists of unloading, storage, transfer, vaporization and injection systems. \n\nThe aqua ammonia unloading system receives and transfers the contents of the delivery tanker truck from the unloading station to the underground double wall steel storage tank within the containment structure.  This tank is anchored to a concrete slab in a pit filled with pea gravel and covered by the containment building floor slab. All lighting and equipment in the building are designed as \"explosion proof\".  Smoking and other ignition sources inside and immediately adjacent to the "

Outside the containment structure, bollards (steel cylindrical posts filled with concrete) are placed at strategic locations to prevent traffic from impacting the containment structure. \n\nDeliveries to the containment structure are prescheduled between UCSF and the supplier.  The route of the delivery truck to Parnassus Avenue has been discussed with UCSF neighbors, representatives from the San Francisco Fire Department (SFFD), Local Emergency Planning Committees (LEPC's), and San Francisco Department of Public Health Hazardous Materials Unified Program Agency (SFDPH). Prior to delivery, appropriate containment structure systems are activated such as the ventilation system. Upon arrival on UCSF property, the delivery truck is met by a UCSF plant operator at the entrance of the containment structure. The UCSF plant operators remains at the containment structure until the unloading process is completed.  When the delivery truck reaches Parnassus Avenue, it proceeds easterly, turning left on Medical Center Way and entering the west end of the containment structure.  \n\nOnce the truck is inside the containment structure, the doors are lowered, hose connections are made, and the driver and UCSF operator enter the vestibule/observation room.  From the vestibule/observation room, the driver and UCSF operator initiate the unloading process (transfer by gravity) and monitor its progress until completion. The filled storage tank contains an approximate thirty-day supply of aqua ammonia; however, regular deliveries to refill the tank are planned at 30-day intervals by a 3500-gallon tanker truck.  The 30-day supply provides for potential deferrals of deliveries during inclement weather without depleting the tank supply.  Upon unloading the full contents of the tanker truck, the hose is uncoupled.  It should be noted that the hose coupling is a dry lock coupling type similar to those used in gasoline transfer hoses.

When east end door is raised, the delivery truck drives out and proceeds easterly along Parnassus Avenue.  This delivery configuration (\"drive through\") will maintain traffic flow along Parnassus Avenue and Medical Center Way.  No backing maneuvers are required by the driver nor is the delivery truck required to drive on Medical Center Way.  \n\nThe aqua ammonia transfer system will convey aqua ammonia as needed from the storage tank to the CUP facility via a 900 foot, 3/4 inch, double-walled underground pipe.  The aqua ammonia transfer system consists of two pumps and associated piping.  The pumps are self-contained and located inside the containment structure.\n\nThe injection system located at the CUP receives, vaporizes, and regulates the rate of ammonia fed into the SCR catalyst bed to reduce NOx emissions from the plant.  Ammonia emissions from the plant are regulated by BAAQMD permit to less than 20 ppm.  \n\n      The administering agency, SFDPH, has required UCSF to prepare and submit a Risk Management Plan (RMP) in accordance with the federal, state and local laws.  The federal law is provided under the provisions of the Clean Air Act (CAA) Section 112(r); state law is specified in the California Health and Safety Code (Article 2,  Chapter 6.95, Division 20) and in the California Code of Regulations (19CCR2735-2785.1); and the local law is found in the San Francisco Municipal Health Code (Article 21, Chapter 5). \n\n      The RMP has been reviewed and evaluated by design, construction, operations, health and safety personnel, and the local SFDPH regulator(s).  The prevention program has resulted in the identification of potential problems and allowed for modifications to upgrade the facility and operations.  UCSF is committed to maintaining the highest standards in the design, construction, operation, and maintenance of the facility. \n\n"

The safe handling of ammonia is enhanced by designing the facilities to include multiple safety devices and engineering controls, implementing effective training programs for personnel, and following standard operating procedures.  Both passive and active mitigation measures have been incorporated into the facility design.  \n\n  These measures are complemented by the presence of an emergency response program.  In conjunction with local first responders and trained plant operators, UCSF maintains a Spill Response Team (SRT) that is knowledgeable and trained to handle hazardous material spills such as aqua ammonia.  This RMP identifies system/process controls UCSF has identified and implemented to ensure the safe and efficient operation of the facility. \n\n(b)   Stationary source and regulated substances - The stationary source consists of an aqua ammonia unloading facility and underground storage tank located on the corner of Parnassus Avenue and Medical Center Way on the Parnassus Heights campus.  Transfer pumps and piping deliver the aqua ammonia to the selective catalytic reduction unit located on the first floor of the Central Utilities Plant. The regulated substance is 29.5% aqua ammonia, an ammonia solution consisting of just over 70% water.  The regulated substance has a maximum inventory of 7,283 (90% of 8,000 tank + volume of piping) gallons at any given time.  The maximum delivery quantity is approximately 3,500 gallons (the entire contents of one tanker truck).  \n\n(c)   General accidental release prevention program and chemical specific prevention steps - The general accidental release prevention and chemical-specific prevention steps are based on passive and active mitigation systems.

Additionally, the spill chamber contains a floating polypropylene ball blanket to further reduce the evaporation area (by 91%). The structure itself also acts as a passive mitigation device. \n\n  Active mitigation measures include a foam spray vapor suppressant system, fog misters, fire sprinkler system, emergency response program, and process controls.  In addition, the interior air is exhausted to the outside atmosphere through a gaseous ammonia scrubber (impregnated activated charcoal) system.\n\n  An ammonia leak detection system is provided to monitor the ambient air concentrations near the aqua ammonia storage tank, both inside and outside the facility structure.  Specifically, ammonia detectors are located inside the containment structure, inside the catch basin, outside the structure at the vent exhausts and other selected ambient air locations, and in the interstitial annular space of the double walled storage tank and piping. Monitored ammonia concentrations >20 ppm inside the ammonia facility and >10 ppm outside the facility are alarmed both in the local control room and main CUP control room. \n\n  The CUP control room is staffed 24 hours a day.  A visual inspection of the exterior components of the aqua ammonia system is performed daily by plant operation personnel.  Preventative maintenance procedures are followed and documented.  Low and high-pressure alarms are provided to monitor the underground storage tank, transfer system, and the ammonia injection unit.  If a leak is detected in the aqua ammonia system, the extent of the leak will be identified and an inspection of all related equipment conducted to determine cause of the failure.
