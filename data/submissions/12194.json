      "SummaryText": "Introduction\n\nWestern Lake Superior Sanitary District's  (WLSSD)  primary function is to treat municpal and industrial wastewater.  The plan provides advanced secondary treatment to domestic and industrial wastewater from ten municipalities and three major wood product industries.  WLSSD treats an average daily flow of wastewater of approximately 43 million gallons per day.  Chlorine is used to disinfect treated wasewater effluent prior to its discharge to the St. Louis River.  Chlorine is only used when the fecal coliform count at a nearby boat dock exceeds standards for safe swimming.  The use of chlorine is mandated by the facility's discharge permit.\n\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) regulations 40 CFR Part 68, require facilities that have a regulated substance above the listed threshold quantities to develop a formal Risk Management Program.  EPA also requires these facilities to register and submit a Risk Management Plan using RMP*Submit  by June 21, 1999.  WLSSD maintains quantities of chlorine above the RMP threshold quantity of 2,500 pounds and as such is subject to the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68.  A hazard review was completed to determine the program level applicable to WLSSD's chlorine system.   Based on the worst-case release as defined by EPA the facility is subject to RMP Program 3 requirements.  \n\nThe elements of the RMP are listed below:\n\nX Hazard Assessment - Assess the potential impacts of worst-case and alternative release scenarios and compile a 5-year accident history.\n\nX Prevention Program - Implement a comprehensive management program that affects a wide variety of operation, training, and maintenance activities.\n\nX Emergency Response - Implement an emergency action program for the covered processes.\n\nX Risk Management Plan - Register and submit an RMP plan that includes an executive summary, RMP data elements, results of the hazard assessment, and summarizes how all other requirements are met.

The format of the section corresponds to the executive summary data elements as dictated in 40 CFR Part 68 Executive Summary Section.  \n\nExecutive Summary Data Elements\n\n\nAccording to EPA guidance the executive summary must include a brief descripton of the facilty's Risk Management Program.  The following sections list each of the required executive summary data elements by rule citation.  \n\n68.155(a) Accidental Release and Emergency Response Policies\nWestern Lake Superior Sanitary District has operated their chlorination system without incident since its construction in 1978. This successful operating record is due to WLSSD's commitment to training programs, operating procedures, and maintenance activities.  \n\nIn recognition of the potential hazards associated with chlorine, WLSSD successfully negotiated with the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) a reduction in chlorine usage as mandated in the facility's National Pollution Discharge Elimination Permit (NPDES).  This decision by MPCA reduced the amount of chlorine handled by the facility which in turn reduced the overall accident release risk at the facility.  WLSSD is continuing to work with the MPCA to convince them that chlorination can be eliminated entirely without compromising the quality of the wastewater effluent.  \n\n68.155(b) Stationary Source and the Substance Handled\nWestern Lake Superior Sanitary District operates a 43-MGD municipal wastewater treatment plant on the shores of the St. Louis Bay.  Discharge from the treatment plant enters St. Louis Bay which feeds Lake Superior.  The facility's National Pollution Discharge Effluent Standards (NPDES) permit mandates the use of chlorine when fecal coliform levels are elevated in the St. Louis Bay.  WLSSD routinely tests for fecal coliform in the summer months and chlorinates as neede"

      "SummaryText": "d.  The purpose of the chlorination is to disinfect the wastewater by reducing the amount of fecal coliform in the discharge.  Chlorine usage by the facility is seasonal.\n\nChlorine for the chlorination process is stored in two 55-ton rail cars.  Usually one car is in service delivering chlorine and the other siding is empty or contains a full, unopened car.  The chlorine storage building is secured to prevent unauthorized personnel from accessing the area.  The railcar area is also monitored from the main control room using a camera monitoring system.  In addition to video monitoring, WLSSD maintains chlorine leak detection devices.\n\n68.155(c) Offsite Consequence Analysis\nOne worst-case release scenario and one alternative release scenario was assessed for the chlorine process.  To ensure a common basis for comparisons EPA defined the worst-case scenario as the release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a single vessel or process line that results in the greatest distance to an endpoint.  The alternative release rate is a release that is considered more reasonable or \"more likely.\"  Active mitigation measures can be used in determining the alternative release scenario while the worst-case scenario only allows consideration of passive mitigation measures.\n \nThe toxic endpoint for chlorine has been defined by EPA to be 0.0087 mg/L (3 ppm).  This airborne concentration that is used as the toxic endpoint is the maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals can be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects. \n\nThe distance to the toxic endpoint becomes a radius for a circle around the covered process.  Residential population within the circle is required to be determined based on available census information.  The population number is reported as part of the EPA submittal.

Since wind direction cannot be anticipated for an accidental release, EPA mandated the circle estimation method.\n\nRelease scenarios and distances to toxic endpoints are discussed in more detail in the subsequent paragraphs.\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario\nWorst-Case Release Scenario is determined in accordance with the requirements provided in 40 CFR 88.22 and 40 CFR 68.25(b,c). \n\nAs described in USEPA 40 CFR Part 68.25(b) the worst-case release shall be the greater of the following:\n\n1. The greatest amount held in a single vessel or\n2. The greatest amount in a pipe.  \n\nFor the chlorine process at WLSSD the worst-case release is that a 55-ton rail car (maximum amount held in a single vessel) of chlorine ruptures and its contents escape to the atmosphere in 10 minutes.  In the event the rail car would release its entire contents to the atmosphere in 10 minutes the release rate would be 11,000 pounds per minute.  The distance to the toxic end point worst-case release distance was taken from Exhibit 4-4 of EPA's Risk Management Program Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants.  \n\nThe residential population within the 10.32 mile radius of influence was determined to be approximately 128,293.  The population was calculated by summing available 1990 population information for cities in the 10.32 mile radius impact zone.  \n\nAlternative Release Scenario\nOne alternative release scenario was evaluated for the chlorine process per USEPA 40 CFR 68.165(a)(2).  The alternative release scenario considered is in accordance with the guidelines provided in 40 CFR 68.22 and 68.28.\n\nThe scenario for the alternative release follows:\n\nConsideration was given to alternative release scenarios that were considered \"more likely\" however, due to the safety systems inplace none of the alternatives considered resulted in an offsite impact.

      "SummaryText": "release scenario that results in an offsite impact.  To achieve this end an unlikely scenario of a vapor release from the chlorine vessel was chosen for the alternative release scenario.  In the vapor release scenario the pressure relief valve on the rail car is assumed to fail releasing chlorine gas to the storage shed. Once the concentration of chlorine in the rail car area reaches 4 ppm the chlorine alarm will sound and WLSSD initiates their response procedures.\n\nEach rail car is equipped with a pressure relief valve.  In our scenario the relief valve is assumed to fail open due to a malfunction of the spring component.  Vulcan Chemical, the supplier of the chlorine rail cars, provided the release valve-opening diameter of 1 1/8 inches.\n\nThe alternative release scenario release rate and distance to the toxic endpoint was taken from Exhibit 4-15 of The EPA's Risk Management Program Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants.  The release rate and distance to toxic endpoint for a 1 1/8-inch hole was interpolated from the information provided in the table exhibit.  The information is presented below.\n\nHole Diameter - 1 1/8 inch\nRelease rate - 206 lbs/min\nDistance to toxic end point (urban area) - 0.23 miles\n\nWLSSD is located in an industrialized area.  No residences are located within a quarter mile of the chlorine facility.  Therefore, the residential population within the alternative release scenario impact area is zero.\n\n68.155(d) Accidental Release Prevention Program\nThe Prevention Program required for compliance with 40 CFR Part 68 for Program 3 processes is identical to the prevention program required under OSHA PSM.  WLSSD aligned its prevention program with OSHA in 1995.  WLSSD continuously evaluates and updates their safety and prevention procedures as needed.  WLSSD revalidated their process hazard analysis for the chlorine system as part of reviewing their existing prevention program during the development of the Risk Management Plan.\n\n68.155(e) Five-year A"

No accidents, as described under 40 CFR 68.42(a), have occurred at this facility since it began operation.\n\n68.155(f) Emergency Response Program\nThe emergency response program established by WLSSD does not require personnel to act as the site incident commander.  In the case of an incident the City of Duluth Fire Department becomes the  commander and assumes the role of directing response activities including any community emergency evacuation measures.  Fire department staff train at the WLSSD facility on an annual basis.  The facility's Emergency Response Planning and Response procedures are presented in the section entitled Emergency Planning and Response.  \n\n68.155(g) Safety Improvements\nThe facility is currently in the process of evaluating the recommendations from the PHA revalidation completed in February of 1999.  Any improvements made in response to the recommendations will be documented and added to the PSM/RMP documentation.\n\nConclusion\n\nAs part of WLSSD's commitment to safety and respect for the hazards associated with handling and storing chlorine, WLSSD had an existing chlorine management system in place prior to the EPA RMP mandate.  To comply with RMP, WLSSD re-evaluated their current system for handling chlorine and updated and modified elements as necessary.  The RMP*Submit satisfies WLSSD's requirement to register and provide the EPA a summary of their Risk Management Program for the chlorine system."
