The facility has written and maintains an Emergency Response Program which provides for detailed:\n\nProcedures for informing the public and emergency response agencies about accidental releases.\n\nDocumentation of proper first aid and emergency medical treatment to treat accidental human exposures.\n\nProcedures and measure for emergency response after an accidental release of regulated substance.\n\nProcedures for using, testing, and maintaining emergency response equipment.\n\nTraining to employees on relevant procedures.\n\nProcedures to review and update the Emergency Response plan. \n\nThe Program is coordinated with the local Fond du Lac Fire Department (FDLFD) and the facility emergency response contractor, Kuhlman.\n\nThrough the ongoing implementation of the PSM/RMP program, Milk Specialties Global continuously looks for safety improvements to the facility.

An ammonia refrigeration system is used to provide cooling of tanks and chillers.\n\nMilk Specialties Global is committed to the health and safety of its employees and the community, and to the protection of the environment.  Therefore, Milk Specialties Global - Fond du Lac is complying with EPA's Risk Management Plan (RMP) regulations, Title 40 CFR Part 68, in conjunction with OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard, Title 29 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 1910.119, which deals with the risks of storing, handling, and processing hazardous chemicals.  Milk Specialties Global - Fond du Lac has completed the RMP and PSM program requirements to educate and protect its employees, the public, and the environment with respect to the anhydrous ammonia located at the facility.\n\nManagement System\nMilk Specialties Global - Fond du Lac has developed a Management System in accordance with 40 CFR 68.15 to oversee the implementation of the RMP elements.  The Management System identifies the title of the individual with the overall responsibility for the development, implementation, and integration of the RMP elements.  The Management System is documented to ensure effective communications through MSG, clarify the roles and responsibilities of MSG personnel, and to ensure that the RMP program elements are integrated into an ongoing approach to identify hazards and manage risks. \n\nOff-site Consequence Analyses\nAs part of the RMP, worst-case and alternate case release scenarios have been evaluated.  The worst-case scenario is a release from the largest receiver, which was determined to be the suction accumulator. In accordance with the RMP, the suction accumulator was assumed to be released within a 10-minute period.  \n\nThe following assumptions were used for the worst-case scenario:\n\n\tWind speed of 1.5 meters/second;\n\tF stability class; and\n\tToxic endpoint of 200 ppm (0.14 m"
