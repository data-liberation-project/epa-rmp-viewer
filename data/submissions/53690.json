Many of the reports and information have only recently been developed.  Given that Show Me Ethanol, LLC is a new facility, there has been constant review and revisions to reports and information prior to the start up of the facility.  On the same note, there has never been a change in management.  The management is \"new\" and therefore, the \"new\" management was implemented with the construction of the facility. \n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Response Policies:\n\nShow Me Ethanol, LLC has a commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated in the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel as well as considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility.\n\nShow Me Ethanol, LLC 's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.
