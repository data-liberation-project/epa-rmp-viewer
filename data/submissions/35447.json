Written safe operating procedures, including emergency guidelines, that are reviewed annually;\n!    Regular preventive maintenance of critical equipment to prevent mechanical breakdowns;\n!    A tank integrity program that ensures safe storage of materials;\n!    Processes that are manned and monitored 24 hours a day;\n!    Safety systems that include emergency relief systems, remotely-activated isolation valves, and interlocking systems to shut down a process;\n!    Scheduled safety audits;\n!    Regular process hazard analysis to identify and correct potential safety concerns;\n!    Detailed safety reviews completed prior to startup following any changes made to our equipment or processes; and\n!    Thorough and regular safety and operational training for employees who work with processes that involve potentially hazardous materials.\n\nIn addition to the above, the chlorine dioxide process has these safety systems in place:\n\n!
