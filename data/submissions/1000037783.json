Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n \n\nWe at HollyFrontier Navajo Refining Company in Lovington (Navajo's Lovington Refinery), NM are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety. This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n \n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\n \n\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Petroleum refining. All products are distilled from the crude oil feed, stabilized, then transported offsite via pipeline to the HollyFrontier Navajo Refinery site in Artesia, NM.  There are 2  RMP-regulated flammable mixtures present at our facility. These flammable mixtures may contain methane, ethane, butane, isobutane, isopentane, pentane and propane. The two flammable mixtures are both derived from the light ends of the crude distillation process.  The RMP-regulated flammable mixtures were identified by conducting a review of the estimated composition of each major vessel within each process unit.  The composite of RMP-regulated flammable mixtures within a given process unit were reported as a single flammable mixture within the RMPlan.  RMP-regulated flammable mixtures are present in both the crude and vacuum units at the facility, comprising the two flammable mixtures reported in the RMPlan.  \n\n \n\n3. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps \n\n \n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA. The refinery has an active program in place to maintain compliance with the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) progr"

The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\n \n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nNavajo's Lovington Refinery maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all Lovington refinery processes.\n\n \n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently. The methodology used to carry out these analyses is What If or HAZOP. The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of every five years.
