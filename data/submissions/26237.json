A primary aspect of this commitment is the Union County Water Treatment Facility system to help ensure the safe operation of the water chlorination process.  Our commitment is also demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our process, as well as, extensive training of our operating personnel. \n\nIn the event of an accidental release, the Union County Water Treatment Facility has procedures that are designed to control and contain the release in a manner that will be safe for our employees and will help prevent injury to the public and the environment.  The Union County Water Treatment Facility's emergency response personnel receive thorough training in handling accidental releases.  An emergency response coordinator has been assigned to oversee response activities and to coordinate response efforts with local emergency agencies.  Communications with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) have been ongoing throughout the preparation of this plan and policies.\n\nIn order to effectively implement these policies, the Union County Water Treatment Facility established a management system headed by the EH & S Training Coordinator to ensure the proper implementation and effectiveness of our Risk Management Program.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.0  Union County Water Treatment Facility and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nUnion County Water Treatment Facility is located in Calion, Arkansas, a community of approximately 300 residents.  The facility is capable of treating 28 million gallons of water per day.  The primary use of the treated water is for industrial processes.  The Union County Water Treatment Facility handles one substance regulated by the OSHA Process Safety Mana"

The regulated substance was evaluated for a possible worse-case release scenario and alternative release scenario.  It is important to understand that the Union County Water Treatment Facility has invested extensive resources to prevent releases, and the potential for a worse-case release is extremely small.  The alternative release scenario represents a more realistic potential for occurrence and is based on historical data from our process or other similar processes.  By identifying these potential releases, the Union County Water Treatment Facility has developed an extensive program to prevent such an occurrence.  This program is discussed in detail in the Prevention Program section of this plan.\n\nThe primary objective of performing the offsite consequence analysis is to determine the distance at which certain effects might occur to the public and/or the environment as a result of an accidental release.  This point is called the endpoint distance.  At distances less than the endpoint distance, the effects would be greater; at distances farther than the endpoint, the effects would be less.\n\n\n\n3.1  Hazard Assessment - Toxic Substances\n\n\n\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with Regulated Toxic Substances is a failure of a full, one ton (2000 lb) cylinder of liquid chlorine.  A toxic cloud formed by the evaporating chlorine would reach offsite endpoints and public receptors.\n\nAn alternative release scenario (ARS) for chlorine releases is a release from a damaged chlorinator.  The modeled release lasted for 60 minutes "

The requirements of the OSHA Process Safety Management standard are nearly identical to the RMP Rule Program 3 Prevention Program requirements.  The Chlorination Process Prevention Program consists of the following elements.\n\n\n\n4.1  Process Safety Information\n\n\n\nThe Union County Water Treatment Facility maintains a variety of technical documents that help ensure the safe operation of our processes.

The EHS & T Coordinator is responsible for maintaining and updating this information, as needed.\n\nChemical specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).  This information is supplemented by other technical information specific for these chemicals.  Continuous attention is given to revisions and updates on the hazards of chlorine and other chemicals used in our process.

Within this program, the Chlorination Process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nTo perform the PHAs, Union County Water Treatment Facility primarily uses the \"What-if/Checklist\" technique.  The PHAs are conducted using a team of people with experience in engineering and Chlorination Process operation and a leader with experience in process hazard analysis techniques. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and/or mitigation measures, when appropriate.  The team then prepares a written report describing the results"
