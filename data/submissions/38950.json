This plant is one of two water plants operated by the City.  The Oviedo water plant and the A. M. Jones water plant have quantities of regulated hazardous chemicals above the EPA threshold.  The City has a unified Risk Management Program which applies to each plant.  Only the Oviedo Water Treatment Plant operations and policies are presented in this Plan.\n1.1.\tACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION/EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES     (A)\nThe City of Oviedo Water Treatment Plant accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures and management practices.  The plant prevention program complies with all applicable procedures of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) 40 CFR-68 Prevention Program under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.\n1.2.\tMANAGEMENT SYSTEMS (A) (1)\nThe City of Oviedo has a management system in place which is lead by the City\u00bfs Manager, who oversees the implementation and on-going use of the RMP elements.  This program, along with other City-wide and plant-specific policies, eliminates and /or reduces the likelihood of a hazardous chemical release at the plant.  An organizational chart defining the lines of authority and responsible staff is included in the plants RMP Process Safety Information.\n1.3.\tPREVENTION PROGRAM LEVEL 3 (A) (2)\nThe City of Oviedo maintains policies, procedures and systems as part of their prevention program.  These are applied to each treatment plant and specifically the Water Treatment Plant.  The program addresses each of the EPA Program Level 3-listed 12 elements, plus RMP elements nee"

Chlorine is used as part of the treatment process.\n1.5.\tSITE DESCRIPTION (B) (1)\t\nThe site is owned and operated by The City of Oviedo and managed by its Utilities Department.  The site is located at 707 South Central Ave, Oviedo, Seminole County, Florida.   The site is located in an area, boarded by South Central Ave. on the east, housing on the west, Sandalwood Ct on the north and a public park on the south.\nThe Plant includes a separate chlorine storage area and adjacent control room plus injection feed distribution system that is contained in a separate process room as well as at various injector points\u00bf cabinets.\nThe boundaries of the chlorine system subject to the RMP regulation include the Bulk Chlorine Storage Room, Feed Control room, associated vent makeup, exhaust systems and chlorine injection cabinets at various injection points.  These are detailed in the Process and Instrument Drawings (P&ID) which are part of the plant Process Safety Information (PSI).  All drawings are maintained in the plants RMP Process Safety Information.\n1.5.1.\tREGULATED SUBSTANCE (b) (2)\nChlorine is the only regulated substance on site which exceeds the EPA 40 CFR-68 rule threshold quantity of 2500 pounds.  The City of Oviedo chlorine process was installed as part of the process of purifying water for public consumption.  It operates under permit from the State of Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FL DEP).

It has a 1 ppm OSHA ceiling Permissible Exposure Limit (PEL) and a NFPA health rating of 4, severe; with immediate and delayed health hazards.  Chlorine is not a carcinogen.\nThe maximum threshold quantity stored on site is 15 each one ton containers.  This equals 30,000 pounds.\n2.\tHAZARD ASSESSMENT\nA hazard assessment was performed to determine the effects a release would have on the public. For chlorine, the distance a set endpoint concentration of the gas would travel must be determined.  In addition, an estimate of the population that could be affected by a release of chlorine was determined, and sensitive receptors such as hospitals, schools, and nursing homes were identified. The hazard assessment considers two release scenarios-a \"worst case\" and an \"alternative case\" and also compiles the five-year accident history for the WTP chlorine system (see section 4 below: five year accident history).\nTwo offsite consequence analyses were conducted which include two chlorine release scenarios.  The first is a \u00bfworst case release\u00bf.  The second is a more probable \u00bfalternative release scenario\u00bf.  The first scenario is defined by EPA, which states that \u00bfthe operator shall assume that the maximum quantity in the largest vessel is released as a gas over 10 minutes\u00bf due to an unspecified failure.  The alternative scenario is defined as \u00bfmore likely to occur than the worst-case scenario\u00bf.\nAtmospheric dispersion modeling was performed to determine the distance traveled by the chlorine released before its concentration decreases to the \u00bftoxic endpoint.\u00bf  The EPA specified endpoint for chlorine is 0.0087 mg/l which equals 3 ppm. The 3 ppm endpoint is the Emergency Response Planning Guideline Level 2 (ERPG-2).  This is defined by the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) as the \u00bfmaximum airborne concentrat"

Both are coordinated with the Seminole County Fire/Rescue Department (including the Haz Mat Team) and the Regional LEPC.\n3.1.\tGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM   (D) (1)\nPlant-wide, many elements of the prevention program are used for all operations.  An overview of the generally written programs is listed below:\nThe City of Oviedo has detailed process safety information on each of its operations. \nThe document maintenance system is integral to the management of change for all operations on site control.  \nTraining is the backbone of employee knowledge, job operations and is ongoing in each area.  Employee training in operations and maintenance emphasizes awareness of the hazardous and toxic properties of all chemicals used. \nMaintenance and preventive maintenance are used for all operations making mechanical integrity a part of each piece of equipment. \nIncident investigations of accidents and near-miss incidents ensure we learn from each event as well as correct the causes of the incident. \nEmployees participate in all aspects of the plant as listed below under emergency response. \nSafe work practices are used throughout the facility including:  1) Hot Work Permits, 2) Lock Out Tag Out Permits, 3) Vessel Entry Permits, 4) Site Security, and 5) Breaking Into Chemical Lines. \nContractors must meet The City of O"

The plant and support equipment of the chlorine storage building and adjacent control room meet and exceed design codes standards and good engineering practices.  The storage area and control building room is equipped with natural and forced ventilation system respectively.  There is a chlorine area monitor inside the storage building and three remote monitors around the perimeter of the chlorine feed area.  If chlorine is detected, the monitor alarms.  The control room also has a chlorine monitor.  Both monitors alarm in their local area as well as in the water plant control room. The alarm system is tied into the security system which alerts management. \n3.2.4.\tEquipment Design\nThere are two types of chlorine pipe systems, high pressure and low (vacuum) pressure.

There is an automatic switch over a vacuum pressure regulator. One bank is in service and the other is on standby. \nThe low pressure system operates under a vacuum pressure of 13 inches of mercury.  There is a pressure relief valve which vents if the pressure in the line reaches above atmospheric pressure.  All the pipe, tubes, and equipment are also chlorine compatible.  The system is designed to 150 psig or complete vacuum giving it a large safety factor over the typical vacuum or positive pressure in it.  There are two chlorine monitors who detects the presence of chlorine in the ton storage area and a third monitor in the chlorine control room. \n4.\tFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY (E)\nThe plant has been chlorine reportable and release free since 1992 to the present, 14 year.\n5.\tEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM (F)\nEmergency response procedures are contained both the Plant Emergency Response Policy and is coordinated with the Seminole County Contingency Plan (Emergency Response Plan).

The plan includes training of all chlorine-area operators. The primary response team includes the Seminole County Fire and Rescue, and county Haz Mat Teams.  All of these respond to severe chlorine leak situations.  Actions include catastrophic, severe, and moderate leaks.  A Chlorine \u00bfB\u00bf Leak Repair Kit is maintained at the chlorine storage area to aid in stopping leaks.  Public notification is facilitated through the City Police and County Sheriff\u00bfs Office, which has an automated emergency dialing message system for public notification.\n6.\tPERSONNEL (F) (1)\nPersonnel are the key resource of the City of Oviedo\u00bfs prevention program.
