The propylene oxide is stored in a pressure tank built to ASME code specifications. The tank is filled periodically by tank truck delivery .The delivery hose is equipped with zero emission coupling. The tank is equipped with a pressure relief valve and enclosed in a concrete, roofed enclosure. The roof reduces the likelihood of lightning strikes (metal roof and building structure) and solar radiation heating. The propylene oxide is piped to a reaction chamber where guar gum and propylene oxide are reacted, totally eliminating all propylene oxide.\n\n\n\nRigid accidental release prevention is practiced by providing steel piping from the tank to the reactor. The reactor controls do not permit releasing propylene oxide if the reaction chamber is open to the atmosphere. All operating personnel are trained in the dangers of propylene oxide and measures to be taken in the event of a release.\n\n\n\nThe management of Economy Mud Products is committed to safety and environmentally aware operations of the plant. See attached Environment and Safety Policy. Even though the operation employs only 32 people including office staff, a safety representative is assigned to the plant. \n\n\n\nThe worst case scenario is based on releasing the entire content') of the tank, 24,000 pounds, into the building. Written instructions limit the tank to 85% capacity. Based on the Offsite Compliance Analysis Guidance Calculation Method, the endpoint radius is 0.06 mile. Economy Mud Products Co. owns the land within the endpoint circle. Based on direct field observations, no residences, businesses, churches, schools or parks are within the endpoint circle. In addition to the Risk Management Plan, the plant operates under a Process Safety Program (OSHA). No releases have occurred at the facility within the past 5 years."

In the event of an emergency, our employees are instructed to call the Fire Department and not attempt response on there own. Economy Mud Products Co. has an ongoing safety program. All supervisors are trained in the operation, maintenance and safety of reaction chamber and raw products storage facilities.\n\n"
