Well sites will include three phase separators with metering of the produced gas, condensate, and water. The produced fluid from each well site after metering will be comingled and sent to the gas processing plant via the gathering system. The gas processing plant is designed to separate gas, condensate, and water. The separated gas will be treated to sales gas specifications and sent to the eight (8) inch sales gas pipeline. The produced condensate will be stabilized and sold via trucks. The produced water will be disposed and transported to an offsite location via trucks. During the process, light condensate will also be produced as a co-product, which will be stored and pumped out in trucks for sale."
