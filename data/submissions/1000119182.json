This commitment is inherent to our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with our regulated process. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible accidental releasees of regulated substances. However, if such an accidental release does occur, we are coordinated with the Memphis Fire Department and Shelby County Local Emergency Planning Committee for emergency response support. \n\n-The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nPresently Anhydrous Ammonia is the only RMP regulated substance present at this facility above a threshold quantity. Ammonia is utilized as the primary cooling media in our closed-loop refrigeration system. The system\u0092s purpose is to provide refrigeration and cold storage capabilities for Riviana Foods-IQF operations. Due to the size and characteristics of our ammonia refrigeration systems, as well as Process Safety Management (PSM) applicability, Riviana Foods-IQF is covered under Program 3 of the RMP regulations. \n\n-Offsite Consequence Analysis\n\nThe Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for reach reported scenario have been completed as stated in Sections 2 and 3 of the RMP*eSubmit document.\n\nTo evaluate both the worst case, and alternative release off site consequence analysis, EPA\u0092s RMP Comp Hazard Release software was utilized exclusively. As specified in the RMP Guidance, the worst case and alternate case scenarios have been calculated and the results of the calculations are documented in the Riviana Foods-IQF RMP Plan on file at the facility.

To meet these necessary requirements Riviana Foods-IQF has implemented their Process Safety Management program through the written guidelines stated in the OSHA PSM Standard, 29 CFR 1910.119.\n\n-Accident History\n\nNo ammonia-related accidents have occurred at the facility over the past five years that resulted in significant onsite or offsite consequences. \n\n-Emergency Action Plan\n\nRiviana Foods-IQF, current Emergency Action Plan focuses on evacuation and response of the facility in the event of an ammonia emergency, with the assistance from local emergency response agencies performing recuse, firefighting, fires-aid, medical treatment, and other response functions. The facility maintains a written Emergency Action Plan to document specific procedures to be implemented in the event of various emergencies, including ammonia release. The plan includes procedures for facility evacuation and response as well as for notification to the local emergency response agencies, which are response for notifying the public. The plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within the facility that would require modified procedures. \n\n-Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nRiviana Foods-IQF currently has no changes planned for the ammonia refrigeration processes at this time. However, the processes will be subjected to periodic process hazard analysis reviews for the purpose of identifying potential hazards and implement the necessary improvement to provide a safer system. Riviana Foods-IQF personnel will also periodically review all potential opportunities to improve the safety of our personnel, the surrounding comm"
