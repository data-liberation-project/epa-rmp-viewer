If an emergency were to occur, the Fulton County Emergency Services and Canton Fire Department will be notified and requested to respond.  AmerenEnergy Resources Generating Duck Creek Station minimizes, where possible, the storage and use of highly hazardous chemicals in our facility.  When highly hazardous chemicals are required for our processes, facility management is expected to ensure the safety of AmerenEnergy Resources Generating Duck Creek  Station associates and protection of the environment.\n\n\nFACILITY AND PROCESS DESCRIPTION\n\nAmerenEnergy Resources Generating Duck Creek  Station operates a 400 MW coal-fired electric generating facility located approximately five miles southeast of Canton in Fulton County.  The facility has installed a Selective Catalytic Reduction CR) system on the coal-fired boiler to reduce the nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions to achieve compliance with federal limits.  Anhydrous ammonia will be used in the SCR process and will be stored in two 30,000 gallon (142,000 pound - 85% capacity) above ground storage tanks.\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe facility maintains compliance with OSHA Standard 1910.119, Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals.  Also, AmerenEnergy Resources Generating Duck Creek  Station has received assistance from the supplier regarding proper practices for the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia and employee training.  \n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nSince the system is new, there have been no reportable releases or accidents.\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nIn the event of an emergency, personnel are expected to meet at a designated area for accountability and to then evacuate the facility.  The Plant Manager, team leader, or control room operator will contact the Fulton County Emergency Services at (309) 647-7701 and th"
