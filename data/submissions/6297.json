(AE Dairy) submits this Risk Management Plan (RMP) for operations at their Des Moines, Iowa facility.  The operations at AE Dairy include the processing of fluid milk and dairy products for public consumption, packaged under the familiar Anderson Erickson Dairy brand name.  AE Dairy has been in operation at this facility for over 60 years providing quality products and over 330 jobs to the local community.\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy\n\nAE Dairy is committed to protecting the health of its employees, the surrounding community, and the environment.  It is AE Dairy's policy to maintain a safe and healthy workplace, protect the environment, and comply with all applicable regulations, including 40 CFR 68 and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation, 29 CFR 1910.119.  \n\n\nStationary Sources and Regulated Substances\n\nTo ensure the quality of AE Dairy's final products, refrigeration is necessary to maintain the low temperatures required for the food processing and storage areas of the plant.  These requirements are promulgated and monitored by the United States Food and Drug Administration, the Iowa State Department of Agriculture and the Iowa State Department of Health.  In addition, the refrigeration system is utilized to operate large coolers for product storage.  To achieve this, AE Dairy uses anhydrous ammonia, the 112(r) regulated substance, as the refrigerant in the cooling system.  The ammonia refrigeration system maintains the 120,000 sq. ft. facility within the required range of operating temperatures and provides the cooling for all stored products. Anhydrous ammonia is a standard refrigerant for the food industries and widely used thro"

      "SummaryText": "ughout the country.  The refrigeration system at AE Dairy consists of receiver vessels, compressors, evaporators, condensers, chillers and piping.  The system can contain a maximum amount of 27,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia at any time during the course of the year.\n \n\nWorst Case Release Scenario\n\nAs required by 40 CFR 68 Subpart B, AE Dairy has evaluated a worst-case release scenario for anhydrous ammonia using the parameters specified by the EPA.  The worst-case release scenario is defined as the release, over a 10-minute period, of the entire contents of the largest vessel or pipe in the facility's system.  Based on the design of AE Dairy's refrigeration system, the worst case release scenario would involve the rupture of the Controlled Pressure Receiver, which is the largest single vessel in the system.  The Controlled Pressure Receiver can contain approximately 12,168 pounds of ammonia when filled to 80% capacity, which is the maximum fill capacity allowed by AE Dairy.  The Controlled Pressure Receiver, like all other major vessels in the system, is located inside a building.  The room in which the Controlled Pressure Receiver is located has two self-closing, interior doors leading into other sections of the building and no exterior doors or windows.  While the room provides passive mitigation for a release, the room is equipped with a ventilation fan that exhausts to the outside atmosphere.  The release of the entire contents of the Controlled Pressure Receiver, through this exhaust fan, is the basis for the worst-case scenario.  Using the equations in Chapter 4 of the EPA's RMP Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration and the RMP*Comp computer program, the maximum distance to the specified \"endpoint\" was calculated.  This is a conservative distance, established by the EPA, at which it is expected that a person could be exposed to the chemical for an hour without suffering irreversible health effects.

During normal operations, AE Dairy maintains the Controlled Pressure Receiver at no more than 50% of capacity.  The receiver would only have the potential to be filled to 80% of capacity when receiving an ammonia charge or during a pump-down operation.  The Controlled Pressure Receiver has been operated in pump-down mode only two times in the last seven years.  Ammonia charging is only performed on an as needed basis, potentially occurring only a few times each year.  \n\n\nAlternative Release Scenario\n\nA more realistic release scenario (alternative release) was developed by AE Dairy taking into consideration the 60-year history of operational experience and the hazards identified in the process hazard analysis (PHA) conducted to ensure that AE Dairy hazards are identified and minimized.  The analysis was conducted in accordance with OSHA's Process Safety Management regulations contained in 29 CFR 1910.119.  The alternate release scenario identified by AE Dairy involves damaging a = inch diameter pipe, resulting in the release of liquid ammonia.  When considering the potential alternate release scenarios, piping routed to, and installed on, equipment located outside the buildings was considered first.  In developing the release parameters of this alternative scenario, AE Dairy considered piping and equipment located in areas where vehicle traffic, personnel foot traffic, and work-related activities were likely to occur.  The resulting scenario involves damage to the sight column of a tube and shell chiller located outside of the warehouse.  The chiller is located in an area traveled by personnel and vehicle traffic; making damage to the equipment by objects or vehicles a credible scenario for consideration. Other considerations include a full flow liquid release from the"

The distance to the endpoint, calculated for the alternate case release scenario, includes offsite receptors.\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nTo prevent and mitigate accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia, AE Dairy has implemented several precautionary measures including process and equipment controls, operating procedures, preventive-maintenance programs, employee training, and audit programs.  In addition, the ammonia refrigeration system itself is designed and constructed in accordance with ANSI/IIAR 2-1992 Standard for Equipment, Design, And Installation of Ammonia Mechanical Refrigerating Systems. \n\nAE Dairy has also developed and implemented a PSM program pursuant to OSHA regulations and as such, has evaluated the refrigeration system for the potential to release anhydrous ammonia.
