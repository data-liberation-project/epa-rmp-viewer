The resources invested in the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances demonstrate this commitment.  The Carroll - Boone Water District implements reasonable controls, such as training of personnel and the safe design, installation, operation and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to make every effort to prevent the release of hazardous substances but in the event of a release, our trained personnel and local emergency response agencies will respond to control and contain the release in a manner that will be safe for workers and will help prevent injuries to the public or the environment.\n2.0    Description of the Carroll - Boone Water District and Regulated Substances\nThe Carroll - Boone Water District Freeman ? Raney Water Treatment Facility is located along the eastern shore of Beaver Lake near Eureka Springs, Arkansas.  The Carroll - Boone Water District handles two substances regulated by the Risk Management Plan Rule (RMP Rule) at each of two water treatment plants located on the property. These substances are:\n? Chlorine - stored in 2000 pound cylinders and used for disinfection of the water prior to distribution.\n? Anhydrous Ammonia ? stored in 1000 gallon tanks used for stabilization of chlorine in the finished water\n\nThe chlorine is stored and used in quantities above the listed threshold of the RMP Rule and the storage vessels and associated equipment are therefore considered ?covered processes?.\n\nThe anhydrous ammonia is stored and used in quantities below the listed threshold of the RMP Rule.  However, in compliance with the General Duty Clause of the RMP Rule, the Carroll - Boone Water District has prepared and implemented a Risk Management Plan and Prevention Program for both subst"

This Hazard Assessment includes an offsite consequence analysis for the following scenarios:\n? One worst-case and one alternative release scenario for the toxic substance chlorine for the chlorination processes at each water treatment plant.\n? One worst-case and one alternative release scenario for the toxic substance anhydrous ammonia for the ammoniation processes at each water treatment plant.\nThe information obtained from this Hazard Assessment has been appropriately communicated to the local emergency response agencies.\n4.0    Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nThe RMP Rule requires that a prevention program be established for the Carroll - Boone Water District chlorination and ammoniation processes.  based on the guidelines of the RMP Rule, the processes are considered Program Level 2 and a prevention program has been developed according to the Program Level 2 requirements. The following details the prevention program elements at the Carroll - Boone Water District that apply to these processes.\n4.1    Safety Information\nThe Carroll - Boone Water District maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to help ensure safe operation of the Carroll - Boone Water District processes.  Material safety data sheets (MSDSs) document the physical and chemical properties of hazardous substances handled at the Carroll - Boone Water District, including the chlorine and anhydrous ammonia in the covered processes.  The engineering design documents include the operating parameters, the design basis and configuration of the equipment in each covered process, and references to applicable codes and standards.\n4.2    Hazard Review\nThe Carroll - Boone Water District performs and periodically updates hazard reviews of the covered processes"

These checklists include items to help ensure the Carroll - Boone Water District operates and maintains the equipment in a manner consistent with the applicable design specifications, codes, standards, and regulations.\n4.3    Operating Procedures\nThe Carroll - Boone Water District develops and maintains operating procedures to define how tasks related to process operations should be performed.  The operating procedures are used to:\n1. train employees and contractors, and\n2. serve as reference guides for appropriate actions to take during both normal and abnormal process conditions.\n4.4    Training\nThe Carroll - Boone Water District trains personnel in the operating procedures to help ensure safe and effective performance of their assigned tasks. A record of all training is maintained to help ensure new and refresher training is provided on a timely basis.\n4.5    Maintenance\nThe Carroll - Boone Water District properly maintains the equipment in our processes.  The Carroll - Boone Water District maintenance program includes:\n1. procedures to safely guide workers in their maintenance tasks,\n2. worker training in the maintenance procedures, and\n3. inspection and testing program to help identify equipment deterioration and damage before equipment fails.\n4.6    Compliance Audits\nThe Carroll - Boone Water District performs periodic (at least every three years) audits of covered processes to verify the processes are operating in compliance with the requirements of the RMP Rule.  A compliance audit report is prepared after each audit, and any deficiencies noted by the audit are corrected in a timely manner.\n4.7    Incident Investigations\nThe Carroll - Boone Water District investigates all incidents that could reasonably have resulted in a serious injury to personnel, the public, or the environment.
