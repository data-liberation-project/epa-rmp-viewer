      "SummaryText": "LCY Elastomers LP owns and operates a facility at 4803 Decker Drive, Baytown, Texas, which began operations in 1992 to manufacture synthetic rubber from a polymerization process utilizing styrene monomer and either 1,3-butadiene or isoprene in a cyclohexane solvent solution. This facility was previously owned by ENI and operated under the names, EniChem Elastomers Americas Inc., EniChem Americas Inc., and Polimeri Europa.\n\nThe RMP regulated flammable materials at this facility are 1,3-butadiene and isoprene. One toxic material, dimethyldichlorosilane is maintained at this location above the threshold limit. Two other toxic chemicals, trimethylchlorosilane methyltrichlorosilane, are also located at this facility, however they are maintained below the threshold limit. Although they are below the regulated amount, LCY Elastomers LP has elected to include them in the RMP for the purpose of letting the community know the chemicals kept at this site.\n\nThe process is a continuous batch reaction in which either a styrene and isoprene or a styrene butadiene co-block polymer is produced. After the rubber is formed, the solvent is steam stripped and the polymerized material is carried to the finishing and packaging section in a water slurry. After the rubber undergoes a drying and cooling process, it is packaged in boxes, bags, or sacks. On site storage space is adequate for inventory and shipping of all product.\n\nLCY Elastomers LP has not had an accidental release since the plant began operation in 1992.\n\nAlong with the RMP regulations, LCY Elastomers LP is also regulated BY OSHA's Process Safety Management regulations. This regulation set into place many of the requirements that the RMP rule has. LCY Elastomers LP risk management program involves the use of state of the art process control systems and equipment in the safest working condition. Personnel are also trained on emergency response procedures for handling situations that could present a hazard to equipment or perso"

This group meets monthly to allow citizens to share their concerns and hear from industry representatives what processes are in place to ensure the safety of the Baytown community.
