The facility utilizes an anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system for process cooling and product freezing.  FGF LLC, is committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas including design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance programs, and employee training associated with the regulated process at the facility.   \n\n\n2. The stationary source and regulated substances handled:  The facility is a commercial bakery that utilizes an anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system for process cooling and product freezing.  The system is a closed loop process and does not normally necessitate re-filling or unloading of ammonia. Access to the entire facility is controlled and further access to the ammonia process is limited to authorized employees and approved contractors.   Anhydrous ammonia is the only regulated RMP substance present at the facility.    \n\n\n3. General accidental release prevention program and chemical specific prevention steps:    The facility has an established accident release prevention program that complies with OSHA's PSM and EPA's RMP programs. The PSM/RMP Prevention Program consists of the following elements:\n\n - Process Safety Information\n - Process Hazard Analysis\n - Operating Procedures\n - Mechanical Integrity\n - Management of Change\n - Pre-startup Review\n - Hot Work Permits\n - Contractor Evaluations\n - Incident Investigation\n - Employee Participation\n - Training\n - Compliance Audits\n\n4. Five-year accident history:  The facility has had 1 reportable releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years on 8/11/2022. This release occurred during a routine  pressure relief valve replacement by an outside mechanical contractor. It was believed that debris on the isolation valve"

The release lasted approximately 58 minutes with a calculated release quantity of 3665lbs of ammonia liquid and vapor. 98 employees were evacuated with 6 being evaluated and released from the hospital for lung irritation.\n\n\n5. The emergency response program:    The facility has a written emergency response plan to assist facility personnel in the event of an accidental release of hazardous materials.  The emergency response program is based on both on-site and off-site emergency response.   The emergency response program includes all aspects of emergency response including on-scene first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, natural disasters, fires, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.  The LEPC and local fire department is invited to the facility annually for a review of the hazards at the facility.    \n\n\n6. Planned changes to improve safety:  The facility continuously evaluates the established procedures and equipment in order to operate the ammonia refrigeration system in a safe and responsible manner."
