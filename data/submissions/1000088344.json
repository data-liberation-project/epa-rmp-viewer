Thatcher Company will not tolerate failure to live up to the expectations outlined in their charter; as such failure could negatively impact the health and safety of our employees, our community, and the environment.  The Thatcher Charter has been reviewed and endorsed by Thatcher Company of California - Stockton, CA plant personnel and plant management demonstrates EHSS leadership and commitment.\r\n\r\nIn addition to EPA's RMP rule, the Stockton plant complies with State and Federal OSHA's Process Safety Management, EPA's State and Federal Hazardous Waste Generator, DHS Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standard and DOT's Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration regulatory requirements.\r\n\r\nIn this RMP submission, there is one Worst-case toxic release scenario and one Alternative Case toxic release scenario evaluated at the Stockton plant for each of the two toxic gases; chlorine and sulfur dioxide. Section 2 of this RMP submittal contains additional details regarding the Worst-case release scenario while Section 3 contains additional details for the Alternative Case release scenario. \r\n\r\nEPA's Cameo (Aloha, Marplot, cameo chemical) model and RMP*Comp were used to develop the worst-case and alternative scenarios for all chlorine releases and to determine the greatest distances to the chlorine toxic endpoint of 3 ppm.\r\n\r\nA Worst-case toxic release scenario consisting of a gas release from a chlorine railcar with a maximum distance to a 3 ppm end point of 25 miles.\r\n\r\nAn Alternative Case toxic release scenario to be a 1-inch chlorine schedule 80 pipe failure gas-phase release with a maximum distance to a 3 ppm end point of 0.6 mile.\r\n\r\nFor sulfur dioxide, the Worst-case toxic release scenario has been determined to be a sulfur dioxide tonner cylinder releasing 2,000 pounds with a maximum distance to a 3 ppm en"

Thatcher Company support American Chemistry Council's Responsible Distribution, an initiative that fosters involvement in the community and continuous improvement in environmental, health, security, and safety performance.  Thatcher Company is a member of the National Association of Chemical Distributors and has been certified to be in compliance with the Responsible Distribution Code. The company is also an active member of the Chlorine Institute, a trade group that develops and establishes recommended practices for the safe handling of chlorine.\r\n\r\nThe Thatcher Company of California - Stockton, CA plant is a chemical manufacturer, packager and distributor of industrial chemicals. The markets for the Stockton plant include water treatment, wastewater treatment, industrial applications, agriculture, and food processing. Chlorine is packaged and distributed for the water treatment, wastewater treatment, agriculture and industrial markets. Sulfur dioxide is distributed through the Stockton facility from our Sparks, NV packaging facility for water treatment, wastewater treatment, and industrial markets. To operate with the highest standards of safety and nvironmental compliance our commitment to EHSS must include: compliance with work instructions and procedures; clear expectations; a constant focus on prevention; active participation; awareness on and off the job; strong leadership; and personal responsibility.  Further, a commitment to EHSS must include personal accountability for their EHSS performance and for the EHSS performance of those they manage or supervise.  A commitment on the part of all employees and contractors is crucial to achieving the EHSS mission.

EPA's Cameo (Aloha, Marplot, cameo chemical) model and RMP*Comp were used to determine the greatest distances to the sulfur dioxide toxic endpoint of 3 ppm.\r\n\r\nTo ensure a common basis for comparisons, EPA defined the worst-case scenario as the release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a single vessel or process line that results in the greatest distance in any direction to an endpoint, in these cases were 0.33 mile for chlorine and 1.0 mile for sulfur dioxide. The alternative release scenario is a release that is considered more reasonable or more likely. These maximum distances are used to determine the radii for circles around the covered processes.\r\n\r\nResidential populations within these circles are required to be determined based on available census information; hence, the population number for each scenario is reported as part of this RMP submittal. These estimates were acquired from the EPA Marplot software.  Since wind direction cannot be anticipated for an accidental release, EPA mandated the circle estimation method. This method greatly over estimates the population potentially exposed to an individual release since the prominent wind direction and other factors are not taken into account. Generally, the Stockton Plant components for the accidental release prevention program includes a commitment to process safety, an understanding of hazards and risk, management of risk and learning from experience as well as compliance with regulatory requirements.  \r\n\r\nThe plant has a Process Safety Management (PSM) system for the covered processes as defined by OSHA. The chlorine and sulfur dioxide program documentation includes the following PSM elements: process safety information; process hazard analysis; operating procedures; training; mechanical integrity; management of change"

      "SummaryText": "; pre-startup safety review; compliance audits; incident investigations; employee participation; hot work permit; contractor management; and emergency planning and response. Throughout the plant, a hierarchy of controls has been implemented including hazard elimination, substitution, engineering controls, toxic gas sensors, administrative controls and personal protective equipment to minimize or eliminate exposure to hazards.\r\n\r\nInfrastructure security improvements at designated areas in the plant have been implemented that provide layers of protection against deliberate man-made incidents in accordance with applicable elements of U.S. Department of Homeland Security's CFATS Risk Based Performance Standards.\r\n\r\nIn the last five years, the Stockton plant has had one accidental release that resulted in an employee injury; a small chlorine release on April 14, 2014 that resulted in < 1 pound of chlorine gas being emitted into the atmosphere.  An upset situation caused chlorine to be present during the connection procedure and a small puff of chlorine exposed an operator, who was not wearing the proper PPE, to the gas which resulted in an injury requiring time off work.\r\n \r\nThe plant has a trained emergency response team comprised of on-site personnel that meets applicable OSHA and other regulatory requirements. In-plant emergency response team training includes classroom instruction; hands-on demonstrations. Plant emergency response team members attend the Mississippi Fire Academy's HAZMAT Response Training as part of their training program. The response team is also trained to provide support at off-site chlorine emergencies through the Chlorine Institutes CHLOREP Program which is a voluntary aid program for chlorine emergencies occurring during transportation or at user locations. Furthermore, the EHSS Manager is actively involved in emergency planning with community emergency management and response stakeholders including participation on the California Local Emerge"
