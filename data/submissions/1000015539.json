The program must consist of a hazard assessment, a release prevention program and an emergency response program. Additionally, the operator must describe the site's risk management program in a risk management plan (RMP). However, the regulation provides for three different programs of compliance dependent upon eligibility criteria of covered processes including, but not limited to, the potential impact of chemical release as identified in the hazard assessment. For example, chemical processes which meet the criteria for program level 1 and program level 2 have very minimal requirements for release prevention programs and emergency response as compared to those for program level 3.\n\nAt General Chemical - Bay Point Works, four listed chemicals are managed on site in quantities greater than the threshold quantity under the program level 3 criteria. No chemicals are managed on site under program 1 or program 2 criteria. The chemicals managed according to program level 3 include Anhydrous Ammonia, Aqueous Ammonia (>20%), Anhydrous Hydrogen Fluoride and Hydrochloric Acid(>30%). As identified in this plan, Bay Point Works is in compliance with the requirements of 40 CFR part 68 for management of Anhydrous Ammonia, Aqueous Ammonia, Anhydrous Hydrogen Fluoride and Hydrochloric Acid.\n\nThis RMP describes Bay Point Work's risk management program, which includes hazard assessment, release prevention program and emerge"

The USEPA-designated table states that the material released would travel 25 miles before it reaches a non-hazardous concentration.\n\n3.2 - The alternative case release scenario is a more credible hypothetical, site specific chemical release.

The ammonium fluoride solution is circulated through a heat exchanger/cooler in order to maintain a low reaction temperature. The top tank operates on the same principle.\n\nSection 6.0 - Process Description for Hydrofluoric Acid Manufacturing\n\nAnhydrous Hydrogen Fluoride of 99.99% purity is delivered to Bay Point Works primarily via rail car. Rail cars are pressurized with nitrogen and unloaded into a purge pot to be sampled. Following laboratory approval, the railcar is unloaded into one of two Anhydrous Hydrogen Fluoride storage tanks. The Anhydrous Hydrogen Fluoride reactor is charged by the pressurization of the storage tanks with air to deliver material into the reactor. Once in the reactor, the Anhydrous Hydrogen Fluoride is treated and steam heated. Anhydrous Hydrogen Fluoride vapors enter the absorption column and are scrubbed with deionized water, forming electronic grade hydrofluoric acid (49-70%).  Electronic grade hydrofluoric acid is then sent to the Packaging Area for packaging into totes, drums or bottles and the Batch Area for use in a wide variety of different blends of products and/or the Ammonium Fluoride process.\n\nFollowing the completion of a \"batch, an aqueous hydrofluoric acid heel remains in the reactor.

The Hydrochloric Acid is analyzed and the impurities are treated prior to use. The process takes place in one glass column and one polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) lined column to remove non volatile impurities.\n\nHydrochloric Acid is fed to the Hydrochloric Acid units via a common pump. The feed tanks are vented to a scrubber to prevent process vapors from entering the atmosphere.\n\nThe Hydrochloric Acid enters one of the two columns and flows counter current to the rising vapors. Two tantalum bayonets supply heat to the process. The vapors are condensed at the tip of the columns by two glass product condensers at 37.1 to 37.4% concentration. The uncondensed vapors also flow through a cooler before they are vented to the scrubber. Appropriate vents are installed in the system to relieve pressure build up and minimize tailings. All vents are tied into the scrubber. The water from the scrubber flows into the waste neutralization tank and is discharged in accordance with the POTW permit.
