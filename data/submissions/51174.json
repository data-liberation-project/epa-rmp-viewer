(Rinchem) is totally committed to safety and the implementation of safe procedures. Its commitment is exemplified by its overall safety policy which states:\n?No job is more important than the health and safety of our employees, our communities and the environment.?\nThis policy is supported by everyone at Rinchem, but first and foremost by senior management.\nTHE FACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE HANDLED\nRinchem?s Chaparral Chemical Warehouse at 511 Highway 213 Chaparral, NM. stores chemicals for industry. There is one substance regulated under 40 CFR part 68 ? chlorine ? that is stored above the threshold quantity at this facility. The chlorine is not involved with any processes at this location other than handling and storage of closed containers.\nRinchem is located in an isolated rural setting with very few nearby residential neighbors. The Chaparral Warehouse was built taking into consideration fire codes, building codes and industry standards for warehouses that store hazardous materials. There are many features designed into the building that help to prevent a liquid release of any of the stored substances to the environment such as secondary containment at the docks and dikes in the rooms where the materials are stored. The materials in the warehouse are segregated by hazard class according to the applicable federal and state regulations.\nWORSE-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SENARIOS\nThe modeling of the worse-case and alternative release scenarios was using EPA?s RMP* COMP? program which is a very conservative model. The worst case scenarios consist of the largest vessel in the facility containing the regulated substance releasing all of its contents. This would involve a release from one cylinder. The passive mitigation system that is in place at the facility and considered for the modeling of the scenario is that material is stored in an enclosed space in direct"

      "SummaryText": " contact with outside air. The worst case of the contents of an entire cylinder being released is very unlikely because of the daily inspections that are performed in the facility to verify that no cylinders are leaking, and the policy that any release is stopped and cleaned up immediately upon detection.\nThe alternative release scenario for the chlorine that was modeled consisted of a slow release from the valve in a multi-stage pattern due to the freezing and unfreezing process of the gas at the point of release. The chlorine cylinders are stored indoors within the warehouse which is considered an enclosed space that is in direct contact with outside air. It was conservatively estimated that the total cylinder volume of 150 pounds would be released in 30 minutes over rural surroundings.\nAccording to the method used to do the modeling of the scenarios, the estimated distance to toxic endpoint for the worse-case scenario is 1.4 miles, the distance to toxic end point for the separate alternative release of chlorine is 0.1 mile, respectively.\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\nThe three key elements of Rinchem?s release prevention program are (1) compliance with federal and state regulations, (2) use of engineering and administrative controls, and (3) dedication to training and safety.\nThe areas of compliance include:\n- having an OSHA Process Safety Management Plan for flammables and chlorine at the facility\n- having a Hazardous Materials Management Plan\n- only accepting materials that are in Department of Transportation-approved containers\n- segregating materials according to their hazard class\n- having secondary and tertiary containment inside the building and around the facility\n- limiting access to the facility\n- performance of daily inspections of the material handling equipment used in the facility\nBefore chlorine cylinders are accepted into the warehouse, the trailer they are brought in is aired out away from th"

The facility is inspected daily to ensure that all operations are running safely and smoothly and to determine if any of the containers in storage are leaking. It is Rinchem?s policy that any time a release is detected, the supervisor is notified and it is cleaned up immediately by properly trained technicians.\nTraining is an essential element of Rinchem?s prevention program since an informed and trained workforce can prevent most accidents. The training includes classroom and on-the-job training for all new employees as well as annual reviews of the operating procedures with the employees and supervisors who perform the tasks at the facility.\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThere has never been a reportable accident involving chlorine at this facility.\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\nRinchem has a comprehensive emergency response plan. The plan includes evacuation and notification procedures for the employees of Rinchem and for the public. The facility is included in the written community emergency response plan. Our employees are fully trained to respond to any release related to the materials stored on-site. Rinchem?s technicians and supervisors attend annual emergency response refreshers where tabletop drills are performed, and facility orientation classes are held where evacuation plans and procedures are reviewed. Facility-wide drills are also performed.\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nRinchem believes that no changes are necessary at this time to address improvement to safety at our facilities. Rinchem?s procedures, safety policies, facility design and many other preventative measures are adequate to keep its employees, the community and the environment safe. However, we are committed to continue working our corrective action process to monitor and improve the safety of all operations."
