DuPont de Nemours and Company\r\nRisk Management Plan\r\n\r\n\r\nIntroduction to Facility & Regulated Substance\r\n\r\nGenencor International Wisconsin, Inc. is an industrial biotechnology facility located in Beloit's Industrial Park.  This ISO-9001:2008-and ISO 14001:2004 certified-facility employs approximately 75 people and operates under a team-based organizational structure.  E.I. DuPont de Nemours assumed ownership of the Genencor International Wisconsin facility in 2011.  In late 2011, efforts were initiated to improve Safety, Health, and Environmental systems for the site, guided by DuPont Core Values and Commitment to Safety, Health, and Environment.  \r\n\r\nThe facility manufactures enzymes through a fermentation-based process. Enzymes are chemicals comprised of large proteins, and have been used in the food and detergent manufacturing industries for many years.  The site's manufactured enzymes are primarily intended for use in the grain processing industry.   The facility operates a continuous 24-hour-per-day process and has on-site Maintenance and Laboratory support.  Staff support includes site Management, Safety, Health & Environmental, Engineering, Purchasing, Finance, and Systems personnel.\r\n\r\nAnhydrous ammonia is the regulated substance under EPA Risk Management criteria and is used in the enzyme manufacturing process.  The covered process for the site's Risk Management efforts includes the anhydrous ammonia storage and distribution system.  The RMP covered process is divided into the following sections or \"nodes\" for the purpose of this program:\r\n\u00bf\tAmmonia truck unloading\r\n\u00bf\tAmmonia storage tank\r\n\u00bf\tAmmonia distribution up to Building 18 Branch\r\n\u00bf\tAmmonia distribution from the Building 18 Branch to Building 1 up to the last block valve at each fermentor\r\n\u00bf\tAmmonia distribution from the Building 1 Branch to Building 18 up to the last block valve at each fermentor\r\n\r\n\r\nChe"
