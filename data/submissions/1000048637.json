      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary, Brewster Dairy, Inc. Warehouse System\n\n\n\n    This is to inform all interested persons, including employees that Brewster Dairy, Inc. is complying with OSHA?s Process Safety Management Standard (called Process Safety Management or PSM), Title 29 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 1910.119, and EPA?s Risk Management Program regulations (called RM Program), Title 40 CFR Part 68, also Brewster Dairy, Inc. Corporate Safety Policies, to deal with the risks involved with the storage, handling, and processing of hazardous chemicals. In this way we promote overall plant, worker, and public safety. These programs enable our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents. Overall, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.\n\n    Our safety programs are applied to any activity involving hazardous chemicals including any use, storage, manufacturing, handling, or the on-site movement of such chemicals, or combination of these activities. Any group of vessels which are interconnected and separate vessels which are located such that a hazardous chemical could be involved in a potential release shall be considered a single process.\n\nOur safety programs prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices which govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment. These rules are detailed and improved as necessary. They are also communicated to and accepted by all employees at the facility.\n\n    Brewster Dairy, Inc. has two systems that are separated by state route 93. Our Westside system is used for process. We use this to cool product and dehumidify air.  The engine rooms are about the same.                                  \n\nThe Eastside (Warehouse) is used to finish the process of making cheese, mostly Swiss. We use this system to operate the "

      "SummaryText": "Evaporators (21 units). In this engine room we have Receiver, Accumulator, two transfer tanks; four screw Compressors, Three Evaporator Condensers. The system uses 18,000 lbs of NH3. \n\n\n\n                The Brewster plant has developed an OSHA PSM program for our ammonia refrigeration system. Ammonia falls under the RMP Program 3 prevention program, which is simular to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) program.    EPA has said that if the process is subject to OSHA PSM, then it is subject to RMP Program 3. Thus, the Brewster facility's ammonia PSM program also meets the requirements for the RMP document.  \n\n\n\nThere are several aspects of the prevention program that are key: \n\na.)    Since most of the pipe work is out of the way of people and the machinery, there is less of a chance of an ammonia release.\n\nb.)    The plant maintains good training, certification and employee awareness of operating procedures.\n\nc.)    The plant has developed a strong preventive maintenance and inspection program.\n\n\n\n                    This facility?s emergency response program is based on the OSHA requirements for Emergency Action Plans (29 CFR 1910.38 and 1910.119) and HAZWOPER (29 CFR 1910.120). We have trained employees for emergency response and maintain a written emergency response plan. This plan is coordinated with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and the local fire department. We conduct annual drills for implementation of the emergency response plan at the facility with the participation of the LEPC and the fire department. The facility has communication with the community to warn if there is an emergency.\n\n\n\n8.)  Safety Improvements     \n\n\n\na.)  We have expanded our hazmat team. \n\nb.)  We have at least one drill to keep our people on top of things and review our mistakes.\n\nc.)  We have performed an annual ammonia system inspection per IIAR Bulletin 109\n\nD.) We have had a compliance audit performed by an outside firm.\n\nE.) we have performed a Process hazard Analysis\n\nF.)"
