This commitment is reflected in a comprehensive accidental release prevention program. This program addresses the design, installation, operation, maintenance, and employee training associated with the process equipment at the facility. \n\n\n\nUniversal Pasteurization senior management is not only committed to offering superior service, but also to maintaining a safety and environmental program to promote a safe environment for all its employees and the surrounding communities. Universal Pasteurization's safety and environmental policies as they relate to the ammonia refrigeration system are administered by the Operations Manager, who conducts inspections of the facility to ensure compliance.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\n\nUniversal Pasteurization is located at 8 Lee Boulevard, in Malvern, Pennsylvania. The facility is located to the south of the Pennsylvania Interstate 76 and approximately 1 mile north of US Highway 202. The area immediately surrounding the facility is rural with a mixture of light commercial, industrial, and residential areas.  The facility was acquired by Universal Pasteurization in 2015, and began operations in June 2015.  \n\n\n\nThe primary business of Universal Pasteurization is to provide cooling and storage of food products. In order to conduct operations, the facility maintains a refrigeration system containing approximately 16,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, a regulated substance.  The refrigeration system, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, and then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for cold storage, dock operations, and HPP processing.  Typical operating conditions range from 180 psig on the low pressu"

Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system.  For example, the facility operates in accordance with OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation.  \n\n\n\nThe facility including the ammonia system was designed and constructed in accordance with the International Mechanical Code applicable at the time of construction, which specifically outlines requirements for the safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system.  These safety features include ammonia sensors in the engine room as well as sensors in the cold rooms and vent line.  In addition, the majority of the ammonia is maintained inside the engine room and just outside of the engine room (condensers). All pressure vessels are equipped with pressure relief valves that relieve into a common header that vents to the atmosphere.\n\n\n\nIn addition to the International Mechanical Code, Universal Pasteurization has developed a preventive maintenance program that utilizes the services of a professional refrigeration contractor to complete regularly scheduled inspections and tests of the ammonia refrigeration system as well as repairs as needed to process equipment. \n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThe EPA's RMP Program defines \"accident\" as the following: \n\n\n\n\"The release must be from a covered process and involve a regulated substance held above its threshold quantity in the process. \n\n\n\nThe release must have caused at least one of the following: \n\n\n\n?     On-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage (?68.42(a)); or \n\n?     Known offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place (?68.42(a)).\" \n\n\n\nUniversal Pasteurization became the owner of the facility and began operations in 201"

Therefore, there have been no significant releases of ammonia that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 100 pounds or that meet the definition above.\n\n \n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe Universal Pasteurization facility has an emergency action plan in effect.  The Emergency Action Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of this PSM/RMP document. This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n\n\n  1.)  To save lives.\n\n  2.)  To minimize and avoid injuries.\n\n  3.)  To protect the environment.\n\n  4.)  To minimize property damage.\n\n\n\nThe facility maintains a safety committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures, which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility. This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations.\n\nIn case of an ammonia emergency, the facility plans to evacuate all employees and contractors and put the facility's action plan into play to respond to the situation.  If necessary, they will alert the local emergency responders (fire department) for assistance. The facility plans to coordinate emergency response efforts with the fire department on a periodic and ongoing basis.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nThe Process Hazard Analysis, conducted on March 20, 2015, including a Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) study and a Facility Inspection, provided mitigation measures to improve safety at the Universal Pasteurization facility.  The Universal Pasteurization safety committee is planning to complete several items over the next year, as a continual effort to provide a safe work environment for their employees.  These changes include the following items:\n\n\n\n1. Continue to train all employees in the facility Safety Plan/Programs.\n\n\n\n2. C"
