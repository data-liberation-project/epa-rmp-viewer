      "SummaryText": "Resolute Forest Products (Resolute FP) operates a pulp and paper mill in Catawba, South Carolina.  This mill is named Resolute FP - Catawba Mill.  The address is 5300 Cureton Ferry Road, Catawba, South Carolina, 29704-0007.  The mill is located in York County and the latitude is 34'50'44' and the longitude is 80'53'21.  These coordinates locate the center of the covered process and were determined by interpolation of a map.  The facility's TRI identification number is 29704BWTRC5300C.  The facility DUNS number is 001946011.  The NACIS code is 322121.  This plant has approximately 450 full-time employees.  The parent company of this plant is Resolute Forest Products.  Resolute Forest Products located at 111 Duke Street, Suite 5000 Montreal, Quebec H3C 2M1 Canada is the owner/operator of this plant.  \r\n\r\nBowater submitted the original Risk Management Plan (RMP) in June of 1999.  The original RMP included three regulated chemicals in four covered processes.  Since 1999, the facility has successfully eliminated two RMP covered chemicals from three RMP covered processes.  Sulfur dioxide was eliminated from use in the thermo-mechanical pulping system in 1999 and elemental chlorine was discontinued as a water treatment chemical during 2003.  In September 2003, the facility began operating a state-of-the-art kraft pulping system, which reduced overall chemical usage, and eliminated elemental chlorine from the paper manufacturing process.\r\n\r\nThe remaining RMP covered chemical at the Resolute FP Catawba mill is chlorine dioxide, which is used to brighten pulp from the kraft manufacturing process.  Chlorine dioxide is also subject to the requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulations under 29 CFR 1910.119 for Process Safety Management (PSM).  The PSM regulations are applicable based on the facility's storage of greater than 1,000 pounds of chlorine dioxide.  The OSHA regulations require the regulated process to undergo a process hazards an"

      "SummaryText": "alysis (PHA) and it must meet all of the management requirements of the regulations.  The facility has completed and implemented the PSM program for Chlorine Dioxide.\r\n\r\nThe Clean Air Act (CAA) required the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) to promulgate regulations to prevent accidental release of regulated substances and reduce the severity of those releases that do occur.  To accomplish this task, the U.S. EPA published the Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Program under CAA Section 112(R)(7) in June 1996.  This regulation requires affected facilities to develop hazard assessments, management programs, prevention programs, emergency response programs and a risk management plan (RMP) by June 21, 1999.  The South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control has adopted parallel regulations.  The OSHA PSM program partially fulfills these requirements and for this reason, this plan refers to the PSM elements and procedures where appropriate.\r\n\r\nA facility is covered by the RMP rule if it has in inventory a regulated chemical greater than the threshold quantity.  For chlorine dioxide (ClO2), the threshold level is 1,000 pounds.  Therefore, Resolute FP is also regulated by the RMP regulations.  Since the OSHA PSM regulations are coordinated with the RMP regulations, the discussion below includes PSM concerns.\r\n\r\nThe U.S. EPA has established three levels of compliance to assure that individual processes are subject to requirements that match their location, complexity and the risk they pose.\r\n\r\n\u00bf\tProgram 1 - requirements apply to processes for which a worst-case release would not affect the public.\r\n\u00bf\tProgram 2 - applies to operators with only moderate complexity such as retailers, propane distributors and users, and others not subject to Occupational Safety and Health Administration - Process Safety Management (OSHA PSM) (29 CFR 1910.119).\r\n\u00bf\tProgram 3 - requirements apply to higher-risk, complex chemical processing op"
