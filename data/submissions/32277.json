Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Polices\n\nHeinz Frozen Food Company's (HFFC) manufacturing sites comply with applicable federal,\nstate and local regulations.  As with all HFFC manufacturing locations, this food processing\nfacility has a formal worker safety program.  All employees are informed of hazards in\nthe workplace.\nEmployees who work with potentially hazardous substances receive proper training in the\nhandling of those substances.  This facility has procedures in place to safely\nremove employees from areas in the unlikely event that a hazardous substance release\nwere to occur, and to put in place emergency notification and response procedures.\n\n2.   Facility and Regulated Substances\n\nThis Heinz Frozen Food Company food processing facility is located at 221 Ore-Ida\nCourt, Pocatello, Idaho.  Frozen prepared foods are produced at this location.  Food\ningredients are received, blended, mixed, cooked, baked, assembled, frozen and\npackaged.  The regulated substance at this facility, anhydrous ammonia, is used in a\nclosed-loop refrigeration system for product cooling and freezing. Ammonia is the\nmost effective, energy efficient and environmentally safe chemical for keeping food\nat it's proper temperature.\n\n3.   Worst-Case and Alternate-Case Release Scenarios\n\nPlease reference onsite data (Volume 1: Risk Management Plan) at Heinz Frozen Foods, Pocatello.\n\n4.   General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Ammonia Specific Prevention\n\nAll Heinz Frozen Food Company manufacturing locations comply with the OSHA Process\nSafety Management for Highly Hazardous Chemicals (PSM) standard relative to anhydrous\nammonia.
