The original Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) for the Unit 2 SCR conducted on February 9, 1995 was revalidated in May 2001, May 2004, May 2009, May 2014 and May 2019.  The original PHA for the Unit 1 SCR was completed on March 16, 1999 and revalidated in May 2004, May 2009, May 2014 and May 2019. Both processes share the rail unloading station which had its first PHA in May 2001 revalidated in May 2004, May 2009, May 2014 and May 2019.  The most recent revalidation of the PHA for all three covered processes was conducted in May 2019, however the report findings are still in draft form as of the date of this RMP submittal.  The metering and injection systems on Unit 1 and Unit 2 are operated independently, but are considered as one process by 40 CFR 68.3 because of the interconnection at the storage tanks by the unloading piping.  However, the prevention program data is reported on a unit by unit basis. ",

The original Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) for the Unit 2 SCR conducted on February 9, 1995 was revalidated in May 2001, May 2004, May 2009, May 2014 and May 2019.  The original PHA for the Unit 1 SCR was completed on March 16, 1999 and revalidated in May 2004, May 2009, May 2014 and May 2019. Both processes share the rail unloading station which had its first PHA in May 2001 revalidated in May 2004, May 2009, May 2014 and May 2019.  The most recent revalidation of the PHA for all three covered processes was conducted in May 2019, however the report findings are still in draft form as of the date of this RMP submittal.  The metering and injection systems on Unit 1 and Unit 2 are operated independently, but are considered as one process by 40 CFR 68.3 because of the interconnection at the storage tanks by the unloading piping.  However, the prevention program data is reported on a unit by unit basis. ",

Ensure compliance with all applicable environmental laws, regulations, and other requirements;\n\n?    Coordinate with local emergency response agencies; and \n\n?    Ensure that our commitment to environmental excellence is communicated through all levels of the organization. \n\n\n\nGSP expects all employees to understand and comply with the commitments outlined above and will promote these commitments with our suppliers, vendors and contractors.\n\n\n\nMerrimack Station Management is responsible for implementation and oversight of the Risk Management Program.  Environmental and Safety personnel are also involved in Risk Management Program related activities including but not limited to plan updates, emergency response coordination, drills, and training. \n\n\n\nA. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n \n\nGSP is committed to providing a safe working environment for all employees.  Achievement of this objective requires that all employees at all levels in the organization create and maintain safe working conditions.  This means strict adherence to established safety rules and practices, and the elimination of all unsafe acts from the workplace.  Each employee, as a condition of employment, is accountable for adhering to safety rules and safe work practices.  Station Management (including the Safety and Training Manager) is responsible for implementation of this policy.\n\n\n\nMerrimack Station has incorporated the program elements from the OSHA Process Safety Management Regulation 29CFR 1910.119 into the routine operation of the facility as the foundation of an accidental release prevention program.

THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\n \n\nMerrimack Station is a fossil fueled electric power generating facility owned and operated by GSP Merrimack LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Granite Shore Power, LLC. \n\n\n\nThe purpose of this facility is to generate electric power for sale via transmission and distribution lines.  There are four separate units with a net claimed capacity of 438 megawatts.  Units 1 & 2 use coal fired cyclone boilers to produce steam that powers turbine driven generators capable of 108 and 330 megawatts respectively.  Oxides of nitrogen (NOx) form during the combustion process.\n\n\n\nSelective Catalytic Reduction deNOx Technology (SCR) was installed in 1995 on Unit 2 and in 1999 on Unit 1 to remove emissions of nitrogen oxide (NOx) as part of the plan to comply with the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments.  The application of SCR reduces NOx air emissions from the station in excess of 80%.  Ammonia, a regulated substance, is the reagent used in the process.  Ammonia vapor is added to the flue gas ahead of the catalyst bed where it combines with the NOx to form nitrogen gas and water vapor.\n\n\n\nC. THE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND THE SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS. \n\n\n\nThe ammonia storage and handling facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.

The Plan includes: routine maintenance and inspections, operating procedures, employee training in the hazards and handling of ammonia, and provides for periodic program audits.\n\n \n\nAll employees who operate ammonia equipment are trained in the hazards of ammonia.  Shift operators conduct rounds that include observations of the ammonia systems.  Trouble reports are submitted when action is required and qualified mechanics are on site to make repairs.  Pressure vessels are inspected according to the ASME.  A management of change process is followed for qualifying modifications to the covered processes.\n\n\n\nD. FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n \n\nMerrimack Station went into commercial operation in 1960.  The first use of anhydrous ammonia on site was in 1991.  There have been no reportable releases of ammonia or related impacts from the use of ammonia to the health and safety of employees or the surrounding community.\n\n\n\nE. THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n \n\nA written Emergency Response Plan is included as part of the Integrated Contingency Plan (ICP) and provides guidance to employees in the event of any emergency at the station.  The primary contact during any emergency is the on-duty working foreman operations (WFO) who is available on site 24/7 at 603-230-7903.  There are 4 WFO's who work on rotating shifts.  The ICP includes procedures for notifying the local response agencies.  The plan is submitted to and periodically reviewed with the Bow Fire Department (BFD) and representatives of the Regional Emergency Planning Committee (REPC).  Two Merrimack Station Employees were elected as members of the REPC on May 7, 2019, representing industry and the environment.  The BFD and the Central NH Hazmat Team (CNHHMT) are consulted in p"
