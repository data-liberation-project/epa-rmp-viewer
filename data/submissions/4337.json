      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nThis report contains the Risk Management Plan (RMP) for the two ammonia refrigeration systems located at the Good Humor - Breyers Ice Cream (GHB) facility in Henderson, NV.  The RMP was prepared by Primatech in accordance with the requirements of the EPA's Risk Management Program (RM program) regulation (Risk Management Programs for Chemical Accidental Release Prevention, 40 CFR Part 68).\n\nThe information presented in this report reflects the data element requirements and numbering sequence of the final EPA RMP submission.  The Henderson facility has two distinct ammonia refrigeration system loops.  These are designated as the 'east system' and the 'west system'.  Many of the components and processes are similar in the two systems, however they do not intermingle.\n\nA.   Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nGood Humor - Breyers recognizes management's responsibility in protecting it's employees, equipment, property, and the environment.  The safety and health of all personnel are very important.  The control of accidents has been and will continue to be a basic responsibility of all personnel in the Henderson facility.\n\nTo accomplish the Company's goal in controlling accidental losses, the facility has established a Plant Safety Program and a Plant Safety Team.  The objectives of the Plant Safety Program are to: achieve maximum efficiency and safety performance, reduce losses associated which damage of property, and the economic  burden resulting from injuries and accidents.\n\nOne of the activities associated with the Plant Safety Program has been the development and implementation of accidental release prevention and emergency response programs which are designed to comply with OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals, 29 CFR 1910.119),  Nevada's Chemical Catastrophic Prevention Act (Senate Bill No. 641), and EPA's Risk Management Program (RM program) regulati"

      "SummaryText": "on (Risk Management Programs for Chemical Accidental Release Prevention, 40 CFR Part 68).  The Utilities Supervisor is responsible for the management of the accidental release prevention and emergency response programs.\n\nThe purpose of the accidental release prevention and emergency response programs is to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents.  Overall, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs help prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices which govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment.  These rules are detailed and improved as necessary.  They are also communicated to and accepted by all employees at the facility.\n\nB.   Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nGood Humor - Breyers operates an ice cream production facility at 1001 Olsen Street in Henderson, NV.  The facility operates two ammonia refrigeration systems to provide cooling and freezing capabilities.  The amount of anhydrous ammonia (CAS #7662-41-7) contained in each system is in excess of 10,000 pounds.  The maximum combined inventory for both systems is 86,000 pounds.  Since ammonia releases from both systems could pose a risk of offsite public impact and both systems are regulated under the OSHA PSM standard (29 CFR 1910.119), the systems are subject to the Program 3 requirements of the EPA's RM program.\n\nIn the two ammonia refrigeration systems, ammonia vapor is fed from vessels operating at low pressures to low stage compressors.  The compressed vapors from the low stage compressors are fed to vessels operating at intermediate pressures and then to the high stage compressors.  The high pressure ammonia vapor flows from the high stage compressors to the condensers where he"

The high pressure liquid from the condensers is collected in high pressure receivers.\n\nThe high pressure liquid collected in the high pressure receivers is circulated to the units (freezers, air units, silos, storage tanks, and chillers) located in the production area.  The ammonia liquid flows across heat exchanger surfaces (coils, tubes, or freezer barrels) where it picks up heat, changing from a liquid to a vapor.  The low pressure ammonia vapor is then sent back to the appropriate vessel via vapor headers.\n\nC.   Summary of Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nThe worst-case release scenario at the Henderson facility involves the release of 9,450 pounds of ammonia over a 10 minute period due to the failure of one of the high pressure receivers.  The maximum level in each high pressure receiver is limited to 75% of the vessel capacity during pump-down operations by facility procedures. The scenario has been developed based on the method provided in the Risk Management Program (40 CFR 68) Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario is unlikely for the following reasons:\n\no The worst-case weather conditions which were used for this scenario are uncommon;\no The high pressure receivers are located in enclosed areas that could help to contain such a release and minimize traffic near the receivers;\no Industry standards were followed for the manufacture and quality control of these receivers;\no Ammonia is not corrosive in this service and the vessels are relatively new;\no Pressure safety valves limit operating pressures in these receivers;\no An ammonia detector which is tied to emergency ventilation fans and an outside monitoring system is located near the high pressure receiver in the west ammonia refrigeration system;\no The high pressure receiver in the east ammonia refrigeration system is protected by concrete-filled pipes;\no  The facility has a preventive maintenance prog"

There are 1/2\" liquid feed lines to the silos and ice cream freezers. The scenario has been developed based on the method provided in the Risk Management Program (40 CFR 68) Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration.\n\nThe alternative release scenario is unlikely for the following reasons:\n\no The high pressure liquid lines are located in enclosed areas that could help to contain such a release;\no Industry standards were followed for the manufacture and quality control of these lines;\no Ammonia is not corrosive in this service;\no Most of the lines are elevated to minimize potential damage from fork lifts;\no  The facility has a preventive maintenance program in place to maintain the on-going integrity of the system; \no The facility has a training program designed to ensure that the system is operated by qualified personnel; and,\no The facility emergency response procedures which enable trained personnel to respond quickly to isolate any potential releases by closing isolation valves in the liquid lines.\n\nD.   Description of the Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe prevention program consists of the following elements:\n\nEmployee Participation:  This program involves the employees in establishing and implementing the program.

Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nEight (8) changes to improve safety were recommended to either the equipment (hardware recommendations) or the system operating procedures (procedural recommendations) when the east ammonia refrigeration system was analyzed in February, 1998.  Twenty-eight (28) changes to improve safety were recommended to either the equipment (hardware recommendations) or the system operating procedures (procedural recommendations) when the west expansion was analyzed in September, 1997.  The recommended changes have been evaluated and will be implemented in a timely manner."
