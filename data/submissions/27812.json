The Facility Policy\n\nThe owners, management, and employees of The Farmers Cooperative Union are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department , or other authorities , to mitigate any release and to minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment. \n\n2. Facility Information\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage of fertilizers fo sale to farmers. Anhydrous ammonia is stored and distributed for application uses.\n\nThe maximum quanity stored would be 83,200 pounds in our 19, 1000 gallon nurse trailers. \n\n3. The worst-case release scenerio and the alternative release scenario.\n\nA. The worst-case scenerio would be the release of the total contents of a nurse tank released as a gas over ten minutes. The maximum quanity released would be 4400 pounds, which represents the volume of a nurse tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by desigh standards.\n\nB. The alternative release scenario based on the five-year accident history ( or the most likely potential incident ) is a release from a break in a transfer hose. \n\n4. The accidental release prevention program. \n\n The facility has implemented the provisions of \" Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1 \", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc. and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA ), 29 CFR 1910.111, Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia\". \n\n5. The five year Accident History \n\nA. There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that : \n- have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; or \n- to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage. \n\n6.
