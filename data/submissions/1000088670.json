The Bushy Park facility is a responding facility for releases of the RMP-listed chemicals.\n\n\n\nThe stationary source and regulated substances handled [40 CFR 68.155(b)]:\n\nStationary Source:\n\nThe Bushy Park facility's primary activity is the manufacture of additives for the rubber industry. \n\n\n\nRegulated Substances Handled & Covered Process:\n\nThe LANXESS Bushy Park facility uses one chemical that is subject to reporting under this filing to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The chemical is necessary to manufacture the additives at the Bushy Park facility. \n\n\n\nThe regulated substance present at the Bushy Park facility is cyclohexylamine. Cyclohexylamine is regulated as a toxic substance. Cyclohexylamine is a colorless liquid with an ammonia-like odor. The LANXESS Bushy Park facility does not have any flammables that require inclusion in the Risk Management Plan. \n\n\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps [40 CFR 68.155(c)]:\n\nThe Bushy Park facility has implemented the Program Level 3 prevention program requirements under the RMP regulations. The required elements of the RMP prevention program are listed below:\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nTraining\n\nContractors\n\nPre-startup Safety Review"

In addition, the facility meets the requirements of the RMP Emergency Planning and Response element as detailed below.\n\n\n\nThe five-year accident history [40 CFR 68.155(d)]:\n\nThe LANXESS Bushy Park facility has had zero RMP reportable incidents in the previous five years.\n\n\n\nThe emergency response program [40 CFR 68.155(e)]:\n\nLANXESS participates in the Charleston International Manufacturing Complex's (CIMC) emergency response teams including Fire, Hazmat, Rescue, and Medical.  The CIMC emergency response procedures for the entire manufacturing complex are stored electronically in LANXESS' shared folder while LANXESS maintains site specific guidelines (WIN0802 BPK Emergency Reporting and Response Plan).  Training is held throughout the year by CIMC for site emergency response volunteers and LANXESS holds training drills annually. Employees who are part of the site emergency response teams also receive HAZWOPER training and will support CIMC's response to chemical releases at any facility.  \n\n\n\nAs is customary with other companies at CIMC, LANXESS employees participate with CIMC in a number of ways:  training, outreach, and the communication of incidents and items regarding regulatory compliance for all tenants.  Information is communicated through the Safety, Security and Pollution Prevention (S2P2) and Site Operations Council (SOC) groups made up of HSE professionals and site leadership, respectively. In addition, CIMC coordinates a Community Advisory Panel (CAP) discussion to address communication and information sharing with interested external parties through a multi-jurisdictional / multi-organizational approach.  LANXESS regularly attends meetings held by the CAP and the Berkeley County Loca"

      "SummaryText": "l Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  \n\n\n\nAdditionally, the LANXESS Bushy Park site trains operators on the safe handling of cyclohexylamine using a rigorous training program with in-depth studies of the Vulkacit manufacturing process (equipment and chemicals used, SDSs, etc) outlined in On-the-Job checklists.  Further, the Process Safety Information (PSI) document for the manufacturing process includes data on raw material hazards, locations of documents such as SDSs, P&IDs, work instructions, engineering files, safety interlock information, and raw material levels. LANXESS Healthy Safety Security Environmental Quality (HSSEQ), in conjunction with the corporate Production, Technology, Safety, and Environmental (PTSE) department, will address external requests for information related to cyclohexylamine releases or inquiries.\n\n\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety [40 CFR 68.155(f)]:\n\nThe Bushy Park manufacturing facility has a continuing commitment to improve safety systems by implementing recommendations identified from Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) and compliance audits."
