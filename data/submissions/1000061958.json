Management at Sprayberry provides adequate controls and equipment that, when used properly, will minimize or eliminate the risk of injury to employees in the event of an emergency. Sprayberry also holds employees responsible for following the procedures and processes held in place by the facility. We have emergency maps located all throughout the facility that show the nearest exits for employees in the case of an emergency. In the event of a release, the plant manager, operations manager and EHS manager are to be notified immediately. If none can be reached for whatever reason then the employees have the right to dial 911. Employees can also pull a fire alarm to signify that there is an emergency. The proper authorities will be contacted to help secure any spill as well as barricade the area off to keep anyone but authorized personnel in the vicinity. The site is a urethane foam manufacturing facility. There are three main ingredients that always go into the foam pouring procedure (toluene diisocyanate, diphenylmethane diisocyanate and Polyol). Our facility holds emergency drills two times a year to test our process and work on improving it if needed. Our local fire department has been in and has completed a walk through of our facility. They also have the SDS' of our three main chemicals on file so that they will know what kind of hazards to expect once they arrive on site. Under no circumstances shall an employee attempt to involve themselves in an emergency situation. These actions shall be left to emergency services professionals who have necessary training, equipment and experience. Untrained individuals may endanger themselves and/or others. Under no circumstances shall an employee provide advanced medical treatment. This also will be left in the hands of emergency services professionals. After an emergency event, re-entry by"
