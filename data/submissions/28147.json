The project site is located just west of the City of Blythe and directly adjacent to and east of the Blythe Airport. \n\nThe Blythe Energy Project generates electricity from two high-efficiency, natural gas-fired turbines and one heat recovery steam generator.  The facility SIC code is 4911, and the NAICS code is 221119.  FPL Energy Operating Services is committed to safe, environmentally sensitive operation of the Blythe facility.  The Blythe Energy Project is operated in compliance with all federal, state, and local environmental and safety regulations.  Emergency response coordination procedures are in place with local emergency response agencies.  \n\nAqueous and anhydrous ammonia are the substances of interest for this document.  The covered processes include both the storage and use of aqueous and anhydrous ammonia.  Aqueous ammonia is used to reduce NOx (oxides of nitrogen) in the exhaust gas emissions through a Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) module or DeNOx system.  The Blythe Energy Project is physically located in a sparsely populated, largely agricultural area west of the City of Blythe. The nearest areas normally used by the public include the airport to the west and a municipal golf course to the northeast. \n\nThe refrigeration system uses 54,975 pounds of ammonia to chill the air intake of a combustion turbine electrical generator.  The system cycles ammonia through various physical states - high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, then back to high pressure liquid.  Typical operating conditions consist of approximately 65 psig on the low pressure side of the system and 200 psig on the high side.\n\nThe process begins with high pressure liquid ammonia draining from the Condensers to the SOC Receiver.  The SOC"

      "SummaryText": "Receiver maintains a liquid reservoir for oil cooling of the Screw Compressors (5) via a modulating control valve on the outlet to the Flash Receiver.  The control valve is connected to the liquid level in the vessel, and allows excess liquid to flow to the Flash Receiver, at which point the pressure of the liquid ammonia is partially decreased.  The ammonia vapor produced by this partial drop in pressure is drawn from the receiver through the economizer suction port of the Compressors.  Liquid ammonia is fed from the Flash Receiver to the Pump Receiver package.\n\nThe Pump Receiver uses five pumps to transfer the liquid ammonia to the Combustion Turbine Inlet Chilling System.  Two pumps feed each of the two Chillers, while the fifth pump is reserved for back-up purposes.  At the Chillers, liquid ammonia partially boils as it absorbs heat from the air intake of the combustion turbine.  The resultant liquid/vapor mix returns to the Pump Receiver where liquid drops to the bottom of the vessel and the Compressors pull suction from the top.\n\nThe energy input to the system is supplied by five Compressors.  Each Compressor draws main suction from the Pump Receiver and economizer suction from the Flash Receiver.  As the name suggests, the purpose for using economizer suction is to increase the efficiency of the Compressors, thereby reducing their cost of operation.  Liquid injection oil cooling is provided by the SOC Receiver, and all Compressors discharge high pressure vapor to the Condensers which are located outside the Equipment Room.  The Condensers convert the high pressure discharge to liquid by spraying water and fan-blowing air over coils filled with the ammonia vapor.  The resulting high pressure ammonia liquid drains to the SOC Receiver to begin the cycle again.\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nA key part of the RMP program is the process hazard analysis (PHA).

We believe our program is proactive and not only meets regulatory requirements but also confirms our commitment to workplace safety as our number one priority. \n\n\nHazard Assessment Summary\n\nThe worst-case release scenario(s) and the alternative release scenario(s) for Aqueous Ammonia\n\nThe HazOp study reported in section 2.1 of this document shows that the only potentially significant RS release would be from the ammonia storage and distribution system. The Most Likely Release was identified as a rupture of the distribution piping immediately downstream of the ammonia vaporizer (SCR skid). The release rate would be limited to the capacity of the vaporizer, 1,000 lb/hr. The rupture would cause audible alarms to sound in the facility's control room for ammonia flow and distribution pressure, and NOx emissions.  As a result, it is highly probable that the operators will shut down the ammonia release within 20 minutes.\n\nThere are no sensitive receptors within the immediate area surrounding the Blythe Energy Project. In particular, the nearest school is 4.5 miles east of the Blythe Energy facility.\n\nDispersion modeling was performed using the Area Location of Hazardous Atmospheres model (ALOHA, version 5.2); a program, developed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).  This model accepts surface meteorological data, including wind speed, direction, and temperature, and upper atmosphere inversion height, for one hour. It determines whether a gas cloud with a density substantially greater than air will be formed, and uses either a Gaussian or dense gas algorithm, as appropriate, to determine AHM concentrations in the vicinity of the release point.  Unfortunately, the ALOHA program cannot directly model solutions which contain mixture such as aqueous ammonia (ammonia and water) because the ALOHA program assumes that the entire content of an aqueous ammonia release is anh"

Therefore, using conventional ALOHA program inputs would significantly over predict the threat zone of an aqueous ammonia spill.\n\nNOAA Report No. HAZMAT 93-3, entitled \u00bfModeling Hydrochloric Acid Evaporation in ALOHA\u00bf, published by the Modeling and Simulation Studies Branch, Hazardous Material Response and Assessment Division, Office of Ocean Research Conservation and Assessment, developed a method for modeling mixed solutions such as aqueous ammonia.  The modeling method used in this report is based on determining evaporation rates of low flashpoint materials in solution from a liquid pool.  The evaporation formula in the report is based on pool area, low flashpoint material mass transfer rates, and molecular weight of the material flashing, vapor pressure of the material, gas constant, and ambient temperature.  Once the evaporation rate is established, conventional inputs to the ALOHA program can be used to determine the maximum threat zones.\n\nThe evaporation rate of aqueous ammonia from a tank release in the secondary containment area proposed for the Blythe Energy Project was calculated to be 0.127 kg/s (kilogram per second), at an ambient temperature of 100\u00b0F and wind speed of 1 m/s (meter per second).  This was assumed to be the worst-case release scenario.  Worst-case meteorological conditions for the modeling were assumed to be F stability class, wind speed of 1 m/s, and ambient temperatures of 100\u00b0F.  \n\nThe scenario was also run for stability class D at a wind speed of 5.0 m/s and ambient temperature of 100\u00b0F.  This weather condition represents the likely actual meteorological condition at the Blythe Energy power plant site.  The hand calculated evaporation rate for this condition was determined to be 0.445 kg/s.  \n\nWhen comparing stability class F to stability class D modeling results, a significant reduction occurs in the maximum threat zone.

If a vessel is located inside a building, the EPA allows a passive mitigation factor of 55% to be used in calculating the release rate to the outside atmosphere when the release is enclosed by a building.\n\nThe Pump Receiver, located inside the compressor room, can hold the entire ammonia charge.  Therefore the entire charge of ammonia (54,975 lbs) is assumed to be released inside an enclosure.  This results in a release rate of 3,033 lbs to the outside atmosphere.\n\nFor analyzing the worst case release scenario, EPA requires the use of the most pessimistic meteorological conditions that will allow for the maximum downwind exposure.  Low wind speeds (1.5 m/s) and stable atmospheric conditions (F stability) will allow the gas cloud to travel as far as possible by limiting cloud dispersion.  The results are conservative.\n\nEPA's 'Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration,' May 2000, Exhibit 4-4 was used to find the downwind distance for the worst case release to 200 ppm in an urban setting.  The RMP*Comp Model developed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and EPA was used to prepare the data in this guidance document.
