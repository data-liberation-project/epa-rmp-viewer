This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive Accidental Release Prevention Program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the Propane, Propane / Dimethyl Ether Blend Mixture Storage and Can Filling processes at our facility.\n\nIt is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, we are coordinated with the Tipp City Fire Department and EMS Units which provides trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the Propane or Propane / Dimethyl Ether Blend Mixture release.\n\n\nOUR FACILITY AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nTwo of the products DAP Inc. manufactures at the Tipp City facility are aerosol paints and insulating foam for household use.  Our Can Filling operation inserts small quantities of Propane or the Propane / Dimethyl Ether Blend mixture into the cans (depends on the product being manufactured) for use as the propellant when the paint or foam products are used by the consumer.\n\nFor the RMP regulation, our facility's primary activities covered under the RMP regulation encompass the Propane and Propane / Dimethyl Ether Blend Storage Systems due to the volumes stored on-site.  We only have these two regulated substances present at our facility.  The maximum inventory of Propane at our facility is 152,640 lbs. stored in two 18,000 gallon tanks.  Another 8000 gallon tank stores the Propane / Dimethyl Ether mixture.  A fourth 4000 gallon tank stores pure Dimethyl Ether.  Administrative controls manages this tank inventory to keep under 10,000 pounds of Dimethyl Ether at any one time in the storage tank.\n\n\nGENERAL ACC"

This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 LP Gas Code.\n\nThe following sections briefly describe the elements of our Release Prevention Program that are in place at our stationary sources.\n\nProcess Safety Information:\n\nDAP Inc. maintains a detailed record of written safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with the storage and can filling processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Reviews:\n\nOur facility conducts studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these reviews is called the Checklist/What-If Methodology.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are re-validated at regular intervals of every five years.  Any findings related to the hazard reviews are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures:\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our facility, DAP Inc. has always had written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as startup, normal operations, emergency shutdown, normal shutdown and startup after a maintenance activity.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved with the processes.\n\nTraining:\n\nDAP Inc. has a training program in place to ensure that employees that are operating processes are completely competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  New employees receive basic training in process operations followed by on-the-job supervision until they are deemed competent to work independently.  Refresher training is provided at least eve"

Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change:\n\nWritten procedures are in place at DAP Inc. to manage changes in process  technology, equipment and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews:\n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as needed at DAP Inc.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits:\n\nDAP Inc. conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation:\n\nDAP Inc. promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.
