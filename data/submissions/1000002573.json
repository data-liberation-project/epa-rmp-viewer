(Pactiv Corporation)\nRisk Management Plan\nBedford Park, IL\n2009\n\nA?68.155(a) Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nThis facility stores and uses butane, which is considered a regulated flammable substance pursuant to Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 68 (40 CFR 68).  It is our policy to adhere to all federal, state, and local rules and regulations.  To provide additional safety, this substance is contained in an underground storage tank (UST), which provides passive mitigation.  This storage tank and associated process equipment complies with all applicable state Fire Marshall requirements pursuant to National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) 58 LP Gas Code.  \n\nIf an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to immediately contact the Bedford Park Fire Department by dialing 911.  The Fire Department is also coordinated with the Cook County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  This company takes a proactive position to reduce the risk of accidents occurring at this facility and is proud of its safety record.  A summary of the accident prevention program follows.\n\n\nA?68.155(b) The Stationary Source and Regulated Substance Handled\nThis facility uses butane as a blowing agent in the polystyrene extrusion process for the manufacture of foam food packaging products.  A low-pressure pump at the storage tank transports the butane to a set of mechanical high-pressure pumps at the pump house, which then delivers the blowing agent to the process lines in the manufacturing building.  \n\nAccess to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees and authorized contractors.  A contractor delivers the regulated substance by transport truck.  The storage tank is designed as a pressure vessel with a safety relief set at 125 psig.  The capacity of the storage tank (using a density of 4.81 pounds/gallon) exceeds the regulated threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds.  Administrative procedures "

This storage tank and associated process equipment complies with all applicable state Fire Marshall requirements pursuant to National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) 58 LP Gas Code. The process area is restricted to authorized personnel and has hazard signs posted.  The butane is stored under pressure as a liquid in a corrosion-resistant, underground storage tank that is equipped with a lining for secondary containment and cathodic protection.\n\nAccident prevention measures include process area lower explosive limit (LEL) monitors, perimeter LEL monitors, and underground leak detection probes.  The facility has a quarterly maintenance program, which addresses this system.  Filling of the storage tank is administratively controlled at 85% capacity to prevent tank overfilling.  The piping is double-walled and corrosion resistant.  The pneumatically controlled valves will fail-safe in the closed position.  The process area is designated with hazard signs.  Maintenance operators are trained and only use brass tools to prevent sparks, which would be an ignition source.  If a blowing agent system pressure drop occurs, corrective action is immediately taken including shutting the pumping system down.    The storage area, pump house and extrusion lines are equipped with flame sensors that will shut down the pumps and remote shut down.\n\n\nA?68.155(e) Five-Year Accident History\nThere has never been an accident related to this butane covered process.\n\n\nA?68.155(f) Emergency Response Program\nThe facility has contacted the Bedford Park Fire Department's Fire Marshall.  The Fire Marshall conducts an annual inspection at the facility.  In the event of an emergency, Prairie Packaging would dial 911 to contact the fire department.  The Bedford Park Fire De"

      "SummaryText": "partment would contact the Cook County LEPC.  Prairie Packaging's primary emergency response asset is the local Fire Department.  Prairie Packaging has developed a written emergency action plan to deal with minor fires and incidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes limited emergency response activities, mainly focusing on prompt notification of local emergency response agencies and the public; emergency evacuations, if necessary; adequate first aid and medical treatment should any be necessary.  Releases of regulated substances are only responded to by on-site Prairie Packaging personnel if incidental.  The plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our covered process.   In addition, emergency response equipment (fire extinguishers, etc) is regularly inspected and serviced. \n\n\nA?68.155(g) Safety Improvement Plans\nThe safety improvement program includes internal safety audits, which are performed on a periodic basis.  Based upon a recent internal safety audit, the facility will install a sign instructing the butane transport carrier contractor to chock the wheels and ground the tank truck prior to unloading.\n"
