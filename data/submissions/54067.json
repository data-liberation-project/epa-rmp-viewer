The Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at the Stationary Source\n\nDynaChem Inc. management and our on-site work force are firmly committed to safety.  Each level of management is directly responsible for the implementation of the Corporate Accident Prevention Program and responsible for the safety performance of their employees.  An active safety management team comprised of members from all departments participates in process hazard analysis, process safety management reviews, incident reviews, and safety implementation reviews.  DynaChem Inc. has a comprehensive job specific and safety training program.  The Georgetown Fire Department serves as the company?s first responders in case of any emergency beyond the control or expertise of DynaChem?s personnel.\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nDynaChem Inc. is a chemical manufacturing plant supplying foundry chemicals and other resins.  The DynaChem plant in Georgetown, Illinois is located in a rural, sparsely populated section of Vermilion County.  The plant uses three listed toxic chemicals above threshold quantities.  Epichlorohydrin is stored and used in the production of epoxy resins, formaldehyde solution is stored and used in the production of phenolic resins and urea formaldehyde resins, and ammonia solution is stored and used in the production of urea formaldehyde resins.\n\n3.    The General Accident Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nDynaChem Inc. has safety, quality control, and risk management programs that assure effective operator training and mandate a preventative maintenance program.  DynaChem Inc. completed failure mode and effects for both epichlorohydrin and formaldehyde solution and recently completed a process hazards analysis on the Coron process which"

The Five-Year Accident History\n\nThere are no records of accidental releases of epichlorohydrin, formaldehyde solution, or ammonia solution in the incident reports reviewed.\n\n5.    The Emergency Response Program\n\nAlarm systems and emergency response is directed at initial evacuation and re-entry with personal protective equipment and monitoring instrumentation. Emergency response is coordinated with the Georgetown Fire Department and the Vermilion County Emergency Planning Committee.  A written Emergency Response Plan is provided to these emergency response organizations.  Both emergency response and emergency medical procedures are documented and emphasized during emergency response training.  Contracted spill response units handle spills that exceed those associated with normal operations and maintenance activities.  DynaChem is continually evaluating the hazards of operations and proceeding to fully integrate OSHA, EPA, and State of Illinois requirements for on-site chemical manufacturing."
