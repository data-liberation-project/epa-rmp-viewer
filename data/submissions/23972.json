CLEAN SAFETY WATER IS ALWAYS ON HAND DURING NURSE TANK FILLING OPERATIONS.\n\nWE ARE EXTREMELY PROUD TO REPORT THAT NO ACCIDENTAL AMMONIA RELEASES HAVE OCCURRED AT THIS FACILITY DURING THE LAST FIVE YEARS THAT HAVE CAUSED ANY HUMAN  INJURIES OR RESULTED IN  PROPERTY DAMAGE.\n\nOUR EMERGENCY REPONSE PLAN HAS BEEN SHARE WITH THE COUNTY LEPC AND THE LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENT.  THEY HAVE TOURED OUR FACILITY AND ARE AWARE OF THE MANY DANGERS ASSOCIATED WITH ANHYDROUS AMMONIA.  THEY ALSO HAVE AGREED TO ASSIST US IN THE EVENT OF AN EMERGENCY."
