Reducing the impact of our operations on the environment is also a priority. NuStar Energy LP is committed to achieving Health, Safety and Environmental (HSE) excellence throughout the organization.\nNuStar management has also agreed to correct in a timely manner all hazards identified through self inspections, employee reports, accident investigations, or any other means with interim protection as necessary.\nWe will provide the results of self-inspections and accident investigation to our employees upon request.\nWe will continuously seek areas for improvement and ways to raise our employee\u00c2\u00bfs level of awareness regarding all aspects of safety and health.\nThe Norfolk Terminal was built and put into service in 1959. The facility was built to store and transport propane (RMP regulated substance), refined products and a Liquid Mixture (LM) of the two products. The propane, refined products and the LM are delivered, via a 6\u00c2\u00bf and an 8\u00c2\u00bf pipeline, to the Norfolk Terminal from the NuStar Terminal in Geneva, Nebraska. The 810,000 lbs. of propane, which exceeds the 10,000 lbs. threshold quantity (TQ) of the OSHA PSM requirements, is stored in, one of two, pressurized \u00c2\u00bfbullet\u00c2\u00bf tanks. The LM is stored in two pressurized \u00c2\u00bfbullet\u00c2\u00bf tanks and is routed through a Depropanizer distillation process, which removes any excess propane from the LM and this propane is then stored in the propane \u00c2\u00bfbullet\u00c2\u00bf tanks with the good propane. The propane is then removed from the site by propane trucks that deliver it to various customers.\nThe Norfolk Facility complies with many different regulatory agencies, which include, but not limited to;\n\u00c2\u00bf\tOSHA\u00c2\u00bfs Process Safety Management (PSM) Program (1910.119) of Highly Hazardous Chemicals.\n\u00c2\u00bf\tOSHA\u00c2\u00bfs Emergency Action Plan Regulation, 29 CFR 1910.38(c).\n\u00c2\u00bf\tOSHA\u00c2\u00bfs HAZWOPER Regulation, 29 CFR 1"

We have had no accidental releases in the last five years and in fact the Norfolk Terminal was built in 1982 and to this date we have had zero propane releases. \nThe Norfolk Emergency Response Program works together with the Norfolk Fire Department. The Norfolk employees are not first responders, but have received training in the notification process of the Norfolk Fire Department (first responder). The employees also participate in an annual evacuation drill, in the event an evacuation is required. \nVarious employees at the Norfolk Terminal have received CPR training, and all employees have received annual HAZWOPER training. Numerous other drills are conducted at the Norfolk Terminal as stated previously.\nSafety is the #1 core value of our company. Whether in performing everyday work or in the planning and maintenance of project work, safety is top priority. Some of the future improvements towards safety are: \n\u00c2\u00bf\tManagement and employee\u00c2\u00bfs are teaming together to pursue the OSHA VPP Star award.
