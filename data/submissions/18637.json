              "Description": "Chlorine storage serves two buildings identified as East and West Treatment Plants.  The storage building has a chlorine scrubber associated with it.  Chlorine gas detectors are located in the chlorine storage building which (1) activates the audible alarm system and 911 dispatch and (2) activates the scrubber unit to neutralize the release.  The chlorine feed system utilizes chlorine gas served by the chlorine storage building.  The gas is fed via tubing below ground to the two facilities.  Each plant receives chlorine gas in separate feed rooms attached to each building, these feed rooms have gas monitoring which activate the audible chlorine alarm and 911 dispatch.  The feed rooms are not attached to the scrubber facility.  The Chlorine alarm goes off when the Chlorine gas detector located in the East Treatment Plant senses chlorine gas in the Chlorine Storage Building, East Plant, or the West Plant.  The detector has two alarm points - low and high.  When any alarm is initiated, the on duty Communications Department personnel  will alert the ON - CALL WATER DEPARTMENT person and appraise them of which alarm(s) are active.The chlorine feed system is designed to feed through a vacuum system.  If the vacuum is lost, the regulators at the storage rooms close off the feed to the plant feed rooms.",

The written master copy will be available at the City Manager's Office & City Attorney's Office, 2nd floor, City Hall, 130 South Galena Street, Aspen, CO, 81611, 970/920-5199; as well as at The Public Works/Engineering Office, 2nd Floor, City Hall, 303/920-5080; and, at the City of Aspen, Water Treatment Facility Administration Office, under Hazardous Material file 500 Doolittle Drive, Aspen, CO.\n\nContents of the program outline the use of hazardous materials and waste and the threat they pose to employees and the environment.  In 1985, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) managed about 275 million metric tons of hazardous waste at licensed Resource Conversation and Recovery Act (RCRA) sites.  Hazardous chemicals are a serious safety and health problem that continues to endanger human and animal life and environmental quality.  Hazardous chemicals are materials that are toxic, flammable or corrosive, can cause fires, explosions, and pollute the air, water and land.  Unless hazardous materials are properly managed, treated, stored, or disposed of, they will continue to pollute the environment in an uncontrolled manner.\n\nThe Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has issued a final standard entitled \"Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals\" (29 CFR 1910.119) and \"Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response\" (29 CFR 1910.120), specifically developed to protect workers in hazardous environment and to help them handle and manage hazardous chemicals and wastes safely and effectively.\n\nThe Response program outlines the protocol in which the City of Aspen will respond to an emergen"
