The same properties that make chlorine valuable as a commodity also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling chlorine to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as that of our co-worker and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is our polocy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State rules and regulations. Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle chlorine.  The safety devices inherent in the design of this facility, the safe handling procedures that we use and the training of our personnel.\n\nOur emergency response program is based upon the facilities chlorine Standard Operating and Emergency Procedures and Indian River County Emergency Plan for Hazardous Materials. The emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of the local fire authority and notification of any potentially affected neighbors.\n\nThe stationary source and regulated substance handled.\nThe primary purpose of this facility is to treat wastewater from the surrounding community.  Chlorine is used during the treatment process primarily to disinfect the effluent. Chlorine is received by semi truck and unloaded by stationary crane. The crane is load tested yearly by certified personnel. The chloine storage room only has access by authorized personnel. The total inventory of chlorine stored at this plant is 4,000 pounds.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario(s) and the alternative release scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario.\nWorst-case Scenario: A 300-pound chlorine cylinder falls over and shears off the valve. There is a gas and liquid release.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario: A vacuum line break.\nThe general accidental release prevention program and the specific prevention steps.\nThis wastewater treatment "
