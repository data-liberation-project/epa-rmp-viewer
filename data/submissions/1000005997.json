This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  The City of Benton Wastewater Treatment Plant implements reasonable controls, such as training of personnel and the safe design, installation, operation and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to make every effort to prevent the release of hazardous substance but in the event of a release, our trained personnel and local emergency response agencies will respond to control and contain the release in a manner that will be safe for workers and will help prevent injuries to the public or the environment.\n\n\n2.0    Description of the City of Benton Wastewater Treatment Plant and Regulated Substances\n\n\nThe City of Benton Wastewater Treatment Plant is located within the city limits of Benton, Arkansas, a city with a population of over 23,000 residents.  The facility treats 3 to 5 million gallons of wastewater per day.  The City of Benton Wastewater Treatment Plant handles one substance regulated by the Risk Management Plan Rule (RMP Rule) in quantities above the Threshold Quantity.  This substance is:\n\n* Chlorine - stored in 1 ton cylinders and used for disinfection of the wastewater prior to release into the receiving stream.\n \n In addition, the City of Benton Wastewater Treatment Plant uses sulfur dioxide in the treatment process.  Sulfur dioxide is a listed regulated toxic substance under the RMP Rule, but is not present above the sulfur dioxide threshold of 5,000 lb in the sulfonation process.  However, Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act, which is the statutory authority for the RMP Rule, contains a General Duty Clause which requires sources producing, pro"
