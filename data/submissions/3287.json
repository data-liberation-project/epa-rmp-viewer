Because the MCWTP is regulated by the Process Safety Management (PSM), the regulatory program for the process is Program 3.\n\nDuke Engineering & Services, Inc. (DE&S), on behalf of the City of Walla Walla, has developed a city-wide Risk Management Program (RMP) in compliance with EPA's RMP requirements. \n\n\nIMPLEMENTATION PLAN\n\nDE&S has performed a thorough review of the existing program documentation against the requirements of 40 CFR 68 and WAC 296-67.  The review determined some of the existing MCWTP documentation and programs have, at least in part, satisfied the EPA RMP regulation.  However, some additions and modifications were necessary.  An implementation plan showing detailed tasks/subtasks and a recommended sequence of execution were provided in the Gaps Analysis Report, which is available at the MCWTP.  To achieve compliance with the requirements of the Risk Management Program, the implementation plan can be summarized according to the following steps:\n\n7 DE&S has developed program documents, beginning with the management system procedures which provide the guidance, methodology and the format for developing other program documents.\n\n7 The hazard assessment and prevention program elements were developed along parallel paths.  These steps involved the majority of the time and resources required for completing the initial RMP, outlined in Section 1.3.\n\n7 Following the completion of the hazard assessment and prevention program documents, the defined safeguards, procedures and training programs were used as a basis for emergency planning and coordination with the public and local emergency response organizations.\n\n7 Following the development of program documents, the implementation began with documented training on man"

This is the most critical for ensuring that compliance is maintained and the City of Walla Walla Mill Creek Water Treatment Plant is operated as safely as possible.\n\n\nMCWTP RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM\n\nThe following element summaries are brief statements of the current MCWTP Risk Management Program.  \n\n1.1   Management\nA formal management system for RMP is currently in place and documented via a formal management procedure that defines program element responsibilities and documentation requirements.  The management procedure provides a good program overview.  The control document is placed at a central location for MCWTP's requirements relating to the RMP.\n\n1.2   Hazard Assessment\nThe hazard assessment has been performed including the worst case analyses, alternative case analyses, and a five-year accident history for the Mill Creek Water Treatment plant. The modeling suggests the downwind distance to the EPA RMP worst case endpoint health criteria will reach 2.2 miles.  The alternative release for chlorine resulted in an endpoint distance of 0.2 miles.  No release was found in the MCWTP's five-year accident history.  \n\nThe worse case scenario is extremely unlikely and EPA does not expect it to be selected as the basis for emergency planning under the RMP rules.  EPA suggests that emergency planning should focus on the alternative release, which is more likely to occur.\n\nThe City of Walla Walla presented the worst case scenario in the Risk Management Program public meeting.  The hazard assessment information is available to the public.  The City of Walla Walla is prepared to explain to concerned citizens both the meaning of these results and what the city is doing to prevent such incidents through the Process Safety/Risk Management program.\n\nAs recommende"

A management procedure has been developed to ensure current written process safety information is developed and maintained in a format that provides easy access by employees, PHA teams, and auditors.\n\n1.3.2  Process Hazards Analysis\nThe MCWTP/DE&S team has conducted a Process Hazard Analyses  to identify, evaluate, and control the risk associated with the process hazards release scenarios at MCWTP subject to the Washington Industrial Safety and Health Administration (WISHA) PSM and/or EPA RMP regulations. The overall purpose of the PHA is to comply with these regulations and to prevent or minimize the effects of a chemical release.\n\n1.3.3  Standard Operating Procedures\nThe City of Walla Walla MCWTP has updated its Operating Procedures (OPs) and continues to maintain up-to-date, accurate, written OPs that provide clear instructions for all covered processes.  Effective OPs, when combined with operator training, are instrumental in ensuring safe operation of the systems and preventing accidental releases.\n\n1.3.4  Training\nA formal training program has been developed which defines the training to be completed, contents of the training, three-year refresher training, and competency testing.

To address all regulatory documentation and recordkeeping requirements more clearly, an addition to the City's procedure has been developed.  The addition defines the composition of the investigation team, provides space for team input on its evaluation beyond the initial supervisor's report, and encourages a more thorough identification of contributing and root causes.\n\n1.3.10  Employee Participation\nThe employee participation procedure provides the employees' right to access PHAs and all PSM/RMP information and the documentation of employee participation in the program.\n\n1.3.11  Hot Work Permits\nA Hot Work permit procedure has been developed to specifically address the chlorine systems as a \"permit required\" area.
