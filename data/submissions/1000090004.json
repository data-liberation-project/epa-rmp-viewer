      "SummaryText": "Cherokee Nitrogen Executive Summary\n\n\n\n1.0    Accidental Release Prevention and Response Policies: Cherokee Nitrogen is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n\n2.0    Cherokee Nitrogen Company and Regulated Substances: Our facility's primary activities encompass the manufacture of ammonia and related processes.  Ammonia is a natural part of the life process.  It is produced internally by all humans and mammals to process essential proteins.  Ammonia is one of the most widely used industrial chemicals in the world and commonly used to purify water and refrigerate foods. The company is a supplier to the fertilizer, explosives, and commercial industries by manufacturing ammonium nitrate, ammonium nitrate solutions, and other products.   Cherokee Nitrogen markets its fertilizers to distributors, dealers, national farm retail chains, regional farm cooperatives, and other fertilizer producers for ultimate sale and delivery to farmers. We have two regulated substances present at our facility at or above threshold quantities.  These substances include ammonia (anhydrous) and ammonia (conc. 20% or greater).  Ammonia (anhydrous) is used to manufacture nitric acid (<80 percent), urea, and aqua ammonia.  Ammonia (conc. 20% or greater) is contained within the letdown, urea, and ammonium nitrate solutions processes.  Sulfur dioxide was used to treat the outgoing process water prior to discharge from the facility. The sulfur dioxide process was removed from service and upgraded to new technologies incorporating Sodium Bisulfite, which is a non-regulated 68.130 toxic substance. As such, sulfur dioxide is no longer p"

The chlorine water treatment process was removed from service and upgraded to new technologies incorporating a chlorine dioxide reactor process. As such, chlorine is no longer present at or above threshold quantities. Additionally, based on process system design the chlorine dioxide present at the facility is below the threshold quantity of 1,000 lbs. Typically, the facility manufactures two types of ammonium nitrate solutions:  industrial - grade (83 weight percent) ammonium nitrate solution and a high-pressure solution consisting of 24 to 25 percent ammonia and 69 to 70 percent ammonium nitrate.  The industrial grade ammonium nitrate solution is used in the fertilizer industry and as a primary building block for commercial explosives and blasting agents.  Without this product, the mining of precious metals and gems, coal for power and concrete for construction would be much less safe and much more expensive. As this RMP will illustrate, our accidental release prevention programs and our emergency response planning efforts help us effectively manage any potential hazards posed by these regulated substances.\n\n\n\n3.0    Accidental Release Prevention Program: Our facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with ASME codes.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\n\n\n3.1    Process Safety Information: Cherokee Nitrogen maintains a detailed record of process safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\n\n\n3.2    Process Hazard Analysis: Our facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.

The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and revalidated at a regular interval of every five years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n\n\n3.3    Operating Procedures: For the purpose of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Cherokee Nitrogen maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the process.\n\n\n\n3.4    Training: Cherokee Nitrogen has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure employees operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every three years and more frequently as needed.\n\n\n\n3.5    Mechanical Integrity: Cherokee Nitrogen carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others:  pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls, and pumps. Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\n\n\n3.6    Management of Change: Written procedures and systems are in place at Cherokee Nitrogen to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures.
