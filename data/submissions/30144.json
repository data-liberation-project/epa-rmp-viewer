              "Description": "INTENT:\nThe intent of this chlorine emergency response plan is to educate and prepare this and other departments in the importance of an effective and rapid response in the execution and elimination of a real or potential hazard by training individuals through preplanning and coordination with all affected departments in a professional and unified manner.\nPOL-28.23.07   RESPONDING TO CHLORINE EMERGENCIES\n\nThis policy applies to all Water Treatment Plant operators and C.E.R.T. team members.\n\nOperators Attend Training and Pass Tests to Join Chlorine Emergency Response Team (C.E.R.T.)\n\nTo join the Chlorine Emergency Response Team and be a qualified responder to a chlorine emergency operators must:\nPass a Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA) fit test.\nTrain in the use of the SCBA.\nTrain in the requirements and use of level ?B? chemical suite and proper personal protective equipment.\nTrain in the use of the chlorine leak Class B repair kit.\nHave a valid first aid card.\nBe physically able to perform the work.\nBe able to function under stress.\n\nOperator on Duty Always Determines if Qualified C.E.R.T. Members are on Site\n\nWTP qualified C.E.R.T. members are:\nHome        Nextel        Pager\nWilliam LaRue        293-1897    661-3684    336-0247\nJamie LeBlanc        240-1399    661-3582    336-0257\nGeorge Atkinson    293-0125    661-3540    848-3247\n\nOperator Calls C.E.R.T. Team Immediately to Respond to Chlorine Emergencies\n\n\n\nStaff Calls 911 AFTER Plant Manager and C.E.R.T. Team Are Contacted\n\nStaff calls 9-911 only AFTER the Plant Manager or authorized supervisor and the C.E.R.T. team have been contacted and have determined that the leak is severe enough to require backup. To call 911 on City Nextel?s dial: 336-3131 or Speed Dial #91\n\nEmployee Calling 911 Gives Important Information\n\nThe employee calling 9-911 prepared to give the following information:\nLocation of WTP and our Staging Area. Staging Area/Communication Center will be at edge of the south field after the C.E.R.T. team has been activated.\nLeak Severity\nWind Direction/Wind Speed\nExtent of injuries\nNeed to evacuate neighbors north or south of the site.\n\nC.E.R.T. Members Follow POL-28.23.08WTP When Fighting a Chlorine Leak\n\nEmergency Phone Number for Canadian Miraclean Products, Inc is (604) 272-4000 (24hrs)\n\n\nPOL-28.23.08   FIGHTING CHLORINE LEAKS\n\nThis policy applies to all Water Treatment Plant C.E.R.T. team members.\n\nResponding C.E.R.T. Members Wear Personal Protective Clothing\n\nResponding C.E.R.T. members wear personal protective clothing that meet the requirements of WAC 296-62-3170(b). This includes SCBA, chemical resistant inner and outer gloves, chemical resistant steel toe and shank boots, hard hat, and Dupont Tychem Level ?B? hooded coveralls.\n\nResponding C.E.R.T. Members Always Rotate Containers\n\nResponding C.E.R.T. members always rotate the container so chlorine gas leaks, not liquid. The quantity of chlorine that escapes from a gas leak is about 1/15th the amount that escapes from liquid leak through the same size hole.\n\nTeam Keeps Tank Cool Using Water During a Fire or Extreme Heat\n\nBecause a fusible plug met down occurs at 158-162 degrees Fahrenheit the team members keep the tank cool using water during a fire or extreme heat, except\nWhen the container is leaking, water should not be used. Chlorine and water react and acids are formed that will corrode the container and the leak will quickly worsen. However, where several containers are involved and some are leaking, it may be prudent to use water to prevent rupture of the non-leaking containers.\n\nMembers ALWAYS Shut Off the Chlorine Feed System During a Fire\n\nChlorine and steel burn at 400 degrees F.\n\nTeam Operates Under the Buddy System at All Times\n\nMembers Use Ammonia Bottles to Determine Leak Location and Severity\n\nMembers Determine if Need to Call the Mount Vernon Fire Department for Backup and Assistance \n\nTeam Closes Building Vents and Installs B-Kit to Contain Leak\n\nIf 10 Pounds or More of Chlorine is Released Plant Manager or Authorized Supervisor Calls 911.\n\nTeam Provides First Aid to Victims of Chlorine Exposure\n\nAfter Leak is Contained Plant Manager or Authorized Supervisor Fills Out an Incident Report for Washington Cities Insurance Authority\n\n\n\nRESPONDING C.E.R.T MEMBERS SHOULD NEVER:\n\nNEVER Discard a Leaking Container Into a Water Way\n\nBy discarding a leaking chlorine container into a water way the chlorine would not only endanger or kill aquatic life, the chlorine leak will become aggravated, increasing the corrosion, and in turn increasing the amount of chlorine leaking. The container may float when still partially full of liquid chlorine allowing gas evolution at the surface.\n\nNEVER Leave Container Valves Open When Container is Not in Use\n\nPiping, valves, and containers should always be closed or capped when not in use to keep atmospheric moisture out of the system. Moisture in the system will create a highly corrosive condition. When chlorine mixes with moisture it readily forms hydrochloric acid.\n\nNEVER Connect a Container to a Manifold That is Not the Same Temperature as Existing Containers\n\nWhen discharging through a manifold, all containers should be at the same temperature to prevent transfer of gas from a warm container to a cool container.\n\n\nNEVER Drop a Container\n\nThis could fracture, weaken, or damage container valves or fusible plugs causing a leak.\n\nNEVER Handle a Container When the Valve Bonnet is Not in Place\n\nThe valves could become damaged or broken as a result of a collision, dropping, etc.\n\nNEVER Store a Container in Direct Sunlight\n\nThis will cause a build up of pressure and the possibility of a rupture due to high surrounding temperature.\n\nNEVER Re-Use Gaskets\n\nA leak can be caused by the use of an old gasket which is weak, brittle, cracked, or damaged in some way.\n\nNEVER Use a Wrench Larger Than 6?, Use Designated Wrenches Only\n\nOver-torque can damage or break the container or header valves.\n\nNEVER Open the Container Valve or Header Valve Over ? Turn\n\nTo allow rapid shutdown of chlorine flow.",

Eight vertical and two smaller variable speed turbine centrifugal pumps deliver the chlorinated water to the transmission pipelines.\n\nAlum, lime, polymer, chlorine and activated carbon can be mixed with the raw water as part of the treatment process to aid in the removal of solid particles and other contaminants.  Mechanical flocculators were installed in 1978 upstream of the sedimentation basins to improve plant performance.  Solids settled out in the sedimentation basin are mechanically removed from the bottom by continuous chain scrapers.\n\nThe six filters contain a mixed media filter material.  These filters remove the remaining particles in the water before it enters the clearwell.  They are equipped with surface agitators and are backwashed when the head loss through them exceeds the maximum value for optimum operation.  The filters are also backwashed if the turbidity of the effluent water exceeds 0.2 NTUs regardless of the head loss.  Backwash water for the filters is pumped from the clearwell.\n\nTreated water (i.e., ?Finished Water?) is supplied to the transmission pipeline by eight high-head pumps and two variable-speed pumps at the treatment plant.  The actual output of the high-head pumps is limited by the capacity of the transmission pipeline to approximately 33-mgd.  Actual peak flow rates in 1997 were 30.0 mgd.\n\nSediment from the flocculation chamber, sedimentation basins, and the filter backwash process is piped to the plant waste sump.  Two pumps are used to pump this wastewater to a solids handling facility.  The solids handling facility consists of three lagoons located on plant property.  The lagoons allow for suspended material to settle out.  Clear water can then be allowed to flow back to the river or to dissipate through natural percolation and evaporation. \n\n\n3.Worst-Case and Alternate Release Scenarios.\nBoth worst-case and alternate realease information can be foun"

Members Wear Personal Protective Clothing\n\nResponding C.E.R.T. members wear personal protective clothing that meet the requirements of WAC 296-62-3170(b). This includes SCBA, chemical resistant inner and outer gloves, chemical resistant steel toe and shank boots, hard hat, and Dupont Tychem Level ?B? hooded coveralls.\n\n2.Responding C.E.R.T. Members Always Rotate Containers\n\nResponding C.E.R.T. members always rotate the container so chlorine gas leaks, not liquid. The quantity of chlorine that escapes from a gas leak is about 1/15th the amount that escapes from liquid leak through the same size hole.\n\n3.Team Keeps Tank Cool Using Water During a Fire or Extreme Heat\n \nBecause a fusible plug met down occurs at 158-162 degrees Fahrenheit the team members keep the tank cool using water during a fire or extreme heat, except\n?When the container is leaking, water should not be used. Chlorine and water react and acids are formed that will corrode the container and the leak will quickly worsen. However, where several containers are involved and some are leaking, it may be prudent to use water to prevent rupture of the non-leaking containers.\n\n4.Members ALWAYS Shut Off the Chlorine Feed System During a Fire\n\nChlorine and steel burn at 400 degrees F.\n\n5.Team Operates Under t"

The container may float when still partially full of liquid chlorine allowing gas evolution at the surface.\n\n2.NEVER Leave Container Valves Open When Container is Not in Use\n\nPiping, valves, and containers should always be closed or capped when not in use to keep atmospheric moisture out of the system. Moisture in the system will create a highly corrosive condition. When chlorine mixes with moisture it readily forms hydrochloric acid.\n\n3.NEVER Connect a Container to a Manifold That is Not the Same Temperature as Existing Containers\n\nWhen discharging through a manifold, all containers should be at the same temperature to prevent transfer of gas from a warm container to a cool container.\n\n\n4.NEVER Drop a Container\n\nThis could fracture, weaken, or damage container valves or fusible plugs causing a leak.\n\n5.NEVER Handle a Container When the Valve Bonnet is Not in Place\n\nThe valves could become damaged or broken as a result of a collision, dropping, etc.\n\n6.NEVER Store a Container in Direct Sunlight\n\nThis will cause a build up of pressure and the possibility of a rupture due to high surrou"

This policy is reviewed yearly for any needed updates.\n\nThe Chlorine Emergency Response Team (CERT) is made up of members of the Water Treatment Plant. The team is on call 24 hours a day. The objective of the team is to respond quickly to contain any leaks or ruptures of chlorine containers found at the Treatment Plant or on any lands owned or operated by the City of Anacortes. All team members train four times each year in the use of Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA) and on how to set up and use the Ton Repair Kit(B-Kit)\n\nIn the event of a serious leak that releases or has the potential to release 10 or more pounds of chlorine, local responders (Mount Vernon Fire Dept.) and the County Department of Emergency Services will be called to assist.\n\nAlso, as part of our overall safety program, we conduct the following inspections. \n\n\nA.Annual Site Survey: Once a year an inspection team made up of members of the Safety Committee will conduct a thorough walk through inspection of each work site.
