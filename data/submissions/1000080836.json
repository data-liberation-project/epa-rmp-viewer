(CHESI) operates a hazardous waste treatment and storage facility (TSDF) in accordance with a RCRA hazardous waste license issued by the Nebraska Department of Environmental Protection. CHESI strives to conduct its business and operations in strict conformity with all applicable laws, and in a safe and responsible manner. CHESI has always placed the highest priority on the health and safety of its employees and members of the community in which it operates.\n\n\n\nCHESI may be subject to the provisions of the Accidental Release Prevention (ARP) Requirements because several of the regulated toxic and flammable liquids may be present in quantities which exceed the regulatory thresholds for these substances. Accordingly, CHESI has prepared a Risk Management Plan under the U.S. EPA's predictive filing provisions. CHESI will not exceed the threshold quantities for toxic gases and flammable gases.\n\n\n\nCHESI's accidental release prevention program involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices. The CHESI facility is designed, constructed, inspected, maintained, and operated in a manner so as to minimize the risk of exposure to employees and the public to hazardous materials managed at the site, and in conformity with all governmental regulations.\n\n\n\nCHESI has a comprehensive inspection plan which requires daily, weekly, monthly, and annual inspections of its processes, equipment, and management practices.\n\n\n\nCHESI has a Contingency Plan which prescribes procedures to be followed in the event of a fire or release at the facility. The Contingency Plan includes procedures for notifying local, state, and federal emergency response officials of incidents, and specifies arrangements which are made with emergency responders to ensure an effective response in the event of an emerg"

Included in the facility training plan are training modules which instruct employees on the hazards of the regulated substances stored at the site, the procedures for evacuation from the facility, procedures for responding to releases, and procedures for notification of incidents to both facility personnel and offsite emergency responders. In addition to the initial training that all employees receive, each employee receives refresher training on an annual basis.\n\n\n\n1.2    Risk Management System\n\n\n\nClean Harbors has developed a management system to implement and maintain compliance with the Accidental Release Prevention (ARP) and related chemical safety and emergency response programs. This management system identifies lines of responsibility for the entire program and each of its key elements.\n\n\n\nClean Harbors Environmental Services, Inc.

An emergency response plan has been developed which prescribes emergency procedures which the facility will implement in the event of a release or fire at the facility.\n\n\n\nCHESI's emergency response plan is identified as the facility Contingency Plan. The purpose of this plan is to describe both the hazards associated with the management of waste materials at the facility and the steps which will be taken to minimize the risk associated with each hazard. By ensuring that proper preventative measures are taken at all times and by providing for emergency response procedures to be followed in the event of any unexpected occurrence(s), CHESI intends to operate its facility in a manner that does not pose a significant threat to public health, safety, or welfare of the environment. CHESI's record in this regard has been exceptional and its overall contribution to the protection of human health and the environment far surpasses the risks associated with the type of activities performed at the facility.\n\n\n\nThe specific elements of CHESI's Contingency Plan include the following:\n\n\n\n?    A general description of the facility operations and the types of hazardous wastes handled at the facility.\n\n?

Personnel training is necessary to support a continual improvement in facility safety. CHESI's training plan achieves this goal. The training programs in place are documented in order to ensure that needed information about the safe handling of all chemicals present at the facility is available to employees, and can be readily interpreted by emergency response team staff and the Facility Emergency Coordinators when questions arise from public safety officials regarding potential risks to the community. All of these features of the RMP and the integrated risk management program at this site lead to operations that meet or exceed the state and federal regulatory requirements applicable to the facility's operations.\n\n"
