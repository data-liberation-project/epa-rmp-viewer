      "SummaryText": "The Chesapeake Energy Center is an electric utility generating plant which burns coal, oil, and natural gas to generate electricity.  Two toxic substances are stored in  reportable quantities, chlorine and anhydrous ammonia.\n\nChlorine is used to treat the cooling water taken from the Elizabeth River.  Chlorine is received by the facility in one-ton containers. \n\nAnhydrous ammonia will be used by the facility in Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) systems in order to comply with nitrogen oxides (NOx) emission reductions required by U.S. EPA's Regional NOx SIP Call, as implemented through the Virginia's NOx Budget Trading Program Rule (9 VAC 5 Chaper 140, Rev D98) and EPA's Section 126 Rule.  The SCR process consists of injecting anhydrous ammonia into the boiler flue gas.  The gas then goes through a catalyst bed where the nitrogen oxides react to form nitrogen and water vapor.  This Risk Management Plan covers the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.\n\nThe worst case release scenario is defined by EPA to be a rupture of one ammonia storage tank, with its entire contents being released as a ten-minute gas release at ground level.  Based on the DEGADIS+ model as distributed through Trinity Consultants' BREEZE HAZ software for calculating the consequences of such a release at 7,250 lbs/min, ammonia could travel as much as 1.4 miles before being diluted to the toxic endpoint.\n\nA more likely release scenario of ammonia would be a small hole or leak in the liquid or vapor space of a cylinder or its associated piping.  A number of such scenarios were examined, and in each case the toxic endpoint is 0.58 mile or less.  No people live within that distance of the release site, according to census data.  Other alternatives include the release of chlorine through a pipe leak, which would result in a toxic endpoint of 0.1 miles or less from the release point.  Within this distance, approximately 58 people would be effected.\n\nThe company's prevention program is based on OSHA"
