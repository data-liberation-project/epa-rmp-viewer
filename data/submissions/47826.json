This commitment is an inherent part of our comprehensive accidental\nrelease prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures,\nmaintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to\nimplement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If such a release\ndoes occur, our trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects\nof the release.  We also coordinate our response efforts with the Cotton County LEPC, which\nprovides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n  2.   Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities include support services for crop production.  We have anhydrous\nammonia stored in one 18,000-gallon tank and one 12,000 gallon tank at our facility in    \nDevol, Oklahoma (Figure 1).  The maximum amount stored is 25,500 gallons (131,223 pounds) at\nthe maximum fill capacity of 85%.\n\n  3.   Worst Case Release and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\n  4.   General Accidental Release Prevention Program\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the EPA's accidental release prevention\nrequirements as set forth in 40 CFR part 68.

Maintenance checks are conducted by qualified personnel with previous\ntraining in maintenance practices.  Examples of process equipment that would receive maintenance\nchecks include:  pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency\nshutdown systems, controls, and pumps.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance\nchecks are corrected in a safe and timely manner (Appendix C).\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at Helena Chemical Company - Devol to manage changes in process\nchemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or\nother employees whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly\nnotified of the modification and offered training to deal with it.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nHelena Chemical Company - Devol routinely conducts pre-startup safety reviews related to new processes and\nmodifications in established processes.
