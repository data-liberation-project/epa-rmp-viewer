Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Helena Chemical Company in Devol, Oklahoma  are strongly committed to employee, public,\nand environmental safety.  This commitment is an inherent part of our comprehensive accidental\nrelease prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures,\nmaintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to\nimplement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If such a release\ndoes occur, our trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects\nof the release.  We also coordinate our response efforts with the Cotton County LEPC, which\nprovides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n  2.   Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities include support services for crop production.  We have anhydrous\nammonia stored in one 18,000-gallon tank and one 12,000 gallon tank at our facility in    \nDevol, Oklahoma (Figure 1).  The maximum amount stored is 25,500 gallons (131,223 pounds) at\nthe maximum fill capacity of 85%.\n\n  3.   Worst Case Release and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\n  4.   General Accidental Release Prevention Program\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the EPA's accidental release prevention\nrequirements as set forth in 40 CFR part 68.  The following sections briefly describe the elements\nof the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nHelena Chemical Company - Devol maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the\nchemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associated with all pr"
