      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nSCC Chemical Corporation has an emergency action plan in effect.  The Emergency Action Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of this PSM/RMP document.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n1.)  To save lives.\n2.)  To minimize and avoid injuries.\n3.)  To protect the environment.\n4.)  To minimize property damage.\n\nSCC Chemical Corporation maintains a safety committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, chlorine health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nStartup of the chlorine system occurred in 1981.  The process is located at 1920 Riverview Drive in San Bernardino, California.   The chlorine transfer process for SCC Chemical consists of chlorine one-ton containers which are the storage vessels.  Chlorine liquid is dispensed from the one ton container through a filling manifold to a 20 pound cylinder.  The 20 pound cylinders are then used off-site to treat swimming pools.  The transfer system is equipped with a caustic scrubber tank to neutralize any chlorine residual in the piping once the transfer process is complete, thereby preventing the chlorine gas from escaping to the atmosphere.\n\nThe maximum quantity of chlorine on site is six one ton containers or 12,000 pounds of chlorine.\n\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY\n\nWorst Case Release Result Summary\nThe worst case release for this facility was that of the maximum quantity of chlorine that can be stored in the largest vessel in 10 minutes.  The largest vessel at this facility is a one t"

The most pessimistic meteorological conditions were used: 1.5 meters/second wind speed and F stability.  The facility is located in an urban setting. The reference table, Exhibit 4-4, from EPA's RMP Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants was used to find the potential downwind distance to 3 ppm as a result of this worst case release scenario.  The release reaches off-site and may affect population receptors.  No environmental receptors were affected by this potential release scenario.\n\nAlternative Release Result Summary\nThe alternative release was that of a 1/4 inch diameter leak from a pipeline containing liquid chlorine.  Based on the pressure in the tank, the release rate was calculated to be 50 pounds/minute.  Since there is no accident history at this facility, this release scenario was based on the possibility of a leak in the pipeline or a flange seal leak (note that the one-ton line is 1/4 inch) that continues until the tank is empty.  The meteorological conditions used were 3 meters/second wind speed, and D stability.  The facility is located in an urban setting.  The reference table, Exhibit 4-12, from EPA's RMP Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants was used to find the potential downwind distance to 3 ppm for the alternative release scenario.  This release reaches off-site and may affect population receptors.  No environmental receptors were affected by this potential release scenario.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nSCC Chemical has a Process Safety Management program in place to manage the handling of chlorine.  In addition, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed.  This includes common practices outlined by the Chlorine Institute and the National Association of Gas Chlorinator"

While the transfer process is not in operation, all chlorine tank valves are closed.  Only two facility personnel are trained to operate the transfer process.\n\nFinally, the chlorine containers are surrounded by an R-2 Fire Wall.  \n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no reported releases of chlorine at this facility over the last five years since June 1994.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nSCC Chemical has a Hazardous Materials Business Plan in effect at the facility and on file with the San Bernardino County Fire Department.  The facility works closely with the local fire department and All Pure Chemical, the chlorine supplier. The facility plans to contact 9-1-1 in the event of an emergency.  In addition, All Pure Chemical is available to respond to a release of chlorine.\n\nThe facility has three full time employees on site. The President is designated as the Emergency Coordinator in the event of an emergency.  In the event of a release of chlorine, the personnel will evacuate out the front of the building, opposite of the hazard, contact 9-1-1 and their neighbors in the building.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe Hazard Analysis, Hazard Assessment, and External Events Analysis studies provided the mitigation measures outlined below to improve safety at SCC Chemical facility.  The recommendations are scheduled to be implemented on or before December 1999.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis Recommendations\n\nR01:    Review the operating procedures to ensure that they are an accurate representation.  Review the operating procedures annually and certify that they are accurate.  Use the operating procedures to train new employees.\n\nR02:    Certify the two trained fill operators using the Senior Operator form included in the Training section of the PSM/RMP manual.\n\nR03:    Add \"warning\" to the operating procedures to alert operators that they need to be prepared to stop th"

This should include the general condition, currency of hydrostatic test, and valve protective housing.\n\nR10:    Include a copy of the Superior Valve Company specification sheet in the Process Safety Information Section of the PSM/RMP Manual.\n\nR11:    Review the secondary containment requirements for the spare caustic tank.\n\nR12:    Post an evacuation map along with the emergency telephone numbers.\n\nR13:    Consider having a second escape mask located in the office area.\n\nR14:    Have employees sign a certification that they have reviewed and understand the emergency response plan / business plan.\n\nExternal Events/Seismic Recommendations\n\nS01:    The one ton containers should be resting on a non-flammable support.  Typically, individual \"cradles\" are used for each container.  This support should be properly anchored to the ground. Each container should be secured using two nylon \"Kevlok\" straps which use a \"come-along\" buckle to ensure that the strap is tight (520-881-2130).  Typically, these straps are rated at 5000 pounds.  Two chains can be used to secure each container, but they must be kept tight around the container.\n\nS02:    The Compressed Gas Association Recommended Practice PS-6 allows for nesting of vertical cylinders such as the 20 pound cylinders.  The nesting should be 3-4 cylinder"
