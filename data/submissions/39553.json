Riverside Plant(formerly Cascade Fruit Company)\n\nOregon Cherry Growers- Riverside is a processor of brined cherries which are further processed into maraschino and glace' cherry products.  Processing operations at this facility also include ingredient cherry processing, fruit processing, fruit drying, and finished product packaging.  Sulfur Dioxide gas is bubbled into salt water to prepare brined that preserve, firm and bleach the cherries.  This process is essential to optimize uses for the growers' fruit and preserve cherry quality.  Our mission is to produce the highest quality cherry and fruit products in safe processing operations and protect our employees, or growers, our customers, the public, and the environment.\n\nTo assure that Sulfur Dioxide is handled safely, only trained, qualified operators are authorized to make cherry brine.  Oregon Cherry Growers has a long standing safety program which includes annual SO2 training for all brine making crews, Process Safety Management, meetings when a process change occurs, and continuing follow up to assure safe practices are followed and improved if possible.  Process team members assist in the annual update of our procedures and safety information.  We have had no accidental releases of Sulfur Dioxide in the last ten years.\n\nTo assure accidental releases are prevented, Oregon Cherry Growers has a continuing safety program for Sulfur Dioxide.  All process procedures are written and closely monitored by trained qualified employees.  Process monitoring methods include checklists for operations, regular equipment inspections, documented preventative maintenance and mechanical integrity inspections.  Additional security measures have also been put in place in compliance with changes in security regulations.  Oregon Cherry Growers maintains a stringent operator training program to keep operators alert to safe operations.  Emergency response activities are reviewed and u"
