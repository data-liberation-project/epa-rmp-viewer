This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility's processes.  The Regency Field Services LLC (Regency) policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances.  \n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOUCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nRegency operates the Waha Gas Plant located in Pecos County, Texas.  The Waha Gas Plant uses cryogenic fractionation to separate ethane and heavier hydrocarbons from raw wellhead gas to produce marketable natural gas.   As a result of this operation, several EPA regulated flammable substances (methane, ethane, propane, iso-butane, n-butane, iso-pentane and n-pentane) are processed, recovered and stored at the facility.  The Waha Gas Plant does not use or store any regulated toxic substances above the EPA set threshold levels.\n\n    \n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThe Waha Gas Plant has had one accidental release during the past five years that meet the criteria for an accidental release as discussed in 40 CFR 68.42.  The release occurred on May 15, 2008, and information regarding the release has been added to Section 6 of this RMP Update.\n\n\n\nLOCAL EMERGENCY RESPONSE COORDINATION\n\n\n\nThe Waha Gas Plant has coordinated its emergency response activities with the local emergency planning and response agencies as required in 40 CFR 68,12(b)(3).  \n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Waha Gas Plant.  Because plant processes are subject to EPA's RMP regulations and to OSHA's PSM standards, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\n\n\nEmployee P"

      "SummaryText": "articipation\n\n\n\nRegency and the Waha Gas Plant actively encourage all levels of employees and contract employees to participate in creating a safe work environment.   This participation begins with well-established mechanisms of communication with all employees regarding covered process information.  Employees are involved in maintaining PSM rule compliance based on their knowledge, skill, job responsibilities, and experience.  \n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information \n\n\n\nThe Waha Gas Plant maintains written information intended to provide a foundation for identifying and understanding the process hazards.  This information addresses the physical properties of hazardous substances handled, operating parameters of the equipment, and design basis and configuration of the equipment.  Regency ensures that this process safety information is available to all Regency employees, the LEPC, and the fire department.  \n\n\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in the material safety data sheets (MSDSs).  This information is supplemented, when required, by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  In addition, the plant has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters and ensures limit maintenance by using highly trained personnel, process controls, and monitoring and protective instrument systems.\n\n\n\nThe plant also maintains documentation that provides information about the design and construction of process equipment.  Equipment information includes construction materials, design pressure, and temperature and electrical ratings.

      "SummaryText": "Waha Gas Plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\n\n\nThe Waha Gas Plant primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience, as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process, as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\n\n\nThe PHA team findings are promptly and systematically addressed.  The Waha Gas Plant assures that the recommendations are documented and resolved in a timely manner. This documentation includes the actions to be taken and a written schedule of completion dates.   The plant also provides proof of communication with operating, maintenance, and other employees whose work assignments are in the process and who may be affected by the recommendations. \n\n\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate from the original design safety features, the plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years by the PHA team.  \n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nThe Waha Gas Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) initial startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) emergency operations, (6) normal shutdown, and (7) startup following a turnaround or after an emergency shutdown.

Operating procedures are periodically reviewed and certified as current.  When a process change occurs, operating procedures are revised as necessary through the management of change process. \n\n\n\nTraining\n\n\n\nTo complement the written process operation procedures, the Waha Gas Plant has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees. New employees receive job specific basic training in plant operations. Employee training includes emphasis on safety and health hazards, emergency shutdown operations, and safe work practices. Operators demonstrating adequate knowledge to safely perform duties and tasks are allowed to work independently.\n\n\n\nHot Work Permit\n\n\n\nThe Waha Gas Plant issues a hot work permit for all hot work operations conducted on or near a covered process.  The Waha Gas Plant provides Hot Work Permit training to all plant employees. Copies of issued work permits are maintained in Operations and Maintenance for a period of 1 year following completion of work.\n\n\n\nContractors\n\n\n\nThe Waha Gas Plant periodically uses contractors to perform maintenance or repair, turnaround, major renovations, or specialty work on or adjacent to a covered process.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) are trained in the work practices necessary to safely perform his/her job, (2) have received and understood the training required and carry a training document card while on location, (3) follow the safety rules of the location including the safe work practices, (4) advise the plant of any unique hazards presented by the contractor, and (5) notify the facility of all illnesses and injuries that occur in the process areas.  \n\n\n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\n\n\nThe Waha Gas Plant conducts a PSSR for any facility modification that requires a change in the pro"

The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides an additional check to make sure that construction and equipment are in accordance with design specification, that adequate safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency procedures are in place, and that training of each employee involved in operating the process or equipment has been completed. A standard checklist is used to document compliance.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\n\n\nThe Waha Gas Plant has well-established programs, procedures and practices that are required to ensure that equipment used to process, store, or handle lightly hazardous chemicals and/or flammable gas or liquid is designed, constructed, installed, and maintained to minimize the risk of a release. Equipment examples include vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, and relief and vent systems with associated emergency shutdown systems and controls (i.e., monitoring devices, sensors, alarms, and interlocks).\n\n\n\nMaintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) a review of the process hazards, and (3) the procedures applicable to the employee's job tasks to ensure that the employees can perform the job tasks in a safe and satisfactory manner.  Process equipment inspection and testing follows recognized and generally accepted good engineering practices.  Equipment deficiencies that are outside of acceptable limits are corrected before further use or in a safe and timely manner when necessary means are taken to ensure safe operation.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change \n\n\n\nThe Waha Gas Plant has a comprehensive system to manage and document changes to all covered processes.
