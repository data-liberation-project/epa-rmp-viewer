This Executive Summary sets forth some of the management systems in place to implement the accidental release and prevention program.  Airgas has also implemented specific chemical prevention steps to help prevent potential scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.  The following examples of the types of safety features in place:  (1) Release Mitigation - Emergency stop buttons to isolate hydrogen sources; personal protective equipment (personal gas detectors, protective outerwear clothing, intrinsically safe devices, safety goggles, shoes, etc.)  (2) System Integrity - Automatic control and manual valves that provides isolation for hydrogen process equipment, check valves on hydrogen loading lines and pressure safety valves for the process piping and vessels.  (3) Facility and Environment - Contracted emergency response specialist, Safety-Kleen, to support the Etiwanda plant emergency response plan.\n\nEmployee Participation (EP)\nAirgas has developed a written plan of action and Etiwanda employee/operators are expected to participate in the accidental release prevention program (RMP/PSM).

The facility is manned 24 hours per day.  The Etiwanda hydrogen process receives LH2 by tractor trailer.  These liquid trailers, in part, fill one onsite stationary single bulk storage vessel (7,810 lbs at approximately -420 \u00b0F) before being vaporized and transferred into gas tube trailers then distributed to customers.  Trucks at this facility can contain both liquified and gaseous hydrogen on a daily basis.  Each is monitored and analyzed, increasing operational safety.\n \nThe planned inventory for the covered process is approximately 40,000 pounds (lbs) of hydrogen.  The covered process exceeds the listed regulatory threshold quantity (TQ) of 10,000 lbs for hydrogen and is subject to U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions, written in Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 68 (40 CFR Part 68) (the RMP Rule), as well as the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) program written in California's Code of Regulations Title 19.  CalARP includes some additional state requirements and is implemented at the local government level by the Certified Unified Program Agencies (CUPA's) which determine the level of detail in the RMPs, review RMPs, conduct facility inspections and provide public access to RMP information.
