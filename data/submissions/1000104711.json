      "SummaryText": "The City of Yonkers Bureau of Water maintains four (4) Process Safety/Risk Management regulated stationary sources that utilize and/or store chlorine gas for the purposes of water treatment. At this facility, Tuckahoe Road Vault Chlorine Booster Station, the treatment process utilizes a chlorinator system that draws chlorine gas from a series of 150 lb. cylinders of pressurized chlorine gas and dissolves it through an ejector into the municipal water supply to inactivate various pathogenic microorganisms.  \n\nThe City of Yonkers is committed to providing clean drinking water to the community while also focusing on employee and community safety.  The City of Yonkers Risk Management Program also complies with OSHA's Process Safety Management regulations and we are constantly striving to operate as safely as possible. The system is outfitted with redundant monitoring and process technologies to prevent accidental releases.  The chlorination system is vacuum-operated. The vacuum system is a safety feature so that the system generally operates under negative pressure making it far less likely for chlorine gas to leak into an occupied area. The only part of the overall chlorinator system under positive pressure is the cylinder itself. Therefore, a leak in the tubing or any other part of the system, other than the cylinder, will lead to a leak of air into the chlorination system and not a release of chlorine gas into the room. Additionally, the chlorine gas ?ow rate in the chlorinator is regulated by a spring-opposed diaphragm regulator which is also the automatic safety shut-off valve. Should vacuum be interrupted for any reason anywhere in the system the safety shut-off/inlet valve immediately closes, shutting off the chlorine supply from the cylinder. \n\nThe chlorination system is designed so that one supply cylinder continues to feed until it is empty which assists in maintaining uninterrupted chlorination of the water supply. This process makes full use of all available"

Facility personnel follow detailed Operating Procedures that minimize the likelihood of operator error related accidental releases. Testing and maintenance of equipment takes place quarterly, biannually or annually depending on the equipment. \n\nSpecific operating personnel are trained to respond to accidental releases, and the Bureau of Water works closely with City of Yonkers Fire Department and Office of Emergency Management for all potential emergency response needs. The Risk Management Program includes provisions for periodic drills with Yonkers FD that include notification system drills, table top exercises and response drills.  \n\nThere have been no accidental releases from the covered processes that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage within at least the past 5 years, as of the time of writing. \n\nThe City of Yonkers prioritizes safety for all operations and staff and works closely with chlorine industry experts to ensure that the process systems are operating in accordance with up-to-date safety and operational standards.  A Process Hazard Analysis, which is conducted every 5 years, enables the City of Yonkers to identify, track and implement needed improved safety measures.  Additionally, the Employee Participation Program provides an open line of communication for employees to communicate potential safety improvements identified during work."
