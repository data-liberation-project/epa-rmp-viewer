Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\r\n\r\nIn this Tampa Port Services, LLC distribution facility, we handle anhydrous ammonia, which is considered hazardous by EPA. The same properties that make anhydrous ammonia valuable as a commodity also makes it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling anhydrous ammonia to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community. It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and state rules and regulations. Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle anhydrous ammonia combined with the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility combined with the safe handling procedures that we use and the training of our personnel. \r\n\r\nOur emergency response program is based upon the EPA, Coast Guard, DOT, OSHA and LEPC requirements. The emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of the local fire authority and notification of any potentially affected neighbors. \r\n\r\n2. The stationary source and regulated substances handled. \r\n\r\nThe primary purpose of this facility is to temporarily store, break bulk, and distribute anhydrous ammonia to both retail and wholesale customers. Anhydrous ammonia is used as a raw material for manufacturing fertilizer products. Anhydrous ammonia is received by barge and stored in a 50,000 ton  storage tank.  Anhydrous ammonia also is distributed to customers by pipeline. This facility has equipment for unloading ships, and loading rail cars and tank trucks.  Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors. \r\n\r\nThe regulated substance handled at this distribution facility is anhydrous ammonia. \r\n\r\n3.
