This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention \nprogram that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and \nemployee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement \nappropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility\u00bfs primary activities encompass Warehousing and filling of aerosol products.  We \nhave 3 regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include Isobutane  \n[Propane, 2-methyl], Methyl ether  [Methane, oxybis-] and Propane.  Isobutane  [Propane, 2-\nmethyl] is used for an aerosol propellant.  Methyl ether  [Methane, oxybis-] is used for an aerosol \npropellant.  Propane is used for an aerosol propellant.\n\n\n3.\tThe Worst Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario, \nincluding administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the \ndistances for each reported scenario\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the EPA's \nOCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equations.  The following paragraphs provide details of the \nchosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 3 flammable substances as a class \ninvolves a catastrophic release from A-55.  In this scenario 72,000 lb. of Flammable Mixture: \nPropane and Isobutane  [Propane, 2-methyl] is released. It is assumed that the entire quantity is \nreleased as a vapor, which finds an ignition source, with 10 percent of the released quantity \nparticipating in a vapor cloud explosion.
