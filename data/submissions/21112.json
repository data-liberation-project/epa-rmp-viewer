Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Car-Freshner Corporation are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental \nsafety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention \nprogram that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and \nemployee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement \nappropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility?s primary activities encompass Warehousing and filling of aerosol products.  We \nhave 3 regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include Isobutane  \n[Propane, 2-methyl], Methyl ether  [Methane, oxybis-] and Propane.  Isobutane  [Propane, 2-\nmethyl] is used for an aerosol propellant.  Methyl ether  [Methane, oxybis-] is used for an aerosol \npropellant.  Propane is used for an aerosol propellant.\n\n\n3.    The Worst Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario, \nincluding administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the \ndistances for each reported scenario\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the EPA's \nOCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equations.  The following paragraphs provide details of the \nchosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 3 flammable substances as a class \ninvolves a catastrophic release from A-55.  In this scenario 72,000 lb. of Flammable Mixture: \nPropane and Isobutane  [Propane, 2-methyl] is released. It is assumed that the entire quantity is \nreleased as a vapor, which finds an ignition source, with 10 percent of the released quantity \nparticipating in a vapor cloud explosion.  Under worst case weather conditions, the calculated \ndistance of 0.33 miles is obtained corresponding to an endpo"

The release is assumed to result in a Vapor Cloud Explosion.  The scenario \ninvolves the release of 21,200 lb. of Flammable Mixture of Propane and Isobutane  [Propane, 2-\nmethyl] in 10 minutes. The release is controlled by active mitigation measures that include Water \ncannons.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the flammable endpoint of \n1 psi overpressure is 0.14 miles.\n\n\n4.    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-\nSpecific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention \nrequirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and \nconstructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1998 Edition.    The following sections \nbriefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary \nsource.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nCar-Freshner Corporation maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the \nchemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes \nare identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is \nHAZOP.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in \nengineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of 5 years.  Any \nfindings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  The most recent \nPHA/update was performed on 03/06/2000.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Car-Freshner \nCorporation maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of \noperation such as init"

Refresher training is provided at least every 3 years and more frequently as \nneeded.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nCar-Freshner Corporation carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process \nequipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes \namong others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, \nemergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by \nqualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these \npersonnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by \nthe maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at Car-Freshner Corporation to manage changes in process \nchemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  The most recent review/revision of \nmaintenance procedures was performed on 03/06/2000.  Process operators, maintenance \npersonnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process \nconditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes \nare conducted as a regular practice at Car-Freshner Corporation.

These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective \nactions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\nCar-Freshner Corporation promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could \nreasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are \nundertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to \nprevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation\nCar-Freshner Corporation truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention \nis a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning \naccident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have \naccess to all information created as part of the facility?s implementation of the RMP rule, \nincluding information resulting from process hazard analyses in particular.\n\nContractors\nOn occasion, our company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction \nactivities.
