This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, we are completely coordinated with CHATTANOOGA FIRE DEPARTMENT which provides highly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\n\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Distribution of chemical products.  We have two (2) regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances are Chlorine & Sulfur Dioxide (anhydrous).  Chlorine is received into Chattanooga in 180,000 pound railcars.  The product is then repackaged in different  containers for distribution to customers.  Chlorine is also used in the production of Sodium Hypochlorite.  Chlorine related processes are Prevention Program Level 3.  Sulfur Dioxide and aqua ammonia are received prepackaged in different containers.  Sulfur dioxide and aqua ammonia storage, warehousing and distribution activities are Prevention Program 2.  Chlorine, Sulfur Dioxide and aqua ammonia containers are used only for resell to our customers.\n\nThe maximum inventory of Chlorine at our facility is 1,080,000 lbs. while Sulfur dioxide (anhydrous) is present at our facility at 50,000 lbs. and aqua ammonia at 50,000 lbs.\n\n3.\tThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accide"
