Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n\nIt is Blue Racer's policy to adhere to all Federal and State rules and regulations.  The Berne Plant has established a commitment to worker and public safety as well as the environment. \n\nNo regulated toxic chemicals (listed in 40 CFR ?68.130) are handled in the Berne Plant.  The plant handles flammable mixtures that meet the criteria for the National Fire Protection Association's (NFPA) 4 rating.  Safety precautions are in place when handling flammable mixtures to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to personal health and safety of personnel, contractors, the community, and the environment.  \n\nThe Berne Plant Emergency Response Plan (ERP) defines the steps the facility and each employee should take during an accidental release of a regulated substance.  The ERP includes both evacuation and protective action procedures for employees not directly involved in the response, and actions to be taken by employees responsible for responding to and mitigating the release.  All employees are trained in the applicable emergency response procedures.  The ERP also includes procedures for notifying facility personnel, emergency response personnel, Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), Lewisville and Woodsfield Volunteer Fire Departments.  \n\n\n\nB.    The stationary source and regulated substances handled:\n\nThe Berne Plant processes natural gas received via pipeline and consists of two cryogenic processes with a combined capacity of 400 million standard cubic feet per day (MMSCFD). The wet inlet gas received via pipeline is routed to an inlet separator.  Liquids from the inlet separator are routed to a pressurized flash tank and then to the condensate stabilization unit.  Inlet separator overheads are compressed prior to being dehydrated in the mole sieve dehydr"

The cryogenic units are designed to liquefy the dry natural gas and recover the natural gas liquids (NGLs) by cooling the gas stream and condensing the heavy components such as butane, ethane, pentane, propane, and heavier hydrocarbons.  The NGLs and condensate are flammable mixtures that meet the criteria for the National Fire Protection Association's (NFPA) 4 rating and are handled in quantities that exceed EPA's threshold of 10,000 pounds.  \n\n\n\nC.    The worst-case release scenarios and the alternative release scenarios\n\na.    Worst Case scenario:\n\nThe off-site consequence analysis assumes that the vessel with the largest amount of NGL had a catastrophic failure. The flammable material is composed of a mixture that contains the following regulated substances: ethane, propane, butane, isobutane, pentane, and isopentane. It is assumed that the mixture is composed entirely of the chemical that would cause the worst damage (i.e., highest heat of combustion) in this case ethane.\n\nThe entire weight of the mixture is used to calculate the distance to the 1 psi overpressure endpoint. The scenario involved a release of 232,952 lb.  RMP Comp was used to predict a distance of 0.5 miles to the 1 psi endpoint, wind speed of 1.5 meters/second, stability class F with ambient air temperature (77 degrees F).  \n\nb.    Alternative Case scenario:\n\nThe off-site consequence analysis assumed that the vessel with the largest amount of natural gas liquids (NGL) had a small leak (1.5-inch hole) resulting in a vapor cloud fire. The alternative scenario is calculated using the chemical with the lowest lower flammability limit (LFL).  The LFL for butane, ethane, and propane is 36 mg/L, and pentane has an LFL of 38 mg/L. Thus, ethane was the chemical used in the analysis for the distance to the LFL limit.\n\nRMP Comp was used to predict a "

Since the scenario does not produce an offsite impact, no adverse impact to the public or to the environment is expected from this release. \n\n\n\nD.    General accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\nThe Berne Plant is a PSM-covered facility and, as such, it has a viable process safety program. Workers and their representatives are consulted and have access to information regarding all PSM elements. Complete and accurate information on the process technology, process equipment, and hazardous characteristics and physical properties of all chemicals and intermediates for all covered processes is maintained. \n\nProcess Hazards Analyses were conducted on the process to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled. Major hazards identified include fire, explosion, over-pressurization, overfilling, and equipment failure.  Process controls in place include relief valves, check valves, emergency and automatic shutdowns, grounding, interlocks, procedures, and training. \n\nTraining (initial and refresher) is conducted and includes on-the-job and classroom type training.  Testing (oral and written) and demonstration are used as means to verify understanding.  \n\nStandard Operating Procedures (SOPs) provide clear written instructions for conducting activities safely. SOPs address operating limits, safety and health considerations, and safety systems and their functions. SOPs are revised as necessary to reflect changes made to the process.  The written operating procedures are readily available to operators and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\nA mechanical integrity program is in place that conducts training, develops written procedures, performs inspections and tests, correct deficiencies, and applies quality assurance measures.

Inspection and testing frequencies are prescribed by manufacturers and industry standards.  \n\nA non-routine work authorization program ensures that appropriate measures are taken any time non-routine operations are performed on or near process areas that might initiate or promote a release.\n\nFacility and process changes are managed through a management-of-change (MOC) program.  The MOC program outlines approval responsibilities and requires hazard evaluations prior to the implementation of any changes affecting a covered process.  Affected personnel and contractors are trained in the changes before startup.  \n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs) are conducted by appropriate employees, as spelled out in the facility's PSSR procedure. \n\nThe facility has an active accident/incident prevention program.  Each incident and near-miss associated with the process area is evaluated and, if it meets predefined criteria, a team-based investigation is performed.  The investigation's purpose is to identify the root and contributing causes and to make recommendations to prevent future recurrence.  The facility's safety manager tracks investigation action items until closure.\n\nEmployees are active in all aspects of process safety, including safe work permitting, process hazard analyses, incident investigations, mechanical integrity, and management of change.  \n\nAdditionally, contractors are involved in many aspects of the programs.  \n\nBlue Racer screens contractors based on safety performance before they are allowed entrance to the facility.  Employees responsible for projects involving contractors are encouraged to provide feedback to both management and the contractor on the contractor's overall safety performance.\n\n\n\nE.

Emergency Response Program Information \n\nThe Berne Plant maintains a written Emergency Response Plan (ERP), which aims to protect employees, public health, and the environment (in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.38, 29CFR1910.119, and 40CFR68).  The ERP defines the steps the facility and each employee should take during an accidental release of a regulated substance, natural disasters, and terrorist threats.  The plan includes both evacuation and protective action procedures for employees not directly involved in the response, and actions to be taken by employees responsible for responding to and mitigating the release. \n\nThe ERP addresses all aspects of emergency response including notifying facility personnel, emergency response personnel, Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), Lewisville Volunteer Fire Department, and Woodsfield Volunteer Fire Department.  \n\nAll employees are trained in the applicable emergency response procedures. The most recent review or update of the ERP was December 21, 2020.\n\n\n\nG.
