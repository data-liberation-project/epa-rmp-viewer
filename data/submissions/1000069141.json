Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nToyota Boshoku Mississippi, LLC (TBMS) is committed to protecting facility personnel, the public, and the environment from any workplace and accidental release hazards.  An appropriate response to releases of Toluene Diisocyanate (TDI) is in the written Risk Management Program.  Safety, environmental, and risk management programs are fully implemented and coordinated with community emergency responders for emergency planning and response. \n\n\n\nB. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe TBMS facility produces urethane molded foam seats for the automotive industry located in Mantachie, Mississippi. \n\n\n\nUrethane molded foam is a product made of combining chemicals that undergo a chemical reaction as they are injected into a mold cavity. One of the chemical mixtures contains approximately 65% Toluene 2, 4-Diisocyanate (TDI) and approximately 15% Toluene 2, 6-Diisocyanate (TDI). The TDI is stored in one (1) 8,000-gallon TDI Bulk Storage Tank. The 8,000-gallons of TDI equates to 65,344 pounds of TDI (max capacity). The TDI Bulk Storage Tank is located within its own building. \n\n\n\nThe EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) is part of the Clean Air Act and applies to a process storing a specified chemical above a threshold quantity. The chemicals and threshold quantities are specified in Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 68. One such chemical is Toluene Diisocyanate (TDI) with a threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds which is used as an ingredient in the manufacturing process. \n\n\n\nAfter reviewing the facility operations and the RMP regulations, it was determined that the entire facility is considered one process.  Based on the facility processes and applicable regulations, it was determined that the facility is subject to Program 2 of the RMP regulations.\n\n\n\nTBMS is committed to protecting facility personnel, the public, and the environment from any workplace a"

Develop, review and update operating and maintenance procedures for the TDI process,\n\n3. Provide the appropriate training for TDI process operators, maintenance personnel, and   \n\n   emergency response personnel.\n\n4. Conduct timely investigations of all incidents involving the TDI process.\n\n5. Conduct RMP Compliance audits as per RMP regulations.\n\n\n\nC. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nProcess Safety Information: TBMS has completed a compilation of written safety information to be used in conducting the Hazard Review. The Hazard Review has been conducted using the process safety information gathered in order to identify and understand the hazards posed by the TDI System. \n\n\n\nHazard Review: TBMS has updated and revalidate the Hazard Review as necessary and at least every five (5) years. The Hazard Review was conducted using  the \"What IF\" methodology, which is one of the methodologies specified in 40 CFR 68.67, and was performed by a team with expertise in engineering and process operations, including one member who has expertise in the TDI System and a member knowledgeable in the specified  methodology. A system was established to promptly address the team's findings and recommendations; assure that the recommendations are resolved in a timely manner and that the resolution is documented; develop a written schedule of when these actions are to be completed; and communicate the actions to operation, maintenance and other employees who may be affected by the recommendations or actions.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures: TBM"

These written operating procedures will be consistent with the process safety information for each operating phase, operating limitations, safety and health considerations, safety systems and their functions. The operating procedures will be readily accessible to employees who work in or maintain the TDI system. These operating procedures will be reviewed as often as necessary to assure that they reflect current operating practice. TBMS will develop and implement safe work practices to provide for the control of hazards during operations such as lockout/tagout; opening process equipment or piping; and control entrance into the TDI storage area.\n\n\n\nTraining: TBMS has provided training for each employee associated with the TDI system. This training includes an overview of the process and operating procedures as outlined in 40 CFR 68.67.  Refresher training is provided every three (3) years or more often as necessary. TBMS documents and maintains records of employee training, and the means used to verify that the employee understood the training.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity: TBMS has developed a written preventive maintenance program to maintain the on-going integrity of the equipment used in the TDI process (i.e., storage tanks, pumps, piping systems, etc); additionally, inspections, testing, equipment deficiencies, and quality assurance are addressed.\n\nEach person who has responsibilities to perform maintenance on the TDI system components receives training at least every three (3) years or more often if necessary.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits: TBMS has and will certify that they have evaluated compliance with the provisions of 40 CFR, Part 68 every three (3) years. The compliance audit will be conducted by at least one person knowledgeable in the TDI system.  A report of the findings of the audit will be developed.  TBMS will promp"
