The Utility Systems Supervisor is responsible for various inspections of the City's facilities to ensure compliance, and oversees the entire safety and environmental programs.  These programs include forklift safety, hazard communications, lockout/tagout, Hazardous Materials Emergency Business Plan, employee safety manuals, manufacturers documentation, Emergency Response, as well as the Risk Management Plan.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe facility has been in operation since 1973 but the water treatment system was modified in 1997.  The process is located at 14521 Lake Poway Road, Poway, CA 92064.  The chlorine system for City of Poway, Lester J. Berglund - Water Treatment Plant consists of chlorine one-ton containers which are the storage vessels.  Chlorine gas is pulled from the one ton containers to the chlorinators through the vacuum regulator.  The chlorinators are equipped with water at the injectors and the resulting chlorine solution is distributed through rotameters to other water processes at the facility. Below provides a list of the chlorine equipment.\n\nChlorine One-Ton Containers (9) in the Storage Area\nVacuum Regulators (4) in the Storage Area\nChlorinators (4) in the Chlorinator Room (Chemical Building)\nInjectors (4) in the Chlorinator Room (Chemical Building)\nInjectors (2) in the Ammonia  Building\nScrubber System, Located at the south end of the facility.\n\nThe maximum quantity of chlorine that can be stored on site is 18,000 pounds.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nCity of Poway, Lester J.

In addition, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed.  This includes common practices outlined by the Chlorine Institute.  In addition to the Management Programs, there is a scrubber system tied to a chlorine sensor that is activated if the concentration of chlorine exceeds 3 ppm.  Visual and audible alarms are activated to alert personnel of the release.  Procedures are in place for operators to respond to a release.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nBased on the Hazard Assessment (February 6, 2004) review of the accident history, (February 1999 - February 2004), there have been no releases of chlorine that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 10 pounds or the California threshold of any release at either Plant. In addition, there have been no injuries resulting from a chlorine release.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nIf a release of chlorine were to occur, the City of Poway, Lester J. Berglund - Water Treatment Plant's response plan is to call 911 in order to reach the Fire Department's HAZMAT team.  Employees will evacuate the facility to a point that is upwind of the hazard.  Evacuation drills are performed annually.  The emergency response plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations.  It is reviewed annually to ensure that the plan is kept current.  \n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe City of Poway has taken a pro-active approach to emergency response and safety at the Water Treat Plant.
