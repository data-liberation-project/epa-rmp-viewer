Facility Information\n\nThis Risk Management Plan (RMP) has been prepared for two contiguous plants: (1) the ADM BioProducts Plant and (2) the ADM Corn Processing Plant.  The following is a clarification of the facility information presented in the registration portion of the RMP.\n\nDun and Bradstreet Numbers:\nBioProducts          039119896\nCorn Processing   781167572\n\nPersons responsible for part 68 (RMP) implementation:\nBioProducts           Staci Bogue-Buchholz\nCorn Processing    John Dee\n\nTRI (Toxic Release Inventory) IDs:\nBioProducts           62526DMBCH4666F\nCorn Processing    62526DMCRN4666F\n\nEmergency Contacts:\nBioProducts            John Alley       Plant Manager   (217)362-3902          24hr (217)424-5205\nCorn Processing     Monty Jost      Plant Manager   (217)424-5750          24hr (217)424-5205\n\nLast safety inspections by an external agency:\nBioProducts            EPA         3/23/98\nCorn Processing     OSHA     2/23/99\n\n2.  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nAt the BioProducts Plant anhydrous ammonia is used as pH control and a nitrogen source for product fermentation.  At the Corn Processing Plant anhydrous sulfur dioxide is used as a processing aid as well as a bacterial inhibitor.  This facility observes safety precautions in handling anhydrous ammonia and sulfur dioxide to reduce the threat to workers, members of the community, and the environment and adheres to all applicable Federal and state rules and regulations. Safety depends upon the manner in which the facility handles anhydrous ammonia and sulfur dioxide combined with the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility and with the safe handling procedures that are used and the training of personnel.\n\nEmergency response for this facility is coordinated with ADM personnel and the Decatur Fire Department.  This program includes procedures for notifying the appropriate personnel "

The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThis facility processes corn into value added products such as corn sweeteners, fuel ethanol, sorbitol, and dextrose.  Through fermentation processes it also produces products such as the amino acids lysine, tryptophan, and threonine. The regulated substances used at this facility are anhydrous ammonia and anhydrous sulfur dioxide.  Anhydrous ammonia is used as a pH control and a nitrogen source for product fermentation.  Anhydrous sulfur dioxide is used as a processing aid as well as a bacterial inhibitor.  Ammonia is received by truck and rail and stored in three 308,000 pound storage tanks and rail cars.  Sulfur dioxide is received by truck and stored in two 130,000 pound storage tanks.  \n\n4.  Off-Site Consequence Analysis\n\nWorst-Case Scenario:  For multiple toxic substances subject to Program 3 requirements the EPA requires that a worst-case scenario be evaluated for the one scenario that is estimated to create the greatest distance in any direction to an endpoint.  For substances that are normally gases at ambient temperatures but are liquefied by pressure the worst-case scenario assumes that the single largest sulfur dioxide tank fails and the entire contents are released as a gas over a ten-minute period.  Safe handling procedures and work practices, safety devices, and personnel training make this scenario unrealistic.\n\nAlternative Scenario:  A more realistic release scenario involving anhydrous ammonia would be a leak on a liquid line of a storage tank.  Excess flow valves on the liquid lines were considered in this analysis as they function to close when maximum allowable flow conditions exist.  \n\nA more realistic release scenario with involving anhydrous sulfur dioxide would be a failure of the level sight tube on the storage tank resulting in a liquid release from the tank.  \n\n5.

      "SummaryText": "lease Prevention\n\nThe key concepts in this facility's prevention programs are the elements of the Process Safety Management Program:  employee participation, analysis of hazards, operating procedures and safe work practices, personnel training, maintenance and mechanical integrity programs, and contractor programs.  \n\n6.  Five-Year Accident History\n\nThis facility has not had any accidents involving anhydrous ammonia or anhydrous sulfur dioxide that require reporting.\n\n7.  Emergency Response Program\n\nADM's East Complex has an Emergency Response Program and Emergency Response Plan for responding to accidental releases of hazardous substances.  As part of this program, ADM has personnel trained as Hazardous Materials Technicians who can take measures to mitigate accidental releases.  The Emergency Response Plan is coordinated with facility personnel, the Decatur Fire Department and the Decatur Police Department such that in the event of an accident, immediate emergency response measures can be implemented.  ADM is working cooperatively with the surrounding community and the Decatur Fire Department to improve response capabilities.\n\n8.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nAs a result of a safety review of this facility's anhydrous ammonia and anhydrous sulfur dioxide systems, it has been determined that no changes need to be made to the systems at this time.  However, ADM is continually evaluating options for improving processes and efficiencies in order to reduce the quantities of hazardous materials used and stored at its facilities.  In addition, ADM continually evaluates options at its facilities for replacing hazardous materials with less hazardous or non-hazardous substitutes."
