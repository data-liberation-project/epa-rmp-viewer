Tangi-Pac strives to protect and promote the health and safety of its employees, its neighbors, and others who may be affected by activities at the facility. Tangi-Pac also strives to limit adverse effects on the physical environment in which its activities are carried out. The facility has established systems to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility. One part of these systems is the risk management program which helps manage the risks at the facility and complies with the requirements of the EPA's Rule 40 CFR Part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule). One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit an RMP describing the risk management program at the facility. \r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONCE POLICIES\r\n\r\nTangi-Pac's goal at its program 3 stationary source is accidental release prevention, while maintaining emergency response procedures to minimize consequences in the event of any such release. Tangi-Pac maintains a Process Safety Manual directing employees to process safety information in accordance with respective Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) process safety management and EPA chemical accident prevention provisions. Tangi-Pac also maintains an Emergency Procedures Manual providing necessary information and guidelines to utilize in the event of an emergency situation resulting in accidental release of a regulated substance. Tangi-Pac's objective is to train affected employees and contractors in emergency response procedures, and requires that emergency response actions are supported by proper consideration for safety, health, and welfare of employees, contractors, the surrounding community, and property.\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\n\r\nTangi-Pac has developed a management system to oversee imp"

Topics chosen are relevant to respective personnel assigned duties, and general and specific information is provided as informational instruments to enhance employee participation in facility-wide safety performance.\r\n\r\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION\r\n\r\nTangi-Pac keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe process operations. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. Specific departments within Tangi-Pac are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.\r\n\r\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in safety data sheets.  For specific process areas, Tangi-Pac has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in the operation manuals for each process unit. Tangi-Pac promotes maintaining process parameters within limits by using process controls and monitoring instruments, operating procedures, trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\r\n\r\nTangi-Pac also maintains technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to enhance safety features in respective processes.\r\n\r\nPROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nTangi-Pac has a comprehensive PHA pr"

Within this program, the existing covered process and potential future processes are systematically examined.\r\n\r\nTangi-Pac primarily uses the What-If/Checklist technique to perform these evaluations. The analyses are conducted using a team of personnel who exhibit operating, maintenance, and process engineering experience and expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as recommends accident prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are warranted.\r\n\r\nTangi-Pac periodically updates PHAs of affected units. These periodic reviews will be conducted at least every five years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating. \r\n\r\nOPERATING PROCEDURES\r\n\r\nTangi-Pac maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. Procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate. Procedures are maintained current by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made to the process. In addition, the Tangi-Pac operating procedures provide guidance on how to respond to events that result in exceeding safe operating limits for specific process or equipment parameters. The written operating procedures are readily available to operators in the process units and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\r\n\r\nTRAINING\r\n\r\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, Tangi-Pac has implemented a training program for all employees involved in operating a process.

In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures in order to maintain skills and knowledge at an acceptable level. \r\n\r\nCONTRACTORS\r\n\r\nTangi-Pac uses contractors to supplement its work force during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities. Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, Tangi-Pac has procedures in place to provide that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform Tangi-Pac personnel of any hazards that they find during their work. This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, (4) safe work practices, and (5) a work permit process (i.e., for hot work, confined space, etc.) prior to their beginning work. In addition, Tangi-Pac evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor. Tangi-Pac personnel monitor contractor performance to evaluate the level at which contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\r\n\r\nPRE-STARTUP SAFETY REVIEW\r\n\r\nTangi-Pac conducts a pre-startup safety review for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.

Inspections and tests are completed to evaluate equipment functioning as compared to that intended, and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels). If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or a management of change team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\r\n\r\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance. Tangi-Pac incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs.

Affected chemical hazard information, process technology information, equipment information, and procedures are updated to incorporate these changes. In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided with any necessary training on the change.\r\n\r\nINCIDENT INVESTIGATION\r\n\r\nTangi-Pac will investigate incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could result in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury. The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team, which can include contractors, will document its findings, develop recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forward these results to Tangi-Pac management for resolution. Corrective actions will be taken in response to the investigation team's findings, and recommendations will be tracked until they are complete.

The facility implements other work permits as necessary to assure safe work conditions are communicated to maintenance and contract personnel.\r\n\r\nSAFE WORK PRACTICES\r\n\r\nTangi-Pac has safe work practices in place to sustain worker and process safety. Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous materials before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control welding and other spark-producing activities, and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space. These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to foster that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\r\n\r\nADDITIONAL SAFETY FEATURES\r\n\r\nIn addition to the accident prevention program activities, Tangi-Pac has many safety features to help prevent the accidental releases of regulated substances in the facility. These safety features help to prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human error. These features include but are not limited to: \r\n\r\n*Operating parameter monitors with alarms\r\n*Process relief systems\r\n*Isolation valves (manual or automated)\r\n\r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nTangi-Pac is a new site that has recently started operations; therefore, there is no relevant accident history to repo"

In accordance with the requirements of 40 CFR 68.42, information relating to any accidental release that results in death, injury, significant property damage, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage will be documented for the facility and provided in future RMP submittals.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\n\r\nTangi-Pac's emergency response program is set forth in its Emergency Procedures Manual. That manual is comprised of numerous relevant sections. Those sections deal with, but are not limited to:\r\n\r\n*Employee participation \r\n*Incident command management\r\n*Response teams\r\n*Emergency evacuation procedures\r\n*Fire response\r\n\r\nThe Emergency Procedures Manual states Tangi-Pac's management issued policy statement, which is briefly described in the Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies section in this Executive Summary.\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nTangi-Pac's mechanisms to improve safety include written procedure review, process hazard analysis, management of change, incident reporting and investigation, near miss reporting and investigation, and employee safety meetings and suggestion processes. Also, Tangi-Pac's pre-startup safety review includes, among other things, 'show stoppers' that prohibit any startup until those items are closed. Tangi-Pac assigns respective tasks resulting from each of these mechanisms to responsible persons, and closure is approved only after all recommendations and action items are documented as complete."
