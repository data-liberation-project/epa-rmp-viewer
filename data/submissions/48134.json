This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility?s processes.  The Samson policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nSamson operates the Rio Farms Gas Plant located in Willacy County, Texas.  Rio Farms is a natural gas processing plant that produces liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) by Joule-Thompson separation with water removal by glycol dehydration.  The LPG is stored in a pressurized bullet tank for transportation by truck.  Condensate is also stored in tanks for transportation from the site via tanker trucks.  As evidenced in the ensuing text and based on criteria outlined in the Accidental Release Prevention (ARP) Program, Rio Farms is a Program 1 RMP process.\n\nOperations at Rio Farms were evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances were present in the process and if they exceeded the threshold quantity.  All equipment and vessels are considered to be connected and/or co-located; consequently, for the purposes of the ARP Program, all equipment and vessels are part of a single process.  The identification of even a single vessel exceeding threshold quantities of a regulated flammable or toxic substance would subject a process to threshold determination for offsite consequence analysis.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nRio Farms is a new facility and has not had any accidental releases in the past five years that meet the criteria of an accidental release as defined in 40 CFR 68.42.\n\nLOCAL EMERGENCY RESPONSE COORDINATION\n\nSince the facility is un"
