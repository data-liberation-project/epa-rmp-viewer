              "Description": "This plan is to minimize the hazards to human health and to the environment that are associated with accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia by NEW Cooperative, Inc. facilities. Employees working at the bulk storage plant make routine observations prior to and during transfer operations of the anhydrous ammonia from the storage vessel(s) to nurse tank(s). In doing so, they are able to detect problems before they arise. This routine inspection identifies any portion of the system that may be under stress or about to fail. Repairs can be made before they arise. Employees are trained at the time of hire and are annually trained thereafter to recognize the hazards associated with storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia. Training includes \"classroom\" instruction, on-site training at the plant, and follow-up observation to determine their individual comprehension and understanding level. Additional training is provided where needed. NEW Cooperative also routinely involves the local fire department personnel to visit the site. In the event that the local fire department requests assistance in training its employees on anhydrous ammonia, NEW Cooperative cooperates in their efforts.",

If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to immediately vacate the premises, move to a safe location, and notify the Local Volunteer Fire Department (via a 911 call) and request that it respond to the emergency. Incidental to the notification to the fire department, a call to the Monona Co. Emergency Management will be made. While we have planned for an emergency, it is acknowledged that a real emergency will be unexpected and may very well be different and cannot be ensured to duplicate what may have been planned. In reality,\n\nthe situation that develops may not happen in a manner in which it has been planned. In that event, what we may have planned will serve only as a guideline to follow. The Emergency Action Plan for this facility describes certain procedures that are intended to minimize the hazards associated with human health and the environment from fires, explosions, the sudden and unexpected release of chemicals, tornadoes, bomb threats, vandalism, or other accidents or acts of God which might occur on our premises. The primary emergency response coordinator for the Mapleton, IA location is Erik Boyle, Location Manager.
