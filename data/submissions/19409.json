      "SummaryText": "The Praxair Distribution facility at Phoenix, Arizona is an industrial and specialty gas plant that stores and handles the following substance that is regulated by the EPA's Risk Management Program rule, in excess of its threshold quantity:\n\n7 Propylene.\n\nThe Phoenix facility receives propylene in bulk form, stores it in large tanks, and then transfills it into smaller containers (cylinders) for distribution to customers.  All of the products from the Phoenix facility are distributed by truck.  Propylene is listed as a regulated flammable substance in EPA's Risk Management Program rule, with a threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds.  The propylene storage and transfilling process at the Phoenix plant contains about 15,000 pounds of product, and therefore is subject to the RMP rule.\n\nUnder the RMP rule, Praxair is required to report one Worst Case Scenario for the propylene process at the Phoenix facility.  The Worst Case Scenario is defined by the EPA as the release of the entire contents of the largest vessel in the process, with essentially none of the safety systems and devices that are in place to prevent such an occurrence functioning as designed.  The released gas is assumed to ignite, causing a vapor cloud explosion.  Given these conditions, we are then required to estimate the distance to an EPA-specified flammable endpoint, which is defined to be an overpressurization effect of 1 pound per square inch.  At the Phoenix facility, the largest propylene vessel contains about 3,700 pounds.  Using the criteria listed above, the Worst Case Scenario would result in a maximum impact distance of about 0.12 miles to the EPA-specified endpoint.  To determine this distance, we used the EPA's \"Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.\"\n\nWe are also required to report an Alternative Release Scenario, or planning scenario, for the propylene process.  While an Alternative Release may never occur at a facility, it is generally accepted to be more likely, or more credible, than the"

      "SummaryText": " Worst Case Scenario, and can be used by the facility and local response organizations to plan community emergency response activities.  The RMP rule assumes more typical atmospheric and weather conditions for an Alternative Release Scenario, and allows a facility to take credit for safety devices and other mitigation systems that are in place to minimize the likelihood and effects of a release.  When selecting an Alternative Release Scenario, EPA suggests a facility consider scenarios such as transfer hose releases, valve and flange leaks, pump seal leaks, and shipping container mishaps, among others.\n\nFor the propylene process at the Phoenix facility, a credible release would be a process piping failure resulting in a liquid propylene release at grade.  An accidental release of this type may occur due to mechanical failure, corrosion, failure of a piping component (such as joint or a valve), impact by a vehicle, or other cause.  At the Phoenix facility, a release of this type could result in the released gas igniting, causing a vapor cloud explosion.  The distance to the EPA-specified endpoint of 1 pound per square inch overpressure is 0.04 miles, or a little more than 200 feet.  To determine this distance, we used the EPA's \"RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.\"\n\nIn accordance with OSHA's Process Safety Management standard and EPA's Risk Management Program rule, the Phoenix facility has a comprehensive accident prevention program in place to ensure the safety of our employees, our neighbors and the community around us.  On a local level, this prevention program is built around process safety concepts such as:\n\n7 Documented process safety information to ensure the process design is understood and maintained throughout its life;\n7 Process hazard analysis to identify and control all of the hazards associated with handling flammable substances;\n7 Trained operators, using written operating procedures, to safely operate the process as intended; and\n7 Maintenance "

In July 1995 an off-site grass fire made its way across our fenceline.  The propylene storage trailer was located near the fence, and the pressure inside the trailer increased as a result of the fire burning around it.  The pressure relief devices on the trailer functioned as designed and begin to lift in order to control the pressure and prevent a failure of the tank.  However, the propylene gas leaving the trailer through the relief devices ignited and burned for several hours, until the contents of the trailer had emptied and there was no more fuel for the fire.  There were no injuries or fatalities associated with this incident, either on-site or off-site, but residents around the plant were evacuated as a precautionary measure.  There was significant property damage, both on-site and off-site, as a result of this incident.\n\nIn the event of an emergency, the facility has an emergency action plan in place, which contains procedures for employees to follow, including notification of local response agencies.  All facility employees are trained in their role in the emergency action plan, and Praxair policy requires that emergency drills be conducted at least annually.\n\nPraxair is committed to the continuous improvement of its safety, health and environmental programs. The company operates under an umbrella of global corporate policies with specific program elements defined on a regional basis. As the result of recent acquisitions, detailed process safety audits have been conducted at numerous facilities throughout the company. As we ensure the process safety int"
