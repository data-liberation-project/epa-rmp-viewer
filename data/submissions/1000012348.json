      "SummaryText": "The Catawba River Water Treatment Plant (CRWTP) located off of Hwy 5 in Van Wyck, SC uses chlorine gas in the Chlorine Dioxide Generation Process which is used to pre-treat raw water entering the treatment plant.\n\nThe chlorine is stored in 2,000 pound cylinders. The CRWTP has trained personnel onsite at all times. Filter personnel are trained in chlorine cylinder procedures, which include connecting, disconnecting and emergency procedures.\n\nThe process is equipped with automatic shutoff valves in the event of a loss of vacuum pressure. The chlorine storage area has gas monitors to detect chlorine leaks that initiate startup of a chlorine scrubber that contains and neutralizes any chlorine gas escape from a vessel. \n\nThe CRWTP purchases DOT approved cylinders. \n\nIn the event of a chlorine gas leak that escapes the scrubber (equipment failure) CRWTP personnel are instructed to call the local HAZMAT team for emergency response. They will monitor wind direction and estimate the amount of chlorine in the cylinder at the time of the release. \n\nThe worst case scenario would be a loss of 2,000 pounds of chlorine gas, and a failure of the scrubber.\n\nThe alternative scenario would result in a lesser amount released.\n\nThe CRWTP has not had an incident involving chlorine in the last five years. The CRWTP has not had an incident involving chlorine since it began processing water in 1992. With the addition of the chlorine scrubber, off site consequences have been eliminated. For any potential release that might occur inside the process building."
