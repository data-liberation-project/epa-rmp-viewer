If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work \n    with the local fire department , or other authorities, to migrate any release and minimize the impact of the\n    release to people and the enviroment.\n\n2.The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled.\n     The primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers. \n     Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and  destributed for direct application as a crop production\n     nutrient. Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management\n     personnel and authorized contractors.\n\n     The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia that can be stored would be 84,000 pounds..\n\n3.The Worst-case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario.\n      The worst- case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank re-\n      leased as a gas over 10 minutes. The maximum quantity released would be 84,000 pounds, which\n      represents the volume of the largest storage tank as limited by design standards.\n\n      The distance to the endpoint of  .14mg/L for the worst-case scenario is 2.5 miles.\n\n       The alternative release scenario based on the most likely potential incident is a release from a break\n       in a transfer hose.\n\n       The distance to the endpoint of .14mg/L for the alternayive scenario is .19 miles. This release has the\n       possibility of extending beyond the facility boundary.\n\n4.The Accidental Release Prevention Program.\n       This facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Preventiun Rule and with all applicable state \n       codes and regulations. This facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirement for the\n       Storage and Handling of Anh"
