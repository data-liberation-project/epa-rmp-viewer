Otto & Sons utilizes a regulated substance, anhydrous ammonia, for refrigeration.  Two closed loop refrigeration systems are required to freeze the produced product and maintain the facility's temperature.  Otto & Sons has a total of 29,500 pounds of Anhydrous Ammonia onsite.  One closed loop system for product freezing contains 15,700 pounds and the other closed loop system for maintaining plant temperature contains 13,800 pounds.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\nOtto & Sons management is committed to safety and the implementation of safe ammonia refrigeration practices.  Employee training has been conducted in accordance to OHSA standard 29 CFR 1910.1200.  In addition, Otto & Sons conducts annual retraining for all emergency response team members which includes evacuation and emergency response drills.  Otto & Sons has also established awareness training with the West Chicago Fire Department.  Otto & Sons has had no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia since it has been stored onsite in 1994.  \n\nWorst-case and Alternative Release Scenario:\nThe worst-case release scenario would be the rupture of the HP Receiver.  The manufacturer has calculated that no more than 6227 pounds of anhydrous ammonia could be released.  RMP*Comp was used to determine the offsite endpoint distance of the 0.9 miles.  An alternative release scenario would be lifting a relief valve on the HP Receiver.  RMP*Comp was used to determine the endpoint distance of the 0.1 miles.\n\nFive-year accident history:\nNone\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program:\nOtto & Sons complies with OHSA regulations 29 CFR 1910.38 (process safety management).  The process safety management program minimizes the potential of an unwanted anhydrous ammonia release.  Both refrigeration systems are c"

      "SummaryText": "ontinuously monitored to ascertain equipment operates under normal conditions.  Procedures have been written to properly shutdown and isolate refrigeration equipment in the event of an emergency.  Also, each piece of refrigeration equipment has multiple safety devices to properly shutdown.\n\nEmergency Response Program:\nOtto & Sons has developed an emergency response plan to provide notification and evacuation of plant personnel and the public.  The plan also outlines procedures for mitigating and neutralizing the affected area.  In the event of a serious release, the plan has written instructions for notifying the West Chicago Fire Department and the DuPage County Emergency Planning Committee.  Otto & Sons has established an in-house emergency response team, as well as an outside contracted emergency response team, to quickly respond any unwanted releases of anhydrous ammonia.  Each member of the emergency response team has had 24-hour ammonia emergency response training, as well as an annual 8-hour refresher course per OHSA 29 CFR 1910.1200.  The emergency response plan has specific written instructions for each team member's role during and following an emergency.  Refrigeration operators have been trained to safely shut down refrigeration equipment during an emergency.  Each year an emergency response practice drill is performed at Otto & Sons.  Recommendations from each emergency response drill are incorporated into the emergency response program for continuous improvement.  Otto & Sons has an onsite mobile emergency response cart containing personal protective equipment, radios, and emergency response procedures that can be used as an incident command center."
