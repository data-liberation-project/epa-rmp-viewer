It is Sun Pacifics policy to comply with \nall applicable governmental regulations.  Further, it is Sun Pacifics objective to \nbe a responsible citizen of the community in all of its business activities.\n\nSun Pacific emphasizes safe and environmentally sound operating practices and \nprocedures through their employee training programs.  In addition to job specific \ntraining, operators and maintenance personnel receive training in accident \nprevention, safety, and first aid.  Additionally, an emergency action plan has been \nprepared for Sun Pacific and a chain of command to respond to emergencies has \nbeen established.\n\nSun Pacific has developed a detailed Compliance Audit Checklist which is used \nto evaluate compliance with the Process Safety Management (PSM) and 40 CFR \nPart 68 (RMP regulations).  At least every three years, Sun Pacific audits these \nprograms and any findings of noncompliance are documented and responded to \nand the deficiencies are corrected.\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances \n\nSun Pacific owns and operates a cold storage facility located at 33374 Lerdo \nHighway.  Shafter is the closest city to the Sun Pacific Lerdo Highway Cold \nStorage facility.  The plant was constructed in 1988.  The refrigeration system \nhas been upgraded several times, with the last expansion completed prior to \nSeptember 1, 1992.\n\nAt Sun Pacific, anhydrous ammonia is used in the refrigeration system which \nprovides process cooling for the cold storage facility.  The system consists of a \nhigh pressure receiver, six evaporative condensers, four compressors, three \nrecirculation accumulators, and numerous evaporators.  The three recirculation \naccumulators and evaporator units provide cooling to the cold storage rooms and \nthe pre-cool/de"

The halls and truck dock areas are cooled by direct expansion \nevaporators.   \n\nDuring normal operation, the anhydrous ammonia is distributed throughout the \nrefrigeration system.  However, during major maintenance activities, the entire \nrefrigeration system can be pumped down to evacuate the ammonia from the \nsystem and store it in the high pressure receiver.  The maximum quantity of \nammonia that can be stored in the high pressure receiver is 20,987 pounds. \n\nFor purposes of the offsite consequence analyses, the RMP regulations define \nthe toxic endpoint for anhydrous ammonia as 0.14 mg/l (200 ppm).  This \nconcentration has been established by the American Industrial Hygiene \nAssociation as the Emergency Response Planning Guideline Level 2 (ERPG-2).  \n\nERPG-2 is the maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that \nnearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or \ndeveloping irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms which could \nimpair an individuals ability to take protective action.\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario and Alternative Release Scenario\n\nOffsite consequence analyses are used as tools to assist in emergency response \nplanning.  The RMP regulations require the owner or operator of a stationary \nsource to analyze the offsite impacts due to an accidental release of a regulated \nsubstance.  The offsite consequence analysis for a Program 3 process must \nanalyze the worst-case release scenario and an alternative release scenario.  \nSince Sun Pacifics ammonia-based refrigeration system is considered a \nProgram 3 process, both release scenarios were evaluated in the offsite \nconsequence analysis.\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis must include an estimate of the residential \npopulation within an area potentially affected by the accidental release scenario.  \nThis area is defined as a circle with a radius equivalent to the d"

The circle \nalso defines the area in which potential environmental receptors must be \nidentified.\n\nThe worst case release is defined by the U.S. EPA as the total release of the \ncontents of the single largest vessel or pipe within 10 minutes.  For liquefied \ngases stored under pressure, the entire contents of the vessel or pipe are \nassumed to be released as a vapor.  A total vapor release is highly unlikely.  \nHowever, this standardized worst case scenario was developed for emergency \nresponse agencies to use for planning purposes.\n\nAn alternative release scenario is a release that is more likely to occur than the \nworst-case release scenario.  For Sun Pacific, the alternative release scenario \nwas selected based on the results of the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) for the \nammonia-based refrigeration system.  A credible release event with a high \ndischarge rate would potentially have the greatest offsite impact.  A failure of one \nof the pump seals was identified in the PHA as having a medium probability of \noccurrence with a possible high discharge rate, and therefore, was chosen as the \nalternative release scenario.    \n\nSun Pacific has analyzed the offsite consequences of the worst-case and \nalternative release scenarios.   For the worst-case release scenario, the release \nof 21,000 lbs. of ammonia over a 10 minutes period within the engine room, the \nplume would travel 1.2 miles at concentrations at or above the endpoint.  Using \n1990 Census data, the population potentially affected within the worst-case \nrelease scenario circle is 48 persons.  There were no sensitive receptors or \nenvironmental receptors within the worst case release scenario circle.\n\nIn the alternative release scenario, a failure of the pump seal was modeled as a \nrelease of liquefied ammonia stored under pressure.  For a release of 580 lb/min \nof anhydrous ammonia within the engine room, the model calculated tha"

There were also no sensitive receptors or environmental receptors \nwithin the alternative release scenario circle. \n\nThe ammonia refrigeration equipment, except for the evaporative condensers, is \nlocated within a building, which would greatly reduce the impact of a release.  \nThe modeling performed as part of this offsite consequence analysis includes a \nmitigation factor which assumes that the release is within an enclosed space, in \ndirect contact with the outside air.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific \nPrevention Steps\n\nA PSM program, which meets the requirements of the general accidental release \nprevention program, has been developed at Sun Pacific to address the \nanhydrous ammonia system.
