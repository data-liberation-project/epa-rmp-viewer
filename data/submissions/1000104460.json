Safety features applicable to prevention of accidental releases of regulated substances at the facility are in place to help prevent potential accidental scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human error.  \n\nE.\tFive-year Accident History \nThe Pasadena Performance Products Plant is a new facility and has not had any accidental release as provided in 40 CFR \u00a768.42 that reached beyond the property line or resulted in deaths on site, injuries or significant property damage on site, or any offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering-in-place, property damage or environmental damage since it started operations. \n\nF.\tEmergency Response Program Information \nThe Pasadena Performance Products Plant maintains a written Emergency Response Plan (ERP), which aims to protect employees, public health, and the environment (in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.38, 29 CFR 1910.119 and 40 CFR 68).  The ERP defines the steps the facility and each employee should take during an accidental release of a regulated substance, natural disasters, and terrorist threats.  The plan includes both evacuation and protective action procedures for employees not directly involved in the response, and actions to be taken by employees responsible for responding to and mitigating the release. \nThe ERP addresses all aspects of emergency response including notifying facility personnel, emergency response personnel, Harris County EMA/EMS, as well as Volunteer Fire Departments.  \nAll employees are trained in the applicable emergency response procedures. The most recent review of the ERP was done on February 4, 2023.\n\nG.\tPlanned Changes to Improve Safety \nThe Pasadena Performance Products Plant is committed to continuously improve the safe handling of the flammable mixtures in the process by implementing preventative maintenance programs, inspection programs,"

Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses in particular.\n\nHot Work Permit - Hot work permits for hot work operations conducted on or near a covered process will be issued by facility safety leaders.  The permit shall document that the fire prevention and protection requirements have been implemented prior to beginning the hot work operations; it shall indicate the date(s) authorized for hot work; and identify the object on which hot work is to be performed.  The permit will be kept on file until completion of the hot work operations.\n\nContractors - NWEP hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out.  Before any contractors are allowed to work on the Pasadena Performance Products Plant, they undergo an orientation conducted by the PSM team.  During this orientation contractors are made aware of the known potential hazards related the contractor's work, the hazards of regulated substances, the safe work procedures insisted on by NWEP, and familiarized with the Hot Work Permit Policy and the Lock Out/Tag Out Procedures used at the Pasadena Performance Products Plant.  Contractors are informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur, and this information includes evacuation routes and assembly points.  NWEP will document that the contractor has received and understands the training.\n\nChemical Specific Preventio"

Safe work practices have been developed to provide for the control of hazards during operations such as lockout/tag out; confined space entry; opening process equipment or piping; and control over entrance into a stationary source by maintenance, contractor, laboratory, or other support personnel. These safe work practices apply to employees and contractor employees.\n\nTraining - A training program is in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.

For the Pasadena Plant, it was assumed that the single pressure vessel with the largest amount of flammable mixture (Isobutane Storage Sphere V-3301) had a catastrophic failure resulting in a vapor cloud explosion (VCE).  ALOHA\u0099 (Version 5.4.7), an EPA-sponsored software tool, was used to calculate the distances to 1 psi of overpressure endpoint.  As described in the EPA Risk Management Program Guidance for Offsite Consequence Analysis, the worst-case scenario was carried out based on a release of isobutane.  Meteorological conditions for the worst-case scenario are defined in 40 CFR \u00a768.22(b) as atmospheric stability class F (stable atmosphere) and wind speed of 1.5 m/s (3.4 mi/h).  The scenario involved a release of 705 lbs/min of isobutane for a 1-hour duration for a total release of 42,215 lbs.\nb.\tAlternative Case scenarios:\nAn alternative case scenario considered a loading hose failure on the Butane Truck loading rack resulting in a vapor cloud fire. Butane was selected as the predominant regulated component of the mixture, as it resulted in a greater distance to the lower flammable limit (LFL) endpoint.  ALOHA\u0099 was used to predict a distance of 0.12 miles to the LFL endpoint, with a wind speed of 3 m/s and a stability class D with ambient air temperature (77\u00b0F).  Meteorological conditions were given in the ALOHA\u0099 program and followed the methodology described in section 10 of the EPA Risk Management Program Guidance for Offsite Consequence Analysis.

The Pasadena Performance Products Plant has established a commitment to worker and public safety as well as the environment. This commitment is demonstrated by the release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at the facility. It is NWEP's policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. If a release does occur, regular personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release. Also, NWEP has coordinated response activities with the Harris County EMA and local Fire and Rescue Departments.\n\nB.\tThe stationary source and regulated substances handled:\nThe Pasadena Performance Products Plant is an alkylate production plant. The facility is located in an industrial area of Harris County in Pasadena, Texas. \nThe facility includes a two phase process consisting of a dimerization process and an alkylation process to convert ethylene to alkylate, a gasoline additive.  The capacity of the facility is 28,000 barrels/day of alkylate.  Raw materials and a catalyst will be fed into a dimerization process where the dimerization of ethylene to butenes occurs in a liquid phase reactor loop.  The heavy and light ends are removed and stored while the butene is sent to the alkylation phase.  Residue gas from this phase will be sent to a thermal oxidation device.\nIn the alkylation phase, the butenes, isobutane and a sulfuric acid catalyst are reacted to form alkylate.  The alkylate product is a mixture of gasoline boiling range hydrocarbons that can be blended with the gasoline pool to increase the gasoline octane and reduce the vapor pressure.\nThe facilit"
