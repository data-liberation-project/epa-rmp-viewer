The regulated substance handled by this facility is chlorine, which is considered hazardous by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA).\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is to smelt aluminum from alumina and produce cast aluminum billets and ingots.  Chlorine is used to remove impurities from molten aluminum prior to casting the metal into forms; this process is called fluxing and it occurs in the cast-house furnaces and SNIF units.  Chlorine is stored in and used from 2000 lb cylinders.  The maximum quantity of chlorine that can be stored or handled at this facility is 30,000 pounds.\n\n\n1.2 ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION & EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\nGoldendale Aluminum Company is committed to preventing accidental releases.  The facility has developed a set of safe operating procedures for each task involving hazardous materials.  Operations and maintenance personnel train on these procedures.\n\nGoldendale Aluminum Company has established an Emergency Response policy and plan.  The plan has been developed so that employees and outside responders will know how to correctly and quickly respond to unplanned releases of hazardous materials and incidents.  The plan includes information on how to respond to d"

Goldendale Aluminum regularly holds training exercises with outside responders from the Klickitat County Rural Fire District #7 and other agencies.\n\n\n1.3 WORST-CASE & ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\nThe worst case release scenario for chlorine is the failure of one of the 2000 pound capacity storage cylinders.  The cylinder is assumed to leak out its contents over a ten minute period.  No active safety devices (excess flow valves, etc.) are allowed to stop the release during the worst case scenario.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for chlorine involves a leak in the line which conveys gaseous chlorine from the chlorine evaporator system to the cast-house area.  This release could be caused by mechanical impact to the piping, although the pipe is well protected and located away from normal vehicle traffic areas.  The release is assumed to be at the maximum rate allowed by the excess flow valves installed in the system, i.e., 10 lb/min.  It is further assumed that the release can be shut off within 2.5 minutes.\n\n\n1.4 GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM & \nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\nGoldendale Aluminum designs, builds, maintains, and operates its chlorine system in accordance with industry standards and all applicable regulations.  Goldendale follows the recommended practices of the Chlorine Institute on its chlorine system.  \n\n\n1.5 FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nOn April 14th, 1997, Goldendale Aluminum has an accidental release of approximately 15 pounds of chlorine from its facility.   The release caused two injuries to plant workers and approximately $500 in property damage.  No off-site injuries of damage was discovered or reported.\n\nThe release was caused by equipment failure; poor operating instructions and unsuitable equipment were identified as contributing factors.  Operating instructions and control equipment in the chlorine system were improved sho"
