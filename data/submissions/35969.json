Energetics are explosives, propellants, pyrotechnics, and specialty chemicals, including their immediately related component applications such as rocket and missile propulsion units; warheads; mines; gun projectiles and propelling charges; and cartridge actuated and propellant actuated devices.  The facility's scope of capabilities allow for the efficient use of specialized expertise and expensive facilities required for research and development, scale-up, manufacture, and test of energetics\n\n\n\nCovered Processes\n\n\n\nThe facility has two nitration plants that produce various nitrate esters.  The nitration processes conducted by the plants differ slightly from each other, but both require mixed acid.  The main component of mixed acid is oleum, or fuming sulfuric acid.  Oleum is listed in the Clean Air Act of 1990, Section 112(r) as a toxic substance.  Both plants store oleum as a component of mixed acid in excess of the 10,000 pound threshold.  There are three mixed acid storage tanks in a diked area at building 781, three mixed acid storage tanks in a dike at building 3019, and finally two mixed acid storage tanks inside building 786. \n\n\n\nCovered Process 1:  Storage, Bldg. 781\n\nProgram Level:  3\n\nCovered Chemical:  Oleum, CAS 8014-95-7\n\nMaximum Quantity:  418,535 lb\n\n\n\nCovered Process 2: Storage, Bldg. 3019\n\nProgram Level: 3\n\nCovered Chemical:  Oleum, CAS 8014-95-7\n\nMaximum Quantity:  100,426 lb\n\n\n\nCovered Process 3:  Storage, Bldg. 786\n\nProgram Level:  1\n\nCovered Chemical:  Oleum, CAS 8014-95-7\n\nMaximum Quantity:  40,974 lb\n\n\n\n5 Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThe facility has had no accidents involving a covered process in the last five years.\n\n\n\nPrevention Program Overview\n\n\n\nThe following paragraphs present an overview of the facility's Risk Managemen"

The program is applicable to all covered processes at the facility. \n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\nThe material safety data sheet (MSDS) supplies the required safety information.  The Safety Department and the responsible office keep the MSDS.  Also, the cognizant office has the applicable piping and control diagrams.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\n\n\nThe facility has a process hazard analysis (PHA) for the covered storage tanks.  The PHA identified tank overfilling, valve problems, tank truck interface problems and supply line failures as the most likely causes of an accidental release.  Recommendations derived from the PHA have been incorporated into the process to eliminate or reduce the chance of an accidental release.  A hazard analysis is required for new explosive processes, facilities, and equipment; processes that have changed significantly; and processes that have not operated in the previous 2 years.  PHAs are conducted in accordance with MIL-STD-882 and Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) OP-5 Ammunition and Explosives Safety Ashore.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nOperating procedures for the processing and handling of hazardous materials explicitly describe tasks to be performed and operating conditions to be maintained while performing specific processes.  The standard operating procedures (SOPs) include step-by-step process instructions, a hazardous material list, a safety equipment list, emergency response and contingency plans, and a hazard control briefing (HCB).  HCBs list and explain the hazards that may be encountered while performing the SOP, measures to avoid or minimize exposure to those hazards, symptoms that indicate unacceptable exposure to those hazards, and remedial actions required upon unacceptable exposure to those hazards.  HCBs are also presented to operating personnel prior to the start of a new operation, monthly for on-going operations, and when the SOP is changed.  SOPs also include a worker's statement that operating pers"

SOP changes are reviewed for safety and environmental issues and are approved by the Safety Department head.  Minor process changes encompass all other situations and can be approved by the cognizant department head. \n\n\n\nAll active SOPs are reviewed annually and must be re-approved every 4 years.  If an SOP is not re-approved within 4 years, the SOP becomes inactive.  Inactive SOPs are withdrawn from the operating area and all operations performed under that SOP are stopped until it is re-approved.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\n\n\nThis facility operates a personnel qualification/certification process in accordance with NAVSEA instruction 8020.9, \"Ammunition and Explosives Personnel Qualification and Certification Program\".  Personnel that come into contact with ammunition and explosives during the performance of a task, including the maintenance of processing equipment, must be certified to perform those tasks.  Personnel are eligible for certification when they have met qualifications such as demonstrating the skill and ability to perform tasks in a particular certification area.  The qualification requirement is documented as a proficiency demonstration using SOPs. There is a qualification/certification board that evaluates and recommends personnel for certification.\n\n\n\nThere are 2 levels of certification - team member (TM) and team leader (TL).  The TM level is the minimum level and applies in all normal operating certification areas.  The TL certification level applies in a specific certification area and allows the TL certified personnel to perform tasks independently and perform as process supervisor.

One outlines the procedures for investigating explosive incidents and another outlines the procedures for investigating personnel injuries and illnesses.  In both circumstances, near misses are treated as incidents and are therefore investigated.  The facility investigates and reports mishaps per Chief of Naval Operations instructions  (OPNAVINST) 5100.23 and 5102.1.  \n\n\n\nExplosive incidents include inadvertent detonations, arming, and launches, malfunctions, material and equipment defects, calibration failures, and near-miss incidents.  Mishaps involving explosive support equipment are covered by the same investigation procedures.  The Safety Department performs an immediate investigation to assess the nature and degree of the mishap and the safety of the accident area.  Within 24 hours of the incident, the cognizant division director must prepare an investigation report for the Safety Department.  The Commander approves process restart when personnel injury is involved or the damage exceeds $10,000.  The Safety Department approves restart when no injuries are involved and the damage is less than $10,000.  The cognizant department head must address the findings of the investigations.  The Safety Department must prepare a summary of lessons learned that can be incorporated into employee training.  Recommended corrective actions are entered into a deficiency abatement log maintained by the Safety Department.  Progress on corrective actions is monitored quarterly.\n\n\n\nThe Safety Department and the supervisor of the personnel involved investigate occupational fatalities, injuries, illnesses, and near-miss incidents and prepare a report of the incident.
