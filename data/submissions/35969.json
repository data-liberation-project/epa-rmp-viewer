In both circumstances, near misses are treated as incidents and are therefore investigated.  The facility investigates and reports mishaps per Chief of Naval Operations instructions  (OPNAVINST) 5100.23 and 5102.1.  \r\n\r\nExplosive incidents include inadvertent detonations, arming, and launches, malfunctions, material and equipment defects, calibration failures, and near-miss incidents.  Mishaps involving explosive support equipment are covered by the same investigation procedures.  The Safety Department performs an immediate investigation to assess the nature and degree of the mishap and the safety of the accident area.  Within 24 hours of the incident, the cognizant division director must prepare an investigation report for the Safety Department.  The Commander approves process restart when personnel injury is involved or the damage exceeds $10,000.  The Safety Department approves restart when no injuries are involved and the damage is less than $10,000.  The cognizant department head must address the findings of the investigations.  The Safety Department must prepare a summary of lessons learned that can be incorporated into employee training.
