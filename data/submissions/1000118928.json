This Risk Management Plan (RMP) covers the Refinery Grade Propylene (propylene) railcar offloading/loading process including four (4) railcar offloading/loading spots, a vapor compressor, liquid pump, flow meters, piping and appurtenances, and track space to store a maximum of 86 RGP railcars. RGP is offloaded into and loaded from DOT regulated onsite pipeline breakout tanks (not regulated by RMP). \n\nThe RGP railcar offloading/loading process was constructed in accordance with National Fire Protection Association Code 58 (NFPA 58 - Liquefied Petroleum Gas Code) and it is the Facility's policy to follow the most current future editions to the extent feasible and adhere to all applicable Federal, State, and Local codes/laws. In addition, BOSTO complies with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Accident Prevention Rules (40 CFR Part 68 Subpart D), the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard and associated 14 elements (29 CFR Part 1910.119), and all applicable state and local laws and regulations.\n\nThis facility has not had an accident involving RGP which has resulted in deaths, injuries, property/environmental damage, evacuations or sheltering in place.\n\nBOSTCO maintains an Emergency Response Action Plan (ERAP) that includes response actions related to the propylene process. Employees are adequately trained and prepared to respond to emergencies. Training includes Emergency Response (HAZMAT), Emergency Action and Fire Prevention, Accidental Release Prevention, Environmental Awareness, and Terminal Safety Systems. Emergency Response Team (ERT) members also attend fire school at the Refinery Terminal Fire Company in Corpus Christi, TX. \n\nFinally, the facility prepares for emergencies by conducting quarterly notification drills, annual exercises, and p"
