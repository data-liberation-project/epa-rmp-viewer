The Mitchell WTF utilizes its Risk Management Program to identify ways to reduce its use of hazardous materials and minimize potential risks to its employees, the community, and environment.\n\n\n\nThe City of Mitchell WTF will comply with applicable safety, health, and environmental regulations; identify, report, and promptly correct unsafe conditions; train personnel to safely perform their job duties; and work to maintain a safe workplace.\n\n\n\nDescription of Stationary and Substance Handled\n\n\n\nThe City of Mitchell WTF has implemented a Level 2 Risk Management Program to prevent the accidental release of chlorine from it's plant at 2800 North Mains St in Mitchell, South Dakota.  At this location, the City of Mitchell operates a water treatment facility to provide safe potable drinking water to the citizens of Mitchell.   Chlorine is used to reduce the pathogenic (disease causing) bacteria and viruses to below the maximum contaminant level s set forth in the Safe Drinking Water Act.  Chlorine can be stored in quantities that exceed EPA's regulatory threshold.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nThe City of Mitchell relies on several safeguards as part of its accidental release prevention program.  The City of Mitchell designers and suppliers use recognized design codes and standards for the equipment and system components; standard operating procedures specify safe practices used at the plant; a maintenance program establishes proper testing, calibration, and cleaning procedures.  Also hazard communication occurs frequently between management, operators, and employees during the process safety information review, training, safety briefings, and the annual program review. \n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History"
