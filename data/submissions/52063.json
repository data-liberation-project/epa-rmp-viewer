Each step is analyzed to \nidentify potential hazards that may cause an injury.  Safe work practices are then \nidentified to prevent the potential injury identified while the work is performed.\n\nThe Valero Star Team consists of hourly employees.  The purpose of this \ncommittee is to provide direction and evaluation of the Refinery safety programs, \nreview incidents, make operational or internal program evaluations.\nAny employee can contact a committee member to have their safety issue discussed\nat the next meeting.\n\n\n  2.0 Process Safety Information\n\nAt Valero, many written documents are available which provide guidance on how to \nsafely operate the various processes within the refinery. The documents related to \nprocess safety information are utilized for training of employees and contractors to \nidentify and understand the hazards associated with each process.  The documents are \nalso utilized as a resource when conducting process hazards analyses, and are\nutilized as a reference during unit operations.\n\nThis documentation consists of information pertaining to:\n\n * Chemical hazards\n * Process technology\n * Equipment in the process\n\nThe written documentation for chemical hazards is addressed through the use of \nMaterial Safety Data Sheets (MSDSs) for both purchased and refinery made hazardous \nmaterials.

New employees receive basic safety and process operator \ntraining before being assigned to a process area.  The basic training consist of \nclassroom lectures, videos, hands-on process training on live process models and \ntesting of all course material.  Safety and health training is also provided by\nreviewing and testing in-plant safety and health guidelines.  After successfully \ncompleting the basic training, a new operator is assigned to a process unit and\npaired-up with an experienced operator until certification is completed for that\nunit.  \n\nExperienced operators periodically receive refresher training to ensure that\nknowledge is maintained at an acceptable level"
