Therefore, it is the policy of Sinclair to conduct all of its activities in a safe, healthful, and workmanlike manner; to prevent injury or illness to persons; and prevent damage to property and equipment. Sinclair's policy is to establish on-the-job safety and health as a way of life and as a way of thinking, and to comply with all local, state, and federal laws regarding health, welfare, and safety of employees and the public.\nAll on-the-job injuries/illness can be prevented. Prevention of all on-the-job injuries/illness is a realistic goal.\nNo task shall be undertaken until adequate safeguards have been provided to protect every involved employee from injury due to recognized hazards. Where it is not reasonable or practical to eliminate the sources of possible injury, measures must be taken to use safe procedures, guards, safety devices, and protective clothing. No matter what the exposure, an effective safeguard can be provided.  All employees have the responsibility for safety of themselves and others and must be aware of and follow established safety and health rules, regulations, or procedures.\nThe line organization has the responsibility for every operational activity of the company. Each first-line supervisor must accept the responsibility for the safety and health of their employees and must assure that no employee is given a job assignment without first determining that the employee can perform his or her duty under safe conditions.\nOnly when supervisors and employees, together, give safety the attention it must have to avoid injuries, on and off the job, can the future well be"

Any violation of this policy will result in disciplinary action up to and including termination.\n\nPresident, Oil Division\nMarch 17, 1997\n\nCorporate Philosophy for Process Safety Management \n\nSinclair Oil Corporation will work proactively to provide a safe workplace for each employee and continue to promote safety practices among employees for their health and welfare.  This will be accomplished at all facilities by actively assuring wide employee participation in a thorough Process Safety Management program and complete safety training.\n\nThe Process Safety Management program will be managed by a corporate team, but completed on a facility basis under the specific direction of the facility manager.  The program will conform to OSHA regulations contained in 29 CFR Part 1910.  Sinclair Oil Corporation has devoted the leadership, manpower, and capital investment necessary to complete the program by May 1997.\nSinclair Oil Corporation will update the Safety Management Program every five years thereafter.  Emphasis will be  placed on managing the higher risk areas of our facilities first, the priority of which will be established by each facility team.\n\nStatement of the Sinclair Tulsa Refinery\n\nThe Management of the Sinclair Tulsa Refinery recognizes and firmly believes in the need for a safe environment for both the refinery and the local community.  Our policy is to ensure that our efforts with prevention-through planning, training, reasonable process controls, timely maintenance, and communication with our neighbors-will help us prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  If a release does occur, however, our trained personnel, in conjunction with trained personnel from the community, will respond to control and contain the release.\n\nDefinition of Processes and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Sinclair Tulsa Refinery operates a variety of petroleum refining process to produce propane, propylene, butanes, butylene, gasol"

The NAICS code for the Sinclair Tulsa Refinery refinery is 32411 and must meet the requirements of  Risk Management Plan (RMP) Program Level 3.\n\nThe RMP rule defines a process as \"Any activity involving a  regulated substance, including any use, storage, manufacturing, handling, or on-site movement of such substances, or combination of these activities.  For the purposes of this definition, any group of vessels that are interconnected, or separate vessels that are located such that a regulated substance could be involved in a potential release, shall be considered a single process\" (re: 40 CFR 68.3).\n\nPer the RMP definition, the Sinclair Tulsa Refinery has the following RMP regulated flammables in its processes:\n\n                        Pentane\n                        Butane/Isobutane\n                        Butene\n                        Propane\n                        Propene\n                        Ethane\n                        Methane\n\nOf the above substances, only Butane, Isobutane, Propane and Propene meet the RMP threshold quantity level for flammables.\n\nThe Sinclair Tulsa Refinery also has the following regulated toxics in its processes:\n\n                        Hydrogen Sulfide\n                        Sulfur Dioxide\n\nThe maximum on site quantities of Hydrogen Sulfide and Sulfur Dioxide do not exceed 10,000 pounds and 5,000 pounds, respectively.  Therefore, these compounds do not meet RMP threshold levels.

The maximum quantity of C4 Mixture onsite at any time is estimated to be 20,400,000 pounds.  This estimate is based upon the total storage capacity of C4 Mixture with an allowance for process piping volume and material in process.\n\n   C3 Mixture:The maximum quantity of propane onsite at any time is 1,940,000 pounds. This estimate is based upon the total storage capacity of C3 Mixture with an allowance for process piping volume and material in process.\n\nHazard Assessment Results\n\nThe Sinclair Tulsa Refinery has no toxic substances onsite that meet the threshold requirements for\ncoverage.  However, we are tracking both H2S and S02 internally to ensure that our prevention and safety programs adequately cover potential releases. \n\nWorst Case Scenario-Flammables:  The worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with the flammable substances is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) involving the full inventory of the largest tank containing C4 Mixture. Tank 218 has a capacity of 13,750 barrels and is also the closest tank to an offsite receptor.  For the WCS, the full tank inventory of 2,900,000 pounds is assumed to release, completely vaporize and ignite, resulting in a VCE.  The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this WCS is 1.1 miles (as calculated by RMP*Comp).  Although Sinclair Tulsa Refinery has numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, we took no credit for passive mitigation measures in evaluating the WCS.  It is important to note the WCS is based upon the simultaneous occurrence of several highly unlikely events, therefore the probably of the WCS actually occurring is extremely low. \n\nAlternative Release Scenario-Flammables:  The alternative release scenario (ARS) for flammable substances at the Sinclair Tulsa Refinery is based upon the failure of a flexible hose used to load propene into tank trucks.  For this scenario, the quantity of propen"

As with the WCS, we assumed all liquid would vaporize and ignite resulting in a VCE.  The distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this event is 0.2 mile (as calculated by RMP*Comp).\n\n5-Year Accident History\nThe Sinclair Tulsa Refinery has not had any RMP-defined accidents. While releases have been documented, none have been of threshold substances, nor have these releases had offsite consequences. After each release, we investigated what happened, recorded the recommendations, and made changes to our processes, procedures, or safety systems to mitigate and eliminate future problems. \nAccident Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nThe Sinclair Tulsa Refinery has instituted and maintains a process safety management (PSM) program for preventing or minimizing the consequences of catastrophic releases of toxic, reactive, flammable or explosive chemicals.  While the following sections are required and practiced for process safety management, Sinclair Tulsa Refinery has other programs and practices (i.e. lock out/tag out, etc.) which add to the operational safety of the refinery.\n\nEmployees participate in all aspects of process safety management by being members of the process hazard analysis team for new installations or procedures, members of the prestartup safety review team and being a member of incident investigations.  Employees participate in development and review of operating procedures and by suggesting and becoming knowledgeable of changes in their respective areas of responsibilities (management of change).  Process safety information, Material Safety Data Sheets and mechanical equipment data is available to all employees.  Employees are trained and refreshed on the use of hot work permits (as well as lockout/tagout, confined space entry, opening process equipment, line opening and blinding, control of entrance/exit of units, Hazmat a"

A hazards communication program and laboratory chemical hygiene plan informs employees and contractors of the chemical hazards to which they may be exposed and the measures that need to be taken to protect them.  The engineering records and operating manuals provide maximum intended inventories, safe upper and lower operating limits, evaluation of consequences of deviation, materials of construction, piping and instrumentation diagrams, electrical area classifications, relief systems design and design basis, ventilation systems, design codes and standards, energy and material balances, and safety systems.\n\nProcess hazards analysis has been performed on all applicable processes by the hazard and operability study method.  This structured approach uses process parameters such as flow, temperature, pressure, etc. to examine impact of deviations.  Out of each analysis comes recommendations for controls or changes.  New facilities are subjected to this analysis before operation.\n\nWritten operating procedures are in place to provide clear instruction for all aspects of operations of the refinery.  These procedures cover any type of operation on each unit, including anything from normal operation to startup procedures to emergency shutdown to partial operation of a unit.\n\nTraining is provided to all operations employees covering their job functions working on the process units.  Initial training requires a program of classroom and on-the-job training which takes a four step progression of levels of certification.  A written and/or performance test is given at completion of the four levels and progression to the next level can not take place without the approval of the supervisor.  Beyond the initial training, refresher training is continually provided which allows recertification of all operators every three years.\n\nContractor's safety is monitored and when performing maintenance and repa"

Sinclair Tulsa Refinery evaluates each contractor's safety performance.  Each contractor must provide safety policies and programs, injury and illness performance reports and training records before performing work.  Safety orientation is provided before starting work to inform contractor's employees of all the safety programs practices which must ne followed inside the refinery.\n\nBefore starting up any new unit or significantly modified unit, a pre-startup safety review is held.  This constitutes a final checklist for the process prior to startup.  In some instances designed safety elements have been eliminated, not constructed properly or just missed because of economic considerations.  The review ensures that all safety considerations have been built and are operable before the unit actually starts. \n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe Sinclair Tulsa Refinery has written an Emergency Response Plan to set in action if an emergency takes place.  The refinery has its own Emergency Response Team that can respond to any Fire, Rescue, Spill or Vapor Release.  The Emergency Response Team receives specialized training enabling them to handle industrial type emergencies.  Each Emergency Response Team member can be reached 24 hours a day in the event of an emergency by electronic pager.  If an emergency should occur the  Refinery operates under the Incident Command type system along with having its own 800 MHZ two-way radio that is programmed to the LEPC ( Fire Department) radio frequency.  With these two items in place the refinery can establish quick communication with the  Fire Department for aid and public notification if the emergency warrants.  In addition the  Fire Department is given periodic walk through tours of the refinery to familiarize themselves with the specific areas of the plant along with reviewing the different types of emergenc"
