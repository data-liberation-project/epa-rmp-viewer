Station\nI.\tAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response NuStar\nSunoco is committed to the safety of our employees, surrounding community, and the environment and the McPherson, KS. Station achieved OSHA VPP Star status on January 20, 2012 and recertified on March 4, 2015 and again on January 27, 2020. It is NuStar\u0092s policy to comply with all federal, state, and local laws as well as accepted industry practice for the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia, butane, propane and other liquefied petroleum gases. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of the facility.\n\nII.\tDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances \nThe McPherson Station was built and put into service in 1974. The Butane addition was added to the station in 2007. The facility was built to store and transport butane (RMP regulated substance), refined products and a Liquid Mixture (LM) of the two products. The butane, refined products and the LM are delivered, via an 8\u0094 and an 10\u0094 pipeline, to the McPherson Station from the Sunoco Terminals in Augusta and El Dorado, KS. The 1,680,000 lbs. of butane, which exceeds the 10,000 lbs. threshold quantity (TQ) of the OSHA PSM requirements, is stored in, one of four, pressurized bullet tanks. The LM is stored in one the pressurized bullet tanks. The butane is transferred out of the station via pipelines to other Sunoco Terminals downstream. \n\nIII.\tGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps. The NuStar McPherson, KS. Station will continue to address the RMP release prevention program with the following elements. \n\u0095\tTraining: Employees are trained in the safe handling of all products stored at the facility and are trained in appropriate emergency actions required tin response to a potential release.
