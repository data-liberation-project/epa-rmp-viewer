The\nRMP  is  required under the U.S. Environmental Protection  Agency\n(EPA)  Risk  Management Program codified in 40  Code  of  Federal\nRegulations,  Part  68  (40  CFR 68).   Refining  operations  are\nprimarily  conducted in Areas 1 and 2, which  are  on  contiguous\nproperties.  BRC also has delayed coking operations  in  Area  3,\nwhich is not adjacent to Areas 1 and 2.  A separate RMP submittal\nhas been prepared for Area 3.\n\nThe  purpose  of  the  RMP  program is to  identify  and  prevent\npotential  accidental releases of specific \"regulated substances\"\nthat  have  the  potential to cause harm to the  public  and  the\nenvironment.   \"Regulated  substances\"  are  hazardous  chemicals\nidentified  by  EPA.   Because  BRC  has  quantities  of  various\n\"regulated  substances\" above a threshold amount,  this  RMP  has\nbeen prepared.\n\nThe remainder of the Executive Summary is organized as follows:\n\n     Section 1:  Accidental  Release  Prevention  and  Emergency\n                 Response Policies at BRC\n     Section 2:  Overview of Regulated Substances at BRC\n     Section 3:  Worst  Case  Release Scenarios and  Alternative\n                 Release Scenarios\n     Section 4:  BRC Accidental Release Prevention Program\n     Section 5:  Five-Year Accidental Release Summary\n     Section 6:  Emergency Response Program\n     \n\n\nSection   1:     Accidental  Release  Prevention  and   Emergency\nResponse Policies at BRC\n\nEquipment  at  the various BRC units must be designed,  operated,\nand  maintained  in  full  compliance  with  applicable  internal\nengineering  standards,  accepted  industry  codes,  or  i"

The  results  of  the\nanalyses are used to assist the Kern County Environmental  Health\nServices Department and Fire Department in its emergency response\nplanning.\n\n\n3.1  Worst-Case Scenarios\n\nBRC  conducted  offsite consequence analyses for  the  worst-case\nscenarios (WCS) using the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA)\nRMP   Offsite  Consequence  Analysis  Guidelines  (OCAG).    This\nmethodology  was  used because the RMP rule  set  forth  specific\ncriteria  that  must  be  followed for  modeling  the  worst-case\nscenarios.   The  worst  case  scenarios  must  incorporate  very\nconservative,  simplified assumptions about  the  nature  of  the\nreleases and the resulting emission rates into the air.\n\nThe  EPA has defined the worst-case release scenario as one  that\nresults in the greatest distance from the point of release  to  a\nspecified  \"endpoint\".  As defined by the rule, the endpoint  for\ntoxics   substances  is  a  specified  concentration,   and   for\nflammables  is  a  specified  overpressure  from  a  vapor  cloud\nexplosion (VCE).\n\nThe  worst-case scenario for a regulated toxic is one  where  the\ntotal quantity in the largest vessel or pipe is released over  10\nminutes,  resulting  in  acute  health  effects  associated  with\nairborne  exposure.   For a regulated flammable,  the  worst-case\nscenario  is one where the total quantity of regulated  flammable\nin  the  largest  vessel  or  pipe is  assumed  to  vaporize  and\ninstantaneously result in a vapor cloud explosion.\n\nA  summary of the worst-case scenarios for BRC Areas 1 and  2  is\nprovided  in  Table 2.  As required by the RMP rule, the  results\nare  shown  for one vessel containing a toxic substance (ammonia)\nand  one  vessel containing flammables.  These scenarios produced\nthe  greatest  distance to their respective toxic  and  flammable\nendpoints.\n\n                              \n                             Table 2\n            Worst-Case Scenario Results - BRC Areas "

Under this program, each process is  systematically\nexamined  by  a multi-disciplinary team to identify hazards  that\ncould  result  in an accidental release of a regulated  substance\nand  to ensure that adequate control is in place to manage  those\nhazards.    BRC  has  used  the  hazard  and  operability   study\nmethodology  as  the refinery's primary process hazards  analysis\ntechnique.   Some  of the revalidation has been  done  using  the\n\"what  if\"  and risk matrix methodologies.  Pertinent parameters,\nsuch  as  flow,  temperature, pressure, and  liquid  level,  were\nreviewed.\n\nTo  help  ensure that the process controls or process hazards  do\nnot   deviate  significantly  from  the  original  design  safety\nfeatures,  BRC updates and revalidates the hazard analyses  every\nfive years.\n\nAs  part of the technical studies, BRC conducted a seismic review\nof  the  refinery.  The refinery is located in an  area  that  is\nprone to earthquakes.  A walk through was conducted in 1996 by  a\nqualified  engineering company (EQE).  The objective  of  seismic\nassessments was to provide reasonable assurance that a release of\nregulated  substance having off-site consequence would not  occur\nas a result of a major earthquake.
