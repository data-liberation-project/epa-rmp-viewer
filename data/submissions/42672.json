      "SummaryText": "Facility Background and Corporate Commitment to Safety\n\nAt the San Pedro facility we handle butane and propane, both of which are recognized by the EPA as regulated, flammable substances.  The same properties that make butane and propane valuable as a fuel also make it necessary to practice certain safety precautions in their handling to prevent leaks, spills and accidents.  First and foremost in our operations are the efforts undertaken to ensure employee and contractor safety while on site as well as minimize the risk exposure for the surrounding communities.  It is our company policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state and local rules and regulations.\n\nAs a corporation, AmeriGas staffs a professional Safety Department at our Corporate Headquarters in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania.  AmeriGas also has eight Regional Logistics Managers, a Terminal Operations Manager, a Safety and Technology Manager and a Supply and Logistics Safety Manager strategically located throughout the United States. These safety professionals are able to immediately respond to a serious incident and provide technical expertise to emergency response agencies as needed at the scene of the incident.  AmeriGas also maintains an around the clock Emergency Communications Center, which handles all after-hours and emergency calls from around the country.  Located in Rocklin, California yes, this is the correct location, the ECC has the ability to contact AmeriGas field personnel on any type of incident encountered at any AmeriGas location or by AmeriGas customers.   \n\nThe primary purpose of the facility is to store and distribute butane and propane to wholesale customers.  Butane is received and/or distributed to customers by pipeline, railcar, ship or transport trucks.  Butane is stored in two refrigerated storage tanks, each bulk tank having a nominal capacity of 13 million gallons.  In addition, butane is also stored in two smaller horizontal vessels, each with a nominal capacity of 60,000"

Propane is received and/or distributed to customers via railcar or transport truck and is stored in three horizontal tanks, each having a nominal capacity of 60,000 gallons.  The facility is equipped to load or offload ships, railcars and transport trucks as needed.  Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, management personnel and contractors.\n\nThe facility is connected by pipeline to a dock in the Port of Los Angeles and currently loads 2 to 6 ships per year with butane for export.\n\nThe maximum amount of butane that can be stored on site is 120 millions pounds.  For propane, the maximum inventory that can be stored on site is 640,000 pounds.\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Policies and Practices\n\nThe site and the company continually strive to improve operations performance including the prevention of incidents, injuries and releases at the facility.  Primary elements of this continuous improvement effort include making capital improvements to the facility as required, maintaining up to date procedures and continual training of personnel in both regulatory and job specific subject matter.  The integrity and reliability of major equipment, including pumps, compressors, pipelines and storage tanks is assured through periodic inspection and preventive maintenance practices.  The chemicals handled do not present significant internal corrosion hazards and corrosion to external surfaces of pipelines and storage tanks is minimized via extensive inspection and painting programs.  \n\nAs important as those previously mentioned items are, the site is also equipped with modern leak detection systems comprised of Ultraviolet (UV) and Infrared (IR) fire detection sensors that alert personnel should a leak and fire occur.  These sensors are located at strategic points throughout the facility and work in conjunction with shutdown systems and emergency response equipment also installed on site.  Shutdown systems include automatic positive shutoff"

In addition, a continuously operating flare is in service on site to minimize gas emissions to the atmosphere during normal and upset conditions.\n\nThis distribution and storage facility is subject to and abides by OSHA?s Process Safety Management (PSM) rule for sites handling hazardous chemicals.  In addition, the site complies with EPA?s Accidental Release Prevention Rule and all other applicable federal, state and local codes and regulations, including California?s requirements for seismic activity study and design.  When built, this facility was designed in accordance with NFPA-58.  \n\nAll of our AmeriGas transport drivers have been thoroughly trained using the National Propane Gas Association?s (NPGA) Certified Employee Training Program (CETP).\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nThis facility has not had an accident or release meeting RMP criteria within the last five years.\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe emergency response plan for this facility includes procedures for notification of the local fire, law enforcement and medical organizations, as well as notification of any potentially affected neighbors.  The plan is reviewed periodically to ensure that it remains up-to-date, reflecting current activities on site and employees are trained on their responsibilities in an emergency to ensure prompt response should a situation arise.  This facility?s emergency response program is based upon the following guidelines and standards:\n\n1) NPGA LP-Gas Safety Handbooks:  Guidelines for Developing Plant Emergency Procedures and How To Control LP-Gas Leaks and Fires.\n2) OSHA?s Occupational Safety and Health Standards for General Industry, specifically: 29 CFR 1910.38, ?Emergency Action Pla"

In addition, the odorant injection system was upgraded in order to significantly reduce fugitive emissions and minor leaks, thereby reducing odor complaints.  In the future, the site plans to replace existing truck rack loading arms in order to further reduce fugitive gas emissions.  Upgrades to the site?s UV/IR fire detection and its gas detection systems are also planned to improve leak detection response time and system reliability."
