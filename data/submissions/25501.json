              "Description": "The Prevention Program ensures that regulated substances are safely stored, used, and handled. In addition, if a chemical release occurs, the Prevention Program ensures that procedures and equipment are established to detect and mitigate the impact of such a release. The completion of Occupational Safety\nand Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) requirements essentially satisfies the 112(r) Prevention Program requirements for the NH3 in the refrigeration process. Specifically, Heinz - KOP has performed or developed the following for the affected process. \n\nProcess safety information: Heinz - KOP compiled written process safety information that is completed prior to conducting any process hazard analysis required by the rule. This written information enables Heinz - KOP and the employees involved in operating the process to identify and understand the hazards posed by those processes involving regulated substances. Minimum information includes hazard data such as that found on a Material Safety Data Sheet, technology information, and equipment information.\n\nProcess hazard analysis: A hazard evaluation has been performed by an experienced team to identify, assess, and control the hazards involved in each of the covered areas.  The hazardous operations (hazop) and ?what if? methodology was used for determining and evaluating the hazards of the process.  The analysis addressed the hazards of the process, the identification of any previous incident that had a likely potential for catastrophic consequences, engineering and administrative controls applicable to the hazards and their interrelationships such as appropriate application of detection methodologies to provide early warning of releases, consequences of failure of engineering and administrative controls, stationary source siting, human factors, and a qualitative evaluation of a range of possible safety and health effects of failure of controls. These analyses are updated and revalidated on a five-year basis.  \n\nOperating procedures: Written procedures have been developed and implemented to provide clear instructions for safely conducting activities involved in the covered process consistent with the process safety information. Elements that are addressed include steps for each operating phase, operating limits, safety and health considerations, and safety systems and their functions. Operating procedures are readily accessible to employees who work in or maintain a process. These procedures are reviewed as often as necessary to ensure that they represent current operating practice. Annual certification helps to assure the currency and accuracy of the procedures. In addition, safe work practices, applicable to employees and Contractor employees, are developed and implemented to provide for the control of hazards during a variety of plant operations.\n\nTraining: Initial and refresher training is conducted as appropriate for each employee involved in operating the covered process. Heinz - KOP ascertains and documents that each employee has received and understood the required training. \n\nMechanical integrity: Heinz - KOP has developed a comprehensive mechanical integrity program that applies to pressure vessels and storage tanks, piping systems, relief systems and devices, emergency shutdown systems, controls, and compressors in the covered processes. Written procedures, training for process maintenance activities, inspection and testing, correction of equipment deficiencies, and quality assurance are all included in Heinz - KOP mechanical integrity program.\n\nManagement of change: Written procedures have been established and implemented to manage changes (except for \"replacements in kind\") to process chemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures; and changes to other stationary sources that affect the covered process. The procedures ensure that the technical basis for the proposed change, the impact of the change on safety and health, the modifications to operating procedures, the necessary time period for the change, and authorization requirements for the proposed change are all addressed. Appropriate employees and contractors are informed of, and trained in, the change prior to startup of the process or affected part of the process. Updates to the RMP are made if required by the nature of the change.\nPre-startup review: A pre-startup safety review is performed for any new covered processes and for significantly modified covered processes at Heinz - KOP. Such review confirms that prior to introduction of regulated substances to the process that construction and equipment is in accordance with design specifications: safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency procedures are in place and adequate. For new stationary sources, a process hazard analysis has been performed and for modified stationary sources, management of change requirements have been met; and training of each employee involved in operating a covered process has been completed.\n\nCompliance audits: Heinz - KOP evaluates compliance with the provisions of this section at least every three years to verify that the procedures and practices developed under the standard are adequate and are being followed. Heinz-KOP?s compliance audit is conducted by a team consisting of outside auditors, the Security/Safety Manager and representatives from each covered process. A report of the compliance audit findings is developed.  Heinz-KOP promptly determines and documents an appropriate response to each of the audit findings, establishes corrective actions, and documents that deficiencies have been corrected.  The two most recent audit reports are retained on file at the King of Prussia facility.\n\nIncident investigation: Heinz - KOP will investigate each incident that results in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  This investigation shall be initiated as promptly as possible, but not later than 48 hours following the incident. An incident investigation team will be established with appropriate personnel. A report, which shall be retained for five years, is prepared at the conclusion of the investigation. A system has been established to promptly address and resolve the findings and recommendations of the incident report, with documentation of resolutions and corrective actions. The report shall be reviewed with all affected personnel, including contract employees where applicable, whose job tasks are relevant to the incident findings.  \n\nEmployee participation: Heinz KOP has developed a plan of action regarding employee participation. Employees and their collective bargaining unit representatives are consulted on the conduct and development of process hazards analyses and on the development of the other elements of process safety management in the 112(r) rule. Employees and their collective bargaining unit representatives are also provided access to process hazard analyses and to all other information required under the rule.\n\nHot-work permit: Heinz KOP issues a hot-work permit for hot-work operations conducted on or near the covered process. The permit documents that the fire prevention and protection requirements in 29 CFR 1910.252(a) have been implemented prior to beginning the hot-work operations. The permit further indicates the date(s) authorized for hot work and identify the object on which the hot work is to be performed. The permit is kept on file until the hot-work operation is completed.\n\nContractors: Heinz KOP and contract-company owners and operators comply with the requirements for contractors performing maintenance or repair, turnaround, major renovation, or specialty work on or adjacent to the covered process. Contractor issues include, among other responsibilities, evaluation of past contractor safety performance and programs, and informing contractors of known potential fire, explosion, or toxic release hazards related to the contractor's work and the affected processes. \n(Note that this part of the RMP requirements does not apply to contractors providing incidental services that do not influence process safety, such as janitorial work, food and drink services, laundry, delivery or other supply services.)\nIn addition to what is required by the 112(r) rule, Heinz - KOP is prepared to prevent and mitigate accidental releases by safe process and equipment design, maintenance of equipment, operating safely, and auditing our operations. .\nProcess and Equipment Design: Backup safety systems, pressure relief valves, insulated vessels and piping, and local emergency shut down systems are used to help mitigate the potential for leaks from the affected process and equipment.\nEquipment Maintenance: Heinz - KOP has a preventive maintenance program in place along with work planning, safety checks and reviews, periodic inspections, and qualified maintenance personnel.\n\nSafe Operations: Operators of the covered processes are trained and certified. Written procedures are in place and followed by operators.\n\nOperations Auditing: Internal and independent audits of the NH3 operation are performed.",

Our workforce of approximately 250 employees is comprised of production, maintenance, plant operations, technical, clerical, and management personnel.  Many of our employees have been with us for many years.  We are proud of our facility, the quality of our products and the stability of our workforce.\n\nThe federal Accidental Release Prevention Requirements under section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act, codified 40 CFR Part 68, were written to help prevent the accidental release of extremely hazardous substances and to minimize the consequences of any such release.  All facilities with threshold quantities(TQ's) of the listed regulated acutely toxic and flammable substances are subject to these provisions.  The listed substances all have a TQ of 10,000 lbs.\n\nHNA-KOP has one chemical that meets the toxic chemical TQ, and thus, this substance must be included in a Risk Management Program.  The chemical is anhydrous ammonia (NH3).  The TQ for NH3 is 10,000 lbs.  HNA - KOP stores approximately 46,000 lbs. For use as a refrigerant in the Chef Francisco plant.  The major Clean Air Act Section112(r) requirements with which HNA-KOP must comply for use of NH3 in the refrigeration policy include:\n-Managements System development and documentation\n-Hazard Assessment for the affected process\n-Prevention Program Completion\n-Emergency Response Program coordination; and\n-Risk management plan submittal\n\nWith regards to hazard assessment, HNA-KOP has developed worst case and alternative scenarios.  The worst case scenario of an ammonia release would be to the high pressure reciever which could release up to 10,360 pounds of ammonia.  An alternative scenario would be a rooftop leak froma  3 inch liquid line that runs for 500 feet then steps down to a 1 1/2 inch line for 200 feet.  The total amount that would be released would"

      "SummaryText": " be 7,250 pounds over 30 minutes.  These parts of the ammonia system fall under the mechanical integrity part of PSM and are inspected and tested numerous times throughout the year to check for any deficiencies.\n\nHNA - KOP has no reportable accdients within the past 5 years of any ammonia releases.  In the event that a release does occur, HNA has developed an emergency response program.  This program consists of employees trained in Hazard Materials Operations, evacuation plan for all employees, conducting evacuation drills 2 times a year, created emergency teams consisting of managers and supervisors, and listings of emergency contacts throughout the facility.\n\nIn addition, HNA-KOP recognizes its responsibility under Section 112(r)(1), the \"general duty clause\", to handle all extremely hazardous substances safely to prevent thier accidental release and to minimize the consequences of any such release.  Additional chemicals on site not meeting their TQ or not identified in the 112(r) list rule include small quantities of standard industrial maintenance and cleaning chemicals, Number 2 fuel oil (home heating oil).  These \"general duty\" chemicals are managed using the same risk-management principals applied to our chemicals fully covered by 112(r).  HNA-KOP follows a prevention program including the use of process safety information, operating procedures, employee training, mechanical integrity, management of change, pre-start up safety review, incident investigation, compliance audits, \"hot work\" by permit only, and evaluation of contractors."
