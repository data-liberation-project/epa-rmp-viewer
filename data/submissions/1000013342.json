      "SummaryText": "The Hillsborough County water Department (HCWD) has an accident release prevention policy integrating technology, established procedures and management practices into an unified approach to risk management.  The HCWD operates a number of water and wastewater treatment facilities within Hillsborough County, Florida.  The HCWD adheres to all applicable policies and procedures of the United States Environmental Protection Agency, the Florida Department of Environmental Regulation and the Florida Department of Community Affairs.  The HCWD response plan involves the preparation of response plans for each facility.  Each facility is in compliance with the EPA emergency response program requirements.\n\nThe Dale Mabry AWT is located at 13055 Delwood Road, Tampa, Fl  33624.  In addition to the treatment facility the complex includes wastewater transmission facilites, a reclaimed water system and surface water discharge facilities.  The complex also houses the Water Department's Environmental Laboratory and the Wastewater Operations Administration offices.\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis includes consideration of two chlorine release scenarios, identified by the EPA as worst case release and alternative scenario.  The first, worst case release is defined by the EPA, which states that the owner or operator shall assume that the maximum quantity in the largest vessel is released as a gas over 10 minutes, due to an unspecified failure.  The alternative scenario is identified as more likely to occur than the worst case scenario.\n\nThe HCWD used the EPA lookup tables to determine offsite consequences.\n\nThe wprst case scenario at the Dale Mabry AWT involves an unspecified failure of a single one ton container of chlorine.   The EPA specified conditions assume the release of the entire amount as a gas in ten minutes, use of the one hour ERPG-2 as the toxic endpoint and consideratrion of the population residing within a full circle with radius corresponding to the toxice endpoint dis"

      "SummaryText": "tance.  The Hillsborough County Water Department believes the EPA assumption to be unrealistic.\n\nA.  Only a fraction of the compressed liquidified chlorine released to the atmosphere will flash to a vapor.  The remaining liquid forms droplet aerosols. This results in the formation of a very dense chlorine cloud consisting of vapor and liquid droplets, with dispersion characteristics significantly different than for a cloud of pure chlorine gas.\n\nB. Only the population within an elliptical plume extending downwind of the release point is potentially affected.  The plume area, or footprint, is approximately six percent of the area of the full circle.\n\nMitigation systems to be considered include the chlorine leak detection system and the vacuum piping.  The Dale Mabry  AWT chlorine system is a vacuum system. The type of system is expected to significantly reduce the amount of chlorine released in the event of a pigtail or piping failure.\n\nThe HCWD's general release prevention program is based on several elemenets:\nTraining of staff.\nPreventative maintenance program\nState of the art process and safety equipment.\nAccurate, effective operating procedures.\nHazard review of equipment and procedures.\nAn in house inspection program.\n\nChemical specific prevention steps include availablity of Self Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA) worn by the operators during connection/disconnection of chlorine and/or sulfur dioxide supply, awareness of hazardous and toxic properties of chlorine and sulfur dioxide and the presence of chlorine and sulfur dioxide detection equipmentr.  The facility also maintains chemical specific repair kits on site."
