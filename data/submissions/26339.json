The Facility Policy\n\nThe owners, management, and employees of Ostrander Farmers' Co-op (Chester Location) are     committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental\nrelease should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and environment.\n\n2. Facility Information.\n\n- The primary activity at the facility is the storage and distribution of NH3 for sale to farmers.\n\n-   Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct soil application for crop\n     production nutrients.\n\n-    The maximum quantity stored would be 55,000 pounds in our one 12,000 gal storage tank.  The           \n      maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a semi tank car holding 44,000 pounds.\n\n3. The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario.\n\na. The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank or (tank car) released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 55,000 pounds which represents the volume of the storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 220 ppm) is .79 miles.\n\n b. The alternative release scenario based on the five-year accident history (or the most likely potential\n incident) is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion\n to 220 ppm) is .78 miles.\n\n4. The accident release prevention program.\n\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of  \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling \nof Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc.,\nand the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), CFR 191"

There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\n\n- have caused any deaths, injures, or significant property damage at the facility; nor\n\n- to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injures, evacuations, sheltering in place,\nor environmental damage.\n\n\n\n6. The emergency response program.\n\n- The facility has:\n\na. A written action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CRF 1910.38;\n\nb. Provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know\n        information as required under SARA Title 111 (EPCRA).      \n\n7. Planned changes to improve safety.\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to\nassess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia\nsafety recommendations for implementation at this time."
