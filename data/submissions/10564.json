      "SummaryText": "Heinz Pet Products is the second largest producer of pet food in the United States, offering the most balanced family of products of any American pet food company.  Heinz Pet Foods has facilities all over the country to serve the needs of loyal customers and has state-of-the-art Heinz manufacturing and distribution operations in California, Kansas, Illinois, Texas and West Virginia.  And that's in addition to our Bloomsburg, PA facility - the largest pet food manufacturing plant in the world!\n\nWe take pride in observing stringent precautions to prevent hazards in our workplace and have well established contingency plans in place in the unlikely event of a mishap.  Our approach for controlling risks from hazardous substances we handle includes:\n\n- The use of well recognized practices and state of the art process control equipment \n- Maintaining high levels of expertise in our personnel who manage and operate our processes\n\nIt is the policy of Heinz Pet Products to minimize risk and comply with all regulations related to the handling and storage of hazardous substances at our facility.  Management will take action to identify hazards within our operations that could adversely affect public health or the environment and install equipment and establish programs that will minimize the impacts of these hazards.  Our employees will maintain high standards of expertise in our risk management activities related to their jobs and handle and operate our equipment in accordance with established procedures.   \n\nWe recognize that the handling and storage of certain hazardous substances within the chemical storage and transfer process at our facility can present certain risks.  Our analysis of the offsite consequences of these processes has determined that the worst case release would be represented by the full release of propane from our propane storage vessel.  Such a scenario would result in a release of 64,000 lbs. of propane, a flammable hazardous substance.  Although very un"

      "SummaryText": "likely to occur, the distance to endpoint for such a release, under winds of 3.4 mph is 1600 feet surrounding our site.  This distance includes a population of approximately 110 people and a neighboring daycare school and commercial and industrial sites.  There would be no environmental impacts from such a release. \n\nWe have excellent release prevention programs in place for preventing releases of propane and other substances we have onsite.  The well recognized expertise of our personnel, many with over 20 years experience in our operations, provides the foundation for ensuring these programs are effective through continual monitoring, checking and maintenance of our equipment.\n\nThere has not been a reportable release of any hazardous substance from our facility during its life. \n\nOur emergency response program is constantly reviewed and has been accepted by the Columbia County Local Emergency Planning Committee.  This program includes immediate contact of the local Fire Department in the event of an emergency.\n\nManagement at Heinz Pet Products reviews our operations to ensure we have the most effective safety and release prevention equipment and practices in place.  The next step in this continuing practice will be to test equipment used to store and transfer hazardous substances and to upgrade any equipment that does not meet current wall thickness codes."
