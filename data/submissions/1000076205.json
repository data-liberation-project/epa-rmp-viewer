Our ACN suppliers own all of the ACN railcar fleet. Covestro owns the ACN material inside the ACN Railcar(s) once it is loaded into the railcars by the acrylonitrile supplier and exits their facility by purchasing agreement.  CSX delivers the ACN railcar(s) to the Massey Railyard for a typical storage period of 1 to 30 days.  Once CSX places the ACN Railcar(s) in the Massey Railyard, the ACN railcar(s) is no longer under active shipping papers.  Upon request from Covestro and Dow, CSX transfers the ACN Railcar(s) from Massey Railyard, through the CSX railroad property, onto the South Charleston Plant to the Covestro ACN unloading station within the South Charleston Plant.  The South Charleston Plant is owned by Dow and Covestro is a tenant at the facility. Covestro leases part of the South Charleston Plant for its operations and stores 1 to 7 ACN railcars at the Massey Railyard during a typical month.  The DOW Massey Yard is not required to be covered under the PSM Regulations. However, Covestro has performed a formal hazard analysis every 5 years to ensure all hazards are adequately controlled.  There are four UTLX employees and no Covestro or DOW employees located at the DOW Massey Railyard.  \n\n\n\nIn summary the Covestro portion of DOW Massey Railyard has one (1) RMP listed toxic chemicals and no flammable chemicals.
