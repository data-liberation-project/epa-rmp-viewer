The Risk Management Program identifies the equipment, procedures, maintenance, inspection, and training associated with Regulated Substance (RS), chlorine,  handled at this facility in excess of its Federal threshold quantity.  This plan describes the original structured assessment of hazards which was conducted to assess possible effects on employees and offsite public and environmental receptors as well as periodic, 5-year updates.  Part of this process provides the results of an offsite consequences analysis; defines a prevention program, emergency response program, and mitigation measures to reduce the probability and magnitude of an accidental releases of the RS.  It also establishes a schedule and responsibilities for implementation of mitigation measures and auditing of program elements.  This Risk Management Plan (RMP) is being filed as required by ARP regulations in order to report the elements of the current Risk Management Program and to describe further measures planned to mitigate or prevent accidental releases of RS's.  \n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\n\n\nThe City of Redding operates two water treatment plants.  Its Buckeye Water Treatment Plant is located at 11501 Benson Road, Shasta, CA in Shasta County, and uses chlorine for disinfection in quantities greater than the Federal threshold quantity for this RS.  The facility is located on the Spring Creek Conduit north of the community of Shasta and west of Keswick in a rural area with few residences.  There are no full-time employees at this site.  Operators visit the site on a regular schedule and also respond to alarm conditions.  Chlorine is received in ton containers by truck, handled with an electric hoist, and stored on ton container scales and trunn"

Pressurized chlorine gas within a ton container is reduced to vacuum at a vacuum regulator valve mounted directly onto the ton container's gas valve.  From there, the chlorine under vacuum is metered through rate valves and rotameters in chlorinators located in an adjacent room, and drawn into water solution by the passage of pressurized water through an injector.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n\n\nIt is the policy of the City of Redding that the receipt, storage and handling of chlorine at its facility be done in a manner which meets regulatory requirements and minimizes the probability and severity of accidental releases of chlorine to the atmosphere, in order to protect the health and safety of its workers, the public, and the environment.  In order to accomplish this goal, City of Redding has gathered safety information on chlorine and on the process, equipment and procedures involving chlorine; performed a structured assessment of hazards of the process and external events which might affect the process; performed an offsite consequences analysis of defined release scenarios; established a written program for prevention and mitigation of accidental releases; and established a written emergency response program coordinated with emergency response agencies.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAMS\n\n\n\nGeneral accidental release prevention programs instituted by City of Redding are categorized as administrative (management) programs; procedures, training, and engineering controls; and emergency response programs. The City of Redding has instituted a Process Safety Management (PSM) Program meeting OSHA requirements at 29 CFR 1910.119 and GISO 5189 covering the disinfection process at its water treatment plants.

These include, among other things, installation of seismic restraints on the ton container scales. Automatic closure valves have been installed within the last 5 years.  They operate based on a leak being detected by chlorine leak detectors mounted in both the storage and dosing rooms.  When a leak is detected, the valves automatically close isolating the chlorine in the ton containers. \n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThere have been no accidents involving chlorine at this facility within the past five years resulting in injuries, offsite consequences, or property damage.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe City of Redding's Emergency Response Program applicable to chlorine has been coordinated with Redding Fire Department, the local agency responsible for hazardous materials release response coordination.  The City of Redding maintains First Responder capability with respect to chlorine releases at its facilities.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nAll of the improvements and mitigation measures identified in the process hazard analysis which City of Redding committed to accomplish have been completed or are in progress.  Any other measures identified by employees during workplace hazard surveys, or as a result of Process Hazard Analyses or audit activities, will be thoroughly reviewed and considered for implementation."
