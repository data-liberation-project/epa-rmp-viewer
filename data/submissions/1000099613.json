      "SummaryText": "Chemical & Metal Industries, Inc. (C&MI) is a manufacturer of antimony pentachloride catalyst. Antimony pentachloride is a fluorination catalyst used primarily in the manufacture of refrigerants (CFC replacement fluorocarbons), fluoropolymers, and pharmaceuticals. C&MI uses chlorine and chloroform in this manufacturing process. In addition, C&MI utilizes reactor residues containing antimony chloride fluoride - a byproduct from the fluorocarbon manufacturing industry. The utilization of this byproduct substantially reduces the amount of primary raw materials, including chlorine, necessary for manufacture.\n\n\n\nThis RMP submission is the revised/updated version of the one submitted in February 20117. No significant changes have been made to our processes since that time.\n\n\n\n1. Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies\n\n\n\nThe handling of antimony pentachloride and of the chlorine, chloroform, and other raw materials used in its manufacture requires certain safety precautions. C&MI's manufacturing process is a closed system. C&MI has developed an Emergency Response and Contingency Plan in accordance with applicable regulations. This plan has been reviewed by several governmental agencies, consulting firms, and was most recently updated by C&MI in December, 2021. The plan includes procedures for notification of the local fire department, county HazMat team, and potentially affected neighbors in the event of an unauthorized release of hazardous chemicals. C&MI is dedicated to continual process and engineering improvements to reduce the amount of hazardous materials utilized and stored, to upgrade the manufacturing process and facility, and to improve process alarms and codes.\n\n\n\n\n\n2. The stationary source and regulated substances handled.\n\n\n\nThe RMP regulated substances handled at C&MI are chlorine and chloroform. Chlorine is received and handled in one-ton cylinders. The total inventory of chlorine tanks stored at this plant at one time is 8 (16,000 lb)"

      "SummaryText": ". C&MI also receives and handles chloroform. The chloroform, primarily received as an impurity in returned spent antimony catalyst residues, is isolated for reuse in C&MI's manufacturing process. The maximum inventory of chloroform is 12,000 gallons (~150,000 lb); average inventory of chloroform is estimated to be 4,000 gallons (~50,000 lb). \n\n\n\n\n\n3. The worst-case and alternative-case release scenarios\n\n\n\nWorst-case Scenario\n\n\n\nThe worst case scenario is the failure of a one-ton cylinder releasing 2000 lb of chlorine. It is assumed that the entire contents of the cylinder are released in 10 minutes. The distance to the endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L (3 ppm) was determined to be 2.2 miles. This distance does not reflect the active mitigation C&MI has taken to ensure no off-site consequences in the event of a chlorine release. Namely, the existence of a chlorine room with separate scrubber system on back-up/emergency power to neutralize the entire contents of a ton-cylinder and automatic shut-off controls are also in place.\n\n\n\nAlternative-case Scenario for Chlorine\n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario for chlorine assumes the failure of a one-half inch liquid chlorine transfer hose and resulting release of 2,000 lbs of chlorine from a ton-tank into C&MI's chlorine room which is maintained at negative pressure. This scenario does consider active mitigation of the scrubber system with 99.997% efficiency for chlorine neutralization, but does not consider active mitigation of the automatic shut-off controls. The distance to the endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L (3 ppm) was determined to be less than 0.1 miles with a chlorine release rate to the air from the scrubber outlet of 0.002 lb/min. \n\n\n\nAlternative-case Scenario for Chloroform\n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario for chloroform assumes the failure of a bottom valve on a process vessel containing 500 gallons of chloroform. The distance to the endpoint of 0.49 mg/L was determined to be less than 0.1 miles.\n\n\n\n\n\n4. The general accident"

The RMP was last audited between January 29, 2003 and April 8, 2004, with different sections audited on a monthly basis.  C&MI had an audit of our PSM system by an engineering/consulting firm with expertise in RMP from February 21 through March 2nd, 2007.  Findings and recommendations were addressed and prioritized. These recommendations were re-addressed in February 2009 and are still in process of being updated. \n\n\n\nC&MI operates its chlorine handling based on recommendations of the Chlorine Institute as applied to C&MI's unique process.\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Five-year Accident history\n\n\n\nNo reportable releases have occurred since January, 2002.\n\n\n\n\n\n6. Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\nC&MI's Emergency Response & Contingency Plan (ERCP) was developed to comply with OSHA, EPA and NFPA standards and guidelines. It has been submitted to and reviewed by OSHA, the Denver Fire Department, the Town of Hudson, Colorado State University's Occupational Health and Safety Service, URS Operating Services, Inc., and the EPA during a voluntary consultation in October 1998, Region VIII EPA and the CDPHE as part of a Hazardous Waste Management audit in October 1998, and VECO engineering as part of a facility process safety audit conducted March-May 1999 & again Feb-March 2007.\n\n\n\nC&MI has an on-site Emergency Response Team that includes all chemical operators, plant managers and Safety, Health and Environment personnel. C&MI conducts on-site training and drills specific to process chemicals and equipment. Annual training is also conducted on site using outside training sources such as Compliance Solutions. C&MI has Personal Protective Equipment, portable gas monitoring equipment, patching utilities, and neutralizing agents "

All mitigation efforts will be coordinated with local authorities.\n\n\n\nFacility safeguards are in place to reduce or eliminate the occurrence of a chemical emergency. These safeguards include: (1) C&MI has a chemical operator training program that includes weekly safety meetings and written and demonstrations certification testing; (2) Chemicals are handled in a closed system vented to a neutralization scrubber; (3) Process equipment has been designed, tested, and engineered specifically for process conditions; (4) C&MI's primary manufacturing chemicals do not burn or ignite and there is no potential for a runaway reaction; (5) C&MI's facility is equipped with a gas-monitoring system which activates automatic shutdown and emergency interlocks and notifies plant personnel and on-call managers; (6) The perimeter of the process building is diked to contain a liquid spill anywhere within the building; (7) Chemical loading areas (railcar and truck docks) have liquid containment systems; (8) Chlorine is stored and dispensed within a dedicated, negative pressure room vented to an emergency neutralization scrubber having a reported removal efficiency of 99.997%. (9) C&MI operates on a 24/7 schedule, and a 24hr security alarm and security cameras and has fencing around rail cars and all HAZMAT storage areas.

This relocation allowed a complete redesign and upgrade of the manufacturing and storage facility. The relocation considers facility site to reduce potential for off-site impacts. The relocation site is adjacent to C&MI's supplier of chlorine and other raw materials, thus reducing hazardous materials transportation distances. We hope to add more security cameras in the future to help monitor the entire facility, not just portions of it. \n\n\n\nC&MI has a continuing program to eval"
