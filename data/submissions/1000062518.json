      "SummaryText": " A Process Safety Plan, corporate guidelines and plant procedures have been developed and implemented to assure safe and consistent handling.  Only properly trained employees perform the work of unloading anhydrous ammonia.  An Emergency Response Plan has been developed, and an emergency response team has been trained to respond in case of an accidental release.  Plant Wansley has never had a reportable release of anhydrous ammonia.\n\n     As required by EPA regulations, this Risk Management Plan contains a Worst Case Release Scenario and an Alternate Release Scenarios for the release of anhydrous ammonia.  EPA's April, 1999 Guidance for Offsite Release Analysis states that since worst case scenario distances are based on modeling conditions that are unlikely to occur, and since modeling of any scenario that results in large distances is very uncertain, EPA strongly urges communities and industry not to rely on the results of worst case modeling or any modeling that results in very large toxic endpoint distances in emergency planning and response activities.  Results of alternative scenario models are apt to provide a more reasonable basis for planning and response.  The alternative scenario model for Plant Wansley shows that an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia  will not leave the plant site and will not effect any public receptors."
