The City has demonstrated its commitment to safety by\nupgrading the chemical feed process at the Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) in early\n1999 from a gas pressure system to a vacuum system mounted directly on chlorine\ncylinders, which decreases system maintenance dramatically and therefore reduces the\npotential for chlorine leaks.\n\nFacility and Regulated Substance\nThe City's WWTP is located in the southeaster portion of the City at 920 South Boise Avenue.\nChlorine is used at the facility to provide disinfection of treated wastewater effluent prior to\ndischarge into the Big Thompson River.  Chlorine is stored in one-ton cylinders, and no more\nthan two cylinders of chlorine (4,000 pounds) are stored at the WWTP.\n\nWorst Case and Alternative Case Release Scenarios\nThe worst case release scenario involves the loss of 2,000 pounds of chlorine from a\nsingle cylinder of chlorine outside of any enclosure.  The rule for worst case release\nanalysis assumes all of the contents are released in 10 minutes.  The alternative case\nrelease scenario was based on process hazard analysis, and involves the release of\n600 pounds of chlorine in 60 minutes as a result of a fusible plug failure.  The distance to\nendpoint for both scenarios was analyzed using RMP*Comp(an EPA program), and the\nanalyses resulted in a worst case release scenario distance to endpoint of 1.3 miles and\nan alternative case release scenario distance to endpoint of 0.1 miles.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\nThe accidental release prevention program complies with the requirements for Program\nLevel 2 processes.  The prevention program includes an employee training program\nbased on the written operating procedures for the WWTP, as well as an aggressive\nmaintenance, inspection, and testin"

      "SummaryText": "g program for equipment utilized within the covered\nprocess.  These programs all serve to prevent or minimize unintended releases of\nchlorine.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\nThe WWTP has had one accidental release of chlorine within the last five years.  The\naccidental release was caused by human error during maintenance of the old pressurized\nfeed system, and resulted in a release of less than one pound of chlorine and a worker seeking\nmedical evaluation.  The accidental release did not result in an offsite impact.\n\nEmergency Response Program\nThe WWTP is included within a written community emergency response plan, and the\nprimary responder to the WWTP is the City of Loveland Fire Department.  WWTP employees\nhandle incidental releases of chlorine and are trained and equipped to do so."
