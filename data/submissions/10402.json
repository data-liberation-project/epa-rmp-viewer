Box 6\nHanska,MN. 56041\n\nFor further information contact: Lance Sletta, Safety Director\n\nRisk Management Plan EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n1. The Facility Plan\n\nThe Board of Directoes, management and employees of the Farmers Co-op of Hanska (the facility) are commited to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia or propane.If an accidental release of anhydrous or propane should occur, the Farmers Co-op of Hanska is prepared to work with the Hanska Community Fire Department, or other authorities, to midigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information\n\nThe primary activities at this facility are the stroage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers and the storage and delivery of propane for sale to customers.\n\n-ANHYDROUS AMMONIA is received, stored, distributed and custom applied for crop production.\n\n-The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia stored at this facility would be 580,000 lbs. This figure is based on three storage tanks, 71 nurse tanks and five caddy applicators.The maximum quantity handled at one time would be the unloading of a semi transport truck holding 41,500 lbs.\n\n-PROPANE is received, stored and distrbuted for crop drying, home heating,and commercial use.\n\n-The maximum quantity of propane stored at this facility would be 253,000 lbs. This figure is based on three storage tanks and two delivery trucks.The maximum quantitty handled at one time would be the unloading of a semi transport truck holding 33,500 lbs.\n\n3.1. The WORST-CASE SCENARIO and the ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO for ANHYDROUS AMMONIA\n\n   a. The worst-case scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas over ten minutes.The maximum quantity released would be 114,000 lbs., which represents the volume of the lagest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards. The distance to the endpoint(point of d"

      "SummaryText": "ispersion to 200ppm.)is 1.09 miles.  \n\n   b. The alternative release scenario based on the most likely potential incident is a release from a break in a transfer hose or a broken pipe. The maximum quantity released is 27,000 lbs. this is based on a 3\" pipe or hose failing for ten minutes, resulting in 13,500lbs. of anhydrous ammonia being released.  The distance to the endpoint ( point of dispersion to 200ppm.) is .78 miles.\n\n3.2 The WORST-CASE SCENARIO and the ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO for PROPANE\n\n    a. The worst-case scenario would a vapor cloud explosion of the total contents of a stroage tank released as a gas over ten minutes. The maximum quantity released would be 110,000 lbs., which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 1 psi over pressure) is .43 miles.\n\n   b. The alternative release scenario based on the most likely potential incident is a vapor cloud explosion from a break in a transfer hose or a broken pipe. Distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 1 psi over pressure) is .29 miles.   \n\n4. The accidental release prevention  program\n\n  The Farmers Co-op of Hanska has implemented the provisions of \" Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", publised by the American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) , 29 CFR 1910.111, \" Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia \".Rules and regulations set forth by the MN Dept. of Ag.\n\n  The Farmers Co-op of Hanska has implemented the provisions set forth by OSHA and the Minnesota Department of Public Safety for the safe storage and handling of propane gas.\n\n5. The Five Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia or propane in the past five years that:\n\n   - Have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the Farmers"

The Emergency Response Program\n\n  -The Farmers Co-op of Hanska has :\n\n  a.a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard , 29 CFR 1910.38\n\n  b. provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to know information as required under SARA Title III (EPRCA)\n\n  c. Coordinated with local emergency responders.\n\n7. Planned changes to improve safety\n\n   Safety improvement is an on -going process at the Farmers Co-op of Hanska.Periodic inspections and evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions. There are no specific anhydruos ammonia or propane safety recomendations for implementation at this time."
