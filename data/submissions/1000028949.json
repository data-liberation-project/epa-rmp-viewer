      "SummaryText": "RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nGranite Falls Energy, LLC\n\n\n\nGranite Falls Energy operates an ethanol fuel production plant located approximately 1.5 miles east of the city of Granite Falls, Minnesota.  As a requirement of the Clean Air Act Amendments 112 Accidental Release of Hazardous Air Substances program, Granite Falls Energy completed a risk management plan (RMP) for any chemical stored on-site that will be above the reporting threshold..  This information is considered to be public knowledge and can be accessed through the Environmental Protection Agency Website at http://www.epa.gov/enviro/index_java.html.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Response Policies:\n\n\n\nGranite Falls Energy is committed to the protection of its employees, the greater community and the government from hazardous substances used in the ethanol fuel production process, specifically the natural gasoline used as the ethanol denaturant as well as the anhydrous ammonia.  The ammonia is used for pH control directly in the process feed mixture and to fermentation.  The natural gasoline is added to the ethanol to make the ethanol unfit for human consumption.  It is the policy of Granite Falls Energy to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  In event of an emergency, including an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia or denturant, it is the policy of Granite Falls Energy to notify the Granite Falls Fire and Police Departments, Chippewa County Sheriff, Yellow Medicine County Sheriff, MN Duty Officer, and the Renville County Sheriff and evacuate all employees from the facility.\n\n\n\nRegulated Substances Handled:\n\n\n\nThe facility produces fuel grade ethanol from corn and a process by-products known as dry distillers grain with solubles(DDGs), modified DDGs, WetCake, Corn Oil and Syrup, which are all used as a livestock feed.  The fuel ethanol production process requires use of a denaturant (natural gasoline) which is reported to contain approximately 40 percent pentan"

      "SummaryText": "e, a RMP regulated substance.  The maximum amount of natural gasoline is stored in an above ground tank as a liquid and is introduced to the fuel ethanol at the load-out into shipping transports (rail or semi tanker).  The denaturant tank with a capacity of 560,000 pounds is located in the facility's tank farm area which includes secondary containment.  Anhydrous ammonia is also stored on-site and used in the ethanol production for pH control.  The maximum anhydrous ammonia stored will be 100,800 pounds.\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program:\n\n\n\nThrough completion of this RMP, Granite Falls Energy has complied with EPA requirements under 40 CFR Part 68.  Process safety information and operations/maintenance procedures are documented on-site.  Periodic functions such as process hazard analysis, training, change management and incident investigations are conducted on a regular basis.  Audits of the overall RMP will be conducted on a regular basis to assure compliance with EPA regulations.\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History:\n\n\n\nGranite Falls Energy does not have a history of accidents which may have caused death, injuries, environmental or property damage, evacuations or in-place sheltering in the last five years."
