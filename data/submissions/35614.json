The program includes Classroom, OJT, and computer-based training. Employees are tested to demonstrate competency.\n\n          Management of Change: The Larose Gas Plant utilizes a Management of  Change process. In this, changes are reviewed to ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and to verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  \n\n          Incident Investigation:  The Larose Gas Plant utilizes an Incident Investigation process. The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts concerning an incident or near miss and to develop corrective actions to prevent recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  \n\n          Compliance Audits: At the Larose Gas Plant, audits are conducted on a regular basis to ensure that the facility is in compliance with applicable RMP / PSM / SIP procedures and regulations. \n\nFive-year Accident History:\n\nOne release has occurred at the Larose gas Plant in the last 5 years. Approximately 50 bbls of condensate were release to the ground. The release was discovered approximately 30 minutes after it began and was contained immediately. No condensate moved offsite and no ground water impact occurred.  \n\nEmergency Response Program Information:\n\nThe Larose Gas Plant maintains a written emergency response program to protect employees, contractors, public and the environment from hazards associated with accidental releases of regulated substances. The program consists of procedures for responding to releases of regulated substances, including the possibility of associated fires or explosions. The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including evacuation plans, accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency res"

The program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to the gas plant processes.  Emergency response program changes are administered through the MOC process. The overall emergency response program for Larose Gas Plant is coordinated with Lafourche Parish Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  This coordination includes attending periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials and industry representatives.  Larose Gas Plant  has 24-hour communications capability with the Lafourche Parish LEPC. The Plant conducts periodic emergency drills that involve the LEPC and emergency response organizations.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\nIn response to the most recent Process Hazard Analysis, the Larose Gas Plant has made several changes to equipment and procedures to reduce either the likelihood and/or the severity of a release."
