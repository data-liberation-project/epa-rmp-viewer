              "Description": "Natural Gas Odorizing, Inc. manufactures mercaptans and sulfides for use as warning agents in natural gas and liquid petroleum gas systems.  Hydrogen sulfide is received from the suppliers pipeline and passes through a phosphoric acid tower to remove any impurities.  The hydrogen sulfide is compressed to approximately 250 psig and combined with either an olefin (ethylene, propylene, isobutylene, or butene) or tetrahydrofuran and then charged to the reactor systems to primarily produce either a mercaptan (ethyl mercaptan, propyl mercaptan, tert-butyl mercaptan, or sec-butyl mercaptan) or a sulfide (tetrahydrothiophene).  Methyl ethyl sulfide is produced from the reaction of methanol with ethyl mercaptan.  Excess hydrogen sulfide is recylced to the amine treating units for purification and then compressed to be fed to the reactor systems again.  The mercaptan and sulfide crudes produced from the reactor systems are stored in pressure vessels then charged to either fractionation unit No.1, No. 2 or tower No. 5  for product purification.  After distillation, the purified products are distributed to pressure vessels for storage and blending and then to packaging for distribution.",

Natural Gas Odorizing, Inc. is a wholly owned subsidiary of OxyChem. OxyChem  is a wholly owned subsidiary of Occidental Petroleum Corporation. \n\n1.  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at the Stationary Source  (? 68.155(a)):\n\nNatural Gas Odorizing, Inc. (NGO) has established a system for the safe operation of the processes at this facility that includes the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  One component of this system is a program to manage the risks of accidental releases at the NGO facility.  This program conforms to the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirement Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule) and requirements of OSHA 1910.119.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMP plan requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at the NGO facility.\n\n2. The Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled (? 68.155(b)):\n\nThe NGO facility consists of a single chemical production plant.  The facility handles four substances that are regulated by the RMP rule.  These substances are as follows:\n\n1-Butene                                                                  Ethyl Mercaptan [Ethanethiol]\n2-Methylpropene [1-Propene, 2-methyl-]                      Propylene [1-Propene]\n\n\n3. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Specific Prevention Steps (? 68.155(d)):\n\nThe NGO facility?s prevention program has been prepared so that it conforms to both the OSHA Process Safety Management and the EPA Risk Management Plan regulations.  The program consists of the following elements:\n\nProcess Safety Information     Process Hazard Analysis     Operating Procedures\nTraining                       "

These manuals are routinely updated.\n\n\n4.      Five-year Accident History (? 68.155(e)):\n\nThere were not any RMP accidents at this facility in the past 5 years.\n\n5. The Emergency Response Program (? 68.155(f)).\n\nThe NGO facility has established a written emergency response plan and maintains an emergency response team (?ERT?) trained in these emergency response procedures.  All plant personnel are trained in evacuation procedures and in-plant drills are conducted periodically.  The drills are used to test the response time of the Emergency Response Team, to test the plant employee accountability program, and to activate the plant's Emergency Command Center (?ECC?).  In addition, OxyChem has developed a Special Situations Plan (?SSP?) which is a program designed for responding to emergencies that may have impacts beyond the immediate plant and is a supplement to the Emergency Response Plan.  The Special Situation Plan links the local response to the OxyChem Corporate Emergency Response Center located in Dallas, Texas.\n\nThe NGO facility is a member of the Local Emergency Planning Committee (?LEPC?), which includes industrial and public entities.\n\n\n6. Planned Changes to Improve Safety (? 68.155(g))\n\nThe NGO facility constantly tries to improve the safety of the processes through annual reviews of our plant procedures, near misses and incident investigation programs, and a program soliciting safety and environmental suggestions from the plant employees.\n\nCertification Statement\n\nTo the best of the undersigned's knowledge, information, and belief formed after reasonable inquiry, the information submitted is true, accurate, and complete.\n\n\n\nOriginal on Co"
