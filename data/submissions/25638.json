      "SummaryText": "\nWe are a fertilizer retail facility.  The only material considered hazardous at this facility is anhydrous ammonia.  Our facility has one 30,000 gallon tank, equipment for receiving ammonia by truck and equipment for transferring ammonia from storage to trucks for delivery to customers.  It is our policy to meet, or exceed all local, state, and national standards relating to handling ammonia.\n\nSpecific safety features that we employ to minimize the impact of an accidental release include:\n\n1.  Excess flow valves to prevent flow from the tank if any hose or line breaks.\n2.  Pressure relief valves on the storage tank to prevent overpressuring and rupture of the tank.\n3.  Inspections by insurance loss control specialists to ensure that our equipment is maintained in a manner that ensures safe operation and prevents releases.\n\nTo further ensure safe operation of the facility, our employees are trained in procedures for safe handling of hazardous materials, and in safe operating and maintenance procedures.  We have also coordinated with the Spearman Fire Department to respond in the unlikely event of an emergency.\n\nAs required by the EPA, we have analyzed the worst-case release scenario defined by the EPA.  This scenario involves a release of the entire contents of the storage tank.  According to information supplied by the EPA a release according to this scenario would include the city of Spearman.\n\nIt is extremely unlikely that an event such as EPA's worst-case scenario will ever occur.  A more probable, but still unlikely event, would be an event like a hose break during a truck pull away.  According to information supplied by the EPA, such a release would affect residences near our facility, but would not affect any schools, recreation areas, or the hospital."
