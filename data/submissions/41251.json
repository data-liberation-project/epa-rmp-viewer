If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate any release to people and the environment.                                                                                         2.

We handle a variety of farm supplies, including pesticides and fertilizers. We are distributors of Anhydrous Ammonia, a product regulated by U.S. E.P.A. We receive Anhydrous Qmmonia by truck, store on site in one 26,000 gallon tank and one 30,000 gallon tank and distribute to our customers in nurse tanks.                                       3. The worst-case release scenario and the alternative  release scenario.                                                                               A. The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes. The maximum quantity released would be 130,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards. The distance to the endpoint(point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.1 miles.  B. The alternative release scenario based on the five-year accident history (or the most likely potential incident) is a release from the break in the transfer hose, This would result in a release of 12,000 pounds over a 2 minute time span until manual shut off could be completed.
