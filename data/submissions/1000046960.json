The facility is designed to process natural gas and recover liquid product from natural gas by physical separation. Petroleum condensates are transported onward to another facility for processing. \n\n\n\nThe Chaney Dell Gas Plant has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our efforts in accident prevention, such as training personnel, quality assurance, and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our process.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will evaluate the situation, take actions within the capabilities of the plant, and notify the necessary outside agencies.\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\n\nThe Chaney Dell Gas Plant is located approximately 4 miles north of Ringwood, Oklahoma, on Highway 58 and operates the process to produce the following petroleum products:\n\n\n\n1. Natural Gas Liquid Product (Y-Grade)\n\n2. Residue Gas\n\n\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS (OCA) RESULTS\n\n\n\nTarga treats the entire facility as one process.  Several vessels at the gas plant were evaluated for offsite consequence analyses.  There is one worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with a release of flammable substances at the Chaney Dell Gas Plant.  The scenario involves a vapor cloud explosion involving 360,349 pounds (75,700 gallons) of a flammable mixture contained in one natural gas liquid storage tank. The entire inventory is assumed to release and ignite, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion and impacting an"

The rest of the vessels that were evaluated have a radius smaller than and located within the WCS radius.   \n\n\n\nThe facility is not located within a populated area; therefore, the WCS would not impact an off site public receptor and is considered a Program 1 process.  A consideration of the 0.5 miles radius has been incorporated into our notification and emergency response planning.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe Chaney Dell Gas Plant is covered by the OSHA PSM Program to aid in accident release prevention. \n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThe Chaney Dell Gas Plant has an excellent record of accident prevention since start-up.  There have been no accidental releases from the covered process that resulted in death, injury or significant property damage on site, or known off site death, injury, evacuation, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage during this period.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\n\n\n\nThe Chaney Dell Gas Plant is a Non-Responding Facility as per 48 CFR 68.90(b). The plant maintains a written emergency response plan, which is in place to help protect employees and public safety as well as the environment.  The plan identifies steps to be taken in case of an accidental release including: evacuation plans, accounting for personnel after an evacuation, and notification of Targa staff, local emergency response agencies, and the public. However, facility personnel are not trained to be first responders to large fires and should a release occur from one of the vessels, Targa would rely on the local fire department to respond.  \n\n\n\nEmployees receive training in the procedures to be followed when certain employees must remain to operate critical plant operations before they evacuate.  The Chaney Dell Gas Plant has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate emergency response organizations (Fire Department, Police and Sheriff's Office).  This interface provides t"
