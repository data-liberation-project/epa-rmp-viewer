The facility utilizes anhydrous ammonia as integral part of its refrigeration system, which consists of several storage vessels, compressors, condensers, piping and air handling units throughout the processing plant in order to maintain proper food safety temperatures.  The total system capacity of anhydrous ammonia on-site is 33,091 pounds distributed throughout the refrigeration components.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES:\n\nAs a concerned member of the community, the company takes its role as a responsible corporate citizen very seriously.
