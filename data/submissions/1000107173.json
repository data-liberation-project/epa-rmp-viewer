      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nHelena Agri-Enterprises, LLC is submitting this updated electronic RMP in compliance with the provisions of the Clean Air Act \u00a7 112(r) as codified by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) at 40 CFR \u00a768 and the State of California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program.  Standards codified by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration at 29 CFR 1910.119 are not applicable to the operations at this facility because the concentration and quantity of aqueous ammonia is below the OSHA concentration and threshold quantity.  This electronic RMP summarizes the policies and procedures implemented by the Facility to minimize the likelihood of an accident, and to ensure that a response to a release will be implemented in a proper and timely manner.\n\nPURPOSE FOR UPDATING RMP\n\nThe Facility is submitting this as a 5-year update in accordance with the rule. All accident prevention elements have been reviewed and/or updated.\n\nFACILITY\n\nThe Facility stores aqueous ammonia in one 14,380-gallon stationary storage tank.  The 14,380-gallon storage tank is vented to a 1,000-gallon storage tank to scrub ammonia emissions.  Aqueous ammonia is transported to this facility via a commercial cargo truck and transferred to the 14,380-gallon storage tank by a delivery driver.  The delivery driver transfers the aqua ammonia from its commercial cargo truck to the stationary storage tank.  The Facility Process Operators manage the contents in the stationary storage tank and transfers the aqueous ammonia from the stationary storage tank into a transport truck for delivery to local growers.\n\nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\n\nThe worst case aqua ammonia release scenario assumes that the largest vessel (i.e. a 14,380-gallon AST) fails and instantaneously releases all content into the secondary containment.  The resulting release is evaporation at the maximum temperature.  The alternative scenario assumes a release of aqua ammonia at the truck transfer containment"

      "SummaryText": "due to the rupture of a 2\u0094 transfer hose.  Mitigation by engineering and administrative controls is considered in these scenarios. \n\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe Depot Manager implements the risk management planning process at this Facility. The Depot Manager is assisted by other trained personnel as directed. The Depot Manager is responsible for ensuring that its employees are properly trained in the implementation of the Program 2 Accident Prevention Program elements as related to their responsibilities.  \n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThis is a non-responding Facility. The Facility has coordinated emergency response activities with its local emergency response agency and local fire department. \n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no accidents involving the release of aqua ammonia in the last 5 years.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThe Risk Management Plan implemented by the Facility complies with the requirements of the Clean Air Act, Section 112(r) and CalARP. The RMP will be updated as the Facility adds, deletes, or makes changes to the process. The Emergency Response Program has been coordinated with the Region III LEPC.\n\nNOTE: Sections 4, 5, 6, and 7 of the standard RMP produced by EPA's RMP Submit Program are not applicable to the Butte City Retail Facility."
