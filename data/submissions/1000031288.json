If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the Superior Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency. We also maintain incipient stage fire fighting equipment on site.\r\n\r\nA description of our facility and the regulated substances handled: \r\nThis facility is a bulk terminal storing LPG for resale to retail propane dealers.  The facility consists of five 30,000-gallon tanks.\r\n\r\nThe worst-case and alternative release scenarios:\r\nOur worst-case scenario is failure of one of the 30,000-gallon storage tanks or the connecting piping when each of the storage tanks are filled to the greatest amount allowed (88% at 60F), resulting in a vapor cloud explosion. The resulting distance to the endpoint extends offsite, and public receptors are within the distance to the endpoint.  Our alternative release scenario is a break in the 3-inch diameter pipe from the railcar unloading tower, leading to a 10-minute release and explosion. The resulting distance to the endpoint extends offsite, and public receptors are within the distance to the endpoint.\r\n\r\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\r\nThis facility complies with EPA\u00bfs accident prevention rule, the OSHA PSM standard, and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.  The propane system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with NFPA-58 and state law.\r\n\r\nFive-year accident history: \r\nKeyera Energy, Inc. acquired the facility in June 2007.  We have never had an accident involving propane that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or shelterings in-place.  To the best of our knowledge no such incident occurred prior to acquisition by Keyera Ener"

We also have trained employees in incipient stage fire fighting.  We have coordinated our response plans with the fire department; members of the fire department will be provided the opportunity to visit our facility and inspect our propane storage system.  A copy of the company\u00bfs Emergency Response Plan is included in the appendix.\r\n\r\nPlanned changes to improve safety:\r\nKeyera Energy, Inc. will continually strive for safety improvement.  Periodic process safety inspections will be conducted followed with timely response."
