Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\nThis facility handles Liquefied Petroleum Gases (propane, isobutane and normal butane), Dimethyl Ether and Difluoroethane that are considered hazardous by the EPA.  These are flammable gases, so it is necessary to follow safety precautions during handling to prevent human exposure and reduce health threats to our workers and the nearby community.  Aeropres Corporation will strictly adhere to all Federal, State and Local rules and regulations.  Safety depends on:\n(a) The manner in which we handle these products;\n(b) The safety devices inherent in the design of the facility;\n(c) Operating and maintenance procedures; and\n(d) Employee training.\n\nOur emergency response program details employee responsibilities, actions and includes procedures for notification of the local fire authority and the local LEPC to notify potentially affected neighbors.\n\n2. The Stationary Source and Regulated Substances handled:\nThe primary purpose of this facility is to:\n(a) Receive and store Liquefied Petroleum Gases, Difluoroethane, and Dimethyl Ether\n(b) Remove trace contaminates;\n(c) Blend these products to customer specification; and\n(d) Ship the finished products to our customers via truck and rail.\nOur customers use this product as propellant in aerosols.  Access to the facility is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.  The single largest container of regulated substance is our isobutane storage tank #2, with a maximum of 198,000 pounds.\n\n3. The Worst-Case and Alternate Release Scenarios\nWorst-case release scenario - Failure of the isobutane storage tank when filled to the greatest amount possible would release 198,000 pounds of isobutane.  Company policy limits the maximum filling capacity of this tank to 88% at 60oF.  The distance to the endpoint of 1 psi for the worst-case scenario is 0.5 miles.\n\nAlternate scenari"

      "SummaryText": "o - A pull-away causing failure of a 50-foot length of 2 inch hose.  The excess flow valves and emergency safety valves function to stop the flow.  The contents of the hose are released.  The resulting unconfined vapor travels to the lower flammability limit.  The distance to the endpoint for the lower flammability limit for the alternative scenario is less than 0.1 miles.\n\n4. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Specific Prevention Steps:\nThis facility complies with all Federal, State, and Local rules and regulations.  The facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 and ASME codes and regulations.  All employees are thoroughly trained on the characteristics and handling of flammable gases such as propane.\n\n5. Five-Year Accident History\nThere have been no accidents at this facility.\n\n6. The Emergence Response Program:\nA detailed emergency response program has been developed and sent to the Hillsborough Township OEM.\n\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety:\nThere are no plans for changes at this time."
