      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nOVERVIEW\nHeetco, Inc. (Heetco) owns and operates the Heetco Farm Center, a fertilizer mixing and distribution operation, in La Belle, Missouri (Site). This Site maintains a 30,000 gallon anhydrous ammonia storage tank containing a maximum of 115,000 lbs. of anhydrous ammonia. Anhydrous Ammonia is a listed toxic substance subject to Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act Amendments, Risk Management Plans.\n\nIt is the policy of Heecto to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations. Safety at the facility depends on the training of employees, adherence to safety procedures, and safety devices inherent in the design of the facility.\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\nThe purpose of the plan is to ensure the protection of employees in an emergency situation.  The personal safety of each employee is and always will be of primary importance to Heetco.  The plan includes procedures for notification of the local emergency authorities.\n\n\nWORST CASE SCENARIO\nAn explosion of the tank on site (30,000 gallons) when filled to the greatest amount would release 115,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia into the atmosphere.  It is assumed for this scenario that the entire contents would be released by a liquid spill and vaporization in a 10 minute period.  The distance to the toxic endpoint of 200 ppm was calculated to be 3.6 miles.  This distance extends past the site boundary and encompasses several residences and other businesses.\n\n\nALTERNATE RELEASE SCENARIO\nThe alternate release scenario is a release from a pipe during a 15 minute period.  The total release from this scenario is 7250 pounds.  The toxic endpoint of this scenario is 0.5 miles.  This distance extends beyond the site boundary and encompasses several residences and other businesses.\n\n\nPREVENTION PROGRAM\nHeetco has a prevention program in place that meets the requirements of the Clean Air Act Amendments, Section 113(r).  Employees have been trained of the procedures associated with the processes a"
