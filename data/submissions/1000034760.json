Micronutrients operates under NAICS Code 325188, SIC Code 2819, Dun & Bradstreet Number 049714657, and Taxpayer ID number 35-1972203.    \n\n\n\nAlthough Micronutrients primary business is the manufacture of feedstock supplements (zinc, copper, manganese special blends), etchants used in the printed circuit board industry, agricultural fertilizers, and specialty chemicals are produced for various clients.  \n\n\n\nMicronutrients is dedicated to environmentally sustainable production.  Our patented and proprietary process maximizes the re-use concept of environmental compliance through adaptive uses of current chemical engineering technology.  Micronutrients purchases copper bearing acidic and alkaline etchants from the printed circuit board industry.  This material would otherwise be required to be managed as hazardous waste.  This material is then used in the production of IntelliBond C. The ingredients utilized in Micronutrients feedstock preparation include a proprietary blend of chemicals.  \n\n\n\n\n\nRegulated Substances:\n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is the only ingredient with the potential to cause significant offsite consequences.  Micronutrients anhydrous ammonia tank is stored above ground, and has a 54,000 lb. capacity.  \n\n\n\n  \n\nRelease Scenarios:  \n\n\n\nRMP*Comp was utilized to conduct offsite consequences analysis.  The worst case scenario identified was the failure of the anhydrous ammonia tank.  \n\n\n\nWorst Case Scenario\n\n\n\nEstimated Distance to Toxic Endpoint:    2.6 miles (4.2 kilometers)\n\nThreat type:    Toxic Gas\n\nPhysical State:    Liquefied under pressure\n\nQuantity Released:    54,000 lbs.\n\nRelease Duration:    10 Minutes\n\nRelease Rate:    5,400 lbs. per Minute\n\nToxic Endpoint:    0.14 mg/L\n\nAssumptions:    Wind Speed - 1.5 M / sec"

Micronutrients primarily relies on engineering controls to mitigate potential safety hazards related to the anhydrous ammonia system.  Examples of the engineering controls include relief systems, check valves, scrubbers, manual and automatic shutoffs, interlocks, excess flow valves, and process area detectors.  Administrative controls such as the use of equipment inspections, an active incident investigation program, training program, and audits of safety and operational procedures are present and routinely conducted.  Information concerning our environmental health and safety programs is communicated to employees, customers, and the surrounding community via our website, meetings and management system programs.\n\n\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History:\n\n\n\nMicronutrients maintains records of all incidents that occur at the facility.  To date, Micronutrients has not had a release of anhydrous ammonia off-site.  \n\n\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program:\n\n\n\nMicronutrients maintains a Comprehensive Emergency Response Plan (CERP), which is reviewed annually.  Employees are trained annually in the contents of the CERP.  Evacuation drills are conducted on an as needed basis.   \n\n\n\n \n\nFacility Response and Prevention Policies:\n\n\n\nMicronutrients management system programs tha"
