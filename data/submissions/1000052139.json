The purpose of the PSM/RMP Program is to provide safe operations and make accident prevention systematic throughout the facility and the closed-circuit ammonia refrigeration system. The PSM/RMP Program contains fourteen elements, coordinated through a management system to ensure development, implementation, and integration of the Program?s requirements.

Reddy Ice-East Point has multiple safeguards pertinent to the ammonia refrigeration system. These include machinery room ventilation systems, pressure relief systems, and failsafe controls that shut down the equipment if operating limits are exceeded, and PLC controls that allow the entire refrigeration system to be shut down remotely if required. Ammonia detection units are installed throughout the location to notify employees or offsite personnel in the event of an atmospheric ammonia release. \n\n\n\nReddy Ice-East Point has also developed an Emergency Action Plan (?EAP?) for n the event of an emergency.

The facility utilizes anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant for ice making and product cold storage. \n\n\n\nThe refrigeration operation is a closed-circuit ammonia refrigeration system that consists of two standard designed process loops for the ice making side and the refrigeration side. The system consists of shared compressors, condensers, and main liquid ammonia storage vessels, with secondary storage vessels and icemakers or air-cooling evaporators specific to the systems. Each system has numerous protective controls including process cutouts for motor overload, high temperature and pressure, low temperature and pressure, low oil pressure differential, and high and low liquid levels. Pressure relief valves (\"PRVs\") are installed on all applicable equipment. An atmospheric ammonia release detection system is installed throughout the facility. \n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammonia, when properly used, has proven to be a safe, efficient, and reliable refrigerant. The sharp pungent odor of ammonia provides its own warning agent. Incident involving anhydrous ammonia can be prevented through the facility's program of proper training, knowledge of the equipment and procedures, and conducting preventive maintenance on all ammonia equipment. Reddy Ice has developed and implemented administrative and engineering controls, as well as training programs to reduce the risk of incidents and employee exposure.\n\n\n\nReddy Ice management is committed to operating safe, compliant, and incident free facilities for the protection of its employees, the public, and the environment.

The Maintenance Supervisor is responsible for portions of the program that are closely tied to the refrigeration equipment and operation. An established safety committee presents a monthly safety meeting and assists in addressing any identified safety concerns for the location.\n\n\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT\n\nAs required by the RMP regulations, Reddy Ice-East Point has conducted a comprehensive hazard assessment, which includes offsite consequence analyses (\"OCAs\") for the potential offsite exposure to surrounding areas from an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia. Worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the facility were evaluated based on company and industry history and calculated using the EPA RMP*Comp modeling program. Potentially affected offsite population and facilities were identified.\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe Reddy Ice-East Point facility has not had an ammonia release that requires reporting as part of a five-year accident history. \n\n\n\nEMERGENCY PLANNING AND RESPONSE\n\nReddy Ice-East Point has also developed an Emergency Action Plan (\"EAP\") for n the event of an emergency.
