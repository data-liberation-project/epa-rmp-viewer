The objective is to minimize the risk of a release of a hazardous material and if a release occurs, to minimize the potential impact to  employees, the public and the environment. This objective will be accomplished by utilizing general good operating procedures, providing appropriate training to all employees, and coordinating response activities, as necessary, with the local emergency response providers.\n\nManagement is committed to providing the resources necessary to implement this policy.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\nThis facility utilizes processes raw wheat to produce flour. The raw materials used in the processes are wheat and chlorine gas. Support operations include a chlorine system, a quality control laboratory, and administrative offices.\n\nOne chemical is utilized at the facility, in sufficient quantities to be subject to the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68, RMP. Chlorine is added to enhance the color and baking performance of flour, especially that used in high?ratio cakes where the sugar level is over 120% like cake and cookies.\nChlorine interacts with flour increasing the permeability of the starch granule surface to give greater hydration, increased swelling and gelatinization of the starch, and consequently greater crumb strength. Chlorine addition achieves this end by disrupting the lipid?protein complex on the surface of the starch granule.\n \nThe reaction of raw flour and chlorine is complete within normal application rates of chlorine. There are no by?products or waste prod"

Chlorine used in the treatment of flour is a GRAS ingredient.\n \nWorst-Case and Alternative-Release Scenarios\n\nThe Worst-Case Scenario for the Chester, Illinois location would be a damaged tank valve from the supplier. Each chlorine tank is independent of each other, therefore the loss of multiple tanks at the same time is not considered. This would result in the loss of 1 chlorine cylinder (liquified under pressure) contents of 2,000 pounds released over a duration of 10 minutes.\nThe tanks are located inside a storage room designed for chlorine storage, which acts as a passive mitigation technique and limits the release rate to 110 lbs/min. Due to chlorine being a chemical of interest, normal operating procedure only allows keycard access by qualified, trained, and CVI approved Ardent Mills personnel access to the room. Due to security measures, access doors are closed at all times during operations. A urban terrain type was selected as there are many trees, terrain features, and other obstacles in the immediate area.\nRMP*Comp was used to determine the parameters of the chlorine release, which has a toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/l. The predicted radius of the endpoint is 0.9 miles with 1.5 m/s wind speed with wind stability class F.

This scenario is more plausible than the worst-case scenario based on Ardent Mills operational experience concerning chlorine application systems. \nThis scenario encompasses a damaged pigtail with a 3/8-hole expelling chlorine gas at 33.3 lbs. per minute for a duration of 3 minutes. \nThe release would be inside the concrete block storage room designed for chlorine storage, which acts as a passive mitigation technique and limits the release rate. Additionally, a couple active mitigation measures are employed: emergency shut off actuators are installed on each chlorine cylinder in service on the tank valve. A chlorine gas detector is installed within the chlorine building and will automatically trigger shut off actuators to close each tank valve once a concentration of 4 ppm is detected. Due to chlorine being a chemical of interest, normal operating procedure only allows keycard access by qualified, trained, and CVI approved Ardent Mills personnel access to the building.

Key personnel are responsible for conducting and implementing the findings from the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) for the chlorine system. Only trained and authorized employees or contractors are allowed to perform work on or adjacent to the chlorine system. \n\nThe policy is to construct all new equipment, systems, and facilities in accordance with the most current building and safety codes, as well as conforming to the recommendations of the Chlorine Institute. This ensures the appropriate safety and release prevention systems are included from the beginning of each project. \n\nWe are committed to providing appropriate training to all employees regarding the safety and health consideration of chlorine. Also, each new employee is provided comprehensive safety training during his or her initial orientation for the facility. In addition, we conduct annual safety training for maintenance and system operators specific to the handling and maintenance of the chlorine system. \n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nWe have not had a release of chlorine that has affected the public or the environment.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nDue to the proximity of local responders, we have instituted a \"No Response\" program.
