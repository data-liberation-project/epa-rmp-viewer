ANGUS is located in the northeast corner of Ouachita Parish, near the Town of Sterlington, off of Louisiana Highway 2 on the east bank of the Ouachita River.  Sterlington is a small community of approximately 1,600 inhabitants within the city limits.\n\n\n\nThe ANGUS facility operates 24 hours per day, seven days per week, and it employs approximately 170 full-time employees.  It consists of six separate operating units: a nitroparaffins unit, a nitric acid unit, a nitroparaffins derivatives unit, a crystallization unit, an isopropyl hydroxylamine (IHPA) unit and a hydrogen generation unit.  It also includes a shipping facility that supports the process unit?s needs regarding both incoming raw materials and outgoing products.  There is also a pilot plant that provides research and development support to the manufacturing units.\n\n\n\nANGUS is subject to OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations at 29 CFR 1910.119.  Thus, the required Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) of covered processes has been performed and revalidated in compliance with the applicable regulations. \n\n\n\nANGUS is also subject to the US EPA's chemical accident prevention regulations at 40 CFR Part 68, by virtue of storing, processing and/or handling on site chemical substances, above their threshold quantities, as listed at  40 CFR 68.130.  These regulated substances include four toxics (sulfur dioxide, formaldehyde, chlorine and ammonia) and two flammables (propane and trimethylamine).  ANGUS also manufactures a detonable material, nitromethane.  Although not listed as a regulated substance, ANG"

The prevention of accidental chemical releases is an integral and important part of the ANGUS policies, and it has established a comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers such areas as process design, system installations, operating procedures, maintenance practices, and employee training, as they apply to each one of its operating units and support facilities at the Sterlington location.  \n\n\n\nANGUS ensures the safety of plant operations through the use of process safety management (PSM) techniques, including but not limited to:\n\n\n\n* Periodic process hazard analyses (PHA's) of production, utilities, and shipping operations; \n\n* Strict adherence to Management of Change procedures; \n\n* Strict enforcement of the written standard operating procedures (SOP's); \n\n* Comprehensive and periodic (refresher) training of plant personnel. \n\n* Mechanical integrity programs utilizing predictive and preventive maintenance principles. \n\n* A comprehensive mandatory contractor safety program for contractors. \n\n* An active employee participation program. \n\n* Incidents, including near-misses, are investigated to determine root cause and contributing factors.\n\n\n\n3.0    Emergency Response Strategy\n\n\n\nANGUS takes a proactive approach toward the prevention of incidents, including accidental chemical releases.  As an important element of this approach, ANGUS has developed and implemented a detailed emergency response plan (ERP) that makes it possible to generate a rational, practical, and timely response if an incident does occur.

Worst-Case Scenarios and Alternative Release Scenarios (WCS and ARS, respectively), as defined in the regulations, were developed for each of the covered toxic and flammable substances.  ANGUS also elected to perform an OCA for a detonable substance manufactured at the facility (nitromethane), even though it is not listed in 40 CFR 68.130.  The WCS's showing the largest potential offsite effects were selected (one toxic and one flammable) for entry into the RMP submittal document.  The WCS for nitromethane is maintained in the ANGUS files.  Likewise, the ARS for each of the covered toxics, and an ARS to represent covered flammables, was included.
