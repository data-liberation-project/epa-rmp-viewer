To meet our vision, we conduct our business with respect and care for the environment and without compromising the health and safety of people, whether employees, customers, or citizens around the world. Facility and organization management fully supports the implementation of process safety at the plant. It is our policy to proactively implement appropriate measures to prevent possible releases. If such a release does occur, our first concerns are for the safety of our employees, the safety of the community, and the protection of the environment. Furthermore, it is our policy to work cooperatively with the local fire department on emergency response matters.\n\n\n\nThe facility produces cotton seed. Cotton seed is received from cotton gins, delinted and cleaned, treated, and then packaged for distribution to customers. Anhydrous hydrogen chloride, a regulated substance, is used in the delinting process. \n\n\n\nThe facility has taken the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68. Employees are trained to recognize the hazards of the process and all changes to the process are reviewed to ensure that the safety, health, and environmental consequences of the change are addressed prior to the implementation of the change. The facility is also subject to OSHA's PSM rule. \n\n\n\nThere has been one release of hydrogen chloride in the last five years.  There were no offsite consequences.  Police department did evacuate everyone within one mile of the facility.  The cause of the release was the deterioration of a silver washer in a pressure release value on the AirGas cylinder.  AirGas determined that moisture was in the cylinder at the time the cylinder was filled causing the deterioration.\n\n\n\nThe emergency action plan was followed and the r"
