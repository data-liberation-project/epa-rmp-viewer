As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible and updated as\n\nnecessary.

The facility has three ammonia systems (SER Degreening, NER Cold Storage, and NWER Cold Storage).  \n\n\n\nThe SER Degreening System provides refrigeration capacity to one (1) plate and frame heat exchanger that is used to chill glycol.  The NER Cold Storage System provides refrigeration capacity to three (3) cold storage rooms and one (1) loading dock.  The NWER System provides refrigeration capacity to one (1) cold storage room and (1) packaging room.  Each system has an Allen Bradley PLC that provides substantial control and alarm capability.\n\n\n\nBoth the Degreening and NER Cold Storage Systems are pumped overfeed systems and operate as follows:  high pressure liquid from the high pressure receiver is piped through a series of liquid feed solenoid valves, an expansion valve, and into a liquid recirculator.  From there, low pressure liquid is pumped to each evaporator, where it passes through a solenoid valve, hand expansion valve and into evaporator.  Low temperature liquid circulates through the evaporator.  Low pressure and temperature gas and overfeed liquid passes through an isolation valve and is returned to the liquid recirculator.  The res"

The high pressure discharge from the compressors is sent to a water cooled evaporative condenser where the high pressure gas ammonia is liquefied and returned to a thermosyphon vessel, and from the thermosyphon vessel it returns to the high pressure receiver. High pressure liquid from the thermosyphon vessel is supplied to the oil coolers on each screw compressor. High temperature liquid is evaporated in the oil cooler and a combination of high temperature gas and liquid is returned to the thermosyphon vessel by thermosyphon action.\n\n\n\nThe Wonderful Citrus D1 facility was originally built in the 1998 by California Controlled Atmosphere and has been added to since that time.  Most recently the following projects have occurred:\n\n\n\n2012/2013 - American Incorporated renovated the computer control system (Cold Storage System and Degreening System)\n\n\n\n2012 - American Incorporated installed new evaporative condensers on both systems.\n\n\n\n2012 - American Incorporated installed a new high pressure receiver, screw compressor, cold box, and loading dock (Cold Storage System)\n\n\n\n2013-2014 - American Incorporated installed the NWER System at Wonderful Citrus D1, which provides refrigeration capacity to Cold Box 4 and a packaging room. \n\n\n\nThe NWER System operates as follows: high pressure liquid from the high pressure receiver is piped through a liquid feed solenoid valves, an expansion valve, and into the liquid recirculator.  From there, low pressure liquid is pumped to each evaporator, where it passes through a solenoid valve, hand expansion valve and into an air-cooling evaporator.

The high pressure discharge from the compressors is sent to the water cooled evaporative condenser where the high pressure gas ammonia is liquefied and returned to the high pressure receiver.\n\n\n\nThe NWER System was built in accordance with the 2010 California Mechanical Code. The system contains numerous safety devices including sensors which stop the compressors if temperatures or pressures exceed or drop below established limits, and safety relief valves which vent ammonia gas to a diffusion tank if the pressure in the system exceeds their set point.\n\n\n\nThe ammonia systems at Wonderful Citrus D1 consist of vessels which are interconnected, or which are co-located such that a release of ammonia could impact the ability to operate vessels that are not directly connected.  Therefore, each system is treated as a single process.\n\n\n\n1.3 GENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE & CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\n1.3.1 GENERAL\n\n\n\nWe inform our employees engaged in process operations of the dangers of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia in annual safety meetings. During these meeting we also discuss\n\npreventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\n\n\n\nWonderful Citrus - Delano (D1) Facility has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the ammonia refrigeration process. These are for\n\nthe purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release. The results of the analyses are reported in the body of the program.\n\n\n\n1.3.2 ANHYDROUS AMMONIA\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration process at the Wonderful Citrus - Delano (D1) Facility is an integral part of the overall business and operates most of the year. It is extremely important that this\n\nprocess is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner. Management is committed to making sure t"

These contractors also assist in performing the annual mechanical integrity inspection of our ammonia equipment.\n\n\n\n1.4 FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nWonderful Citrus - Delano (D1) Facility has had no accidental release within the last five (5) years.\n\n\n\n1.5 EMERGENCY ACTION AND RESPONSE PLAN\n\n\n\nWonderful Citrus - Delano (D1) Facility's emergency action and response program has been developed to satisfy the following requirements:\n\n?

A list of current or past due action items can be accessed at any time by those with access to PSMWriter.\n\n\n\nIn addition to utilizing PSMWriter to create, schedule, track, and document events, Wonderful Citrus - Delano (D1) Facility has also entered into a contract with Resource Compliance to obtain\n\nhelp with RMP-PSM program implementation. A copy of Resource Compliance's service agreement has been included in this program with the support material.\n\n\n\nFor the future, Wonderful Citrus - Delano (D1) Facility now thinks of the RMP-PSM program as a \"living document\".
