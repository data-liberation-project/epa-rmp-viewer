Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\n\nWe at John Van Curen Receiver, Merjan Farmlands LLC - Del Rey Plant are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled:\n\nOur facility's primary activities encompass cold storage of fruit.  We have 1 regulated substance present at our facility.  This substance is Ammonia (anhydrous) and is used for our refrigeration system.\n\nThe maximum inventory of Ammonia (anhydrous) at our facility is 34,000.00 lbs.\n\n3.    The Worst Case Release Scenarios and the Alternative Release Scenarios, including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario:\n\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equations.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from Ammonia refrigeration system. In this scenario 34,000 lbs. of Ammonia (anhydrous) is released.  The toxic liquid released is assumed to form a 1-cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to evaporate over 10 minutes.  At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 2.12 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L.\n\nThe alternative release scenari"

Toxic liquid is assumed to be released to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated after 0.10 minutes.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L of Ammonia (anhydrous) is 0.085 miles.\n\n4.    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirement set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1998 Edition.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information:\nJohn Van Curen Receiver, Merjan Farmlands LLC - Del Rey Plant maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis:\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is What If.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of every three years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  The most recent PHA/update was performed on 4/27/2000.\n\nOperating Procedures:\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, John Van Curen Receiver, Merjan Farmlands LLC - Del Rey Plant maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, t"

The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining:\nJohn Van Curen Receiver, Merjan Farmlands LLC - Del Rey Plant has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every year and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity:\nJohn Van Curen Receiver, Merjan Farmlands LLC - Del Rey Plant carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change:\nWritten procedures are in place at John Van Curen Receiver, Merjan Farmlands LLC - Del Rey Plant to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures. The most recent review/revision of maintenance procedures was performed on 4/20/2000.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\nPre-startup Reviews:\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at John Van Curen Receiver, Merjan Farmlands LLC - Del Rey Plant.

Five-year Accident History:\n\nJohn Van Curen Receiver, Merjan Farmlands LLC - Del Rey Plant has an excellent record of preventing accidental releases. Due to our stringent release prevention policies, only one accidental release has occurred during this period.\n\nThere has been only one accidental release of a regulated substance from our facility within the last 5 years. This release took place on 04/17/1997 and involved 15 lbs. of Ammonia (anhydrous).  No deaths or injuries occured offsite as a result of this accident.  Onsite, there were no deaths or injuries.  There was some onsite property damage.\n\n6.    Emergency Response Plan:\n\nJohn Van Curen Receiver, Merjan Farmlands LLC - Del Rey Plant carries a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.\n7.    Planned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\nSeveral developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program.  Ongoing quarterly and monthly safety walk through inspections, training of onsite personnel, and refrigeration industry seminars are some of the major steps we want to take to improve safety at our facility.  These changes are expected to be implemented by 12/29/00.\n"
