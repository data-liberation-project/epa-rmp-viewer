The City of Redding, Wastewater Utilities, has instituted a Process Safety Management (PSM) Program meeting OSHA requirements at 29 CFR 1910.119, covering its disinfection and dechlorination process.  This constitutes the general accidental release prevention program for the City of Redding's operations.  The program and document management procedures included in the PSM Program are used as the management system for the Risk Management Program.\n\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC RELEASE PREVENTION STEPS\n\nRelease prevention steps specific to chlorine and sulfur dioxide have been identified and implemented.  This includes, among other things, changing the chlorine and sulfur dioxide systems with pressure gas piping and vacuum regulators mounted to the walls to a vacuum system where the vacuum regulators are directly mounted to the ton containers, and the system to the injector only works under vacuum.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no reportable accidents involving chlorine or sulfur dioxide at this facility within the past five years.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe City of Redding's Emergency Response Program applicable to chlorine and sulfur dioxide has been coordinated with Redding Hazmat. The City of Redding, Utilities Department, maintains First Responder capability with respect to chlorine and sulfur dioxide releases at its facilities.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE"

      "SummaryText": "stored in separate rooms inside an enclosed building that is dedicated to chlorine and sulfur dioxide.  The chlorine is used for odor control of the influent wastewater, to disinfect the wastewater effluent, and for other process uses.  The sulfur dioxide is used to dechlorinate the disinfected effluent for aquatic toxicity control.  Pressurized gas within each ton container is reduced to vacuum using a vacuum regulator valve mounted directly onto the ton container's gas valve.  The gas, under vacuum from up to two one-ton containers, is connected to one of two manifolds where it is metered through rate valves and rotameters in chlorinators or sulfonators located in a separate room.  For chlorine, the gas is drawn into water solution by the passage of pressurized water through an injector inside the dedicated building.  In the case of sulfur dioxide, the gas under partial vacuum travels underground in PVC piping to the outfall building up to 1 mile away. It is injected into the water and then added to the outfall pipe shortly before the final effluent is discharged into the Sacramento River.\n\nThe City removed sulfur dioxide in 2023 due to a lack of chemical being available.  This RMP employs predictive filing for sulfur dioxide and would return tusing this chemical if it becomes available again.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nIt is the policy of the City of Redding that the receipt, storage, and handling of chlorine and sulfur dioxide at its facility be done in a manner which meets regulatory requirements and minimizes the probability and severity of accidental releases of chlorine to the atmosphere, in order to protect the health and safety of its workers, the public, and the environment.  In order to accomplish this goal, the City of Redding has:\n\u00bfgathered safety information on chlorine and sulfur dioxide and on the process, equipment, and procedures involving chlorine and sulfur dioxide; \n\u00bf\tperformed a structured assessment of haz"

A Risk Management Program:\n  - identifies the equipment, procedures, maintenance, inspection, and training associated with Regulated Substances (RS's) handled at this facility in excess of Federal threshold quantities; \n  - describes the structured assessment of hazards which was conducted to assess possible onsite effects on employees and offsite public and environmental receptors; \n  - provides the results of an offsite consequences analysis.  \nIt defines a prevention program, emergency response program, and mitigation measures to reduce the probability and magnitude of accidental releases of RS's; and establishes a schedule and responsibilities for implementing mitigation measures, including auditing the program.

Stillwater Wastewater Treatment Plant is located at 6475 Airport Rd, Anderson, CA, in Shasta County. It uses chlorine and sulfur dioxide for effluent disinfection and dechlorination prior to its release to the Sacramento River.  Both chemicals are stored and used onsite in quantities greater than the Federal threshold quantity limits.
