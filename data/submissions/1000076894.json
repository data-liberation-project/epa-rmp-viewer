      "SummaryText": "but only one accident is included in the TCPA/RMP 5-year accident history as explained below.\r\n\r\nOn May 10, 2016, an explosion occurred during steam distillation to remove trace amounts of xylene from the product. There were no injuries and no offsite impacts. The concentration of epichlorohydrin in the process was only 0.027% at the time of the event.  This accident is not included in the 5-year accident history because the concentration of epichlorohydrin was less than 1%.  The explosion was caused by the presence of hydrogen peroxide in the process and the formation of an unstable organic peroxide.  Hydrogen peroxide has been removed from the facility as a corrective action.\r\n\r\nOn January 7, 2017, a batch of epoxy resin started foaming in one of the reactors. The vent system filled with foam and approximately 200 gallons of batch material with a nominal composition of 50% epichlorohydrin entered the vent system.  The foam eventually reached the scrubber and overflowed into secondary containment.  Three employees were sent to the occupational health clinic as a precaution and recorded on the OSHA log as 3 lost work days.  There were no offsite impacts. The formation of foam was caused by a flow control valve passing through and high flow of nitrogen going to the reactor. The nitrogen flow control valve was replaced as a corrective action.\r\n\r\nThe Huntsman Maple Shade facility is operated as an RMP Program 3 facility.  Engineering and operational controls are described below.\r\n\r\nProcess safety information includes process flow diagrams, piping and instrument diagrams, electrical input/output diagrams, fire water system piping diagrams, equipment specifications, and chemical safety data sheets.\r\n\r\nThe most recent process hazard analysis (PHA) and layers of protection analysis (LOPA) was conducted in March 2017 using the hazard and operability study (HAZOP) methodology.  Huntsman hired an outside engineering firm to facilitate the PHA/LOPA.\r\n\r\nWritten standard operati"

Training topics include hazard communication, emergency response, safe work permits, personal protective equipment, respiratory protection, and use of portable fire extinguishers.\r\n\r\nMechanical integrity and preventive maintenance procedures are in place to assure the reliability of process equipment via testing and inspection, and a computerized work order system is utilized to keep records of equipment repairs.\r\n\r\nSafety and environmental incidents are documented and serious incidents are investigated to determine the root cause and identify corrective actions to prevent a recurrence.\r\n\r\nSafe work permits are utilized for hot work, energy isolation (lockout tagout), breaking lines, and confined space entry.\r\n\r\nContractors are pre-qualified, trained, and evaluated by Huntsman to ensure that they are qualified to work at the facility.  Contractors are required to follow Huntsman policies and procedures.\r\n\r\nManagement of change (MOC) includes a process change authorization checklist to assure that safety and environmental considerations are addressed.  Process change authorizations must be reviewed and approved by facility management.  Affected employees must be notified of process changes and trained if necessary.  Process safety information and standard operating procedures must also be updated as necessary.\r\n\r\nPre-startup safety reviews (PSSRs) are conducted prior to startup of new equipment or processes to assure that safety and environmental risks have been addressed.\r\n\r\nThe following projects are planned for improvement of the process safety management program at the facility.\r\n\r\nA foam suppression system was installed in the bulk storage tank farms for fi"

The suppression system includes monitors to enable the foam to be activated automatically in the event of a fire, and to trip the fire alarm to notify employees and emergency responders.  The sprinkler system in the main building contains a foam system, and sprinkler heads under each of the reactor vessels.\r\n\r\nThe ventilation system was upgraded in September 2019 to reduce the chances of an explosive vapor cloud from forming in the event of a leak from process equipment.  The ventilation system increased the air recirculation rate in the main building and direct the air flow from the roof level down to the floor level, and will exhaust from the floor level."

      "SummaryText": "Huntsman Advanced Materials Americas, LLC. (Huntsman) purchased the Maple Shade, New Jersey facility in June 1995 and began operations in June 1996.  Huntsman manufactures specialty epoxy monomers and resins based on epichlorohydrin chemistry.\r\n\r\nEpichlorohydrin is the only listed RMP and TCPA substance that is handled by Huntsman above the threshold quantity.  Epichlorohydrin is the basic building block used in epoxy manufacturing and provides the basis for the facility risk management and accident prevention programs.  Epichlorohydrin is handled at the facility in bulk in quantities that do not exceed 499,999 pounds.  Epichlorohydrin is stored in tote bins, one 15,000-gallon tank for fresh epichlorohydrin, three 2,000-gallon tanks for recycled epichlorohydrin, one 7,500-gallon tank for recycled epichlorohydrin, and two 1,500-gallon tanks for recovered epichlorohydrin.  Process equipment includes one 1,200-gallon reactor, one 2,000-gallon reactor, one 13,500-gallon reactor, two 4,100-gallon reactors, and one 3,000-gallon holding tank.\r\n\r\nThe epoxy resins and monomers (modifiers) produced by Huntsman are used primarily in the specialty coatings industry.  Applications include civil engineering coatings such as floor coatings, tank and secondary containment linings, and structural steel primers.  Other common uses include adhesives, and specialty automotive and aviation coatings and composites.\r\n\r\nThe Huntsman facility is designed and operated to minimize the potential for safety and environmental impacts to employees and the surrounding community.  Huntsman has demonstrated a commitment to safety and environmental compliance by involving employees and third-party engineering firms in the principals of process safety management.  In 2017, Huntsman partnered with Delaware Technical Community College (DTCC) to provide 16 hours of process safety training for every operator in the plant.\r\n\r\nIn the past 5 years, Huntsman has had two accidents in the covered process area,"
