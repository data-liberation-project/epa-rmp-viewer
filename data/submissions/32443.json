The Offsite consequence analysis modeling was \n\nperformed based on the following principle elements:\n\n\n\nA.   Meteorological parameters for the dispersion modeling analysis\n\n     were determined using National Weather Service data collected at\n\n     the Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport.  Highest daily\n\n     maximum temperature and average relative humidity over the last\n\n     three-year period were used for worst-case scenarios.  Typical\n\n     meteorological conditions based on the data over the last \n\n     three-year period were used for alternative release scenarios.\n\n\n\nB.   Total quantity in the single largest tank was used for chlorine\n\n     and sulfur dioxide worst-case scenarios.  A leak from a liquid\n\n     line near the outdoor storage tank was assumed for either\n\n     chlorine or sulfur dioxide alternative release scenario.\n\n\n\nC.   No mitigation measure was considered in worst-case scenarios. \n\n     The excess flow valve, however, was considered for either\n\n     chlorine or sulfur dioxide alternative release scenario.\n\n\n\nD.

Distance to the flammable endpoint for methane scenario was\n\n     determined using a TNT-equivalent model.\n\n\n\nG.   Offsite impact was evaluated with LANDVIEW III for each release\n\n     scenario.\n\n\n\nSince there has been no major process change, as described in previous\n\nreport, new modelling efforts are therefore not required. The meteorological \n\nconditions, source parameters and dispersion modelling analysis will \n\nbe similar as submitted in the report mentioned above.\n\n\n\nRe-eveluation of offsite impacts on population, public and environmental\n\nreceptors are necessary because of potential population changes as well \n\nas other public developments since the previous report five years ago. \n\nHence the recent Census and mapping data contained in latest LANDVIEW 6\n\nsoftware was used to re-evaluate the offsite impacts for each scenario\n\ndeveloped in the previous report.\n\n\n\nThe accidental release of sulfur dioxide from a storage tank is\n\nconsidered the worst-case scenario. A distance of 5.3 miles between\n\nthe release source and the toxic endpoint was modeled in the offsite\n\nconsequence analysis.

Implementation of corrective actions recommended during the most\n\n     recent hazard review completed on April 22, 2004.  This effort is\n\n     one of the most important steps for preventing a chemical release\n\n     or minimize its effects on plant personnel or the public.\n\n\n\nC.   Regular review and revision of operating procedures to address\n\n     the safely operating procedures for regulated process systems,\n\n     including all eight (8) elements set forth in the regulation. \n\n     When combined with the operator training program, current\n\n     operating procedures are essential in  ensuring safe operation of\n\n    "
