      "SummaryText": "(a)  ACCIDENTAL RESEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nCytec is a leader among chemical manufacturers in its safety, health and environmental programs.  Our commitment to protect our employees and the communities that are home to our operations is an integral part of Cytec's way of doing business.  Cytec has established safety, health, emergency response and environmental policies and standards to meet or exceed all regulatory requirements.  As a member of the Chemical Manufacturers' Association (CMA), Cytec subscribes to the codes established for Responsible Care (R).\n\n(b)  THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLES\n\nOur facility has three plants that involve regulated substances.\n\nThe Resins Plant makes products that are used as raw materials in the coatings and adhesives industries.  The regulated substance involved with this operation is formaldehyde.\n\nThe CYRO Plant makes products that are used to make medical devices and food packaging.  The regulated substance involved with this operation is acrylonitrile.\n\nThe AC Molding plant makes products that are used as raw materials to make wall plates, buttons and dinnerware.  The regulated substance involved with this operation is formaldehyde.\n\n(c)  WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nThe toxic worst-case scenario is the failure of a rail car and the release of 204,000 pounds of acrylonitrile.  The mitigating effects of a berm, drain and a sump were included in the evaluation of the possible consequences.  The evaporating acrylonitrile could reach offsite endpoints and nearby public and environmental receptors.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for acrylonitrile is the failure of an unloading line from a railcar and the release of 4,080 pounds of material.  The mitigating effects of a drain, sump, spill pan, emergency shutdown system, fixed fire water monitors and the plant fire department response were included in the evaluation of the possible consequences.

The mitigating effects of a drain, sump, spill pan, emergency shutdown system, fixed fire water monitors and the plant fire department response were included in the evaluation of the consequences.  The evaporating formaldehyde would not reach off-site endpoints and nearby public and environmental receptors.\n\n(d)  THE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RESEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nCytec's general accidental release prevention program includes:\n\n- EPA 40 CFR 68 - Risk Management Plans\n- OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119 - Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals\n- OSHA 29 CFR 1910.120 - Hazardous Waste Operations & Emergency Response\n- Other EPA, OSHA, DOT and State regulations\n- Generally recognized & accepted engineering codes and standards, and\n- Cytec Safety, Health, Environmental and Engineering standards.\n\nThe following engineering and administrative controls help prevent a release of acrylonitrile and formaldehyde:\n\n- Operating procedures and constant attendance during transfer operations by trained personnel\n- High level controls with automatic shutoffs\n- Computer control system with safety and environmental interlocks\n- Multiple level indicators in storage tanks and production vessels.\n\n\n(e)  5-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no incidents at the Wallingford Plant that meet the criteria for reporting in the five-year accident history.\n\nI\n(f) EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe Wallingford Plant has an extensive emergency response program.  This program outlines actions to be taken by operating department, maintenance, utilities, office, technical, visitors, contractors, and plant emergency response employees.  This information can be found in the CYTEC, WALLINGFORD PLANT, EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN.  The onsite CYTEC Fire Department drills on various scenarios with the Town of Wallingford'"

Drills with the Wallingford Fire Department are conducted at least four times a year and hands-on-training (i.e. structural fire fighting) is provided by Town Fire Service Instructors at least twice a year.  In addition, CYTEC Emergency Response teams help provide training in hazardous materials to the Town of Wallingford Fire Department personnel.\n\n(g)  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nCYTEC Industries is constantly striving to upgrade its processes, control technology, employee training, inspection, repair and maintenance of process equipment in order to improve safety.  We are also executing a well organized plan to ensure minimum possible negative impact from Y2K."
