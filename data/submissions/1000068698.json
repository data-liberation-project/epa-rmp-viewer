      "SummaryText": "PLM Operations, LLC dba Paleteria La Michoacana, Modesto, California Facility (La Michoacana) is located at 2068 Lapham Drive, Modesto, California, approximately 50 yards south of State Highway 132 (Yosemite Boulevard) and is approximately 300 yards west of Mitchell Road. The Facility produces and stores ice cream products. Anhydrous ammonia is used in the refrigeration systems at the Facility. La Michoacana has developed a California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program in general accordance with the requirements of California Health & Safety Code, Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4, and Federal EPA requirements, 40 CFR Part 68 Risk Management Plan (RMP), and federal OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) 29 CFR 1910.119 and California OSHA 8 CCR 5189 to enhance already existing anhydrous ammonia safety and emergency action programs. Paleteria La Michoacana was purchased by PLM Operations, LLC in 2017. A new management team was hired after the company transfer to PLM Operations, LLC. La Michoacana has been committed to worker and public safety through investment in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the ammonia refrigeration systems. La Michoacana policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. La Michoacana will rely on support services provided by the local fire department and the Stanislaus County Hazardous Materials Response team in the unlikely event that a chemical release does occur at the Facility.\n\n\n\nProcess Descriptions\n\nLa Michoacana has two anhydrous ammonia refrigeration systems at the Facility. The two ammonia refrigeration systems are identified as follows: The Versaline System and the Plant System, which is a remodeled and expanded two-pressure system that will serve a majority of the Facility's cooling needs. The Versaline System and the Plant System are shown separately in the CalARP Registration Form. Howe"

An ammonia leak detection system and an ammonia diffusion tank are ancillary systems that support the process.\n\n\n\nThe Versaline System, has been reduced in charge size to 1,500 pounds of ammonia and only serves a brine cooling system. The recirculator package, high pressure receiver, two Vilter compressors and all evaporator coolers from Freezers 1 & 2 and the +34-degree cold box that were originally a part of this system have either been removed or disconnected from the Versaline System and connected to Plant System.\n\n\n\nThe Versaline System is composed of the following key components:\n\n&#159;    1 Condenser\n\n&#159;    1 Control Pressure Receiver\n\n&#159;    1 Oil Pot\n\n&#159;    1 FES Compressor \n\n&#159;    1 Chiller Evaporator w/Accumulator Vessel\n\n&#159;    1 Liquid Transfer Vessel\n\n\n\nThe Versaline System operation cycle begins at the control-pressure receiver where liquid ammonia is fed to the chiller evaporator. At this point, the ammonia flashes down to saturation temperature, then is pumped from the chiller evaporator where it absorbs heat from the brine. Vapor is returned to the compressor and compressed and the pressure is increased to condensing pressure. The superheated compressor discharge travels through the evaporative condenser where the ammonia gas gives up its heat and is condensed to a liquid and returned to the control-pressure receiver to begin the cycle once again.\n\n \n\nThe Plant System has two different operating pressures with an estimated charge of 13,300 pounds. One pressure is referred to as the medium temperature at +20 degrees F, which serves both air handlers on the roof and the +34-degree cold box. The second operating pressure (-50 degrees F) serves the two (-15 degrees) freezers for product storage, four ice cream freezers, and one spiral quick freeze tunnel. The Plant System is composed of the following key components:\n\n&#159;    1- Condenser BAC Model VC2-887\n\n&#159;    1- High Pressure Recei"

The superheated compressor discharge travels through the evaporative condenser where the ammonia gas gives up its heat and is condensed to a liquid and returned to the high-pressure receiver to begin the cycle once again.\n\n\n\nHazard Assessment Summary\n\nThe CalARP and federal RMP regulations require facilities to identify and evaluate chemical release scenarios resulting from potential failures of the chemical handling systems covered by the CalARP/RMP Programs. Facilities are required to evaluate a worst-case release scenario (release parameters are defined by the regulations) and an alternative release scenario. The regulations define a worst-case release scenario as \"...the greatest amount held in a single vessel...released as a gas over 10 minutes.\" An alternative release scenario is identified as a release that is more likely to occur at the Facility. An alternative release scenario must be evaluated for each covered process. Therefore, since the two systems are considered to be one process, only one alternative release scenario is required. This Facility has prepared worst-case and alternative release scenarios. These are not summarized herein as recommended by EPA, but are presented in the CalARP/RMP Program.\n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no reportable releases of ammonia at the La Michoacana Facility in the past 5 years. \n\n\n\nPrevention Program Elements \n\nAs part of the implementation of this CalARP/RMP Program, key Prevention Program elements were implemented by La Michoacana to manage process safety issues associated with the use of ammonia for refrigeration. In addition, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are currently utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed. The CalARP/RMP Prevention Program elements include the following:\n\n&#159;    Management System\n\n&#159;    Offsite Consequence Analysis\n\n&#159;    Five Year Accident History\n\n&#159"
