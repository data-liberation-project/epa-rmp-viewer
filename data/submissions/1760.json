Our freezing process uses the thermal medium Anhydrous Ammonia that is alternately compressed and condensed in a closed system to develop the low tempertatures operating our freezers.  We currently have 20,000 pounds of Anhydrous Ammonia contained in our freezing system.\n\nEquity Group has implemented a written safety and health program that covers hazardous communication, personal protective equipment, hearing conservation, respiratory protection, bloodborne pathogens, lockout/tagout, confined space, hot work, and forklift training to insure the well being and safety of all of our employees.  Along with these programs, Equity Group has an in house emergency response team that has been trained and equipped to the level of Hazardous Materials Technician (level A) to handle limited chemical emergencies.  We also have CPR and First Aid trained personnel to assist with emergencies that could occur at the facility.  Every employee at the facility receives initial new hire orientiation training and then annually, a refresher training session on all of the programs.\n\nEquity Group has also implemented a Process Safety Management Program to address the proper operation, maintenance, and modification procedures to the Anhydrous Ammonia System.  All preventative maintenance on the system is maintained and driven by a computerized preventative maintenance program.  The Anhydrous Ammonia system is also required to have non-destructive testing conducted to insure that the system is maintaning its integrity.\n\nThis system was installed in 1995 and to date has not had any reportable incidents involving the release of Anhydrous Ammonia.\n\nWe have a good working relationship with the North Baltimore Fire Department who will be providing services in the event of an emergency.  They have toured the facility to familia"
