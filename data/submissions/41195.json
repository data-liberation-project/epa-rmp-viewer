Over the past years. HCWD#1 has spent $20,000 for a building to store and confine 2,000 lb(4total) chlorine cyclinders to minimize escaping cl2 gas,a cl2 gas detector was installed to instantly set off alarms if a cl2 leak is detected over 3 ppm ( parts per million) so HCWD#1 could take immediate action to notify surrounding residences, police, medical personnel, fire department, and local government agencies.                                                                                                                                                    PWP's plan for accidental prevention is following Standard Operating Procedures(s.o.p.'s) in handling cl2, daily inspections by the operators of the equipment used in the processes and routine maintenance on the equipment used on the processes. Reviewing chlorine handling safety video's, periodically reviewing sop's. Emergency responce procedures at our facility is as follows.\n1.   Verify leak visually with ammmonia or smell(assuming there is no obvious visible plume.                                                            \n\n2. Notify the facility Emergency Response Coordinator or the alternate of the potential problem.\n\n3. Put on appropriate personal protective equipment (ppe).If it's a controlled small leak and plant personel can't stop the leak by closing the main valve they are to notify JONES CHEMICAL of the situation so they can dispatch thier emergency response team/tank repair personel.                                                                        \n\n\n4.

In the event phone contact is unobtainable via cell phone, contact the HCWD#1 main office (270-351-3222) by radio and advise the operator on duty there to contact Mr. RHODES immediately.\n\n8. Once evacuated from the plant and as soon as the RHODES family has been notified, plant personnel are to begin notifying the people and/or agencies identified on pages q-7-11-2 and q-7-11-3 and on q-7-11 form for the plant.\n\n9.When contacting emergency services, personnel on site should provide the following information:\n\nA. Identify who you are.\nB. Identify the plant location.\nC. Identify your location.\nD. Advise as to the nature of the emergency (chlorine leak).\nE.
