In addition, the largest unit is enclosed in a building.  Release of the entire amount of ammonia on plant site, which represents the worst-case scenario,  would leave our plant site; however, no public or environmental receptors are within the exposure distance.  Model used:  EPA's RMP Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration Reference Tables or Equations.\n\n  \u00c2\u00bf  Epichlorohydrin - Failure of the storage tank filled with the largest amount possible would release the substance into a concrete dike that limits the exposed surface area of the liquid pool and thus reduces the release rate.  No public or environmental receptors are within the exposure distance resulting from the worst case release.

Failure of the cylinder would release the substance into the room.  A population of 418 would be affected by this release which consists only of residences with no schools, hospitals, prisons, recreation areas, office areas, or industrial areas in the impacted zone.  This cylinder could not catastrophically fail since it can withstand impact of a locomotive.  No environmental receptors are within the distance to the endpoint.

It would take a leak of 100 lbs. to impact any public receptors.  VanDeMark Chemical Company Inc controls cylinder leaks through detailed mechanical integrity of these vessels.  A leak repair kit is maintained on the Martin plant site.  The plant\u00c2\u00bfs Fire and Emergency Brigade is trained in the use of this leak repair kit.  No leaks of this chemical have ever been experienced outside the manufacturing area.\n\nWe are using this information to help us ensure that our emergency response plan and the community emergency response plan address all reasonable contingency cases.\n\n\n4  GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PRVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe Martin plant complies with all EPA Regulations at 40 CFR Part 68; OSHA Regulations at 29 CFR 1910; Clean Water Act Regulations at 40 CFR 112; RCRA Regulations at 40 CFR 264, 265, & 279.52; and EPCRA Rules and Laws.  We maintain a number of programs to help prevent accidental releases and ensure safe operation.  Leadership by senior management through policy, participation, communications, and resource commitments provide results in achieving continuous improvement of performance.\n\nAccident prevention programs are maintained through the Works Management Safety Committee, Works Employee Safety Committee, Works Management Inspection Committee, Process Safety Management Task Force, and the Executive Safety Review Committee.  Safety objectives are an annual part of the Martin Results Sharing Success.  Clear accountability for safety performance"

The initial stages of the 5S program should be completed by the end of 2009.\n\n    \u00c2\u00bf  SOCMA ChemStewards EHS&S Management System -- The Martin Plant has recently been certified for the SOCMA ChemStewards EHS&S Management System.  \n\n    \u00c2\u00bf  Air Monitoring Program - The Martin Plant's Safety Officer has an Industrial Hygiene program to monitor surrounding environments in manufacturing during processes that use highly hazardous materials.  All production procedures have been reviewed to identify potential employee exposures.  Low hazardous materials and previously monitored materials will be reviewed during subsequent years.  It is anticipated that within a five year span, all materials at Martin will have been monitored.\n\n  \u00c2\u00bf  ESH Compliance Audit - In September 2006, a plant wide ESH compliance audit was conducted at Martin to determine if any deficiencies exist.  The resulting audit document was updated with a corrective action plan.  All corrective actions from this audit have been completed.  The audit team was made up of safety, health and environmental professionals from within the corporation. Another ESH compliance audit is scheduled for September 2009."

      "SummaryText": "5  FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere has never been a worst-case scenario type event in our history at Martin.  No offsite incidents have ever occurred.  No serious incidents have taken place within the manufacturing unit; however, OSHA recordable accidents have occurred.  We keep records for all accidental chemical releases that occur at Martin.  There have not been any accidental chemical releases involving materials covered under EPA's Risk Management Program rule during the past five years.  \n\n\n6  EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe Martin plant maintains an integrated emergency response plan, which consolidates all of the various federal, state, and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning.  Our program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting employees, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  In addition, we coordinate our plan with community emergency response plans and local responders.  We maintain a mutual aid agreement with the three surrounding fire departments.  \n\nAll Martin plant Fire and Emergency Brigade members are trained in emergency response, fire fighting, Hazmat requirements, and must pass a physical exam.  The plant has an extensive fire fighting system with fixed monitor nozzles, hoses, foam generating capability, and sprinkler systems.  We maintain an E-1, 1,500-gallon pumper, 110-ft. ladder truck equipped with radio and cellular phone systems, emergency response, and decontamination materials.  Emergency response personnel are trained in first aid and CPR.\n\n\n7   PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe following is a list of key improvements that the Martin plant is committed to implementing to help prevent and better respond to accidental chemical releases:\n\n  \u00c2\u00bf  Formal safety and awareness meetings \u00c2\u00bf Safety meeting are held eight times each month to ensure that full coverage to the shift workers is available.  100% attendance is required for all site personnel.\n\n  \u00c2"

      "SummaryText": "is part of each employee's annual review.\n\nUse of the Community Awareness and Emergency Response (CAER) process assures public comments and concerns are considered in both design and operation of the plant's process safety systems.  All elements of the EPA and PSM programs are used to ensure sufficient layers of protection exist through technology, facilities and personnel to prevent escalation from a single failure to a catastrophic event.\n\nAll plant operators are trained and certified in the jobs that they do.  Every employee has the authority to shutdown any process or to stop any job, in order to maintain a safe operation.  Training programs cover job specific tasks, principles of chemical processing, safety, and regulatory issues.\n\nAll plant process equipment is subjected to EPA and OSHA mechanical integrity inspections to look for corrosion or wear.  All storage and process vessels are protected against over-pressure by safety relief valves.  Process shutdown systems are built-in to our process control computers. These safety devices and shutdown systems are periodically inspected and tested.  Predictive Maintenance techniques are utilized to address problems before they happen.  All plant modifications and procedure changes undergo a management of change process that involves operator, maintenance, engineering, technical and management review.  \n\nIn the unlikely event of a release, we feel the best method of protection for our community is to shelter in place away from the hazard.  We have prepared our community by publishing the steps they should take during a chemical release from our plant boundaries.\n\nThese individual elements of our prevention program work together to prevent accidental chemical releases.  Our company and our employees are committed to the standard that these management systems dictate the way we do business, and we have specific accountabilities and controls to ensure that we are meeting our own high standards for accident prevention."
