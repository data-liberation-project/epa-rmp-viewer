      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\nFacility Information \n\nThe Chicago Specialties plant has approximately 130 employees.  The facility produces \norganic dyes and pigments and intermediate cyclic organics.  Chicago Specialties uses \nthree regulated chemicals in processes above threshold quantities.  The facility uses \nsulfur trioxide as a feed material in the manufacture of paracresol, and sulfur dioxide as a \ndiluent in the paracresol process.  The facility stores up to 215,000 pounds of sulfur \ntrioxide in an indoor storage vessel, and up to 50,000 pounds of sulfur dioxide in an \noutdoor storage vessel.  The facility also uses anhydrous ammonia as a feed material in \nthe production of isopthalonitrile.  The regulated anhydrous ammonia process is a storage \nvessel, which can store up to 175,000 pounds of the material.  \n\nRisk Management Planning\n\nIn addition to our existing information sharing practices, Community Right-to-Know, \nemissions inventories, and Title V Permit, Chicago Specialties shares information \nregarding the chemicals used and their associated risk with the public.  The facility uses \nboth passive and active mitigation to minimize the likelihood of releases and their impact \nto the public and to the environment.  These mitigation systems emergency shutdown \nequipment and revised operating procedures and equipment for the covered sulfur \ndioxide process.  The sulfur trioxide process uses dikes, sumps, emergency shutdown \nequipment, and a CO2 cryogenic mitigation system, which entails freezing the material if \nreleased.\n\nAccident History and Safety Improvements\n\nThe table below lists Chicago Specialties' five-year accident history of all accidental \nreleases from covered processes, which resulted in off-site evacuations, shelter-in-place, \nproperty or environmental damage, injuries, or significant property damage on-site.  The \nincident in 1997 occurred on August 4.  During the incident a transfer hose failure \nreleased 8,500 pounds of sulfur trioxide in to the envir"

There \nwere no deaths or off-site property damage associated with this accident. \n\nThe facility conducted an extensive safety review after the incident.  Chicago Specialties \nhas determined that the most likely cause of the accident was water the unloading \nconnections of the tanker truck, which was loading sulfur trioxide into the facility's \nstorage tank.  The facility has subsequently installed several safety measures to reduce \nthe likelihood of a reoccurrence of this type of incident: improved and upgraded \nequipment involved in the process, revised training, maintenance, emergency response \nplans, and operating procedures.  The facility also installed new mitigation systems, \nwhich significantly reduced the risk of such an occurrence happening again.  \nChicago Specialties' 5-year Accident History\n\nThe five year accident history was prepared in accordance with 68.42.  The accidents \nreported in the RMP data elements only include accidents related to a regulated chemical \n(SO2, SO3 or Anhydrous Ammonia) that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant \nproperty damage on-site or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in \nplace, property damage, or environmental damage.  There were four releases of regulated \nchemicals in the past five years.  Only the August 04, 1997 release meets the \nrequirements of 68.42 for a release which must be reported.\n\nYear    1994    1995    1996    1997    1998\nNumber    0    0    0    1    0\n\nPrevention Program\n\nChicago Specialties believes the best way to manage risk is to prevent accidents.  \nChicago Specialties has performed a HAZOP analysis to identify and reduce the risk \nposed by the RMP covered processes.  The prevention program will continue to reduce \nthe risk through improved safety.  Chicago Specialties' process safety management \nprogram includes but is not limited to; process safety information, operating procedures, \ntr"

Chicago Specialties has prepared an extensive \nwritten emergency response plan.  Specifically, the emergency response plan works to \nminimize the amount of material released to the environment and to establish control and \nmitigation of any releases in an expedited manner while communicating the nature of the \nincident to the public and local agencies.\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nThe RMP rule requires development of scenarios or examples for an accidental release of each RMP regulated chemical.
