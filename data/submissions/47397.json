The following are brief summaries of these scenarios, including information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the exposure distances for each scenario:\n\n\nRelease Scenarios - Regulated Toxic Chemicals\n\nAmmonia\n\nThe release scenario involves failure of an unloading hose releasing 500 pounds of ammonia.  Using typical weather conditions specified by USEPA ( Class D stability, 25 degrees C, 3.0 meters per second wind), the OCA Guidance estimates that the ammonia could travel 0.3 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a significant hazard to the public.  Within the potentially affected area are portions of the community of Mt. Airy and one industrial facility.  Active mitigation measures considered under this scenario include the excess flow valves installed in the ammonia transfer piping system. \n\nAcrylonitrile\n\nThe release scenario involves failure of an unloading hose releasing 8,310 pounds of acrylonitrile.  Using typical weather conditions specified by USEPA ( Class D stability, 25 degrees C, 3.0 meters per second wind), the OCA Guidance estimates that the acrylonitrile could travel 0.5 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a significant hazard to the public.  Within the potentially affected area are: one school (Garyville Mt. Airy Math and Science Magnet School); portions of the community of Mt. Airy;  and one industrial facility.  Active mitigation measures considered under this scenario include the automated shutoff valves installed in the acrylonitrile transfer piping system; passive mitigation measures considered under this scenario include the drains and sump under the unloading area. \n\nEpichlorohydrin\n\nThe release scenario involves failure of an unloading hose releasing 7,300 pounds of epichlorohydrin.

Active mitigation measures considered under this scenario include the automated shutoff valves installed in the epichlorohydrin transfer piping system; passive mitigation measures considered under this scenario include the drains and sump under the unloading area.\n\nFormaldehyde\n\nThe release scenario involves failure of an unloading hose releasing10,000 pounds of formaldehyde solution.  Using typical weather conditions specified by USEPA ( Class D stability, 25 degrees C, 3.0 meters per second wind), the OCA Guidance estimates that the formaldehyde could travel 0.5 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a significant hazard to the public.

The OCA Guidance estimates that, if the release were to result in a vapor cloud explosion, it would affect an area within 0.06 miles of the tank.

The following is a brief summary of accidental chemical releases involving materials covered under EPA's RMP rule during the past five years (2000 - present):\n\nThere have been no accidental chemical releases involving these materials above their Regulated Quantity (RQ) at our facility in the last five years.  There have been several small releases of acrylonitrile, ammonia and formaldehyde.  None of these resulted in injuries to employees, nor did any affect the community or environment.  After each of these incidents, we conducted formal incident investigations to identify and correct the root causes of the event.  None of these incidents met the requirements to be reported under EPA's RMP.\n\n\n6.0 Emergency Response Plan\n\nWe maintain a contingency plan, which consolidates all of the various federal, state, and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning.
