The facility has a written Emergency Action and Fire Prevention Plan.  In the case of an emergency, it is facility policy to contact 911 or the North Callaway Fire Protection District, requesting that they respond to the emergency.  Callaway Propane, LLC is also to be contacted for propane emergencies.  Employees are not required to respond to fires or releases of regulated substances.  The facility also maintains a robust training schedule, including safety training conducted by dedicated staff and outside vendors.  \n\n\n\nA description of your facility and the regulated substances handled:  This facility is a biomedical research facility consisting of several buildings on roughly 600 acres of land.  The facility has two regulated processes, consisting of non-interconnected above-ground bunkers (blast walls) with 1000-gallon propane tanks that are filled up to 88% capacity.\n\n\n\nThe worst-case release scenario:  The worst-case release scenario is failure of a storage tank when filled to 88% capacity, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  Since the facility is located in a relatively remote, unoccupied area, the worst-case scenario would not affect anyone beyond facility property.  \n\n\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:  This facility complies with EPA provisions regarding accident prevention, as well as all applicable state and local codes and regulations.  The propane system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with all applicable laws.  Tanks are maintained in open-air concrete bunkers (blast walls) to minimize potential damage in an accident. \n\n\n\nFive-year accident history:  The facility has never had an accident involving propane that caused death, injury, property or environmental damage, eva"
