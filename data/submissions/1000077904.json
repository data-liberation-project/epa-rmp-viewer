In the event an accidental release should occur, we are prepared to work with our Local Fire Department(s), Emergency Response Personnel, and other appropriate authorities deemed applicable depending on the specific incident, to best mitigate any release and to minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\r\n\r\n\r\nFacility Information:\r\n\r\nThe primary activity of our company is NAICS code 424510, Grain and Field Bean Merchant Wholesalers, however, we are also engaged in providing agricultural inputs that include receiving, storage and reloading of Anhydrous Ammonia for delivery to farmers in our area.  The NAICS code we feel most applicable for this activity is NAICS code 424910, Farm Supplies Merchant Wholesalers.  Anhydrous Ammonia is the only product at this facility subject to EPA Risk Management Planning at this time.\r\nAnhydrous Ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application to farm fields during the early spring and fall months.  During the balance of the year little if any product transfer occurs.  The maximum quantity handled at a given time would be the offloading of a semi-trailer vehicle tank.\r\nThe facility is operated on an as needed basis with staff present only during the receiving and reloading of product for delivery.  Total annual hours for these needs do not meet the 2,080 hour requirement to qualify as a full time employee on site, therefore, item number 1.11 is zero.  Our facilities have adequate lighting and are inspected at various times of day and night throughout the year.  Time expended for these inspections is not included in our staffing calculation.\r\n\r\nWorst"

(ANSI) K61.1 - 1999; Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia and the U.S. Occupational safety and Health Administration (OSHA) standard 29 CFR 1910.111 Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.  We conduct annual employee training on the safe handling, transportation and distribution of Anhydrous Ammonia, and have installed safety equipment including, but not limited to; excess flow valves, breakaway couplers at risers, emergency shut-off valves and barriers to avoid damage by trucks or other vehicles.  Additionally, locks are used to prevent tampering when the site is unattended.  We also maintain routine contact with local fire department and emergency response personnel; and have provided and/or participated in safety training exercises on Anhydrous Ammonia.\r\nWe have developed an Emergency Action Plan for employees, customers and visitor protection in event of fire, explosion, tornado, and other acts of god that require evacuation, emergency medical care, contacts for assistance, etc. for all areas of our company including the Anhydrous Ammonia facility included in this plan.
