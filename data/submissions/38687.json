Holton Water Purification Works.  The Purification Plant exceeds the Environmental Protection Agency?s Risk Management Program threshold quantity of 2500 pounds for chlorine.  The facility is located at 61 North Road in Hope, Rhode Island.  The facility is not subject to OSHA requirements and falls under Prevention Program 2.  \n\nThe original treatment plant was placed online in 1926.  The plant is capable of treating 144 mgd using liquid ferric sulfate as coagulant, lime for corrosion control, sodium silicofluoride for preventing dental caries and chlorine for disinfection.  The purification plant building consists of an administration area, the filter wing and the chemical and control wing.  The chemical and control wing and filter gallery have a combined area of 33,600 square feet.\n\nThe chemical storage in the chemical and control wing consists of bulk storage of 40 tons of quicklime, 20 tons of sodium silicofluoride, and 12 one-ton containers of liquid chlorine.  \n\nIn 1997/1998 the chlorine storage and feeder rooms were updated to include a vacuum operated system with chlorine gas alarms and an automatic ventilation system.  There are two scales with separate header manifolds with three one-ton cylinders on each scale and up to six full cylinders in storage.  There is a maximum inventory on site of 24, 000 pounds. Chlorine detectors are located in the chlorine storage room and in the chlorine feed room located on the floor directly beneath the chlorine storage room.  Chlorine alarms are located at the central control board.   \n\nChemical Prevention Steps\nUnder Prevention Program 2 the facility completes several review processes.  Examples include safety review, hazard review, operating procedure review etc.  Staff at the plant mus"

Process controls include vents, manual and automatic shutoffs, alarms, pressure readings, enclosures, emergency shutdown systems and the use of a gas feed system.  Ammonium hydroxide is used to test for leaks of the chlorine cylinders and valves.  Entrance into the Chlorine Room is limited to employees with electronic badge access.\n\n5-Year Accident History\nNo accidental releases of chlorine have occurred in the past 5 years at the Providence Water Treatment Plant that have resulted in death, injury, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite death, injury, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\nEmergency Response Program\nThe Providence Water Supply Board has a written and approved Emergency Response Plan that was last revised on August 21, 2001.  The plan includes specific actions that need to be taken in the event of an emergency at the Purification Works.  The Risk Management Plan includes portions of the Emergency Response Plan that applies, including notification procedures, emergency routes, emergency contingency plan for chlorine and emergency plant shutdown procedures.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nCurrently planned changes at the Purification Works includes the use half respirators as part of the personal protective equipment (PPE) during chlorine container changeovers, weekly inspections of the eyewash and shower stations throughout the plant, updated standard operating procedures (SOPs) for chlorine deliveries (including  the use of safety signs and cones during chlorine delivery and checking chlorine cylinders for leaks on delivery truck prior to building delivery), chlorine container changeover, and chlorine leak detector maintenance."
