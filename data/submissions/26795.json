The management and employees of the Muscatine facility are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to the community and the environment.\n\nThe facilities primary operation is the purification, storage and distribution of Carbon Dioxide. A support process to this operation involves the use of anhydrous ammonia.  Ammonia is use in a refrigeration system which cools part of the carbon dioxide production process. There are two separate CO2 and Ammonia systems, each are simular. Ammonia is received from a bulk Ammonia Supplier (LaRoach)  via a Bulk Trailer and stored in a 3000 gallon tank that contains a maximum of 14,000 pounds of  anhydrous ammonia each.  The ammonia is then used in a closed refrigeration system.\n\nThe worst-case scenario, based on the EPA's definition for a toxic gas release, would be the rupture of the 3,000 gal. (14,000 lb.) vessel.  The results would be a maximum release of 14,000 lbs (total system loss) of  anhydrous ammonia over a 10 minute period.\n\nThe endpoint of 0.14mg/L (EPRG-2 Level) was determined to be 1.5 miles using the RMP*Comp. (1.06) software. The weather conditions used were a wind speed of 1.5 meters/sec., Stability Class F, an air temperature of 77 degrees F and urban topographical terrain.\n\nThe impacted area would affect 464 residents and several special receptors which includes  several schools based on the 1990 US Census data obtained from Land View III.  Several business and industries are also within the endpoint. No environmental receptors are affected.  No passive/active mitigation or administrative controls were considered in this assessment.\n\nThe alternative releas"

No passive or active mitigation measures were considered.\n\nThe release endpoint of 0.14mg/L (EPRG-2) was determined to be 0.20 miles using the RMP*Comp. (1.06) software. The Weather conditions used were a wind speed of 3.0 meters/sec., Stability Class D, and air temperature of 77 degrees F and urban topographical terrain.\n\nThe affected area would include one resident and a couple of small business based on actual observations. The business/industry would be the Pain Dry Ice Company and a Conoco gas station/store.\n\nPassive and Active Mitigation systems in place that would reduce the likelihood of a release or the release itself. These include check valves, Emergency Shut-off Valves,  a preventive maintenance schedule, and safeties.\n\nThe facility has developed a comprehensive prevention program designed to prevent accidental releases of ammonia.  The program utilizes state-of-the-art technology, sound engineering practices, administrative controls and active employee participation.  Employees serve on task groups and teams in developing and maintaining risk management program elements.  They are frequently consulted concerning the various aspects of the program and ways to continually improve the safety of the process.  \nWritten process safety information was developed for the ammonia system to enable managers, supervisors, and employees to identify and understand the process hazards.  This information was utilized to develop a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) which assists management and employees in making decisions for improving safety and reducing the consequences of releases of ammonia. The PHA focuses attention on equipment, instrumentation, utilities, human actions, (routine and nonroutine), and external"

The facilities Emergency Response plan was review in July 2002 and tested at that time. \n\nThe facility receives a compliance audit in accordance with EPA's Risk Management Standard Part 68 at least once every three years.  The audit includes an evaluation of the design and effectiveness of the risk management system and a field inspection of the safety and health conditions, and practices to ensure compliance.  The Team uses an audit tool to document each audit step and ensure an effective audit is conducted.  A Protocol Policy has been developed to ensure that proper follow-up is accomplished.\n\nBOC Gases will make available all information, including any Trade Secret information as it relates to compliance with this regulation.   \n        \nThe facility has an Emergency Response Plan which has been integrated with the local community Emergency Response Plan. All employees and contractors are trained in the plan prior to commencement of work.  The Emergency Plan is tested and critiqued twice a year to insure that it is current.

In addition, the contractor's safety performance, job skills, knowledge, and certifications (such as pressure vessel welders) are also verified. The contractors safety procedures were last review in July 2002.  \n\nPreStart-up Safety Reviews (PSSR) are used for new or modified processes to improve the design and construction of the process from a reliability and quality stand point.  The PSSR recommendations are resolved before final installations are complete. Other items completed prior to initial process startup include piping and instrument diagrams, operating procedures, and ensuring operating personnel are fully trained.  The initial startup and normal operating procedures are fully evaluated as part of the PSSR to assure a safe transfer into the normal operating mode for meeting the process parameters.
