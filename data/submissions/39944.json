      "SummaryText": "ISK Magnetics Inc., is a manufacturer of iron oxides for magnetic storage media and food grade pigment and cosmetic applications.  One of the raw materials used in our process is agricultural grade anhydrous ammonia.\nAbout 80% of all ammonia produced is used in agriculture, as a nitrogen source for plants and a protein source in livestock feeds.  Some other common uses for ammonia are: metal treating, pharmaceuticals, synthetic textile fibers, plastics, water treatment, pollution control devices and large refrigeration systems.  Ammonia is classified as a nonflammable gas with a reportable spill quantity of 100 pounds.\nISK uses detailed operating and maintenance procedures and employee training to maintain the safe operation of this system.  Detection sensors are strategically located to alert personnel of leaks. Remotely operated shut off valves, automatic excess flow devices and remotely operated water deluge systems minimize the effect of a failed component.  ISK participates in the LEPC and invites the local Fire Department and Hazardous Materials Team to train on site annually.  Our internal emergency response plan includes coordinating with police, fire and HAZMAT personnel.\nISK has had no reportable releases or injuries from ammonia in the last 10 years.  The Management of ISK is committed to operating this system in a safe and responsible manor, protecting our employees and the surrounding community.\nISK?s RMP submission and other related records was inspected by U.S.EPA on 8/22/2002."
