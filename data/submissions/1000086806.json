Hawkins is based in Roseville, Minnesota with branches throughout the United States.  \r\n\r\nHawkins provides water and waste-water treatment equipment and chemicals to improve the quality of life and operate in concert with the environment.  Hawkins also serves regional customers in the Industrial sector in the fields of energy, electronics, chemical processing, pulp and paper, medical devices and metal finishing.  Food manufacturers, processing plants, and pharmaceutical concerns across the nation benefit from Hawkins' chemical distribution, blending and related expertise.\r\n\r\nHawkins' mission is to exceed our customers' expectations as a high-quality, service-oriented chemical supplier.  We adapt quickly to the changing chemical needs of customers with a keen focus on technical expertise, teamwork, safety, profitability, and responsible care of the environment and of our community.\r\n\r\nExecutive Summary \r\nPrevention and Emergency Response policies:  Hawkins' management and safety committees have set a motto of \"Think Safe! Be Safe!\" regarding accidents and injuries.  Support for this motto is manifested in several ways, including:\r\n1.\tA corporate Health, Safety and Environmental (HSE) department staffed with trained professionals.\r\n2.\tTraining programs in chemical safety, safe material handling, accident prevention and emergency response.\r\n3.\tPrompt investigation of near misses and incidents to identify root causes and implement measures to prevent future occurrences.\r\n4.\tAdherence to all EPA and OSHA regulations governing our operations.\r\n5.\tCompliance with DOT requirements regarding shipping and materials.\r\n6.\tInternal and 3rd party audits of Health, Safety and Environmental procedures at all Hawkins locations.\r\n7.\tMembers in good standing with the National Association of Chemical Distributors and the Chlo"

      "SummaryText": "rine Institute.\r\n\r\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled:  This facility is a chemical distribution and manufacturing facility that handles several materials used to protect public health by treating water, wastewater, swimming pools and other uses.  The products covered by EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) at this site are:\r\n\u00bf\tChlorine: used to packaging smaller containers of chlorine and to manufacturing bleach (sodium hypochlorite). Chlorine (and sodium hypochlorite) are well-known and trusted disinfectants for drinking water, wastewater, food processing equipment, swimming pools, etc.\r\n\u00bf\tSulfur dioxide: used to make paper and by water treatment facilities to purify water (warehousing only at this location)\r\n\u00bf\tAnhydrous Ammonia: used in refrigeration systems (warehousing only at this location)\r\n\u00bf\tAqua Ammonia conc. 20% or greater: bulk storage and distribution.  Aqua ammonia is used for NOx emission control and potable water treatment. \r\n\r\n&#8195;\r\nPrevention Program:  Planning for accidents, such as that done through our Risk Management Plan helps to ensure that they never happen.  The Red Rock facility has been built to specifically minimize any environmental impact an accident may have.  Hawkins has nearly 60 years of experience in handling chemicals.  Accident prevention is achieved through safe handling procedures and safety systems that properly protect chemicals during shipping, storage, and use.  This starts with having employees trained in proper handling procedures and equipping them with equipment to safely transfer chemicals during manufacture.  Adherence to OSHA workplace rules is just another part of our safety program.\r\n\r\n5-year Accident History:  As a result of our diligence, there has not been an RMP accidental release from a covered process that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage at this fac"

In addition to our internal efforts, safety and emergency response planning also is coordinated with local and national officials, including the St. Paul Fire Department, Minnesota Pollution Control Agency, and U.S. Coast Guard.  Hawkins also must regularly meet requirements in industrial wastewater, national pollutant discharge (NPDES) and other permits, and is an active member of the Chlorine Institute and the National Association of Chemical Distributor.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes:  While Hawkins desires to continually improve safety, there are no specific changes planned other than to continue compliance with industry standards and government regulations and our own commitment to \"Think Safe!
