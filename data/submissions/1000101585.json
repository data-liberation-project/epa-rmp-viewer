The acetylene that is generated in the low-pressure generator is piped to the high-pressure cylinder fill area where it is compressed and routed through manifolds that are used to fill multiple cylinders.  \r\n\r\n3.  The general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\r\nThe Linde facility complies with USEPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable federal, state, and local codes and regulations.  The acetylene systems are designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with NFPA and state law at the Linde Inc. facility in Twinsburg, Ohio.\r\n\r\n4.  Five-year accident history:\r\nA pressure switch failure lead to increase calcium carbide feed rate resulting in increased pressure in the acetylene gas holder. The gas holder functioned as designed and automatically vented excess pressure. Through management of change, the pressure switch was replaced with an improved design.\r\n\r\n5.  The emergency response program:\r\nIn the event of an emergency accidental release involving our acetylene storage systems, it is Linde Inc.'s policy to immediately notify the Twinsburg Fire Department and the Linde National Operations Center, who would respond to the emergency.  We have communicated this policy with the Twinsburg Fire Department.  All members of the Linde team are properly trained to respond to emergencies at the facility.  All employees have access to Linde emergency action plan.  Emergency response training, including fire drills, is conducted annually.  \r\n\r\n6.

The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the facility:\r\nThe Linde Inc. facility located in Twinsburg, Ohio complies with USEPA's accident prevention rule, and it is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  All process equipment is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with NFPA standards.  If an emergency accidental release were to occur involving our acetylene storage/handling systems, it is our policy to immediately notify the Twinsburg Fire Department and the Linde National Operations Center, who would respond to and assist with the emergency.  In addition, we have implemented programs related to Process Safety Management and Security Vulnerability Risk Assessment.  Corporate / Senior management provides support for all compliance requirements through training information and training programs.  Regular safety meetings are required by corporate policy.\r\n\r\n2.  A description of the facility and the regulated substances handled:\r\nThe Linde facility manufactures acetylene.  Acetylene is put into storage cylinders of various sizes before they are sold and shipped from the facility. \r\nThe acetylene manufacturing/handling/storage process consists of chemical acetylene trailers, a low pressure acetylene generator, and a high-pressure cylinder filling area.\r\n\r\nAcetylene is compressed using chemical acetylene stored on trailers that have acetylene cylinders manifolded\r\ntogether.  The piping from the manifold runs to the generator and compressor room. The supply lines are equipped with flow reducing pressure regulators, 1.2 orifice plates, large flash arrestors, and check valves to protect against reverse flow. Acetylene trailer cylinders are equipped with fusible plugs designed to prevent a spread of fire from one trailer to another. \r\n\r\nFor backup purposes, the acetylene manufacturing/handling/storage process consists of a low-pressure acetylene generator.
