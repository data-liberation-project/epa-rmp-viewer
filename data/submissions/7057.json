Due to our stringent release prevention policies, no reportable off-site releases have occurred during this period. \n\n6.\tEmergency Response Plan\n\n\tUnited Dairy Farmers, Inc. utilizes a written Emergency Response Plan to document specific procedures to be implemented in the event of various emergencies, including an ammonia release.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response, including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.  To ensure proper functioning, emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.   The Emergency Response Plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our process that would require modified procedures.\n\n\tThe Hamilton County LEPC is the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) with which our Emergency Response Plan has been coordinated and verified.  The City of Norwood Fire Department is the primary emergency response agency for all facility emergencies, including ammonia releases.\n\n7.\tPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\tIn order to improve process safety at our facility, existing process piping insulation will be removed to allow complete inspection of pipe/fitting integrity.

This commitment is inherent to our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with our regulated process.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, our highly trained emergency response personnel are available to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  We are also coordinated with the City of Norwood Fire Department for emergency response support.\n\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\tThis facility is primarily used for production of fluid milk and ice cream products.  The only RMP regulated substance present at our facility is ammonia, utilized as the primary cooling media in our closed-loop refrigeration system.  Refrigeration is a critical part of our business, providing cold storage capabilities for products per Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations. The amount of ammonia currently present in the refrigeration system is approximately 38,000 pounds.  Due to the size and characteristics of our ammonia refrigeration system, as well as Process Safety Management (PSM) applicability, this facility is covered under Program 3 of the RMP regulations.\n\n3.  \tThe Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\n\n\tTo evaluate both the worst case and alternative release scenarios, the computer dispersion model ALOHA (Areal Locations of Hazardous Atmospheres) was utilized exclusively.

The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\n\tThe worst case scenario would typically involve the catastrophic failure of the largest vessel in the ammonia refrigeration system.  However, the largest vessel is located inside the facility and would constitute a mitigated release.   Subsequently, an additional worst case scenario was evaluated for an unmitigated release due to the rupture of high pressure liquid piping outside of the facility.   This scenario yielded a greater distance to toxic endpoint than the mitigated vessel release and was therefore chosen as the true worst case scenario.  The release rate was calculated to be 536 pounds per minute, using the modified bernoulli equation specified in the RMP Guidance Document for Ammonia Refrigeration.   As specified in the guidance document, the high pressure liquid ammonia is assumed to vaporize as it is released.   As required by the RMP rule, the release duration must be assumed to be 10 minutes, yielding a release quantity of 5,360 pounds.    Under worst case weather conditions (Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed) as required by the RMP rule, ALOHA yielded a distance of 0.87 miles to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L (200 ppm).  The majority of area within the zone of influence exhibits urban topography, based upon the prevalence of commercial, industrial, and residential buildings.  The estimated residential population for the zone of influence is approximately 17,000 people, based upon 1990 census data calculated by  LANDVIEW software.  Other public receptors identified include schools and at least one recreational area.  No environmental receptors are known to be located within the zone of influence.\n\n\tSeveral alternative release scenarios were evaluated, however, the majority either would not exceed the toxic endpoint or would not result in offsite consequences.

The scenario would involve an undetected release through a pressure relief valve on the facility roof.  Based upon the manufacturer's rating for this relief valve, it has the capacity to release 29 pounds per minute of ammonia gas.   The release duration is assumed to be 60 minutes, yielding a total release quantity of 1,740 pounds.  Under average weather conditions for the area, ALOHA yielded a distance to toxic endpoint of 0.04 miles.  The corresponding zone of influence only slightly extends beyond the facility property line, with one residence being the only offsite receptor.  The residential population within the zone of influence is assumed to be no greater than 10 people based upon the single residence identified.\n\n4.\tThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\tOur facility has taken all necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68.  Our facility is also subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119, as well as the EPCRA Section 302 and 311/312 notification/reporting  requirements.
