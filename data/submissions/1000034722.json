Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies: \r\n \r\nCentral Valley Ag in Akron is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety. This commitment is an inherent part of our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. If such a release does occur, our trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release. We also coordinate our response efforts with the Hinton Fire Department which provides additional emergency response expertise.\r\n\r\n2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled:\r\nOur facility's primary activities include support services for crop production. We have anhydrous ammonia stored in two (2) interconnected tanks at our facility in Akron. The maximum amount stored in all vessels on-site is 307,811 pounds at the maximum fill capacity of 85%.\r\n\r\n3. Worst Case Release and Alternative Case Scenarios:\r\nWe utilize RMP Comp for the worst case and alternative case scenarios of the required off-site consequence analysis for our facility. The following details these scenarios.\r\n\r\nThe worst case release scenario is the case of the entire contents of the single largest tank in gaseous form over a 10-minute period. At Class F atmospheric stability, 1.5 m/s, and urban topography, the maximum distance to endpoint of 0.14 mg/L is 4.4 miles. The estimated population within the 4.4 mile radius of this facility is 1909.\r\n\r\nThe alternative release scenario is where the transport unit that is delivering anhydrous ammonia to the bulk storage plant pulls away from the intake lines without disconnecting the transfer hoses.  The typical anhydrous ammonia hose is (4) four inches in diameter and t"

      "SummaryText": "wenty-five (25) feet in length.  Through a series of mathematical equations, the alternative release is calculated to be approximately 93 pounds every 20 seconds.  Therefore, the expected rate for a pull-away by the transport unit approximates 279 pounds per minute.  Utilizing RMP*Comp Program, the distance to endpoint for a 2,800 pound release over a ten minute time frame is .10 miles from source.\r\n\r\n4. General Accidental Release Prevention Program:\r\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the EPA's accidental release prevention requirements as set forth in 40 CFR Part 68.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary facility.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information: Central Valley Ag maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associated with all processes (Appendix D).\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis: Our facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled effectively. Any findings from the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely fashion.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures: Central Valley Ag has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity: Central Valley Ag conducts documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operation. Maintenance checks are conducted by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices. Examples of process equipment that would receive maintenance checks include: pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shut down systems, controls, and pumps. Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner (Appendix C).\r\n\r\nManagement of Change:"

      "SummaryText": "Written procedures are in place at Central Valley Ag to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures. Process operators, maintenance personnel or other employees whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly notified of the modification and offered training to deal with it.\r\n\r\nPre-startup Reviews:  Central Valley Ag routinely conducts pre-startup safety reviews related to new processes and modifications in established processes. These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, and operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation: Central Valley Ag truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort. Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements. In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP, particularly information resulting from process hazard analyses.\r\n\r\n5. Five-Year Accident History:\r\nCentral Valley Ag has had no accidental release has occurred during this period.\r\n\r\n6. Emergency Response Plan:\r\nCentral Valley Ag maintains a written emergency response plan to deal with the accidental release of hazardous materials. The plan addresses all aspects of emergency response including first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, and notification of local emergency response agencies and the public (Appendix A).\r\n\r\nPat Renken\r\nWORK:      (712)568-2426\r\n24-hour:   (712)490-6562"
