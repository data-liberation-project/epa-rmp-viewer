This Risk Management Plan has been developed in accordance with the requirements specified under 40 CFR Part 68, Subpart G.  The Risk Management Plan certifies that CCL has instituted a Risk Management Program at the Danville, Illinois facility that is in compliance with U.S. EPA RMP requirements.\n\nThe Risk Management Plan follows the format provided by the RMP Data Elements published by U.S. EPA.  In addition to identifying the applicable corporate policies and risk management system, the Risk Management Plan establishes that the facility's worst case release and five-year accidental release history qualifies the facility for Program Level 1 status under the RMP regulation.  This signifies that the CCL Danville warehouse does not pose an off-site hazard to the public. \n\n1.1 Corporate Statement\n\nCCL Industries, Inc. recognizes and believes in the importance of safeguarding both our natural resources and our environmental heritage.  As such, we are committed to our customers, employees, and the various communities in which we operate to protect the health of our environment through the development and maintenance of programs which:\n\n* comply with federal, state, provincial, and local environmental and occupational health and safety legislation.\n\n* audit compliance with legislative and company standards, identify long term potential liabilities, and take appropriate action.\n\n* minimize environmental health and safety risks to our employees and the communities in which we operate through the use of safe operating procedures, emergency plans, and employee training.\n\n* conserve natural resources, minimize the generation and discharge of waste, and ensure that "

The Danville facility has developed a management system to oversee the implementation of the Risk Management Program in accordance with the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68, Subpart G.  The management system identifies the following job functions by responsibility level:\n\nCCL Facility Management: Vice President General Manager\n\nRisk Management Program Development and Implementation: Divisional Environmental Compliance Manager\n\nAccident Prevention/Process Safety Management Program:  Site Safety Supervisor\n\nOff-site Hazards Assessment:  Divisional Environmental Compliance Manager\n\nEmergency Response:  Site Safety Supervisor\n\n\n\n\n2.0   PROCESSES AND SUBSTANCES SUBJECT TO 40 CFR PART 68\n\nThe EPA Risk Management Regulation identifies three levels of requirements for industrial processes.  Program 1 applies to any process that does not pose an off-site hazard.  This means that  there has not been a release of a regulated substance affecting off-site receptors over the five year period prior to the June 1999 RMP submittal date and that the modeled worst-case release as specified in the RMP regulation does not affect \"public receptors\" (e.g. residences, parks and recreation areas, commercial/industrial facilities, hospitals).

      "SummaryText": " warehouse meets these requirements, it qualifies for Program Level 1 status according to 40 CFR Part 68.   RMP Program 1 requires a review of the five-year accident history and evaluation of a worst-case release to verify that public receptors would not be affected, and procedures to  notify off-site emergency (e.g. fire department) of the on-site hazards associated with the regulated substances.\n\nCCL operates a warehouse at West Ross Lane in Danville, Illinois that can store up to 7 million aerosol cans. These aerosol cans contain various amounts of flammable hydrocarbon propellants to provide the pressure to force the product from the container.  Combinations of up to five regulated flammable chemicals are used as propellants and, therefore, may be present in quantities exceeding the 10,000-lb threshold for flammable substances established by the regulation. The regulated substances include isobutane, n-butane, propane, 1,1difluoroethane, and dimethyl ether (DME).  With an average amount of 40 grams of propellant per can, the total amount of propellant stored in the warehouse is estimated to be up to 630,000 pounds. \n\n\n\n\n3.0   HAZARD ASSESSMENT\n\n\n3.1 Worst Case Release\n\nThe largest single vessel in the warehouse storage area is an aerosol can containing up to 200 grams, or 0.44 lb of hydrocarbon propellant.  The worst-case release is defined by the RMP regulation as a vapor cloud explosion of the flammable material inside this vessel.  The endpoint is an overpressure of 1 psi associated with this explosion.\n\nFor the warehouse, the worst-case endpoint distance was calculated using RMP*Comp.  For a release of 0.44 lb of propane, the maximum amount  in a single container, the resulting overpressure endpoint distance associated with a vapor cloud explosion does not extend off-site.  As such, public receptors would not be affected by the worst-case release, as defined by 40 CFR Part 68.\n\n3.2 Five Year Accident History\n\nDuring the past 5 years (June 1994 to June 1999),"

      "SummaryText": " there has not been a release of a regulated flammable substance at the CCL Custom Manufacturing warehouse that resulted in offsite deaths or injuries, or damage to the environment.  \n\n3.3 RMP Program Determination\n\nThe process is considered Program Level 1according to 40CFR Section 68.12(b) of the regulation because: 1) no public receptors would be affected within the endpoint distance from a worst-case and within the past five years, and 2) no release of a regulated substance has resulted in off-site deaths or injuries, or damage to the environment.\n\n4.0   ACCIDENT PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE\n\nThere are no specific accidental release prevention program requirements for Program 1 processes under 40CFR Part 68.  CCL operates its warehouse in a manner that promotes safety and has systems in place such as fire/smoke detectors and sprinkler systems to enable rapid emergency response and mitigate the effects of accidental releases of flammable materials should they occur.  \n\nCCL relies on the Westville Area Fire Department to control emergency releases and extinguish fires at the Danville warehouse.  The Fire Department is aware of the presence of flammable substances in the warehouse."
