Chlorine is stored at the Plant in ton containers that are co-located in a chlorine building.  Chlorine is used at the Treatment Plant to disinfect treated effluent before being discharged to the Mississippi River.  The facility is regulated under Missouri NPDES permit number MO-0028720, which requires effluent disinfection during the months of April through October of each year.  The average treatment plant flow rate is 6.2 million gallons per day.  The plant serves a population of approximately 40,000 people.  A project is now under design to replace the chlorination process with ultraviolet disinfection.  The project is expected to be completed within one to two years at which time the chlorine process will be de-registered.\n\nThe Plant's chlorine building was built in 1991 and was specially designed for chlorine storage and use.  A maximum of three ton-containers are stored at any time in the building.  Approximately 145 lbs. per day are fed during the chlorinating season.  \n\nThe primary process component is the Regal 256 chlorinator, which meters and controls chlorine gas from ton-containers stored in the chlorine room.  The chlorinator consists of two container-mounted vacuum regulators and two remote water injectors. The water injectors create a vacuum, accept the flow of gas, mix it with water and deliver chlorine solution to the treated effluent.  The system is designed so that chlorine gas is removed from the ton-container only under vacuum.  If vacuum is lost, such as what might occur during a gas tubing break or disconnection, the vacuum regulator valve would shut-off chlorine feed and prevent release of chlorine gas.  This system design greatly reduces the potential for accidental release of chlorine gas.\n\n\nWorst-case Release Scenario\n\nThe Wors"

      "SummaryText": "t-case Release Scenario was assumed to be the release of an entire ton-container stored in the chlorine container room.  In the scenario, the cause of the leak would be a container valve that would be inadvertently open when the outlet cap is removed.  The assumed released quantity was 2,000 lbs. of chlorine, released in a period of ten minutes.  RMPComp, 1.06 was the model used to calculate the affected area of the release.  Data inputs used in the model were a relative humidity of 50%, ambient temperature of 77 degrees Fahrenheit, chlorine temperature of 77 degrees before release, rural surface roughness coefficient, wind speed of 1.5 meters per second and an atmospheric stability of Class F.  The release would occur at ground level inside the chlorine building and all receptors are considered to be at ground level.\n\nThe toxic endpoint for chlorine gas as given in 40 CFR, Part 68.22 is 0.0087 mg/L.  The distance from the scenario point of release to the toxic endpoint was calculated at 2.2 miles.  The area located within a 2.2-mile radius of the process includes:\n\n1) a section of the north side of the City O'Fallon, \n2) sparsely populated rural properties \n3) Mississippi River floodplain\n\nApproximately 40% of the affected area is in the Mississippi River floodplain with few inhabitants.  The remaining area receptors include residences and two schools.   \n\nTo avoid the worst-case scenario, operators follow procedures to assure that container valves are closed before removing the outlet caps.  As a backup safety measure, outlet caps are removed slowly to assure that the closed container valve is not leaking.  If there is evidence of a leak, the cap can be tightened to stop the leak.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario\n\nThe alternative scenario selected was a release of residual chlorine gas from a container assumed to be empty.  The container valve would have been loosened from opening and closing during use and therefore may have the potential for leaking at the packing "

      "SummaryText": "gland.  In the scenario, the accuracy of one of the container scales would have drifted to show an empty container when actually up to ten pounds of chlorine remained in the container.  The release of ten pounds of chlorine would impact a radius of 0.1 miles.  Two residences are identified to be located within this radius.\n\nTo prevent the alternative release scenario from occurring, container scale accuracy is checked routinely.  Also, loose packing nuts are tightened to reduce the potential for leakage.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Plan\n\nIn accordance with OSHA regulations, a Process Safety Management program has been established for the chlorine process.  The program includes preventive measures to prevent releases.  These measures include process safety information, procedures, process hazard analysis, training, mechanical integrity, management of change, employee participation, pre-startup reviews, hot work permits, contractor safety, incident investigation and compliance audits.\n \nFive-year Accident History\n\nThere have been no significant chlorine releases at the facility.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe facility is considered a \"non-responding facility\" and is included with the Emergency Response Plan established by the O'Fallon Fire Department and the St. Charles County Hazmat Team.  \n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe facility is in the process of replacing the chlorine system with ultraviolet disinfection, thereby removing the chemical hazard.  This process substitution is expected to be completed within the next two years."
