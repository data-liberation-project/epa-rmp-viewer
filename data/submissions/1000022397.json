The building is isolated from other facilites and  is approximately 450 feet from the nearest residence.  Operational Staff are trained in Operation and Maintenance Proceedures which promote safe responsible operation of the chlorine storage and waste water disinfection system.\nShould an emergency response become necessary, it will be coordinated with the Polk County Fire District #1 and the Polk County Sheriffs Office.  This will provide an organized timely response of emergency professionals to any emergency situations which endangers public safety or property.  The duties of this response team are delineated in the Monmouth Emergency Management Plan Adopted in November 1995, the Polk County Fire District #1 Emergency Management Plan, adopted in September 2005, and the Polk County Emergency Management Plan adopted in September 2005.   In the event of a Chlorine spill, these emergency response plans provide coordinated procedures which react to the hazard and provide rapid  public notification and evacuation.\nMonmouth has not had any accidental releases of chlorine or process related injuries in the past 5 years.\n"
