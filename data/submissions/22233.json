Regulated Substance Handled at this Facility:\nPercival Farm Service, Inc. is a supplier of farm fertilizer and chemicals in the Percival,\nIowa area.  Our anhydrous ammonia facility is a new installation with the latest safety\nfeatures.  In consideration for public safety,  the facility is located in a non-populated\narea.  \n\nII.   Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy:\nBecause of the hazardous nature of NH3 and in compliance with Section 112 (r) of the\nClean Air act, we have accidental release prevention programs and emergency\nresponse policies, as well as employee safety training and programs.  Our employees\nhave been trained in the safe handling of NH3, the hazards of NH3 and the use of\npersonal protective equipment for safety.  This safety equipment includes face masks,\nneoprene gloves, and proper clothing when in the vicinity of NH3.  Water for\nemergency flushing is located on the NH3 use tanks, and at the storage area.  Our\nsafety policy firmly states that employees must never handle NH3 without always\nfollowing these rules.  There are emergency shut off and relief valves on all storage\ntanks and nurse tank filling stations are equipped with breakaway couplers.\n\nIn case of accidental exposure, we have posted telephone numbers of the plant\nmanager after hours, emergency responders which include the fire department and\nrescue department.  The emergency plan states employees will meet at a\npre-designated collection point for further direction from the Emergency Coordinator,\nor in their absence,  the Assistant Emergency Coordinator.  Within fifteen minutes of\nthe incident of accidental release, the E.C. or the Asst. E.C. will notify the Fremont\nCounty LEPC and will cooperate with the Incident commander from the fire\ndepartment at the scene in order to expedite the notification and safe evacuation of\npersons from the area to prevent exposure.  We have invited our loca"

Worst Case Scenario Vs Alternate Release Scenario:\nThe worst case scenario that we were required to develop for this Risk Management\nPlan involved a total release of product from the largest storage tanks at this facility. \nWe emphasize that this is highly unlikely.  The integrity of the storage tank is certified\nby professionals, and inspected annually.  The more common release, failure of a\ntransfer hose, is the one we used as an alternate release scenario.  Transfer hoses are\nchecked annually, and replaced if necessary.  If a transfer hose developed a leak, the\nleak could only happen when an employee was present, as all valves to the transfer\nhose are closed except during transfer of product by an employee.  This leak would be\nobvious immediately, and the employee would close the valve to the supply hose. \nThe leak would more than likely be a small one, and not the diameter of the transfer\nhose.  Therefore, even the alternate release scenario is exaggerated.\n\nIV.   Five Year Accident History:\nThis is a new facility, therefore we have had no releases during the past five years.\n\nV.   Emergency Response Program:\nWe are in contact with our local fire and rescue department and the Local Emergency\nResponse Commission regarding our operations.  Because we are in a small\ncommunity, several of our customers and employees are members of our local fire,\nrescue and emergency response teams. In addition to the training our employees\nreceive, we encourage any emergency responders to attend our safety meetings and\nto understand our operations.\n\nVI.   Planned Changes to Improve Safety:\nWe will document the safety inspections of storage and nurse tanks, transfer hoses,\nvalves and application equipment.  We will continue training for all new and current\nemployees to insure their safety and the safe operation of our facility."
