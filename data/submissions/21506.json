The isopentane is also received in rail cars and stored in a 40,000 gallon underground tank.  The isopentane is pumped through two pumping stations directly to the foam extruders where it is injected into melted polystyrene to form rolls of foam polystyrene sheet.  The maximum amount of Isopentane stored on site will be 187,200 pounds.\n\nOther manufacturing activities conducted at this location include manufacture of foam drink cups, cup lids, plastic cup bags, foam plates and plastic table ware (forks, knives and spoons).  There is also a small machine shop operation used to support other manufacturing activities and a truck maintenance facility to service the semi truck and trail fleet.\n\n\n3.  The worst-case scenario and the alternative release scenario, including administrative controls and mitigation measues to limit the distances for each reported scenario.\n\n          Worst-Case Scenario. - The largest release possible would be loss of the contents of a full 60,000 gallon above ground isopentane storage tank.  This would involve 312250 pounds of isopentane.  It is assumed that the pentane vapors find an ignition source which would result in an explosion.  Using the tables from the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance, the distance to the endpoint of 1 psi is .54 miles.  This would extend beyond the facility boundary.\n\n           Alternate Scenario -  The most extreme alternate scenario would involve a transfer hose failure such as a hose break or coupling being dislodged while the attendant was distracted or called away from the railcar unloading area.  It is assumed that the condition is not found and corrected for 10 minutes allowing a pentane spill up to 15,000 pounds.  The resulting vapor cloud is assumed to find an ignition source which would lead to an explosion.  Usin"

This would extend beyond the facility boundary.\n\n4.  The general accidental release prevention program and the specific prevention steps.\n\nThis facility has written procedures that are used to ensure the safe handling of pentane.  There are detailed written procedures for unloading that will limit or prevent any spills.  Personell are trained in safe handling practices for the pentane.  Smoking or open flames are strictly forbidden in areas where flammable materials are likely to be present.  All employees company wide are trained to respect the flammable and explosive nature of pentane.  This starts with the right to know training on the first day of employment and continues to be reinforced with on the job training.  Signs are also used to reinforce the no smoking, no flames warnings for critical areas.  The site has lel detector meters for hydrocarbons which trigger alarms in the event of a release.  The alarms alert personell to action to minimize the spill and minimize the hazard potential.\n\n5.  Five year accident history.\n\nThis facility has not had a reportable accident in the past five years.\n\n6.The emergency response program.\n\nThe emergency response program at this facility is very strong.  We have a team of trained hazmat responders.  Several of the emergency response team members are also members of the local fire departments emergency response teams.  Our facility Safety Director is a Hazmat trainer and is a member of the Lancaster County Local Planning Committee.  The response plan is frequently updated and drills are conducted by the emergency response team frequently.  The local fire department is aware of the hazards at this facility and has visited the site to review emergency response needs.\n\n7.  Planned changes to improve safety.\n\nThis facility reviews the emergency plan annually and updates the plan as needed any"

      "SummaryText": "1.  Accidental Release prevention and emergency response policies\n\nIn this production facility, Dart Container Corporation of Pennsylvania located at 60 East Main Street in Leola Pennsylvania, we handle N-Pentane and Isopentane.  Both are considered hazardous by EPA.  Our pentane handling systems are designed with controls to prevent and minimize accidental release.  Written procedures for unloading shippments of pentane, require supervision by specially trained workers.  This allows us to immediately detect equipment failures and prevent dangerous release situations.  Alarms, excess flow devices and automatic shut down systems connected to pentane dectors are part of our spill prevention program.  Our emergency response program is combination of in house response by our emergency response team whose members are trained for hazardous material handling for pentane, acids and general fire, and our local emergency response agencies.  We keep materials and equipment on site, to respond to, and contain accidental spills or releases.  There is a strict no smoking, no flames policy in effect in all areas where pentane is present and the areas are clearly marked with no smoking signs.\n\n\n2.  The stationary source and regulated substances handled.\n\nThis facility has several operational areas.  The two areas of concern for this program are the EPS bead production area and the foam sheet and thermoforming operations. \n\nThis facility uses n-pentane to manufacture expandable polystyrene bead (EPS).  The N-pentane is received in rail cars and stored in underground storage tanks.  The pentane is pumped directly to process tanks and reactors where it is combined with polystyrene beads to form EPS bead.  The maximum amount of N-Pentane stored on site is 297,440 pounds.  The N-Pentane is brought to the site by rail car.  It is unloaded and stored in two 30,000 gallon underground tank(s).  Finally it is added to polystyrene beads in reactors to create expandable polystyrene beads (E"
