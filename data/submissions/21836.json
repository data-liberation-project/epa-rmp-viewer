      "SummaryText": "This document was developed for the City of Cambridge's Wastewater Treatment Facility in an effort to fulfill criteria of the Risk Management Program (RMP), as reequired by Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act (CAA), and regulated by 40 CFR, Part 68.  The Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) utilizes primary and secondary biological treatment processes.  The facility has an extensive Risk Management Program that follows OSHA and EPA guidelines.  The program emphasizes employee trainning, emergency response, and equipment inspection/maintenance.\n\nThe WWTP stores and utilizes chlorine in one-ton cylinders.  The maximum quantity on-site at any given time is 8000 lb.\n\nRMPcomp software was used to conduct the worst-case release scenario for chlorine.  Additionally, enclosures (e.g. buildings) were considered as passive mitigation measures in the analysis, which reduced the impact of a potential release.  The analysis calculated an impact radius of 0.9 miles.  This impact radius would result in an offsite impact (members of the public could be exposed to toxic concentrations).\n\nFor the alternative scenario, the same procedures and mitigation measures were used as listed above for the worst-case release scenario.  The scenario chosen for analysis was a hole in one of the storage cylinders.  Both of these scenarios assumes the scruber does not engage.  The analysis showed an impact radius of 0.2 miles.  The impact radius would not result in a residencial off-site impact.\n\nThe facility has a dialer system that notifies personnel of a release during non-working hours.  This ensures a release can be identified 24 hours per day."
