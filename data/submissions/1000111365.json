A new Equipment Test Facility will allow for the collection of data to develop designs for the next generation of Air Products' coil wound heat exchangers. The feed stock for the facility will be a flammable mixture of isobutane and methane. The quantity of this flammable mixture is considered hazardous by the EPA. It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and state rules and regulations. Air Products manages the safety of the regulated processes by means of operating procedures, equipment testing and inspections, safety devices (e.g., alarms, shutdowns, instrumentation, relief devices) inherent in the design of this facility and other controls and systems designed to prevent accidental releases of hazardous chemicals. Safe work practices and training of our personnel supplement the inherent safe design of the plant. Our emergency response program is based upon OSHA's HAZWOPER regulation. The emergency response plan includes procedures for the notification of the appropriate local responders so that appropriate measures can be taken to control accidental releases. This document has been prepared in accordance with the EPA's Risk Management Plan regulation (40 CFR, Part 68). The substances and processes considered during the preparation of this RMP and the scenarios described were selected based on criteria established in the regulation\n\n2.\tThe stationary source and regulated substances handled:\nThe feedstock for the test facility Includes a flammable mixture of isobutane and methane. The isobutane will be delivered by tanker and transferred to a stationary tank. The methane will be brought in by DOT approved Tube trailers and staged near the operation with the mat"

This is a closed system as the material will be recovered. If for any reason material cannot be recovered it will be sent to a permitted flare stack. Data collected from the tests will be used for the design of improved equipment for use in the LNG business. The Alternate Case selected was calculated based on a hose failure during an isobutane transfer resulting in a vapor cloud explosion. A release time of 2 minutes was used based on the time it would take to activate an e-stop.\n\n3. The general accidental release prevention program and specific prevention steps:\nThe facility developed prevention program elements based on the Federal EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Plan and OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation. This facility was designed and constructed to comply with applicable state and industry codes.\n\n4.\tFive year accident history:\nThere have been no accidents involving or accidental releases of flammable gas.\n\n5.  The emergency response program:\nThe facility's emergency response program is based upon OSHA's HAZWOPER standard. At this site, employees are trained to recognize emergencies and initiate emergency response from outside agencies. They have been trained to OSHA's First Responder Awareness Level. The employees will receive annual refresher training in their role in the emergency plan. Emergency response activities will be coordinated with the appropriate local responders. The North River Fire District was on site performing a drill on June 13, 2023.\n\n6.  Planned changes to improve safety:\nThe facility resolves recommendations from PHAs and Incident Investigations, some of which may result in modifications to the plant design and operating procedures."
