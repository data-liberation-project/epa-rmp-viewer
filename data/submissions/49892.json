Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n\nAt this facility, we manufacture Arsine and Hydrogen Selenide.  We purify and transfill Chlorine and Ammonia.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal, State, and Local rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle these products combined with the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility.  Safe work practices and training of our personnel supplement the inherent safe design of the plant.\n\nOur emergency response program is based upon OSHA's HAZWOPER regulation and the CGA COMPGEAP Program defined by NFPA 472.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for the notification of the local Fire Authority and Hazardous Materials unit.  A detailed Hazardous Materials Management Plan (HMMP) provides plans, actions, and contacts for on or off-site incidents that may occur.\n\n2.  The stationary source and regulated substances handled:\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is the manufacturing, purification, and fill of specialty gases used in the electronics and fiber optic industry.  Those materials included in the RMP that are manufactured include Arsine and Hydrogen Selenide.  Materials that are purified and/or repackaged under RMP include Ammonia and Chlorine.  \n\nThe regulated substances handled and triggered at this facility are:\n-Anhydrous Ammonia\n-Arsine\n-Chlorine\n-Hydrogen Selenide\n\n3.  The worst-case scenario(s) and the alternative release scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distance for each reported scenario:\n\nBelow is a description of the WCS:\n*With a loss of containment of a (TOXIC) and release of material over 10 minutes, the Toxic End Point would reach an off-site receptor.\n\nBelow is a description of the ARS:\n*Arsine - By a loss of containment, a mitigated release through a scrubber reaches an off-site receptor.\n*Hydroge"

The general accidental release prevention program and specific prevention steps:\n\nThe facility complies with the Federal EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Plan and OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation.  The design and construction of the facility complies with applicable state and industry codes.\n\n5.  Five-year accident history:\n\nPer the requirements of EPA RMP, five year accident histories are up to date.\n\n6.  The emergency response program:\n\nThe facility emergency response program is based upon OSHA's HAZWOPER standard and the CGA COMPGEAP program defined by NFPA 472.  At this site, employees are trained to recognize emergencies and initiate emergency response from outside agencies if necessary.  They have been trained to OSHA's Operations Level as a minimum or as a HAZMAT Technician.  The employees receive annual refresher training in their role in the emergency plan.  Emergency Response activities have also been coordinated with the local municipalities.  This includes an aggressive Mutual Aid Group from surrounding industry and Emergency Services.  Periodic drills are conducted with these groups/agencies to review the effectiveness of our emergency procedures. \n\n7.  Planned changes to improve safety:\n\nSafety and Environmental Protection is of utmost importance to Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.  Through OSHA regulations as a minimum, the implementation of the CMA Responsible CARE initiative, and excellent Accident Prevention Programs, improvements to Safety is an ongoing continuous improvement process."
