These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters, specific chemical inventories and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Specific departments within the plant are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.  Employees are provided training on how to locate the information from computer terminals.\n\nChemical specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDS).  This information is supplemented by documents that address known corrosion concerns and hazards associated within inadvertent mixing of specific chemicals.  Safety related limits for specific process parameters (e.g. temperature, pressure, composition, etc.) have been documented.  Processes are maintained within these limits using process controls, monitoring instruments, protective instrument systems and trained personnel.\n\nThe Baltimore plant also maintains an electronic database, accessible to both employees and contractor supervision, which provides information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical classification, etc.  In combination with written procedures and trained personnel, this information provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not comprised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nThe Baltimore plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that the hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.

The training program includes both initial and refresher training.\n\nAll new operators receive several weeks of comprehensive training before being assigned to a specific operating position.  This training includes training on specific types of equipment, such as pumps and compressors, a general overview of the process, properties of hazardous substances in the process and a detailed review of complex procedures such as safe work practices and emergency response.  Written tests are used to verify that employees understand the training material before a new employee can report to a process unit.  When a new employee reports to a particular process unit, he/she then receives detailed training with respect to process specific procedures.  When the new hire has demonstrated, through hands-on demonstration in the field, mastery of process specific operating procedures for specific tasks, he/she is allowed to begin work in a specific operating position.\n\nRefresher training covers (1) a general overview of the process, (2) the properties and hazards of the substances in the process, and (3) a detailed review of the process operating procedures and safe work practices.  Demonstration in the field is used to verify that employees understand the training before an employee can resume work in the process.  Operators are consulted in safety meetings and through questionnaires regarding effectiveness and frequency of training.  Recommendations are reviewed and changes to the training program are implemented as appropriate.\n\nManagement of Change\n\nThe Management of Change procedure at the Baltimore plant evaluates all proposed changes to chemicals, equipment, procedures and controls within covered processes to help ensure that a"

HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  HAZOP analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience and engineering expertise.  The team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process and accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes recommendations for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures where deemed necessary.\n\nHAZOP team findings are made available to personnel who operate and maintain the process for comments, and forwarded to management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest rank receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options that are implemented in response to PHA findings are tracked until complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nOperators, supervisors and plant engineers work together to develop and maintain operating procedures.  These procedures define how tasks related to process operations are safely performed.  At the Baltimore plant, operating procedures are used to train employees and serve as reference guides for appropriate actions to take during both normal operations and process upsets.  Operating procedures include:\n-\tSteps for safely conducting activities\n-\tApplicable process safety information, such as safe operating limits,\n-\tSafety and health considerations, such as chemical hazards, personnel protective equipment required and steps to take if exposed to a particular chemical.\n\nPlant personnel develop and maintain operating procedures that cover all phases of operations, including i"

The Baltimore plant incorporates quality assurance into equipment purchase and repairs. This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\nSafe Work Practices\n\nThe Baltimore plant has a long-standing safe work program in place to ensure worker safety.  Examples of the program include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) lockout/tagout procedures to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) procedures for safe removal of hazardous materials before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedures to conduct spark producing activities (i.e, hot work), (5) a permit and procedures to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space, and (6) procedures to ensure that hazardous jobs are closely coordinated by qualified supervision.  These procedures, along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nThe Baltimore plant investigates all incidents that could reasonably have resulted in a serious injury to personnel, the public or the environment in order to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future.  Plant employees are trained to identify and report any incident requiring investigation.

The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that processes, procedures and personnel are appropriately prepared for startup prior to startup.  The review provides an additional check to make sure that construction is in accordance with design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.

The basic aspects of this program include (1) maintenance procedures, (2) personnel training in maintenance procedures, (3) equipment inspections and testing, (4) correction of identified deficiencies, and (5) quality assurance measures.

Plant personnel, in combination with the Baltimore City Fire Department, are available 24 hours per day and trained to respond and take actions to contain, control and mitigate any release that might occur.  Emergency responders have access to on-site and off-site emergency equipment that is appropriate for situations that could possibly occur at the plant.  In addition to the considerable on-site resources, the Baltimore plant is a member of the South Baltimore Industrial Mutual Aid Program (SBIMAP).  This membership allows the plant (if needed) to draw on the emergency response resources of other industries in the immediate area.\n\nDrills are periodically conducted either individually or jointly with the LEPC and SBIMAP to assess emergency response"
