The Facility Policy\n\nThe owners, management and employees of O?Connell Oil Company are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire company, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application. Anhydrous ammonia is used for crop production nutrients. \n\nThe maximum quantity of ammonia stored would be 275,000 pounds in our 15,000-gallon and 18,000-gallon storage tanks and nurse tanks. The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a tank truck holding 40,000 pounds.\n\n3. Worst-Case Scenario/Alternative-Case Scenario: This facility has developed a worst-case and alternative-case scenario however it has been withheld from this Executive Summary as security-sensitive information as requested by EPA.\n\n4. The accidental release prevention program.\n\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc. and the Standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia\". In addition, Minnesota Dept. of Ag Rules. \n\n5. The Five-year Accident History\n\na. There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that: have caused any death, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\n6.
