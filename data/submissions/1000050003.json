The Port Sutton Ammonia Terminal is located about 1 mile west of U.S. Route 41 on Port Sutton Road and south of Tampa, Florida.  The facility receives anhydrous ammonia from ocean-going vessels, stores the ammonia at near atmospheric pressure, and transfers the ammonia to its customers via a pipeline (primarily) and trucks. The facility is situated on Port Sutton Channel, with dock facilities for one ship, and storage tanks with the capacity for up to 49,000 tons of ammonia.  The ammonia is in liquid form and is maintained at low temperature (-28\u00b0 F) to keep the storage tank pressure below one pound per square inch.\r\n\r\nPOLLUTION PREVENTION POLICY:\r\n\r\nYara North America, Inc. is committed to protecting the environment and preserving our natural resources for future generations.

We strive to minimize the generation of pollution at the source, but, where that cannot be achieved, we are committed to environmentally sound methods of recycling, treatment, and disposal. By preventing pollution at the source, we strive to achieve cost savings, increase operational efficiencies, and maintain a safe and healthy workplace.\r\n\r\nREGULATED SUBSTANCE:\r\n\r\nAnhydrous Ammonia is the only regulated substance at this facility subject to EPA Risk Management Program and the OSHA Process Safety Management Program.

This assures that construction and equipment installed are in accordance with design, that all necessary procedures, including safety procedures, are in place, that necessary training is completed, and that hazard analysis or other requirements of management of change are completed.\r\n\r\nMECHANICAL INTEGRITY: This is a quality assurance procedure to assure that equipment, parts, materials, and installations are suitable for the applications intended. Maintenance employees are trained in process hazards and safety procedures applicable to their work. Inspections, procedures, and testing are conducted under this part of the program.\r\n\r\nSAFE WORK PRACTICES: Procedures and policies for all work permits and maintenance lockout/tagout procedures are in force, and are periodically reviewed for completeness and effectiveness.\r\n\r\nMANAGEMENT OF CHANGE: No changes in the process or procedures are allowed without a review and authorization. Safety impacts, technical review, required procedure modifications, and training needed are all considered in this review.\r\n\r\nINCIDENT INVESTIGATION: A facility team promptly investigates any accident, near miss, or incident that resulted in, or could have resulted in, an ammonia release.  Findings of the investigation team and their recommendations for corrective action are documented, as is the resolution of the recommendations and corrective actions.\r\n\r\nCOMPLIANCE AUDIT: The program is audited at least every three years to verify compliance with these procedures. Findings of the audit are documented and any deficiencies are corrected and documented.\r\n\r\n5-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY: \r\n\r\nThe Risk Management rule requires inclusion of the 5-year accident history of the facility for"

      "SummaryText": "all accidental releases that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or any known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage. There have been no reportable releases in the facility's last five years. However, a non-reportable release was recorded on July 2, 2013, for which a notification was submitted to the National Response Center, case number 701976. This release was less than 100 pounds of anhydrous ammonia. \r\n\r\nSYNOPSIS OF WORST AND ALTERNATE CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS:\r\n\r\nThe Risk Management rule requires a hazard analysis for worst case and alternate case accidental release scenarios for regulated substances. The rule requires an analysis involving the release of the total contents of the largest storage vessel of ammonia at this site. This is called the \"worst case toxic release scenario\" (worst case scenario) and involves the release of 32,250 tons of ammonia. This release must be considered to occur over a 10- minute period and pooling of the ammonia can be considered when modeling this release.  EPA\u00bfs RMP*COMP version 1.07 was used to determine the maximum downwind distance the ammonia release could impact the general public.  This assessment incorporated a toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L (Ammonia concentration) of 0.14 mg/L.  This toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L refers to the maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms that could impair an individual\u00bfs ability to take protective action.\r\n\r\nAn alternate scenario, which is a more likely event, is required to be submitted. The alternate case chosen involved the release of ammonia from a transfer pipe where 96,000 pounds would be released over a 2-minute period. A significantly lower quantity is involved because various shutdown safeguards have been installed and operat"

      "SummaryText": "or intervention will tend to mitigate and limit the quantity in such cases. The same modeling techniques were applied and resulted in much lesser off-site impact.  Under average weather conditions of low/moderate wind speed and neutral atmospheric dispersion, the release will cause off-site impacts.  The EPA\u00bfs RMP*COMP version 1.07, was also used to perform the off-site consequence analysis.  The ammonia toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L was used in the assessment.\r\n\r\nCHANGES FOR SAFETY IMPROVEMENTS: \r\n\r\nSafety improvements are a continual and ongoing process at the Terminal.  The Prevention Program of the Process Safety Management Program facilitates this process.  Many process safeguards have been implemented as a result of the Process Hazard Analysis and the Incident Investigation activities.  The increased emphasis on security measures since September 11, 2001 has also been instrumental in many improvements, such as an expanded video surveillance system, improved fencing, all electronically controlled gates, intruder alarms, crash barriers, and greatly enhanced lighting.  Among the many improvements  for this facility are more security cameras, more radios, more ammonia sensors, an improved ship/shore emergency shutdown device, installation of quantifier/alarm systems on all Storage Tank vacuum/vent valves, the installation of a deluge vapor suppression system, upgrading of instrumentation, upgrading of compressor systems, the testing/repairing/painting/re-insulating of Terminal piping, and the institution of a Preventive Maintenance Program.  It is the belief of Yara North America, Inc. that through improvements like these and the diligent application of the elements of the Prevention Program/Process Safety Management Program that our employees and the community can be assured that the need for emergency response has been, and will continue to be, significantly diminished and hopefully will never be necessary."
