This\ncommitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training of\npersonnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our\nprocesses.  Our standing practice is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable\nreleases of regulated flammable substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained gas plant\npersonnel will take appropriate action to control/mitigate the release.\n\nA DESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe East Texas (Avinger) plant, located in rural Marion County, Texas, operates a variety of processes\nto recover petroleum products (e.g., natural gas, propane, butane, condensate) from field gas. \nWellhead gas is received at the facility via pipelines.  The liquid hydrocarbons are separated out by employing the cryogenic/turbo-expander/demethanizer process.  The demethanized residue gas is either sold to customers as low pressure gas or recompressed employing five reciprocating compressors for sale to customers as high pressure gas.  The liquid hydrocarbons separated in this process are fed into a fractionation process.  In the fractionation process, propane, butane, and natural gasoline are separated off from the De-ethanizer tower bottom and are sold to third party customers.  The following flammable substances regulated under the Risk Management Program are stored at the facility:  propane, butane, and a flammable mixture (Natural Gas Liquids).  There are no threshold quantities of toxic substances present.  The facility is classified as a Program Level 3 under the regulations.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the East Texas (Avinger) plant. \nBecause processes at the gas plant that are regulated by the Environmenta"

Examples of employee participation range from updating\nand compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a\nprocess hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of\nthe gas plant accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the\naccident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is\nmaintained at the gas plant and addresses each accident prevention program element.  In\naddition, the gas plant has a number of initiatives in place that address process safety and\nemployee safety issues.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe East Texas (Avinger) plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe\noperation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated\nhazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment\ndesign basis/configuration information.  Specific departments within the gas plant are assigned\nresponsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.  The reference documents\nand their location is readily available as part of the written employee participation plan to help\nemployees locate any necessary process safety information.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure\ntreatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).

For specific process areas, the gas\nplant has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature,\nlevel, composition).  The gas plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits\nusing process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective\ninstrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\nThe gas plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the\ndesign and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of\nconstruction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment.  This\ninformation provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as\nevaluating proposed changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nThe East Texas (Avinger) plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with\nthe various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is\nsystematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to\nmanage these hazards.\n\nThe gas plant primarily uses the HAZOP analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  The\nanalyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience\nas well as engineering expertise.  The team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well\nas accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional\nprevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nThe PHA team findings are sent to local and corporate management for resolution. \nImplementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is guided by a relative risk\nranking assigned by the PHA tea"

The final resolution of each finding is documented\nand retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate\nsignificantly from the original design safety features, the plant periodically updates and\nrevalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five\nyears and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The results\nand findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are\nforwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is\ndocumented and retained.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe East Texas (Avinger) plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process\noperations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4)\nemergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process.  These\nprocedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent\ntraining of new operators.

Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support\npersonnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment\nundergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous substances before\nprocess piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing\nactivities (i.e., hot work), and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are\nin place before entry into a confined space.  These procedures (and others), along with training of\naffected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are\nperformed safely.\n\nManagement of Change\n\nThe East Texas (Avinger) plant has a comprehensive system to manage changes to all covered processes. \nThis system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology\n(including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly\nreviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that\nadequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls\nhave not been compromised by the change.  Chemical hazard information, process operating\nlimits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these\nchanges.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training\non the change.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nThe East Texas (Avinger) plant promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably "
