      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nThe United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) developed the Risk Management Program (RMP) rule (40 CFR 68) to assist facilities in preventing accidental releases of highly toxic or flammable chemicals.  The RMP established three levels of requirements for the program.  Programs 1 and 2 are for facilities that pose less risk to the environment and therefore have reduced compliance requirements.  Program 1 is designed for \"no impact\" facilities and has the fewest requirements, while Program 3 is the most stringent of the three levels.\n\nThe program level for each facility is determined by:\n\n\u0095\tUse of regulated substances in threshold quantities\n\u0095\tImpact of an off-site public receptor (e.g., residence, school, park)\n\u0095\tNorth American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code\n\u0095\tFive-year accident history\n\u0095\tOSHA Process Safety Management (PSM), 29 CFR 1910.119 applicability\n\nWashington Eastern Railroad, LLC (Washington Eastern) has prepared this RMP under Program 3 requirements because:\n\n\u0095\tThe site handles butane in excess of the threshold quantity (10,000 lbs).\n\u0095\tA release from this facility could impact an offsite public receptor (e.g. residence).\n\u0095\tThe site maintains an OSHA PSM because the facility is normally occupied.\n\nElements required by USEPA 40 CFR 68 Subparts B through H for Program 3 are presented in Sections 2 through 10 of this document and in the Appendices.\n\n1.1\t\u00a768.155(a) Accidental Release and Emergency Response Policies\n\nWashington Eastern  has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety. Our commitment is demonstrated by the capital and human resources invested in our accident protection and accidental release prevention/mitigation programs. Washington Eastern \u0092 mitigation efforts include: personnel training; safety engineered design; thorough process hazard analyses; compliance audits; management of change; contractor oversight; and planned equipment installation, operation,  and maintenance of our processes"

However, if a release does occur, transloading personnel are trained to follow Washington Eastern\u0092s emergency response procedures in an effort to safely avert further release and minimize the impact to public and environmental receptors.\n\n?\n1.2\t\u00a768.155(b) Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Four Lakes Transloading Facility, located at 9025 S Craig Road in Cheney, Washington, performs transloading of butane from railcars to tank trucks.  The part of the process that was selected to represent all regulated flammable substances at the Hartford Transloading Site which could contain a regulated flammable substance above the threshold quantity is a butane railcar. This vessel was selected due to having the greatest inventory and endpoint potential of a regulated flammable substance that could hypothetically be released and have offsite consequences.\n\nIn order to establish the safest possible environment for our employees, third party contractors, and the public, any inventory of regulated toxic substances is maintained below the threshold quantity. In addition to following the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP), the Hartford Transloading Site follows applicable laws set forth in OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard 29 CFR 1910.119.\n\n1.3\t\u00a768.155(c) Accidental Release Prevention Program and Prevention Steps\n\nPrevention Program 3 elements are presented in the following sections of this report as required under Part 68 Subpart D.  The following elements are addressed in the Process Safety Management (PSM) Plan, which is a standalone document:\n\n\u0095\tProcess Safety Information\t\u00a768.65\n\u0095\tProcess Hazard Analysis\t\u00a768.67\n\u0095\tOperating Procedures\t\t\u00a768.69\n\u0095\tTraining\t\t\t\u00a768.71\n\u0095\tMechanical Integrity\t\t\u00a768.73\n\u0095\tManagement of Change\t\u00a768.75\n\u0095\tPre-startup Review\t\t\u00a768.77\n\u0095\tCompliance Audits\t\t\u00a768.79\n\u0095\tIncident Investigat"

This summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accidental release prevention program.\n?\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nWashington Eastern  encourages employees (or third-party contractors) to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention. Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team. Employees have access to all information created as part of the site accident prevention program. Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the site and addresses each accident prevention program element. \n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nWashington Eastern  develops and maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. Specific personnel at the site are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information. A table summarizing the reference documents and their location is readily available as part of the written employee participation plan to help employees locate any necessary process safety information.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency respon"

For specific process areas, Washington Eastern  has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in our Operating Procedures and/or Process Safety Information. Washington Eastern  ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\nWashington Eastern  also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nThe Four Lakes Transloading Site has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled. Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nWashington Eastern  primarily uses the What-if/Checklist analysis technique to perform these evaluations. The analyses are conducted using a team of Washington Eastern  personnel and/or third-party contractors who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.

Once approved, mitigation actions are assigned a relative risk ranking based upon the magnitude/immediacy of necessary actions to reduce hazard risks - as deemed necessary by the PHA Team, PHA Team Leader, and/or Corporate Management. This risk reduction ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention. All management-approved PHA Team recommendations are mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nPeriodically, Washington Eastern  updates and revalidates the initial PHA to ensure that process controls remain technologically adequate, and that process hazards are minimized and are within acceptable company risk tolerances. The PHA Revalidation verities that the process does not deviate significantly from its original engineering design and safety features. These periodic revalidations/reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is decommissioned. The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained. As with the initial analysis, the PHA Team findings/recommendations will be forwarded to corporate management for approval/revision, and the final resolution of the action tasks will be documented and retained.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe Cheney Transloading Site maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, including (1) initial startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) startup following an emergency shutdown.

This information is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\nTraining\n\nWashington Eastern  has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees and third-party contractors involved in operating a process. New employees receive basic training in transloading operations if they are not already familiar with such operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, and skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years. All training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n?\nContractors\n\nWashington Eastern  uses third party contractors to supplement its work force.

Washington Eastern  personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\nWashington Eastern  conducts a Pre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR) for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information. The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service. This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready. The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness. A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nWashington Eastern  established practices and procedures to maintain piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition. The basic aspects of this program include: \n\n\u0095\tConducting training:\n\u0095\tDeveloping written procedures;\n\u0095\tPerforming inspections and tests;\n\u0095\tCorrecting identified deficiencies; and\n\u0095\tApplying quality assurance measures. \n\nIn combination, these activities"

Maintenance personnel receive training on the following to help ensure that they perform their jobs in a safe manner:\n\n\u0095\tProcess overview;\n\u0095\tSafety and health hazards;\n\u0095\tApplicable maintenance procedures;\n\u0095\tEmergency response plans; and\n\u0095\tApplicable safe work practices.\n\nWritten procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training. Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for piping). If a deficiency is identified, employees (or third-party contractors) will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or a management of change team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\n\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance. Washington Eastern  incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs. This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made. \n\nSafe Work Practices\n\nThe Four Lakes Transloading Site has safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety. Examples of these include:\n\n\u0095\tControl of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel;\n\u0095\tA lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance;\n\u0095\tA procedure for safe removal of hazardous substances before piping or equipment is opened;\n\u0095\tA permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work); and\n\u0095\tA permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space. \n\nThese procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure t"

This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented. Changes are reviewed to ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change. Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes. In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided with any necessary training on the change.\n?\nIncident Investigation\n\nWashington Eastern  promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury. The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to Washington Eastern  management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings. Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidations.\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nTo help ensure that the accidental release prevention program is functioning properly, Washington Ea"
