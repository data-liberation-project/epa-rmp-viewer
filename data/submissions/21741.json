The Facility Policy\n\n    MFA Incorporated, and the employees of the MFA Agri Service  in Vandalia are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Vandalia Fire Department, and other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information\n\n    The primary activity at the facility is the receiving, storage and distribution of various grains.  During the fertilizer off season, anhydrous ammonia nurse tanks are stored in a flat storage building at the West Grain facility to prevent vandalism. \n\n    The maximum quantity handled would be the storage of 1,000 gallon nurse tanks holding approximately 4,500 pounds in the flat storage building.  The number of nurse tanks stored at the facility will vary, depending on the season and product movement.\n\n3. The worst-case and alternative release scenario.\n\n    a. The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of three nurse tanks, released as a gas over 10 minutes. The maximum quantity released would be 13,500 pounds, which represents the volume of the three nurse tanks at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 0.82 miles.\n\n    b. The alternative release scenario based on the most likely potential incident is a release from a break in a 1? transfer hose during handling operations. This release is assumed to last approximately 2 minutes before automatic or manual shut-off stops the flow. The maximum quantity release would be 2,901 pounds. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 0.47 miles.\n4. The Accidental Release Prevention Program.\n\n    The facility has implemented the prov"

The Five-year Accident History\n\n    There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that: have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6. The Emergency Response Program.\n\n    The facility has;\n\n    a. a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA\n       Standard, 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\n    b. provided State and Local authorities with the emergency\n       planning and community right-to-know information as\n       required under SARA Title III (EPCRA);\n\n    c. a written emergency response program, in accordance with\n       OSHA Standard, 29 CFR 1910.120, including pre-emergency\n       planning and employee training.\n\n7. Planned changes to improve safety.\n\n    Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions. There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
