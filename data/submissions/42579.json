      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES:\n\nThe Plymouth Tube Company, East Troy  facility utilizes Hydrofluoric Acid (70% by weight) (HF) as a pickling agent for stainless steel tubes.  Plymouth Tube is committed to ensuring that HF is stored and handled in a safe manner.  We have conducted hazard reviews of the HF process to ensure that our installations are in compliance with Federal, state and local codes, standards, and generally accepted good engineering practice and reviewed maintenance and operating procedures to enhance safety.  Employees and contractors who are involved in storing and handling HF have been trained in safe storage and handling procedures.\n\nIn case of an accidental release of HF, it is Plymouth Tube Company's policy to notify the Village of East Troy Emergency Services and Superior Special Services, Inc. (contract agreement for spill response) so that they can respond to the emergency.  Plymouth Tube has procedures in place to notify the appropriate emergency services in case of an accidental release.\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED:\n\nThe primary purpose of Plymouth Tube Company's East Troy, Wisconsin facilities is to manufacture stainless steel tube of varying diameters and lengths.  Stainless steel sheet rock is formed, rolled and welded into tubing.  In order to pickle the finishing tube, lengths of tubing are dipped into a solution of HF (2%-5%), Nitric Acid and water.  After pickling, the tubing is inspected, rinsed and bundled for shipping.  There is one HF (70% by weight) storage tank at one location at the site.  The HF tank is 6,300 gallons in capacity and is located outside the southwest corner of the building.\n\nThe RMP regulated substance at the East Troy, Wisconsin facility is Hydrofluoric Acid (70% by weight).\n\nTHE WORST CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS:\n\nThe Worst-Case Release Scenario for HF is mandated in the RMP rule (40 CFR 68.25) to be the instantaneous release of the en"

      "SummaryText": "tire contents of the largest single storage vessel, to form a liquid pool.  There is a containment dike that will contain the entire contents of the largest spill; therefor, evaporation occurs over the surface area of the containment dike.  The Environmental Protection Agency's Off-Site Consequence Analysis Guidance (OCAG) formulas and tables were used to determine a rate of evaporation of the spilled pool.  The OCAG provided atmospheric, topographic andprocess parameters in order to estimate the distance that the evaporated pool of HF liquid would disperse to the surroundings.  The dispersion distance specified by the RMP rule is the distance to the ERPG-2 (Emergency Response Planning Guidline-2).  The ERPG-2 is a number estimated by the American Industrial Hygene Association to be the concentration of HF that is believed nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms that could impair their ability to take protective action.  The worst case ERPG-2 impact area for the HF storage tank was determined to be a circle, centered on the storage tank, with radii equal to the ERPG-2 distance.  The impacted area of the storage tank is a circle with a radius of 0.40 miles.  There are public receptors within this area.\n\nThe Alternate Release Scenario for HF is one that is more likely to occur than the Worst-Case Release Scenario.  The distance to the endpoint (ERPG-2) is computed using more typical atmospheric conditions.  A number of alternate release scenarios were considered.  The scenario chosen for analysis was a failure of an HF transfer hose or fitting during the delivery of HF to a storage tank.  There are two trained delivery personnel in attendance at all times during delivery.  These persons are equipped with personal protective and could reach critical shut off valves within 20 seconds time HF would be spilled on the ground both from the storage tank and delivery"

The impact area for the HF storage tank was calculated by a circle with a radius of 0.20 miles.  There are public receptors within this area.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS:\n\nPlymouth Tube Company's facilities are in compliance with the USEPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule (40 CFR 68).  The HF equipment was installed according to guidelines provided by the Hydrogen Fluoride Industry Practices Institute.  The HF delivery hoses are wire reinforced, inspected before and after each use and replaced annually.  The storage tank has been thickness tested.\n\nTHE FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\n\nThe Plymouth Tube Company, East Troy site has not experienced a release of Hydrofluoric Acid in the last five years that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place.\n\nTHE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\n\nIn the event of an emergecy involving hydrofluoric acid, it is Plymouth Tube Company's policy to notify the City of East Troy, Wisconsin Emergency Services and Superior Environmental Services, Inc., our designated spill contractor, and let them respond to the emergency.  We have discussed this policy with Emergency Services."
