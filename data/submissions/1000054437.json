A customized mitigation and/or response plan is then developed and implemented to respond to the particular risk or emergency situation. Furthermore, the facility is covered under the Henry County EMA Emergency Response Plan.\n\n\n\nStationary Source\n\nRed Star Yeast Company, LLC\n\n13211 US Highway 431 South\n\nHeadland, AL 36345\n\n\n\n40 CFR 68 Regulated Substance(s)\n\nChemical CAS# 7664-41-7 \n\nNAICS Code 311999\n\nThreshold Quantity 20,000 lbs. Aqua Ammonia\n\nAvailable Storage On-Site 130,000 lbs.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nProgram level 2\n\nThe facility implements measures, both technological and procedural, to ensure prevention of accidental release of regulated substances. Process controls have been designed into the process to prevent and/or minimize accidental releases of regulated substances. Regular monitoring and maintenance is performed on all equipment to ensure optimum operating conditions and minimize accidents.\n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThere has been no accident in the last five years at this facility.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\n\nThe facility has compiled an Emergency Response (ER) Plan, and has coordinated the\n\nER plan with the Henry County EMA office. In the event of an accident, the Henry\n\nCounty EMA Emergency Response Plan would be activated.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to improve safety\n\n\n\nContinuous Improvement is an integral part of the RMP. This includes proactive planning and implementation of safety and process improvement ideas to further mitigate accidents at the facility. Along with the other aspects of the RMP, safety an process improvement ideas and plans will be reviewed at the regularly scheduled risk review conducted by the RMP mana"
