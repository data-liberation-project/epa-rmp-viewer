This document consists of the executive summary and registration data elements (68.155 through 68.185).\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n1.0    RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe Con Agra Frozen Foods (CFF) facility in Marshall, MO has a good record in preventing releases of anhydrous* ammonia.  The CFF facility has a thorough emergency training program for on-site emergency responders.  The facility has implemented CFF?s HAZWOPER plan (emergency response program) which is a plan designed for the safety of its employees?, the community and the environment.  This detailed emergency response program includes procedures for handling an emergency - the established action plan and appropriate personnel involved in containing a hazardous release (HAZMAT team).  As part of this emergency response program, CFF emphasizes a thorough training program and medical surveillance of the HAZMAT team prior to and after an incident.  With the potential dangers associated with a hazardous chemical release, CFF has researched and developed safe containment and disposal procedures as well as an evaluation procedure following an emergency response.  All of these components make the CFF HAZWOPER plan a thorough and comprehensive plan for release prevention and emergency response.\n\nThe emergency response policies at the CFF facility ensure that there is emergency response coverage 24 hours - 7 days per week.  There are also provisions for coordination with outside agencies such as the Marshall Fire Department in the event of an emergency.\n\n*From this point in the Executive Summary, anhydrous ammonia will be synonymous with ammonia.\n\n2.0    PROCESS DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nCFF is a producer of prepared frozen foods (chicken products, pot pies, and frozen meals).  The NAICS code for this processes at this facility is 311412.  Many areas of the plant are refrigerated to preser"

      "SummaryText": "ve the food products. \n\nCFF has one regulated substance under 40 CFR 68: ammonia.  Ammonia is used as a refrigerant in the refrigeration of the foods in the various areas of the plant.\n\nThe plant has two separate processes that are regulated under Section 112(r).  The main plant ammonia system has 57,091 pounds of ammonia and is used for refrigeration in the main processing plant.  The new freezer warehouse is another regulated process with 55,643 pounds of ammonia.  There is another warehouse that has only 3,000 pounds and is not regulated.\n\n\n\n\n3.0    WORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration systems have associated hazards that can potentially affect on-site employees and the general public off-site if there is a release from the system.  Described below are the associated hazards for the regulated chemical.  Though there are other scenarios possible, EPA only requires that one worst-case and one alternative scenario be reported for each process.  Since the Marshall facility has two processes above the threshold, one worst-case and two alternative scenarios were developed.\n\nAmmonia \n\nAmmonia is classified as a Group 2 Refrigerant per ASHRAE Standard 34-1989.  The dominant characteristic of this chemical is its toxicity.  It is a self-alarming chemical by its distinctive pungent odor.  Due to this odor, persons exposed to ammonia vapor will not voluntarily stay in areas of even small concentrations.  Ammonia will burn at a very narrow and high range of concentrations accompanied with a high ignition temperature.  Although ammonia is not poisonous, it is corrosive to human tissue.  Ammonia is readily absorbed into the moisture of the skin and, at high concentrations, can cause severe burns.\n\nThe risks to persons in an accidental release of ammonia include:\n\n1.    Corrosive attack of skin and other tissue (including lung tissue)\n2.    Freezing of skin and other body tissue when contacted by liquid ammonia\n\n4.0    GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTIO"

      "SummaryText": "N PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nCFF has developed an OSHA PSM program for their ammonia refrigeration systems. At CFF, ammonia falls under the RMP Program 3 prevention program which is identical to the OSHA PSM program.  EPA has said that if the process is in compliance with OSHA PSM, then it is compliance with RMP Program 3.  Thus, CFF?s ammonia PSM has been reviewed and determined to be complete for the RMP document.  \n\nThere are several aspects of the ammonia prevention program that are key:\n\n1.    The ammonia PSM program at CFF includes provisions for employee involvement, procedures for working with contractors, pre-startup safety reviews and managing change within the system. The different sections of the PSM document detail employee participation (hazard analysis team), process safety information, process hazard analysis (PHA - what-if/checklist), operating procedures, training, mechanical integrity, hot work permits, management of change, incident investigation, compliance audits and emergency planning and response (HAZWOPER plan).  The plant, therefore, maintains good training, certification, and employee awareness of operating procedures.\n\n2.    CFF has researched information pertaining to the properties and hazards of ammonia, sought professional assistance from experts in the ammonia refrigeration industry, and used many internal resources to develop the ?ConAgra Frozen Foods - Ammonia Refrigeration Reference Manual?.  Block flow diagrams and P&ID?s have been developed and are updated as the ammonia refrigeration system audits are completed.\n\n3.    CFF has established a hazards analysis team (comprising of plant employees)  responsible for updating existing operating procedures for the refrigeration system and also verifying and documenting the mechanical integrity of the system.\n\n4.    In the event of a catastrophic release or an incident which could have resulted in a catastrophe, investigations will be undertaken (this is a policy of the PSM doc"

Necessary preventative measures will be taken to reduce the risk of incident reoccurrence.\n\n5.0    FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe review of CFF?s accident history includes the following range of dates: June 22, 1999 - June 21, 2004. According to 40 CFR Part 68.42(a), there have been no accidental releases at this facility.\n\n6.0    EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nAs mentioned previously, the CFF facility has developed an OSHA hazardous substance emergency response program called HAZWOPER.  The HAZWOPER document contains detailed procedures for: emergency evacuation, communication, escape routes, and emergency assessments.\n\nCFF?s emergency response plan (HAZWOPER) is a detailed document which discusses the role of employees and management in an emergency situation.  All emergency response personnel undergo training and records of this training are maintained and updated on site.  The plan outlines specific procedures for evacuations, incident alarms and alerting.  Depending upon a given situation, the Fire Department will be called to provide back-up emergency responders and equipment.   The Fire Department will be called for all fire related emergencies.  The incident commander has ultimate control of implementation of the emergency response plan.\n\n7.0    PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nBased on the completed Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) for ammonia, a list of action items were developed and their status monitored to ensure that implementation was accomplished."
