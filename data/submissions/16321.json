The RMP  was prepared by Primatech in accordance with the requirements of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RM program) regulation (Risk Management Programs for Chemical Accidental Release Prevention, 40 CFR Part 68).\n\nMr. Ray Rehman, Associate Engineer from Primatech, was the project manager for the preparation of the RMP.  Mr. Greg Hutton, Chief Engineer, coordinated the preparation of the RMP for Texas Freezer Inc.\n\nThe information presented in this report reflects the data element requirements and numbering sequence of the final EPA RMP submission format .  Prior to submission to the EPA, the RMP information would need to be converted into a specified electronic format via data entry into a software tool such as RMP*Submit provided by the EPA.  EPA also requires the numerical information in the RMP to be presented in a specified number of significant digits.  This format should be adhered to when specifying numeric\n\nA.   Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nTexas Freezer recognizes management's responsibility in protecting its employees, equipment, property, and the environment.  The safety and health of all personnel are very important.  The control of accidents has been and will continue to be a basic responsibility of all personnel in the Dallas facility.\n\nTo accomplish the company's goal in controlling accidental losses, the facility has established a Plant Safety Program.  The objectives of the Plant Safety Program are to: maximize efficiency and safety performance, reduce losses associated with damage of property, eliminate human suffering and the economic burden resulting from injuries and accidents.\n\nOne of the activities associated with the Plant Safety Program has been the development and implementation of acc"

Mr. Greg Hutton, Chief Engineer,\nThe purpose of the accidental release prevention and emergency response programs is to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents.  Overall, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs help prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices which govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment.  These rules are detailed and improved as (often as) necessary.  They are also communicated to and accepted by all employees at the facility.\n\nB.   Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nTexas Freezer Inc. operates a cold storage facility in Dallas, TX.  The facility operates two  ammonia refrigeration systems (i. e., the Building 1 and Building 2 Refrigeration Systems) to provide cooling and freezing capabilities.  The amount of anhydrous ammonia (CAS #7662-41-7) contained in these systems is below the EPA's  threshold of 10,000 pounds.  The maximum amount of ammonia charged to the Building 1 and 2 Refrigeration Systems is 9,500 and 9,000 pounds respectively.  Since ammonia releases fro\nC.
