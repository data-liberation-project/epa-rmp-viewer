      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nThe C&S Wholesale Foods distribution center in Stockton, California utilizes approximately 25,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia in to refrigerate warehoused food prior to distribution.  This exceeds U.S. EPA?s Risk Management Program (RMP) threshold quantity (TQ) for preparing an RMP.  Because the facility?s utilization of this quantity of ammonia also exceeds the TQ established by U.S. OSHA for preparing a Process Safety Management (PSM) Plan (completed for the facility in March 1996 and revised in June 1999), the facility is subject to Program 3 of the RMP regulations.  \n\nIn 2006, the refrigeration facility was purchased by C&S Wholesale Grocers from Ralphs Grocery Company.  No changes were made to the facility.  Ammonia is used in a closed-loop refrigeration system to provide cooling and freezing of food products prior to distribution to various retail outlets.  This warehouse-like facility uses approximately 25,000 pounds (lbs) of ammonia in the system to keep food products at refrigeration and freezer temperatures.  This is the only covered process as determined by U.S. EPA and CalARP regulations.\n\nThe principal element of the Program 3 RMP is the Offsite Consequence Analysis.  This involves developing and modeling one worst-case and one alternative theoretical release scenario to estimate the impact an accidental release may have on the public in the surrounding area.  The worst-case release assumes that the entire ammonia charge is released into the atmosphere during pessimistic meteorological conditions.  This scenario is intended as a basis of comparison with other facilities, but it is not realistic to expect such a scenario to actually occur.  The requirements for the alternative release include that it be more likely to occur than the worst case scenario and that it be substantial enough to reach offsite.  The alternative release scenario assumes average daily atmospheric conditions for the area, which were mandated by the local Administ"

Because ammonia can exist in both neutrally bouyant and heavy gas states under the conditions examined, both the Gaussian and heavy gas Algorithms were used.  The more conservative of the two toxic endpoint calculations were used for assessing each release scenario?s impact.  The toxic endpoint is given as 0.14 milligrams-per-liter by the American Industrial Hygiene Association?s Emergency Response Planning Guidelines for Level 2. \n\nThe facility has not had any accidental releases of ammonia that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage onsite, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage within the past five years.\n\nThe prevention program requirements for Program 3 RMPs are taken verbatim from applicable sections of the PSM regulations.  This is a result of U.S. EPA?s recognition that measures taken to reduce and mitigate hazards to facility workers will also serve the same purpose for the surrounding community and environment.  Thus, in order to eliminate redundancy, the PSM is referenced in the RMP.  The PSM consists of several elements that contain or describe procedures that must be implemented on an ongoing basis, including ammonia and process safety information,  process hazard analysis, operating procedures, employee training, contractor qualification, pre-startup safety reviews, mechanical integrity of equipment, management of change, incident investigation, and injury and illness prevention. \n\nThe intent of the Process Safety Information (PSI) section is to compile system information for use in conducting the Process Hazard Analysis and to help facility operators to identify and understand the hazards posed by those processes involving highly hazardous chemicals.

This information must be kept up-to-date as process changes or upgrades are made.

The facility has also developed an ammonia information notebook that contains essential information about ammonia and the refrigeration system in an easy-to-understand format appropriate for facility visitors, contractors, and personnel not involved with operating the refrigeration system. \n\nThe purpose of the operating procedures portion of the PSM program is to develop, implement, and maintain clearly written, detailed procedures, guidelines, rules and practices for the safe operation of the refrigeration process during all operating phases.  A copy of the operating procedures must be readily accessible to all employees who work on or near the refrigeration system.  All employees involved in the daily operation and maintenance of the refrigeration process should have a full understanding of every operating phase.  This is to include an overview of the process, principles of using ammonia in refrigeration systems, operating characteristics of the components of the system and the associated safety hazards, and the proper steps to be taken to execute all system-related tasks in a safe manner.  Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) have been developed that include all pertinent procedures involved with the refrigeration system, including those mandated by the PSM regulation.

Therefore, Stockton Logistics has developed a written training program for all employees involved in the operation, maintenance, and supervision of the refrigeration system.  Each employee involved with the refrigeration system operation will, at a minimum, receive training in understanding MSDS?s, routine system operation, emergency system operation, normal and emergency ammonia safety and handling procedures, and the individual?s role in emergency response.  This program includes the identity of employees to be trained, the training program technical content, competency requirements, documentation requirements for demonstration of competence, schedule for initial training and refresher training, and training for change.  In addition, contract and maintenance personnel also receive training as provided for in the Contractor Qualification Program.  The PSM includes a form for documenting all training provided to employees.\nThe purpose of the Contractor Qualification Program is to help ensure that contractors and their employees are fully aware of the potential dangers involved in the use of ammonia and the refrigeration system.  This awareness should lead to reduced risk of accidents, and thus improved safety for both contractor employees and the company?s employees.  It applies to all contractors performing any type of work (e.g. maintenance, renovation) on or in the vicinity of the refrigeration system.  The Contractor Qualification Program consists of a five-part procedure to be used during the procurement of a contractor in order to verify that their employees are adequately informed and trained, and includes several forms to facilitate and document the process.  \n\nThe purpose for the pre-startup safety review is to help ensure that certain important considerations have been addressed prior to startup of a new or modified process involving ammonia.

The mechanical integrity program helps ensure that proper procedures are adequate and are being followed, such that all equipment used to process, store and handle ammonia is maintained properly.  The mechanical integrity program includes an inventory of all refrigeration system equipment, including the date on which it was installed and its life expectancy, a list of scheduled maintenance tasks and inspections and a description of the preventative maintenance program for process equipment. \n\nA PSM compliance audit must be completed at least every three years.  The principal objective of the audit is determine whether the procedures and practices that have been developed to comply with the PSM regulation are adequate and are being followed.  The audit is to include an evaluation of the design and effectiveness of the PSM program and a field inspection of the safety and health conditions and practices to verify that the PSM elements are effectively implemented. \n\nThe facility manager selects a trained team of people to audit the PSM program.

In order to facilitate necessary changes, while ensuring that unrecognized and/or unacceptable hazards are not introduced, the management of change (MOC) procedure has been developed.  The objective of the MOC procedure is to help ensure that all changes are properly reviewed, and that any hazards introduced by the implementation of the change are identified and controlled, prior to placing the change in operation.  The MOC procedure is intended to apply to all equipment and procedures involving the refrigeration system, and to any change in procedures regardless of whether the change is considered major or minor, or is of a temporary or permanent nature.  As part of the PSM, definitions, procedures, and documentation forms were developed to accomplish the MOC.\n\nA procedure has been developed to investigate serious incidents or near-misses in order to understand what happened (or could have happened) and to prevent any recurrence of similar incidents, thereby improving the safety of the process.  Formal incident investigations will be performed any time there is an incident which resulted in, or which could reasonably have resulted in (near-miss), a catastrophic release of ammonia.
