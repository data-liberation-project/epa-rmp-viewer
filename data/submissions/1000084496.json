The Risk Management Program identifies the equipment, procedures, maintenance, inspection, and training associated with Regulated Substances (RS's) handled at this facility in excess of Federal threshold quantities; describes the structured assessment of hazards which was conducted to assess possible effects on employees and offsite public and environmental receptors; provides the results of an offsite consequences analysis; defines a prevention program, emergency response program, and mitigation measures to reduce the probability and magnitude of accidental releases of RS's; and establishes a schedule and responsibilities for implementation of mitigation measures and auditing of program elements.  This Risk Management Plan (RMP) is being filed as required by Federal ARP and CalARP regulations to report the elements of the current Risk Management Program and to describe further measures planned to mitigate or prevent accidental releases of RS's.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\n\n\nThe City of Lakeport Municipal Sewer District (CLMSD) operates a wastewater treatment plant located at 795 Linda Lane, Lakeport, CA, in Lake County. It uses chlorine, an RS, for disinfection in quantities greater than the California threshold quantity for this RS.  The facility is located in a rural area beyond a low-density residential area.  There are two full-time employees at this site.   Chlorine is received in 2000 lb. (ton) containers by truck, handled with a crane, and stored secured by straps to individual scales.  The chlorine is used to disinfect the treated water.   Automatic switchover vacuum regulator valves are attached to the gas valves of two cylinders, one online and one standby.  Up to four full ton containe"

Chlorine under vacuum is metered through a rate valve in a smart valve and drawn into water solution by the passage of pressurized water through an ejector.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n\n\nThe City of Lakeport maintains the policy that the receipt, storage, and handling of chlorine at its facility be done to meet regulatory requirements and minimizes the probability and severity of accidental releases of chlorine to protect the health and safety of its workers, the public, and the environment.  To accomplish this goal, the City has gathered safety information on chlorine and the process, equipment, and procedures involving chlorine. It has performed a structured assessment of hazards of the chlorine disinfection and external events that might affect that process.  It performed an offsite consequences analysis of defined release scenarios, established a written program to prevent and mitigate accidental releases, and established a written emergency action program coordinated with the Lake County Fire Protection District.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAMS\n\n\n\nGeneral accidental release prevention programs instituted by the City of Lakeport are categorized as administrative (management) programs, procedures, training, engineering controls, and emergency response programs.  The City of Lakeport has instituted a Process Safety Management (PSM) Program meeting OSHA requirements at 29 CFR ?1910.119 and Cal/OSHA requirements at 8 CCR ?5189 covering the chlorine process at its Wastewater Treatment Facility utilizing chlorine in ton containers.  The program and document management procedures included in the PSM Program are used as the Risk Management Program management system.\n\n\n\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC RELEASE PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nRelease prevention steps specific to chlorine have been identifie"

These include, among other things, the creation of written procedures for chlorine receiving and cylinder changing, the introduction of air-purifying respirators for container changing, and an updated manual maintenance management system.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThere have been no reportable accidents involving chlorine at this facility within the past five years resulting in injuries/deaths, shelter in place orders, or property damage.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe City of Lakeport's Emergency Action Program applicable to chlorine has been coordinated with Lake County Fire Protection District and the City of Lakeport Fire District, the local agencies responsible for hazardous materials inventory reporting and release response coordination.  The emergency response plan for chlorine releases is to evacuate the area and call public agency First Responders.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nAll of the improvements and mitigation measures identified in the Process Hazard Analysis, which the City of Lakeport committed to accomplish have been completed or are in progress.  Any other measures identified by employees during workplace hazard surveys or other audit activities will be thoroughly reviewed and considered for implementation.\n\n\n\nThe City is investigating switching from chlorine to sodium hypochlorite within the next two years. \n\n"
