We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees, contractors, and the public, as well as protection of the environment. This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\nA description of our facility and use of substances regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) risk management program (RMP) regulation\n\nA summary of results from our assessment of the potential off-site consequences from accidental chemical releases\n\nAn overview of our accidental release prevention program\n\nA 5-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule \nAn overview of  our emergency response program\nAn overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our associates, contractors, the public, and the environment\n\nHuntington Water Treatment Plant Regulated Substances\n\nThe Huntington Water Treatment Plant is a water treatment facility that takes raw river water from the Ohio River in Huntington, West Virginia, and treats the river water with chlorine and other chemicals to make potable (drinking) quality water for public distribution and consumption.  Sewage treatment is not a part of lant operations. The plant handles one RMP-regulated toxic substance above the EPA threshold quantity, which is chlorine.

The container storage room area can hold up to 4 one-ton containers. Two containers are connected to the same feed piping manifold at a time. An alternate supply arrangement consists of two additional ton containers connected to a parallel, but normally isolated, feed piping manifold. Chlorine is stored as a liquefied gas under pressure, fed as a liquid to chlorine evaporators, and injected as a vapor at the outlet of the chlorinators into the water stream. Currently we store the reserve containers of chlorine outside. The chlorine process is classified as a Program Level 3 process, and we implement a complete accident prevention program.\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis\n\nWe performed an off-site consequence analysis to estimate the potential for an accidental release of chlorine from our facility as a regulated toxic substance that could affect the public or the environment. The off-site consequence analysis consisted of evaluating both a worst-case scenario (WCS) and an alternative release scenario (ARS) following identification of the appropriate ARS. We do not expect a worst-case release scenario to ever occur. An ARS represents a release that might occur during the lifetime of a facility similar to our water treatment plant. ARS's can be used to help the Cabell/Wayne (local) Emergency Planning Committee (C/WEPC) improve and prepare an effective community emergency response plan.\n\nWe have submitted release scenario analyses to EPA and have shared that information with C/WEPC and other organizations involved in emergency response activities. It is also available to local residents, schools, hospitals, and businesses. For these events, we have emergency mitigation systems that should help reduce the consequences of the events if they occur. In all cases, if such events occur, we would activate our emergency response plan to respond to the event notify l"

The paragraphs below briefly describe the scenarios we have included in our risk management plan (RMPlan), including information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures we have put in place to limit the exposure distances for each scenario.\n\nWorst-case Release Scenario for Chlorine\n\nThe worst case scenario at our water treatment facility involves a failure of a ton container holding approximately 2000 lbs of liquefied chlorine gas under pressure, resulting in a release with vaporization of the entire contents of the container. In this scenario, the chlorine is released as a vaporizing liquid outdoors of our water treatment building. Since this facility is located in a populated area, the toxic cloud formed by the evaporating chlorine would reach off-site end points and nearby public receptors.\n\nCurrently, the Huntington Water Treatment Plant is under construction of a new State-of-the-art facility including a chlorine feed/storage area. The new facility will contain a chlorine scrubber among other updated controls and computerization. This construction is scheduled to be complete by December 1999. Therefore, the results of the worst case and alternate case scenarios are based upon current operating conditions and not the new facility upgrades due to be complete in December, 1999.\n\nNumerous administrative controls are in place to prevent a release of this type and should one occur, to provide for effective emergency response. Controls include container design, storage, operation, maintenance and inspection; container repair and emergency response equipment; and personnel training conducted in accordance with regulatory requirements, chlorine industry standards and practices, and our company's corporate policies and procedures, which are strictly enforced at the water treatment plant.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario for Chlorine\n\nOur a"

      "SummaryText": "lternative release scenario for chlorine involves a chlorine release of approximately 4000 lbs through a broken flexible connection (\"pigtail\") between either of two connected chlorine containers and a common supply manifold in the liquid piping to our chlorine feed system. A break in a pigtail connecting one of the containers to the piping manifold will permit both connected containers to vent their respective contents (about 2000 lbs each) through the open ends of the severed pigtail. Credit is taken in accordance with EPA's simplified approach for the partial containment of chlorine vapor by the room/building enclosure, which mitigates the release. Such building confinement reduces the release rate of chlorine vapor directly to the outdoors. Since this facility is located in a populated area, the toxic cloud formed by the evaporating chlorine would reach off-site end points and nearby public receptors.\n\nAs in the WCS, we have taken a very conservative approach to determining the ARS endpoint distance off-site. Therefore, in determining the ARS endpoint distance we have not taken credit for active mitigation provided by engineered safeguards that include chlorine monitors/detectors. The chlorine leak detection system is calibrated toinitiate alarms at very low concentrations of chlorine (i.e., lower than industry recommended settings). Some of our additional engineering safeguards are outlined in the following section of this summary and include isolation valves. Isolation valves are provided in the downstream chlorine feed system to isolate downstream chlorine sources from the pigtail leak.  As stated in the description of the WCS, numerous administrative controls are in place to prevent a release of this type and to provide effective emergency response should one occur.\n\nWe are using this information to help us ensure that our site/facility emergency response plan and the community emergency response plan address all reasonable contingency cases.\n\nAccidental Rel"
