The program has many of the same elements that are covered in the Nevada's Division of Environmental Protection (NDEP's) Chemical Accident Prevention Program and OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) program. Nikkiso Cryo Incorporated (NCI) Cryogenic Pump Test Facility has hazardous toxic and flammable substances listed in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) at 40 CFR 68.130 in an amount above the threshold quantity specified for that substance, you are required to develop and implement a risk management program under a rule issued by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  For the RMP program that is Methane (CAS 74-92-8) and Propane (CAS 74-98-6) are both listed with a threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds.  The program complies with the EPA's RMP Level 3 requirements. The RMP is submitted to the EPA using RMP*eSubmit online. The process is on a secure web-based system and allows for access to the RMP online, anytime. The EPA Facility ID# is: 100000170977.\r\n\r\nMany of the required elements covered in the NCI procedures EHS P-024-01 Process Safety Management (PSM) Program and EHS P-025-01 Chemical Accident Prevention Program (CAPP) are referenced in this procedure. NCI is certified to ISO 14001 Environmental Management Systems and OHSAS 18001 Occupational Safety and Health Management Systems.\r\n\r\nScope\r\n\r\nThis procedure applies to all employees work for, or on behalf of NCI while on NCI facilities.

The on-site liquid is stored in two horizontal cylindrical tanks. The system consists of two cryogenic storage tanks for refrigerated testing fluid, four storage tanks for liquid nitrogen(LN2, used for cooling and purging, a non-regulated substance), two test pump vessels, a re-circulation vessel, two transfer pumps, associated piping, valves, heat exchangers, control system, etc. IT SHOULD BE NOTED that the facility can only have one regulated substance on site  AT ANY GIVEN SINGLE TIME, due to the fact that the facility has only one system set which can ha"

After the completion of each test the testing fluid is transported away from the facility, and the system is purged with liquid nitrogen (LN2) in preparation for the next test. Methane, propane, and butane are all non-toxic, flammable, and clean burning gases. The maximum allowed inventory at the facility is: 78,486 lbs of refrigerated LNG, OR 108,104 lbs of refrigerated liquid propane, OR 110,918 lbs of refrigerated liquid butane.\r\n\r\nNevada NDEP CAPP Programs and OSHA's PSM Program\r\n\r\nThe RMP and PSM program in many aspects mirrors the requirements for the Nevada Division of Environmental Protection (NDEP) Chemical Accident Prevention Program (CAPP).  CAPP applies to facilities that have select, highly hazardous substances in quantities above defined thresholds. These highly hazardous substances are distinguished from numerous other agency-regulated substances in that they will cause acute health impacts, that is, serious health impacts from a relatively short- term, low concentration exposure. Some of the highly hazardous substances are covered under CAPP solely due to their flammability; CAPP also applies in facilities that manufacture explosives for sale that are classified as division 1.1 through 1.5 in the Table of Hazardous Materials under 49CFR172.101. \r\n\r\nMuch like OSHA's PSM program the CAPP requirements fall into one of three categories; accident prevention, emergency response or public right-to-know. Through the accident prevention program, facilities are required to: evaluate and mitigate hazards, understand the design parameters of their processes and operate within the appropriate design limits, prepare comprehensive operating procedures, thoroughly train operators in those procedures and maintain the facility equipment and instruments to prevent premature failure.

      "SummaryText": "facilities are required to develop an action plan for dealing with potential emergency situations and they are further required to coordinate emergency response activities with local responders, to ensure that the responders are prepared to deal with the emergencies appropriately.\r\n\r\nWorst Case Release Scenario\r\n\r\nUsing the EPA's 40 CFR 68 and Off-site Consequence Analysis (OCA) Guidance, it is determined that the worst-case release scenario is failure of one or two storage tanks.  There tanks each have  a gross capacity of 13,848 gallons. However, the maximum allowed inventory by written SOPs is 80%, or 11,078 gallons (39,243 lbs.) of LNG. The release scenario results in an assumed vapor cloud explosion involving 926.7 lbs. which evaporates in 10 minutes from the liquid pool in a spill containment area.  The sump limits the exposed surface area of the pool to 450 square feet and thus reduces the evaporate / release to 92.67 lbs. / minute. The resulting distance of the endpoint of a 1 PSI overpressure (TNT equivalent method) is 0.081 miles and extends offsite. The facility is located in an industrial park. Within the circle with a radius of 0.081 miles there are no residences, but there are other public receptors such as employees in the surrounding facilities. The maximum population within the circle is 120.  Please note that an explosion of an unconfined methane vapor cloud has never happened, and it is not considered a credible incident.\r\n\r\nAlternate Release Scenario\r\n\r\nUsing LNG industry experience and the EPS's 40 CRF 68 and OCA Guidance, an alternate release scenario would involve a leak in the system, resulting in a liquid pool in the spill containment sump as described in the worst-case release scenario.  The liquid evaporates to form a vapor cloud which ignites and produces a vapor cloud fire.  It is conservatively assumed that the liquid in the pool is enough to cover the containment surface and the depth of the pool is more than 1 cm.  The liquid amount"

      "SummaryText": "in a pool of 450 square feet by 1 cm deep is about 390 lbs. Manual emergency shutdown is expected to limit the quantity of leakage. A smaller leakage leads to a smaller vapor cloud which disperses faster to below the Lower Flammable Level (LFL).  The evaporating / release rate is calculated by using the containment area of 450 square feet and a wind speed of 3.0 meter /second). The result is 159.13 lbs. / minute. The duration of the release is not considered for estimating the vapor fire cloud distances. The OCA Guidance and the distance to the endpoint of LFL is estimated as 0.06 miles. The public population is still the same as the worst case scenario.\r\n\r\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention\r\nNCI complies with the EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) Level 3.  It also complies with all state and local code requirements.  Specific elements of the PSM and CAPP programs are reference in procedures EHS P-024-01 Process Safety Management (PSM) Program and EHS P-025-01 Chemical Accident Prevention Program (CAPP).\r\n\r\nThe Five-Year (5) Accident History\r\nNCI has never had an incident involving LNG or LPG or the vapors from either that caused death, injury, property damage, environmental damage, evacuation, or sheltering in place.\r\n\r\nThe Emergency Action Plan and Emergency Response Programs\r\nNCI complies with the CAPP NAC 459.9544.2 (a, b, and c); IFC 2009 in accordance with North Las Vegas Fire Codes, and 29 CFR 1910 .119 Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals regulations.  Local responders would be the North Las Vegas Fire Department. NCI has developed these procedures to comply with the requirements: EP-F-001-01 - Emergency Action Plan, EP-F-002-01 - Emergency Response Plan, and EHS P-020-01 Fire Prevention Plan."
