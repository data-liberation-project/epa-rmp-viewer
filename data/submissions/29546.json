Calpine Corporation, is committed to proactively protecting human health and the environment.  Calpine aims to operate their businesses in a manner that consciously safeguards our employees, customers and communities in which we do business.  In striving for responsible environmental, health and safety stewardship, Calpine pledges to:\n\nA) Diligently develop, construct and operate our facilities in an environmentally responsible manner that promotes pollution prevention and places the highest priority on health and safety. \nB) Operate facilities that meet all applicable federal, state and local environmental, health and safety rules, regulations, ordinances and statutes as well as recognized industry guidelines and standards. \nC) Continually measure, evaluate and improve our environmental, health and safety performance. \nD) Promote environmental, health and safety awareness that fosters a caring, ownership-driven culture among employees, contractors and vendors. \n\nThe Columbia Energy Center (Columbia) is one of Calpine's new combined-cycle cogeneration facilities.  The facility will provide competitively priced electricity into the region's growing wholesale power market and will supply thermal energy to Voridian.  Columbia will store 28% aqueous ammonia (ammonia) onsite in two 20,000-gallon above ground storage tanks.  Ammonia is injected into Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) processes to minimize nitrous oxide (NOx) emissions from the two combustion turbine stacks. \n\nIn accordance with the RMP Rule, Columbia must estimate offsite impacts of both worst-case and alternate release scenarios.  Ammonia release rates were estimated based on methodologies presented in EPA guidance documents and adjusted to allow for passive mitigation due"

The endpoint distances presented represent the distance a vapor cloud of ammonia can travel from a release before dissipating to a concentration at which serious injuries from short-term exposure will no longer occur.\n\nAs defined by the rule, a worst-case scenario for a toxic substance is the release of the maximum quantity of the substance from the failure of a single vessel or process line that results in the greatest distance to the toxic endpoint.  Columbia?s worst-case scenario is based on a catastrophic event in which the maximum quantity of one 20,000-gallon tank is released into containment.  This event is considered highly unlikely.  In the event of a leak, the containment will minimize the volatilization of ammonia by limiting the exposed surface area resulting in a worst-case toxic endpoint is 0.5 miles.  \n\nIn addition to a worst-case scenario, the RMP Rule requires an alternate scenario be evaluated.  The alternate release scenario reflects a release during the filling of one ammonia tank from a 5,000-gallon ammonia delivery truck.  The scenario assumes a release from the delivery truck?s transfer hose at the fill point located within the tank?s containment.  In the event of a leak, the containment will contain the ammonia solution and minimize the volatilization of ammonia by limiting the exposed surface area resulting in an alternative toxic endpoint is 0.1 miles.  \n\nAssumptions discussed in this summary are subject to change based on any design modification made during construction.  However, endpoint distances are not expected to change drastically.  Endpoints represented in this summary indicate releases beyond Columbia?s leased property boundary.  However, releases are not expected to extend beyond Voridian?s property boundary.  In addition, the alternate scenario would not reach Voridian?s Administration Building.

Passive mitigation has been established by Columbia to minimize the potential accidental ammonia releases and to minimize offsite impacts in the event of an accidental release.  The mitigation includes a containment dike which encloses the aqueous ammonia storage tanks.\n\nEmergency Response Procedures have been developed for both the Calpine facility and Voridian.
