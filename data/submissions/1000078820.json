The Carson Plant supplies Phillips'66 Wilmington Plant with these intermediate streams and they are subsequently used to produce gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, and other petroleum products. Other co-products of the refining processing such as coke and sulfur are sold directly from the Carson Plant.\r\nThe refinery produces and/or uses regulated flammables, including propane, butane, hydrogen, and mixtures of\r\nregulated flammable substances.

LAR has a written employee participation\r\npolicy that outlines the many ways in which employees are involved in the accident prevention\r\nprogram, and employees have access to all information generated within the program.\r\nAll Process Hazard Analysis (PHA)teams include an experienced unit operator and unit engineer.\r\nEmployees are also members of teams formed for compliance audits,incident investigations,\r\nreviewing MOCs and pre-startup safety reviews. The plant emergency response team is comprised\r\nof qualified employees who receive specialized training and participate in emergency drills.\r\nEmployees are expected to report incidents and near miss situations that may occur, as well as any\r\nsafety concerns, safety hazards and suggestions they may have.\r\nEmployee assistance is enlisted to develop training programs,operating procedures and compile\r\nother critical process safety information. Additionally, LAR has various safety programs designed to\r\nincrease plant safety by encouraging employee involvement.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\nLAR maintains key technical documents that contain information essential to safe operation of the\r\nvarious processes.

Facility siting studies have also been revalidated with an emphasis on ensuring\r\nthe safety of non-essential personnel during non-routine operations such as start-ups and\r\nshutdowns. Also seismic reviews of the facility have been conducted to ensure safety during a\r\nseismic event to meet the Local Emergency Planning Committee Seismic Guidance approved in\r\n2014.\r\n\r\nSafety is a core value at Phillips 66 and LAR. The LAR safety program includes various elements\r\naimed at continuous improvement, including annual computer-based safety training for all\r\nemployees, annual refresher training classes, safety meetings conducted at least monthly,\r\nemployee required safety observations, and safety bulletins to alert personnel when a safety\r\nconcern is noted. Continuous improvement is also an operational goal. Recommendations from\r\nprocess hazard analyses, audits, incident investigations and employee input provide opportunities to\r\nenhance the safety of the refinery.\r\n\r\nLAR has submitted an extensive application to CalOSHA to approve the plant as a Voluntary\r\nParticipation Program (VPP) site and is in the second year of implementing Refinery Safety\r\nregulations issued October 2017 for California refineries."

Refresher training is provided at least every three years to\r\nmaintain a clear understanding of current operations and any process modifications that may have\r\noccurred. Employee comprehension of training is verified, and documentation is maintained. Additionally, operating employees receive required safety training annually.\r\n\r\nContractors\r\nContractors are utilized at LAR to supplement employees when increased or specialized activities\r\nare conducted. Prior to final contractor selection, the contract employer's safety performance and\r\nprogram are evaluated. LAR provides contractors with a process overview, safety/hazard and safe\r\nwork practice i"

In addition, the refinery monitors contractor performance and\r\ncompiles a contract employee injury and illness log to ensure that a good safety record is maintained.\r\n\r\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSR)\r\nLAR conducts PSSRs for all new facilities or modifications to facilities that change existing process safety information. These PSSRs ensure that important aspects of a project, such as safety, procedures, personnel, and equipment, are prepared and reviewed before equipment is placed in service.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\nProcedures are maintained at LAR to ensure the integrity of process equipment including pressure\r\nvessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems/devices, emergency shutdown systems, controls, and pumps. Inspection and testing are key components of the mechanical integrity program, with elements and frequency following accepted industry good engineering practices and manufacturers' recommendations augmented by operating experience. All work is documented. Deficiencies that are identified are corrected prior to further use of the equipment or reviewed by a qualified team to determine actions to be taken to ensure safe operations. Quality assurance measures are in place to ensure that new equipment is suitable to the service for which it is intended and is properly installed.\r\nMaintenance materials and spare parts are also checked for compatibility with the process and equipment. Employees involved in maintaining process equipment integrity are trained on the process, its hazards, and safe work practices and procedures.\r\n\r\nSafe Work Practices\r\nAdherence to safe work practices is deemed imperative at LAR to help ensure that operations and\r\nmaintenance activities are performed safely. These safe work practices include:\r\n1) a permitting system to authorize and control any hot work (spark-producing) activities,\r\n2) a confined s"

Managed changes include those to process chemicals, technology, equipment, procedures and facilities. Special consideration is given to the technical basis for the change, as well as safety and health impacts, operating procedure modifications, time period for the change and authorization requirements. All changes are reviewed and approved by knowledgeable personnel from various disciplines to ensure that potential new hazards are managed and any controls in place are not adversely affected. Affected employees and other workers receive training on the change prior to its implementation. In addition, process safety information and operating procedures are revised to reflect any changes.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation\r\nShould an incident occur that results in or could reasonably have resulted in a release of regulated\r\nsubstances, LAR promptly begins a thorough investigation. A knowledgeable investigation team determines the cause and develops corrective action recommendations to prevent recurrence. Refinery Management tracks the resolution of corrective actions. Investigation findings are available for review by all affected personnel.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits\r\nAudits to ensure the proper functioning of the accident prevention program are conducted at LAR at least every three years. A cross functional audit team carefully reviews facility practices and documents findings for management's review and implementation. Resulting corrective actions are electronically tracked until completion. The two most recent audit reports are kept on file.\r\n\r\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\nThe pre"
