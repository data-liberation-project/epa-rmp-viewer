If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the Hampton Department and request that they respond to the emergency. This facility is a propane bulk plant that consists of six (6) eleven thousand gallon tanks, with pumping equipment. Our worst case scenario is the failure of one eleven thousand gallon tank when filled to the greatest amount allowed, resulting in a vapor cloud expolsion. According to the EPA look-up tables, the distance to the endpoint is 1 mile. There are private homes, businesses, and a school within the distance to the endpoint, with a total population of 595 people.This facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations. The propane system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with NFPA-58 and state law. We have never had an accient involving propane that caused death, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations or shelterings in place. In the event of an emergency involving our propane system, it is our poilicy to notify the Hampton Fire Department and request that they respnd to the emergency. We have discussed this policy with the fire department: members of the fire department have inspected our propane system. We have no plans of changes to improve safety."
