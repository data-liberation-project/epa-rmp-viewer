      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\nThe Olin Chlor Alkali Products Tracy, CA, Bleach facility is committed to the safety and well-being of its employees, neighboring community, and the environment.  Olin is an active member of the Chlorine Institute, an industry group that develops technology for the safe handling and management of chlorine.  Olin also participates in the Canadian Chemical Producers' Association Responsible Care&reg; initiative.  Responsible Care&reg; is the industry's effort to reach out and dialogue with the public regarding our environmental, health and safety programs and to receive input from the community on issues of concern.\r\n\r\nStationary Source\r\nThe site produces sodium hypochlorite (bleach) from chlorine and sodium hydroxide (caustic).  These chemicals provide important benefits in critical applications such as water purification and household disinfectants.  Olin's policy is to implement reasonable measures to prevent a release of a hazardous material from occurring, to provide early detection of a release in the unlikely event that one would occur, and to have in place a contingency plan to respond promptly yet safely to such a release.\r\n\r\nRegulated Substances Handled\r\nThis Risk Management Plan has been prepared to address the handling of chlorine at the Olin Tracy Bleach facility.\r\nLiquefied chlorine is received in 90-ton rail cars and used in the manufacture of bleach.  Customers use both chlorine and bleach to treat drinking water, wastewater, swimming pool water and industrial water to eliminate and/or prevent the growth of harmful organisms.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\r\nOlin has a comprehensive release prevention program, meeting the Federal RMP Prevention Program and OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) requirements.  We have physical safeguards in place to prevent a release of chlorine.  We also follow best industry practices for the design and construction of equipment,"

      "SummaryText": "piping and instrumentation.  Our process design includes expansion bottles and/or rupture disks and pressure switches to safeguard against hydrostatic overpressure of equipment and piping.\r\n\r\nFive Year Accident History\r\nThe 5-year accidental release history as described in Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5 Section 2750.9 of the California code must include all accidental releases from covered processes that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\r\n\r\nThe Tracy Bleach Plant has not had any releases in its 5-year history meeting that definition.  All releases are tracked through RC Alert on the Olin Chlor Alkali home page.  Investigations are managed online and any resulting corrective and preventative actions are tracked to closure using SAP.  \r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\nOlin has a comprehensive emergency response program that includes the installation of detection, alarm, shutdown, containment and scrubbing systems to halt and/or mitigate a release.  In the unlikely event that a release cannot be controlled completely with these systems, Olin has an Emergency Response Team trained and equipped to respond safely to a release in accordance with a written Emergency Response Plan.  Olin has worked closely with the Tracy Fire Department and Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) in developing its Emergency Response Plan.  \r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\nOlin has made significant changes to improve safety, including the expansion of both the coverage and functionality of the chlorine monitor system, the addition of video surveillance cameras, upgrades to the chlorine vent and disposal system and additional interlocks and automatic shutdown devices."
