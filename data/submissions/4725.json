Any hint of a problem is checked immediatly and steps taken as necessary to prevent release. Alarms are tested frequently. Loading/unloading and cylinder changing are monitored closely, and neither is done except by two or more persons.",

During this time we have been careful to operate in a safe and considerate manner for the safety of our employees and the general public. We have taken care continually to make needed changes as pointed out by state and/or federal agencies, employees, and our insurers. This has resulted in a safety record which we believe will compare favorably with anyone. We have never had an occurence with off-site effect.  It is our full intent to continue to maintain this record of safety.  In support of this intention, we are presently investigating changing our method of disinfection to ultra-violet. This will mean some major capital expenditures, as well as changes in the way we  protect our employees, but even less possibility of danger to the public. We will continue to make changes in operational procedures, rules, equipment and other means of keeping our people and the public as safe as possible."
