The policy includes working with the surrounding community and local emergency response agencies to promote a spirit of cooperation and teamwork and to orchestrate an effective contingency plan in the unlikely event of a process incident occurring at the West River Wastewater Treatment Plant.  It is the Gadsden Water Works and Sewer Board's policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws applicable to the West River Wastewater Treatment Plant. \n2.0 Description of Facility and the Regulated Substance Handled\nThe West River Wastewater Treatment Plant is a publicly owned and operated wastewater treatment facility. Chlorine is used primarily for the destruction of pathogenic microorganisms in the effluent and to provide chlorine for prechlorination and trim chlorination.  Other possible uses of chlorine are for odor control and to assist in settling biosolids in the clarification process.  The maximum quantity of chlorine stored at the facility is 8,000 pounds (four 1-ton containers).  The chlorination system consists of vacuum regulators, chlorinator, injectors, chlorine leak detector, alarm, associated piping, valves, and other miscellaneous equipment.  \n3.0 General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-specific Prevention Steps\nThe GWWSB has complied with the requirements of the RMP Rule, 40 CFR Part 68, for the West River Wastewater Treatment Plant.  A comprehensive review of all systems, as well as administrative, technical, and operating and maintenance procedures has been conducted, in addition to the other required program elements of the RMP Rule.  A detailed hazard review was conducted for"

The effectiveness of the facility's design, operating procedures, and training has resulted in an excellent safety record.\n5.0 Emergency Response Program\nThe GWWSB has implemented an Emergency Response Program for the West River Wastewater Treatment Plant, which coordinates response efforts with the Gadsden/Etowah County Emergency Management Agency (EMA), the Gadsden fire department's HAZMAT team, the police department, and the hospital.\n6.0 Planned Changes to Improve Safety\nThe GWWSB encourages its employees to suggest ideas for changes to improve safety. Overall safety issues are discussed during routine employee meeting.  Employees are encouraged and trained to recognize hazards and to present ideas to eliminate them or to minimize the potential consequences of those hazards."
