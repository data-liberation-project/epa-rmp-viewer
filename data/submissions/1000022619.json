Our commitment to customer satisfaction is driven by accomplishing our objectives which include regulatory and customer requirements, continuously improving and the ongoing development of all team members including suppliers and contractors.\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED:\n\nSSI-Sintered Specialties is the world's largest stainless steel powder metal components manufacturing facility. We specialize in high-temperature sintering of stainless steel, soft magnetic alloy, tool steel, sinter-hardening alloy, and custom powder metal parts. We are unique in the Powder Metal industry with our ability to offer four powder metal process technologies. We serve a diverse range of applications in diverse industries - Automotive, Industrial, Medical, and Ordnance.\n\nThe facility is located on a nominal 5 acre site, with paved shipping and receiving areas. The major structures and their designated functions are: \nReceiving Area w/ docks; \nFurnace Room;\nWarehouse; \nShipping Area w/ docks;\nMaintenance Room;\nOffice areas.\nBulk hydrogen storage tanks (2) and liquid nitrogen storage tank (1) located outdoors.\n\nHydrogen is utilized at SSI Technologies to manufacture metal components by high-temperature sintering. During sintering, compacted metal powders are bonded together by heating at a temperature close to the melting point of the major constituent. \n\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM:\n\nThe facility has implemented a Process Safety Management program for its hydrogen sintering process operation and maintenance. The PSM Program has been incorporated as both policy, and most importantly, procedure in everyday operations"

The bulk storage system is leased from Linde, LLC, who provides continuous monitoring of the system as well as periodic inspection and maintenance. \n\nAmong the many safety features present at the facility are: \nOSHA Process Safety Management Program, and EPA Prevention Program.\nContinuous monitoring of the hydrogen storage tank systems via telemetry by Linde, LLC.\nEmergency communication systems.\nTraining Programs, such as Chemical Safety, Safe-Work Practices, and others.\nPlant Safety Committee, trained, involved, and motivated.\nMonthly Safety Meetings.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\n\nThere have been no accidents or injuries related to the PSM / RMP-covered hydrogen process during the past five years, as this process is just now becoming operational.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\n\nThe Facility Emergency Action Plan and Fire Prevention Program has been developed in accordance with OSHA 1910.38. The plan addresses fire, explosion, spills or releases of toxics, severe weather, and other criteria. The plan details response actions by facility personnel for such emergencies, safety and emergency equipment, communication responsibilities, and coordination with off-site responders, as well as notification of federal and state agencies. The plan includes Emergency Response to Hydrogen Leaks, specifically addressing incidents involving hydrogen.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\n\nThe facility is continually working to improve safety in all areas, as well as within the hydrogen process. The facility encourages input from operation and maintenance personnel, as well as vendor and agency inspectors, and responds to address potential improvements. The facility places a high emphasis upon training of personnel in the areas of safety and environmental awareness, compliance, and response."
