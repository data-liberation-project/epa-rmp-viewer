This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n1.) To save lives.\n\n2.) To minimize and avoid injuries.\n\n3.) To protect the environment.\n\n4.) To minimize property damage.\n\nAmeriCold Logistics maintains a (safety) committee whose members are the\n\ndesignated emergency coordinators for the facility. The Plan provides the action organization and\n\nnotification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be\n\nimplemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility. This Plan is\n\nreviewed and updated at least once per year. This Plan will be reviewed and updated to ensure compliance\n\nwith the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate any facility changes.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe Americold  Rochelle-Caron Rd (Plant# 75197) facility chills and stores a variety of food products in their cold\n\nstorage warehouse. The refrigeration process, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia\n\nthrough various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure\n\nvapor, then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for cold storage rooms. Changes in\n\npressure are directly related to changes in temperature. For example, lowering the ammonia pressure lowers\n\nits temperature. Low pressure (cold) liquid ammonia provides refrigeration by removing ambient heat from a\n\nroom or product. Removal of ambient heat causes the liquid ammonia (contained within the system) to\n\nvaporize. Heat is later removed from the ammonia as it is condensed"
