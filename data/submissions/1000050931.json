Extensive efforts have been made to avoid situations that could provide the conditions which could lead to the release of any chemical used on-site. The efforts include (1) HAZOP or Zurich analysis of all new or modified systems, (2) Pre-startup safety reviews, and (3) Specific operating procedures for normal conditions as well emergency situations.\n\n\n\nIt is the policy of this site to train employees to respond to emergencies including fire and chemical spills. The site maintains an Emergency Response Team trained as per the applicable standards. This Team conducts drills periodically to maintain effectiveness and readiness if an accident should occur.\n\n\n\n\n\nFacility Description\n\nThe BASF Corporation Beaumont Site produces several brands of trade name herbicides. These include:\n\nBanvel(R), Clarity(R), Distinct(R) and Frontier(R), as well as a variety of other formulations, which are used in the farm sector to enhance growth, to eliminate weeds, and to improve the yield in general.

The site inspects and maintains equipment and piping as recommended by the codes applicable for that equipment and service. All BASF engineering standards are based on Recognized and Generally Accepted Engineering Practices. All changes to the process are thoroughly evaluated prior to implementation. This is our first and most effective prevention program against chemical leaks within the site. \n\n\n\nThe site also maintains remote sensors for chlorine at the railcar unload area that alarm in the control room to alert the staff if a release is detected. Remote sensors for flammability are provided in the unload areas and tank farms that alarm in the control room to alert the staff if a leak is detected. \n\n\n\nAdditionally, the operations employees regularly walk through the process areas to look for leaks of any chemicals.\n\n\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nThis facility has not had an accident within the last five years that met the definition of a RMP accident.\n\n\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThis facility has an emergency response plan that is coordinated with the local emergency planning commission. The site is a member of the Sabine Neches Area Chiefs Association, (which is a mutual aid group) and assists the Jefferson County Local Emergency Planning Commission. The site maintains a complete fire fighting facility manned by volunteer employees who receive extensive training. This training consists of offsite training as well as regularly scheduled on-site drills. There is a plant wide system of fire water piping with pumps and power. A system of foam generators is available wherever flammable solvents are stored and throughout the tank farm.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe policy of the BASF Corporation is to always seek ways to improve the safety of our facilities.
