Within this program, before any not-in-kind changes are implemented for the SCR system, the process change is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate safeguards are in place to manage these hazards.  This process was also used as part of the 2001 addition of the Units 1-4 SCR systems.\n\nThe AES Alamitos primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations. HAZOP analysis in recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques. A team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise conducts the analyses. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well accident prevention and mitigation measures. The team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.  The last review of the hazards analysis was performed as part of this RMP resubmittal in May 2004.\n\nThe PHA teams findings are forwarded to facility management for resolution. Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team. The ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention. All approved mitigation options are tracked until they are completed. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from original design safety features, AES Alamitos, as part of the five year resubmittal process,  reviews (and if necessary) updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.

These procedures generally include:\n\n\u00bf Unit start up (boiler and flue gas blower) and operation;\n\u00bf SCR system normal start-up, normal shut down and emergency shutdown;\n\u00bf SCR system on-line operational procedures;\n\u00bf Aqueous ammonia ordering and truck unloading procedure.\n\nOther AES Alamitos procedures potentially impact the operation of the SCR system and storage tanks, but are not directly related to SCR system or tank operations. These include general safety and fire protection policies, procedures and practices. The SCR system\u00bfs general operation and maintenance is governed by these policies and practices where they apply.\n\nThese operational procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are periodically reviewed to assure they are current and accurate.  The last major review of operational procedures occurred in October 2002, with an informal review as part of the RMP resubmittal process in May 2004.  The procedures are kept current and accurate by annotating/revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through an informal management of change process.  The facility maintains several master sets of operational and maintenance procedures \u00bf including a set in the relevant control room, and truck unloading procedures at each ammonia storage tank unloading area.\n\nTRAINING\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, AES Alamitos has implemented a training program for all employees involved in operating or maintaining the SCR systems.  As an integral part of the safety and hazardous materials training, training which includes the safe receiving, operation and maintenance of the SCR system and associated tanks is provided to all personnel who"

In general, new employees receive basic training in plant operations if they not already familiar with such operations and all new workers working with the SCR system or associated tanks are trained in the SCR system operating procedures as well as the specific hazards of ammonia.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with an experienced operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g. through tests, skills demonstration, etc.) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. \n\nThe specific individual training programs at AES Alamitos is supported by the facility\u00bfs Injury and Illness Prevention Program (IIPP) and written safety procedures manual, which emphasizes communication of safety hazards and requirements on a continuous basis, as well as general safety and safe work practices training.  As noted elsewhere in the RMP, hazardous materials emergency response training is also provided.

The flame arrester minimizes the potential for an open flame to be drawn into the main tank. The secondary containment tank is also vented to the atmosphere 12 feet above grade through a dryer canister in parallel with a conservation pressure vent. This arrangement prevents breathing in moisture while allowing a bypass path to prevent pressure build up in the secondary containment.\n\nA liquid leak detection system is provided for the underground storage tank with leak detector elements installed in the secondary containment compartment (two elements), supply pump columns (one element each), safety relief valve discharge (one element), and underground piping secondary containment (one element). The elements are wired to a local leak monitor and alarm panel which will also annunciate to control room operators via the plant distributed control system (DCS). Detection of liquid in the underground piping secondary containment will trip the supply pumps.\n\nGeneral\nThe SCR system for Units 5&6 were designed by Noell, Inc.

The RMP was prepared in compliance of both the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) and California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program requirements. This resubmittal includes an updated narrative description (in this Executive Summary) of the AES Alamitos aqueous ammonia accident prevention program, the additional data elements required by the April 2004 USEPA revised RMP regulations, and represents a thorough review of operating and maintenance procedures, and a review of the process hazard analyses previously conducted.  \n\nTwo physical changes to the system were made after the original 1999 submittal: 1) Prior to October 2001, the 7,500 gallon vertical day tank serving the demineralizer system was permanently placed out of service and completely isolated from the Units 5&6 SCR ammonia system (this change was reflected in the November 2002 RMP submittal), and 2) a small ammonia line now feeds a small amount of ammonia (on manual demand) to the boiler feed water system at Units 1&2 and 3&4 \u00bf replacing the use of 55-gallon drums of 29.4% aqueous ammonia.  As part of the 2004 RMP resubmittal effort, a Hazard and Operability (HazOp) Study was performed on the two system changes.  There were no previously unidentified consequences or prevention program activities/recommendations resulting from this HazOp. \n\nAs documented in the Offsite Consequence Analysis prepared for the 2001/2002 RMP revision, these modifications at the facility did not result in"

Therefore, in accordance with AES Alamitos\u00bf interpretation of USEPA regulations at Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 68, at 40 CFR 68.190(b)(4), an RMP update filing with the USEPA was not required in 2002 since the OCA impact distance did not change by more than a factor of two. The California Code of Regulations (CCR), Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5, Section 2745.10 also did not, under that interpretation, require a filing of an updated RMP under the CalARP Program if the OCA impact distance does not change by more than a factor of two unless the process modification is considered significant.\n\nHowever, in order to maintain a fully accurate and up to date facility RMP, in November 2002 AES Alamitos filed a final revised version of the RMP with the City of Long Beach Department of Health and Human Services (Long Beach CUPA). The final 2002 RMP was only filed with CUPA, and not with the USEPA, since an update was determined not to be required under federal regulations. \n\nFor this 2004 RMP resubmittal, AES Alamitos is preparing and resubmitting the RMP as a single integrated program document which includes all three SCR deNOx systems, and is intended to reset the 5-year resubmittal period to run until June 2009.  \n\nThe 2004 RMP resubmittal process included the following:\n1.  Both system modifications (noted above) were reviewed by an experienced multi-disciplinary team of AES Alamitos personnel (operations, environmental, engineering and maintenance), facilitated by a 2-person HazOp-experienced ESCI EnviroServices, Inc. team.

AES Alamitos has a strong commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention (such as SCR system awareness and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of the aqueous ammonia SCR systems).  Specific to the SCR system, aboveground storage tanks, and the underground storage tank, a multitude of release prevention design, procedural and operational elements and controls are in place and effective.  As an integral part of the external events analysis for the AES Alamitos Risk Management Program, the facility had conducted a series of Seismic Hazards Analyses that evaluated the stability and integrity of the SCR mechanical systems and related equipment relative to earthquake and related hazards. The recommendations made in these seismic hazards analyses were evaluated and implemented as appropriate.  As detailed in the Maintenance Section of the RMP, AES Alamitos has in place a multi-faceted inspection and maintenance program that includes daily visual inspections and annual maintenance overhauls.\nThe AES Alamitos policy is to implement reasonable and sustainable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, facility and ammonia vendor personnel (if applicable) will take immediate actions to stop a release, if such actions can be taken immediately and safely.

The AES Alamitos, LLC facility is located 690 North Studebaker Road at the southeastern edge of Long Beach at the Seal Beach border in the City of Long Beach, California. SCE retained the electrical transmission facilities to the north of the current AES Alamitos property (e.g., the switchyards, power distribution lines), as well as property south of Units 5&6.\n\nThe AES Alamitos power generating facility burns natural gas in boilers to produce steam. The steam is then used in turbine generators to produce electricity. Currently, the station actively operates six boiler/steam turbine generating units, designated Units 1 through 6. Units I and 2 are rated at 175 MW each, Units 3 and 4 are rated at 320 MW each, and Units 5 and 6 are rated at 480 MW each.\n\nAs part of any fossil fuel combustion process, a small amount of nitrogen oxides (NOx) are produced and exhausted to the atmosphere with the other flue gas constituents (mostly nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and water vapor). The amount of NOx that the station is allowed to emit is regulated by the South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD).  In 1991 \u00bf 1992, revised SCAQMD rules required a reduction in allowed NOx emissions and specifically the facility install a NOx emission reduction system on the two largest boilers - Units 5&6.  In 1993, a Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) NOx Control System was installed on Units 5 & 6.  In April 2001, AES Alamitos completed installation of two additional SCR systems within the existing boilers of Units 1, 2, 3, and 4.  The installation was part of a December 2000 agreement with SCAQMD.  \n\nThe SCR process at Alamitos involves injecting aqueous a"

The ammonia/flue gas mixture flows through a catalyst installed between the convective pass and the air preheater. In the presence of the catalyst, the ammonia and NOx react to form nitrogen and water vapor, which exits out the boiler stack. About 87% of the NOx is removed in this manner. The SCR system uses a 29.4% aqueous ammonia solution in the SCR system. The aqueous ammonia is stored in one 20,000-gallon double walled corrosion protected steel underground storage tank for Units 5&6, and three aboveground 20,000-gallon double-walled aboveground and separately-contained carbon steel aqueous ammonia storage tanks for Units 1, 2, 3, and 4.  Since AES Alamitos utilizes aqueous ammonia in amounts over the federal 10,000-pound RMP threshold, the facility and the SCR process are covered under the federal and state Risk Management Prevention program.\n\nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS \u00bf WORST CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\nSeveral potential release scenarios were evaluated as part of the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA).  The OCA was performed in accordance with USEPA and California CalARP OCA guidance.  The results of this OCA, which included worst case and alternative release scenarios, were considered in the implementation of the prevention program and in facility emergency planning.  The results of the facility's Process Hazard Review was used to determine the most likely (e.g. credible) alternative case release scenario based on operations and system design and maintenance.  The specific details and results of the RMP are maintained by the facility and have been reviewed with local emergency response and planning agencies (primarily the Long Beach CUPA).  The administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each scenario are summarized in this RMP submittal.

Aqueous ammonia is stored in three 20,000-gallon, double-walled, aboveground, and separately contained carbon steel ammonia storage tanks. The storage tanks are ASME-registered U-stamped pressure vessels designed for ammonia service. To minimize potential ammonia leakage, the tanks utilize a double-wall design. The inter-wall space is isolated from the main storage space and can be drained independent of the main storage area. The ammonia supply of the boiler SCR units is taken from these storage tanks.\n\nUnits 1 and 2 utilize one tank (located south of Unit 1) and Units 3 and 4 utilize two tanks (located south of Unit 3). The proposed tanks are horizontal, and have a nominal capacity of 20,000 U.S. gallons. The tanks are capable of withstanding pressures of 25 pounds per square inch gage (psig), which is designed for the worst-case ambient temperature condition of 125 degrees Fahrenheit. \n\nEach storage tank is placed within a concrete berm that is between 645.7-649.6 square feet in area.
