      "SummaryText": "The Sweetwater Mine and Mill is part of The Doe Run Company\u00c2\u00bfs Southeast Missouri Mining & Milling Organization (SEMO).  The regulated substance used at this facility is anhydrous (water-free) sulfur dioxide.  It is delivered to the mill via a tanker truck and stored as a liquid under pressure in a horizontal carbon steel tank.  The tank has a maximum capacity of 108,000 pounds SO2.  Tank volume is typically maintained at less than 75% capacity, 81,000 lb\n\nSulfur dioxide is used in the benefication of copper-bearing ore. Sulfur dioxide vapor is fed to the \u00c2\u00bfcopper circuit\u00c2\u00bf at a rate controlled to maintain an acceptable pH of process solutions. This aids the separation of copper bearing material from the other components of the solution. Sulfur dioxide is used because it is the most effective and cost-efficient reagent for this purpose.  \n\nCertain safety precautions must be observed when handling and storing sulfur dioxide to prevent human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as our co-workers, to reduce the hazard to nearby members of the surrounding communities, and to reduce the threat to the environment. It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal, state and local rules and regulations. \n\nAccess to the mill facilities is restricted to authorized company employees and authorized contractors, and visitors.\n\nThere have been no sulfur dioxide accidents or incidents with adverse on-site or off-site consequences.  \n\nThe Doe Run Company maintains a strong corporate commitment to employee safety. Safety is part of our culture. All Doe Run facilities consistently operate at safety performance levels better than the industry average. Our commitment to safety extends to safety in the communities in which we operate, and we have implemented education programs that help keep residents safe at home.\n\nEmployee training, both formal and informal, and facility maintenance activities are conducted routinely.\n\nThe facility has recently updated"
