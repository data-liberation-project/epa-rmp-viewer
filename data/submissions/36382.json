      "SummaryText": "Facility Description\nAl-Corn Clean Fuel operates as an ethanol fuel production plant located in Claremont, in Dodge County, Minnesota.  As a requirement of the Clean Air Act Amendments 112? Accidental Release of Hazardous Air Substances program, Al-Corn Clean Fuel completed a risk management plan (RMP) for any chemical stored on-site that will be above the reporting threshold of 10,000 pounds. \n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nAl-Corn Clean Fuel is committed to the protection of its employees, the greater community and the environment from hazardous substances used in the ethanol fuel production process, specifically pentane as a constituent of the natural gasoline used as the ethanol denaturant as well as the annhydrous ammonia. The ammonia is used for pH control directly in the process feed mixture to fermentation.  The denaturant is added to the ethanol to make the ethanol unfit for human consumption. It is the policy of Al-Corn Clean Fuel to comply with all applicable federal, state and local laws.  In the event of an emergency, it is the policy of Al-Corn Clean Fuel to notify the City of Claremont Fire Department and evacuate all employees from the facility.\n\nRegulated Substance Handled\nThe facility produces fuel grade ethanol from corn and a process by-product known as dry distillers' grain with solubles, which is used as a livestock feed. The fuel ethanol production process requires use of a denaturant (natural gasoline) which may contain approximately 40 percent pentane, an RMP regulated substance. The maximum amount of natural gasoline on-site is estimated to be 361,380 pounds. The natural gasoline is stored in a tank as a liquid and is introduced to the fuel ethanol in the final stage of production. This tank is located in the facility's tank farm area which includes a secondary containment dike.  Anhydrous ammonia is also stored on-site and used in the ethanol production process for pH control.  The maximum anhydrous ammonia "

      "SummaryText": "stored will be 100,800 pounds.  Al-Corn Clean Fuel has evaluated the worst-cast and alternative case scenarios as it relates to each of these reportable substances.  Emergency response programs for these scenarios have been prepared and implemented.  Al-Corn Clean Fuel has coordinated emergency response with the local authorities and conducts drills.  \n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\nThrough completion of this RMP, Al-Corn Clean Fuel has complied with the EPA requirements under 40 CFR Part 68 and OSHA Process Safety Management requirements.  Process safety information and operations/maintenance procedures are documented on-site. Periodic functions such as process hazard analysis, training, change management and incident investigation are conducted on a regular basis. Audits of the overall RMP will be conducted on a regular basis to assure compliance with EPA regulations.\n\nFive Year Accident History\nAl-Corn Clean Fuel has not had a natural gasoline or an anhydrous ammonia accident causing death, injuries, environmental or property damage, evacuations or in-place sheltering in the last five years at the fuel production facility.\nThe facility began operation in April of 1996."
