      "SummaryText": "The Praxair facility at Kingman, Arizona is an electronics gas plant that handles and/or stores the following substances that are regulated by the EPA's Risk Management Program rule, in excess of their threshold quantity:\n\n7 Silane; and\n7 Trichlorosilane.\n\nThe Kingman facility receives the substances listed above in bulk form, stores them in large tanks or tube trailers, and then transfills them into smaller containers (cylinders) for distribution to customers.  All of the products from the Kingman facility are distributed by truck.  Each of the substances above is listed as a regulated flammable substance in EPA's Risk Management Program rule, with a threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds.  The silane storage and transfilling process at the Kingman plant contains about 15,000 pounds of silane, and the trichlorosilane process contains up to 80,000 pounds.  Consequently, each process is subject to the RMP rule.\n\nUnder the RMP rule, Praxair is required to report one Worst Case Scenario that represents all regulated flammable substances at the Kingman facility.  The Worst Case Scenario is defined by the EPA as the release of the entire contents of the largest vessel in the process, with essentially none of the safety systems and devices that are in place to prevent such an occurrence functioning as designed.  The released gas is assumed to ignite, causing a vapor cloud explosion.  Given these conditions, we are then required to estimate the distance to an EPA-specified flammable endpoint, which is defined to be an overpressurization effect of 1 pound per square inch.  At the Kingman facility, the Worst Case Scenario involving a regulated flammable substance would be the failure of the silane tube trailer, which holds about 13,250 pounds of product.  Using the criteria listed above, the Worst Case Scenario would result in a maximum impact distance of about 0.19 miles to the EPA-specified endpoint.  To determine this distance, we used the EPA's \"Off-Site Consequence Analysi"

      "SummaryText": "s Guidance.\"\n\nWe are also required to report an Alternative Release Scenario, or planning scenario, that represents all of the flammable substances covered.  While an Alternative Release may never occur at a facility, it is generally accepted to be more likely, or more credible, than the Worst Case Scenario, and can be used by the facility and local response organizations to plan community emergency response activities.  The RMP rule assumes more typical atmospheric and weather conditions for an Alternative Release Scenario, and allows a facility to take credit for safety devices and other mitigation systems that are in place to minimize the likelihood and effects of a release.  When selecting an Alternative Release Scenario, EPA suggests a facility consider scenarios such as transfer hose releases, valve and flange leaks, pump seal leaks, and shipping container mishaps, among others.\n\nFor the flammable processes at the Kingman facility, a credible release would be a process piping failure resulting in a silane gas or trichlorosilane liquid release at grade.  An accidental release of this type may occur due to mechanical failure, corrosion, failure of a piping component (such as joint or a valve), impact by a vehicle, or other cause.  At the Kingman facility, a credible release of silane would result in the released gas spontaneously igniting resulting in a jet fire.  A release of trichlorosilane could result in a flash fire or vapor cloud explosion.  The distance to the EPA-specified endpoints for these scenarios would be less than 0.06 miles, or 317 feet.  Both of the covered processes at the Kingman facility are more than 900 feet from the nearest property line; therefore, the consequences of the alternative release scenarios does not have any offsite impact.  To determine these distances we used the EPA's \"RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.\"\n\nIn accordance with OSHA's Process Safety Management standard and EPA's Risk Management Program rule, the Kingman "

On a local level, this prevention program is built around process safety concepts such as:\n\n7 Documented process safety information to ensure the process design is understood and maintained throughout its life;\n7 Process hazard analysis to identify and control all of the hazards associated with handling flammable substances;\n7 Trained operators, using written operating procedures, to safely operate the process as intended; and\n7 Maintenance programs and procedures to ensure the on-going mechanical integrity of the process.\n\nThe prevention program is audited periodically, by our corporate assessment group, to ensure that the process safety concepts and practices are in place and working effectively.\n\nAs a result of our process safety and risk management practices, the Kingman facility has not had an accident involving any of the RMP regulated substances on-site in the last five years.  In the event of an emergency, the facility has an emergency action plan in place, which contains procedures for employees to follow, including notification of local response agencies.  All facility employees are trained in their role in the emergency action plan, and Praxair policy requires that emergency drills be conducted at least annually.\n\nPraxair is committed to the continuous improvement of its safety, health and environmental programs. The company operates under an umbrella of global corporate policies with specific program elements defined on a regional basis.
