If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared\r\nto work with the local fire company, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of\r\nthe release to people and the environment.\r\n2. Facility Information\r\n-The primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers. Anhydrous\r\nammonia is received, stored, and distributed.\r\n-The maximum quantity stored would be 84000 pounds in our 18000 gallon storage tank and 56000 pounds in our 12000 gallon tank.\r\n-Maximum quantity possible including all storage tanks, nurse tanks, and tankers would be 1,243,172 pounds.\r\n3. The Worst-case and Alternative Release scenario\r\na. The worst case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank over a 10\r\nminute period. The maximum quantity released would be 80000 pounds which represents the maximum\r\nstorage as limited by policy. The distance to endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 3.3 miles.\r\nb. The alternative release scenario based on the most likely potential accident is a release from a transfer\r\nhose. The distance to endpoint. (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .1miles.\r\n4. The accidental release prevention program\r\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of\r\nAnhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1 published by the American National Standards Intsitute, Inc., and the\r\nstandards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29CFR910.111, Storage and\r\nHandling of Anhydrous Ammonia.\r\n5. The Five year Accident History\r\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that\r\n-have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor\r\n-to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths,"
