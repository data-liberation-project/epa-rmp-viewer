Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards. The plant primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations. HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques. The analyses are conducted by a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\r\n\r\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to management for resolution. Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team. This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention. All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained for the life of the process.\r\n\r\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the Baton Rouge plant updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results at least once every 5 years for the life of the process.

This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and emphasizing safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nThe Baton Rouge plant is located at 1836 Shada Avenue, Baton Rouge, LA in East Baton Rouge parish. The plant produces synthetic rubber, and uses or produces relatively few regulated substances above the RMP threshold quantities: butadiene (flammable); and ammonia and acrylonitrile (toxic substances).\r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\r\n\r\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the Baton Rouge plant. Because processes at the plant that are regulated by the EPA RMP regulation are also subject to the OSHA PSM standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\n\r\nThe Baton Rouge plant encourages employee participation in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention. Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.

These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. Procedures are maintained current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process. Procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\n\r\nThe Baton Rouge plant has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process. New employees receive basic training both in safety issues and in plant operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is typically paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. Operators receive refresher training on the operating procedures at least once every 3 years to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. Training is documented for each operator, including, the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\r\n\r\nContractors\r\n\r\nThe Baton Rouge plant routinely employs contractors to work on or near process equipment.

Each contractor employee is provided with a process overview and information about safety and health hazards, emergency response plan requirements, and safe work practices prior to beginning work. Contractor safety programs and performance are evaluated during the selection of a contractor. Plant personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\r\n\r\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSR's)\r\n\r\nThe Baton Rouge plant conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information. The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service. This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready. The PSSR team uses checklists to verify and document all aspects of readiness. A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\n\r\nThe Baton Rouge plant has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition. The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures.

Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended, and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels). If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or Management will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\r\n\r\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance. The Baton Rouge plant incorporates quality assurance measures (e.g., purchasing specifications and inspection procedures) into equipment purchases and repairs. This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\r\n\r\nSafe Work Practices\r\n\r\nThe Baton Rouge plant has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety. Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous materials before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work), and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.

This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented. Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change. Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes. In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation\r\n\r\nThe Baton Rouge plant promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury. The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to plant management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings.  Incident investigation reports are retained on file as supplements to the hazard analysis records for the affected areas, and are reviewed during PHAs and PHA revalidations.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits\r\n\r\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the Baton Rouge plant periodically"
