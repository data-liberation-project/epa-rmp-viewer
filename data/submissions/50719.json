If an emergency were to occur, it is the facility's policy to notify the Star Volunteer Fire Department as well as the Montgomery County LEPC, as necessary.  Medical emergencies will require notification of the First Health Ambulance Company and Montgomery Memorial Hospital.  This facility does not maintain a trained fire brigade or hazardous material response team on-site to respond to the small initial stages of an emergency.\n\nThe Texon, L.P. - Star Terminal is a butane transloading facility (specifically, railcar to truck tanker).  This Risk Management Program (RMP) covers the butane transfer systems only, including the associated piping and eleven (11) 30,000 gallon storage tanks detached railcars.  \n\nThis facility's worst case scenario is the failure of one (1) of the transloading system's 30,000 gallon storage tanks when filled to the greatest amount allowed resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  The facility's alternate (feasible scenario affecting off-site receptors) release scenario is a BLEVE incident involving one (1) railcar resulting in a fireball.\n\nThe Texon, L.P. - Star Terminal complies with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) accident prevention rules (40 CFR Part 68 Subpart D), the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard (29 CFR Part 1910.119), the OSHA Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response (HAZWOPER) Standard (29 CFR Part 1910.120), and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.  This butane transfer system is designed, constructed and maintained in accordance with NFPA #58 and the manufacturer's (Texon, L.P.) instructions.  Railcars meet the U.S. Department of Transportation Federal Railroad Administration design "

The facility currently has no trained fire brigade or hazardous materials response team.  The facility emergency response plans are coordinated with the fire departments (alternate departments include Biscoe and Troy) and the Montgomery LEPC.  The Star Volunteer Fire Department is aware of the system and its available fire protection systems (site fire extinguishers, hydrants and emergency shut-off devices)."
