              "Description": "Anhydrous Ammonia Storage. The plan is to minimize those hazards to human health and to the environment that are associated with accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. Employees working at the bulk storage plant make routine observations prior to and during transfer operations of anhydrous ammonia from the storage vessels to nurse tanks. In so doing, they are able to detect problems before they arise. This routine inspection identifies any portion of the system which may be under stress or about to fail. Repairs can be made before they become problematic. Employees are annually trained to recognize the hazards associated with the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia. In addition to annual training for employees who have been on the job for a number of years, the company conducts training on new hires. This training includes classroom instruction, on-site training at the plant, and follow-up observation to determine the comprehension and understanding of the new hire. Finally, the company routinely invites local fire department personnel to visit the site. In the event that the local fire department requests assistance in training its personnel on anhydrous ammonia, the company cooperates fully in their endeavors.",
