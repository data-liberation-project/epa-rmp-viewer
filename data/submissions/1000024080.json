      "SummaryText": "MarkWest Energy Appalachia, L.L.C. - Langley Plant, is a natural gas liquids extraction facility located in a rural section of Floyd County near Maytown, Kentucky. At this location we can extract up to 150,000 gallons per day of natural gas liquids from raw natural gas that is piped to the plant. The liquid product primarily consists of liquid propane with lesser amounts of butane, isobutane,isopentane, hexane and smaller quantities of ethane and methane. This mixture of natural gas liquids is flammable and is considered to be hazardous by the US Environmental Protection Agency. The liquids are stored in seven pressurized horizontal bullet storage tanks with a total capacity of 210,000 gallons. Also in the process area are four smaller tanks with a total capacity of 27,000 gallons giving a total site capacity of 237,000 gallons. Because of the proximity of the storage tanks to each other, they are considered part of the same process. It is our policy to take proactive action to reduce the risk of exposure of these hazardous chemicals to company employees, the local community and the environment. We comply or are in the process of updating our compliance with all Federal and State regulations including OSHA Process Safety Management. These regulations require specific actions to identify potential hazards in the process, to train operators in procedures that will reduce potential releases of hazardous chemicals and appropriate measures to reduce the potential of uncontrolled process releases. Due to our efforts in these safety and prevention programs, there has been no accidental releases of hazardous chemicals in the last five years. In the event of an accidental release of hazardous chemicals, we are trained to respond by means of an Emergency Action Plan. The Emergency Action Plan includes step by step procedures for protecting plant personnel and the general public in the event of an uncontrolled release of hazardous chemicals and includes response and evacuation"

Members of the fire department are involved in the development of the Emergency Action Plan and ongoing discussions on the coordinated responsibility of both the company and the fire department in the event of an uncontrolled release of hazardous chemicals.\r\n\r\n1.\tAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nThe MarkWest Energy Appalachia (MarkWest) - Langley facility located in Maytown, Kentucky is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers such areas as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is the policy of MarkWest to implement appropriate controls to prevent the possible release of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, MarkWest is completely coordinated with the Floyd County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) which provides emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\r\n\r\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substance Handled\r\n\r\nThe primary function of the MarkWest facility encompasses natural gas liquid (Y-Grade) extraction.  Y-Grade is the one substance present at the facility that is regulated by Risk Management Plan (RMP) regulations.  This flammable substance is a mixture comprised of propane, normal butane, isobutane, and natural gasoline (pentanes and hexanes).\r\n\r\nThe facility Y-Grade is extracted from a natural gas gathering pipeline.  Once extracted, the Y-grade is stored in pressurized storage vessels prior to being transferred via truck/pipeline to a fractionation facility.\r\n\r\nProduct is stored in 7 - 30,000 gallon pressurized tanks along with an additional four tanks totalling 27,000 gallon capacity.  Product stored in the vessel is administratively contr"

Additionally, pressure relief devices provide added assurance that the vessels are not over-filled to pressures above 250 pounds per square inch (psi).  These controls are in place to prevent the potential for over-pressurization which could cause structural damage to the vessels and lead to a release.\r\n\r\nBased on the administrative controls described above, the maximum inventory present at the facility would be equal to 85% of the total 237,000-gallon capacity:  201,450 gallons (890,811 the equivalent of  pounds) of Y-Grade.  For the largest container this would be 85% x 30,000 = 25,500 gallons (112,761 pounds).\r\n\r\n3.\tThe Worst Case Release Scenario and Alternative Release Scenario\r\n\r\nThe parameters of the offsite consequence analysis for this MarkWest facility were based on the requirements set forth in the RMP rules outlined in 40 CFR 68.25 (e), Worst-case release scenario-flammables and 40 CFR 68.28, Alternative release scenario analysis.  The worst case and alternative case radii of effect were determined utilizing RMP*Comp software provided by the EPA. The worst case scenario is described as a pressurized vessel releasing the contents to atmosphere, all liquids vaporizing and then an explosion. This results in 25,500 gallons released.  The alternative case scenario is for a fill hose to rupture and a maximum of five minutes elapse prior to complete shutoff.  The average hose flow rate is approximately 200 gallons per minute so a five-minute release would be 1,000 gallon maximum release.  Calculations to show each constituent weight are given at the conclusion of this section\r\n\r\n4.\tThe General Accident Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nMarkWest has taken all the necessary steps to comply with accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68 of the RMP regulations.

These audits are carried out every three years as required by RMP regulations (40 CFR 68.58) and any corrections required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and timely manner.\r\n\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation\r\n\r\nMarkWest investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident, as well as any corrective actions needed to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a period of five years.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\n\r\nMarkWest believes that successful RMP, PSM and accident prevention programs require a team effort.

In addition, MarkWest employees have access to all information created as part of the facility\u00bfs implementation of the RMP program, in particular, information relating to and resulting from process hazard analyses. \r\n\r\nContractors\r\n\r\nPeriodically, MarkWest hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of the safety performance of the contractor is undertaken.  MarkWest has a strict policy of informing contractors of known potential hazards relating to the contractor's work and the associated processes.  Contractors are also informed of all procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\r\n\r\n5.\tFive Year Accident History\r\n\r\nMarkWest has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last five years.  Due to stringent release prevention policies, there have been no accidental releases during this period.\r\n\r\n6.\tEmergency Action Plan\r\n\r\nA written emergency action plan to deal with accidental releases of regulated substances is retained at the MarkWest facility.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including medical treatment, evacuations, and notification of local emergency response agencies and the public.\r\n\r\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within processes that would require a modified emergency response.\r\n\r\nMarkWest has fully coordinated this RMP and our emergency response plan with the Floyd County local emergency response committee (LEPC).\r\n\r\n7.\tPlanned Changes to Improve Safety  \r\n\r\nMarkWest will continue to monitor the implementation of the RMP program at the Langley facility to ensure that accidental release of Y-Grade does not occur.

The Risk Management Plan provided herein summarizes the active release prevention program that is currently in place at the facility.  This risk management program illustrates MarkWest's commitment to employee, public, and environmental safety.  In the unforeseeable event that a release does occur, MarkWest's emergency action plan combined with the assistance of the Floyd County LEPC provide assurance that such an event will be successfully and safely mitigated. \r\n\r\nDocumentation of Calculations for January 2012 Revision\r\n\r\nTanks Included in the Plan:\r\nThe tanks included in the RMP are 7 - 30,000 gallon y-grade storage tanks and an additional four y-grade storage tanks with a total capacity of 27,000.
