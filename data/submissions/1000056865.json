The Facility Policy:\n\n\n\nThe owners, management, and employees of Poole Chemical - Holcomb, KS are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, and other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n\n\n2. Facility Information:\n\nA) The activity at the facility is the storage of anhydrous ammonia.\n\nB) Anhydrous ammonia is used in the production of this product.\n\n\n\n3. The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario:\n\n\n\nA)    The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a truck trailer released as a gas over 10 minutes. The maximum quantity released would be 40,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 2.3 miles.\n\nB)    The alternative release scenario based on the five-year accident history (or the most likely potential incident) is a release from a break in a transfer hose. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .5 miles.\n\n\n\n4. The accidental release prevention program:\n\n\n\nThe facility has referred to the provisions of Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, Kk-611.1A, published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, A Storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.\n\n\n\n5. The Five-year Accident History:\n\nA)  The facility operates under PSM Standards\n\nB)   There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facili"

The Emergency Response Program:\n\n\n\nThe facility has:\n\nA)    A written Emergency Action Plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\nB)    Provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\nC)    A written emergency response program, in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.120, including emergency planning and employee training.\n\n\n\n6. Planned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\n\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions. There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time.\n\n"
