Our emergency action plans have been coordinated with both the fire\ndepartment and LEPC.\n\n   6. Planned changes to improve safety. \n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility. We have added u-locks to the service valves of our nurse tanks. The facility is well lit at night. Safety inspections on equipment are done on a regular basis. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions. There are no specific safety recommendations for implementation at this time."

If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Hillsboro Fire Department, Montgomery County Local Emergency Planning Committee or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n     2. The stationary source and the regulated substances handled.\n\nThe primary activity at the facility, is the storage of fertilizer for sale to farmers. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient. The storage and handling system consists of a 18,000 gallon storage tank, loading risers, associated plumbing and nurse tanks. Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors. The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia that can be stored would be 389,000 pounds; this includes the amount of anhydrous ammonia that could be stored in nurse tanks.\n\n   3. The accidental release prevention program.\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations. This facility has implemented the provisions of the Compressed Gas Association\u0092s (CGA\u0092s) \u0093American National Standard Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\u0094 (6th edition), commonly referred to as \u0093ANSI/CGA G-2.1 2014\u0094, as adopted by state regulation and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia. Compliance with these regulations and on-going training of our employees make up our accident release prevention program.\n \n  4. Five year accident history. \n\n There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous"
