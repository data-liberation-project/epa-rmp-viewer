Deer Valley WTP has prepared a Risk Management Plan (RMP) in accordance with the EPA and OSHA regulatory requirements.  A brief overview of the RMP and the associated policies at Dear Valley WTP are described below.  \n\n\n\nPrevention and Response Policies\n\nThe City takes an active role in preventing accidental releases by ensuring that its employees are properly trained in the save operation of covered processes and the safe handling of treatment chemicals.  The City has also established and maintains procedures for emergency notification and response.  These are reviewed with employees on a periodic basis and revised to accommodate changes in staffing when they occur.  To increase employee safety and awareness, the City:\n\n\n\nA? Maintains up-to-date safety information and operating procedures,\n\nA? Performs regular preventative maintenance,\n\nA? Provides periodic refresher training on safe handling of chemicals, and \n\nA? Conducts quarterly safety drills\n\n\n\nFacility Description and Regulated Substances\n\nDeer Valley WTP utilizes surface water supplies to produce potable water through a series of physical and chemical treatment operations.\n\n\n\nThe regulated substance handled at Deer Valley WTP is chlorine.  The chlorine is stored in 1-ton containers, with a maximum of 15 containers (30,000 lbs.) on site.\n\n\n\nPrevention Steps for Chlorine\n\nThe prevention program fulfills the requirements of the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) rule and the EPA RMP rule, and includes:\n\n\n\nA? Formal and on-the-job training,\n\nA? Written operating procedures, and \n\nA? A process equipment preventive maintenance program.\n\n\n\nThe primary means of mitigating an accidental chlorine release at Deer Valley WTP is the installation of a chemical scrubber for the chlorine building.  The scrubber is maintained on a regular basis to ensure proper operation if needed during a c"

      "SummaryText": "hlorine release.\n\n\n\nAccident History\n\nThere has been no accidental release of the covered chemical in the past five years.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThis facility has established and maintains and emergency response program that is coordinated with local response agencies.  The goals of the program are to protect on-site employees from the hazardous effects of the releases and to minimize the effects of releases on the general public.  The program is routinely reviewed and updated to reflect personnel and regulatory changes.\n\n\n\nPlanned changes for Improved Safety\n\nIdeas for changes to improve safety are actively sought from employees.  Employee meetings that focus on safety issues are held regularly at the facility.  Employees are encouraged and trained to recognize hazards and present ideas to eliminate them or to minimize the potential consequences of those hazards.\n\n\n\nDuring the resubmission of the RMP document, a process hazard analysis of the chlorine system was conducted with key employees to fulfill the prevention program requirements.  During these sessions, recommendations were made for the purpose of improving safety and preventing accidental chemical releases.  Each recommendation will be or has been considered for implementation.  Though not all recommendations may be implemented, the exercise provided all affected employees with a heightened awareness of safety issues related to the covered processes."
