(R&M) Toledo, Ohio  Refinery, hereafter referred to as the Toledo Refinery, has a long-standing commitment to worker, contractor, and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Toledo Refinery operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products (e.g. gasoline, fuel oil, propane, butane) from raw crude oil.  The Toledo Refinery has several regulated flammables, such as propane, butane, etc.  The Toledo Refinery does not have any of the listed regulated toxic chemicals above the threshold quantity for reporting.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accidental release prevention program in place at the Toledo Refinery.  Because processes at the Toledo Refinery that are regulated by the EPA RMP regulation are also subject to the OSHA PSM standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\nEMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION\n\nThe Toledo Refinery encourages employees to participate in all elements of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation include employees serving as members on Process Hazards Analysis teams as well as incident investigation teams.  Employees also serve as trainers and procedure writers in addition to serving as safety auditors.  Employees also form the Emergency Response Fire Brigade and Hazardous Materials Teams for the To"

Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the Toledo Refinery and addresses each accident prevention program element.\n\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION\n\nThe  Toledo Refinery keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Specific departments within the Toledo Refinery are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.  A Process Safety Information directory summarizing the reference documents and their location is available in each control room within the Toledo Refinery.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations are provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).  This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For specific process areas, the Toledo Refinery has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e,g,, temperature , level, pressure) via the Process Hazards Analysis process.  The Toledo Refinery ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems)\n\nThe Toledo Refinery also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel pro"

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe Toledo Refinery primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a multi-disciplined team with experience backgrounds across the organization.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the Toledo Refinery periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The results and"

Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\nOPERATING PROCEDURES\n\nThe Toledo Refinery maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The procedures are maintained current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.  These written operating procedures are readily available to operators in the process units and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\nCONTRACTORS\n\nThe Toledo Refinery uses contractors to supplement its work force during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the Toledo Refinery has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform refinery personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.  In addition, the Toledo Refinery evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.  Refine"

If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or  key personnel will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\n\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is positive material identification (PMI).  The Toledo Refinery incorporates PMI measures into equipment purchases and repairs.  This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\nTRAINING\n\nTo complement the operating procedures, the Toledo Refinery has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees are required to complete a 36 month Apprenticeship Training Program.  This program has been certified by the United States Department of Labor and the State of Ohio Bureau of Apprenticeship and Training.  This program includes (1) formal in-unit training, (2) classroom training, (3) on the job training, (4) self study training, and (5) testing.\n\nDuring the three year apprenticeship, each apprentice must successfully complete all\nfacets of the program which include: (1) basic industry training, (2) off the job related studies, (3) training, (4) testing (written & skill demonstration), (5) qualifying on a set number of jobs at the assigned unit, and (6) obtain a State of Ohio Stationary Engineers License.  Each apprentice must record their work hours on different types of refinery equipment, attend all required safety training, and meet minimum requirements in supervisory evaluations every six months to remain employed.  After successfully completing the apprenticeship program, the employee will have adequate knowledge to perform the duties of the assigned jobs at the assigned process unit within the Toledo Refinery.\n\nIn addition, all operators are recertified every three years."
