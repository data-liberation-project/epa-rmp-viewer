Our employees are also trained in fire extinguisher use to handle small emergencies.\n\n\n\nA description of your facility and the regulated substances handled.  This facility is a paint production plant storing flammable solvents and propane/isobutene for aerosol filling in a single 12,000-gallon bulk tank.\n\n\n\nThe worst-case and alternative release scenarios.  Our worst-case scenario is failure of the 12,000-gallon propellant storage tank when filled to the greatest amount allowed (88% at 50 deg. F), resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  The resulting distance to the endpoint extends offsite, and public receptors are within the distance to the endpoint.  Our alternative release scenario is a break in a 2.0-inch diameter fill pipe, leading to an immediate release and explosion.  The resulting distance to the endpoint does not extend offsite, and no public receptors are within the distance to the endpoint.\n\n\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps.  This facility complies with EPA?s accident prevention rule, the OSHA PSM standard, and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.  The propane/isobutene system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with NFPA-58 and state law. \n\n\n\nFive-year accident history.  We have never had an accident involving propane/isobutene that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or shelterings in place.\n\n\n\nThe emergency response program.  In the event of an emergency involving our propane/isobutene system, it is our policy to notify the Hudson Fire Department and request that"
