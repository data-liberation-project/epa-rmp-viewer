      "SummaryText": "1.  The Facility Policy.  The owners, management, and employees of Bader Agricultural Service, Inc. are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia by utilization of proper equipment , regular inspections and maintenance and training of all persons that work with the anhydrous ammonia.  Should an accidental release occur, the facility has oriented the local fire department and the local local emergency planning committee so that they can plan for a response to any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.  Facility Information.  The primary activity of the facility is the storage and blending of agricultural fertilizer for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is one of these fertilizers.  Anhydrous ammonia is recieved, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.  The maximum quantity stored would be 85,680 pounds in the facilities tank.  The capacity of this storage tank is 18,000 gallons.\n\n3.  The worst-case releasew scenario would be the release of the total contents of the storage tank released over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 85,680 pounds which represents the volume of the storage tank.  The distance to the endpoint of dispersion based on the model used is .96 miles.  \n      The alternative-case release scenario is assumed to be a release from the rupture of a 1 inch transfer hose, with 2,901 pounds released over 2 minutes.  The distance to endpoint of dispersion is .31 miles.\n\n4.  The accidental release program.  The facility complies with the rules and regulations relating to the handling of anhydrous ammonia and low pressure nitrogen solutions, equipment , containers, and storage facilities.  These regulations administered by the Illinois Department of Agriculture are consistent with ANSI K61.1 and OSHA 29 CFR 1910.11 regarding storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.\n\n5.  The five year accident history.  THere have been no accide"

      "SummaryText": "ntal releases of anhydrous ammonia for the covered process in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site; nor to our knowledge, have any accidental releases resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6.  The emergency response program.  The facility has a written emergency response action plan in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38 and provide state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III of EPCRA.  Our emergency response action plan has been reviewed with the local fire department and provided to the local emergency planning committee for coordination in the community response planning.  \n\n7.  Planned changes to improve safety:  Safety improvements are an on-going process at our facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe practices and operations.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
