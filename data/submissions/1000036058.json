The state risk management regulations, also referred to as the California Accidental Release Prevention Program (CalARP), are codified in California Code of Regulations (CCR), Title 19, Section 2745, et. seq. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) also regulates facilities with certain toxic and flammable substances. The federal regulations are codified in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Title 40, Section 68. Finally, both the California Occupational Safety and Health Administration (CalOSHA) and the Federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulate facilities with certain acutely hazardous materials under the PSM standards as defined in CCR, Title 8, Section 5189 and CFR Title 29, Part 1910, Section 119, respectively.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nTRWQCF prepared the RMP/PSM Program to satisfy regulatory requirements and to demonstrate a commitment to evaluate and improve chlorine handling systems and practices at the facility. In the unlikely event that a chemical release does occur at the facility, TRWQCF has written an Emergency Response Program and personnel are trained in the appropriate response measures, relying on emergency services provided by the local fire department and the"

      "SummaryText": " Stanislaus County Hazardous Materials Response team. TRWQCF will continue to improve chlorine-handling safety through the implementation of the prevention program elements of the RMP/PSM Program.\n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nTRWQCF's wastewater plant is located at 901 South Walnut Road, Turlock, California. The area is zoned for industrial use. This facility processes wastewater for Turlock and surrounding communities, processing approximately 13.4 million gallons of wastewater per day.  The NAICS Code for the facility is 221320 (Sewage Treatment Facilities).\n\n\n\nChlorine (CAS 7782-50-5) is the regulated substance used in the facility's wastewater treatment system. The chlorine system, which is an open system, contains approximately 36,000 pounds of chlorine in ton-containers. The system takes liquid chlorine from ton-containers, changes the liquid to a gas in evaporators, and then provides gaseous chlorine to water injectors which mix the gas with water to form a disinfecting agent. The disinfecting agent is piped to various points at the wastewater treatment facility.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nTRWQCF has developed a management system, an emergency response plan, and fourteen prevention programs to meet RMP/PSM requirements. The prevention programs cover Process Safety information, a Process Hazard Analysis, Standard Operating Procedures, a Training program, a Mechanical Integrity Program, Management of Change and Pre-Startup Safety Review programs, Compliance Audit and Incident Investigation programs, an Employee Participation program a Hot Work Permit program and a Contractor Safety Program.\n\n\n\nThe RMP/PSM regulations require a review of the accidental release prevention program and chemical specific prevention steps used by the facility. TRWQCF has incorporated many safety features in the chlorine system to prevent system failures and to mitigate potential releases. The pred"

      "SummaryText": "ominant safety concern with chlorine systems is an inadvertent buildup of pressure exceeding pressure ratings or capacities of equipment due to chlorine expansion. The TRWQCF chlorine system is continuously monitored by automated control systems that shut down ton-cylinder valves if deviations from normal operating conditions occur. Liquid chlorine piping is protected by expansion tanks wherever the possibility of trapping liquid chlorine exists. Further, the system is equipped with pressure relief valves on all liquid piping and most, if not all, additional locations within the chlorine system where chlorine could become trapped. Pressure relief valves vent to a chlorine scrubber system for chlorine removal.\n\n\n\nOther safety features at the facility include: \n\n* Storage room emergency ventilation system\n\n* Chlorine leak detection in storage room and control areas\n\n* Remote emergency shutdown switch\n\n* Fire sprinklers throughout the chlorine facility\n\n* Component specific safety shutdowns\n\n\n\nIn addition to the physical features of the chlorine system at the facility, TRWQCF has extensive administrative controls in place to maintain safe operation of the system. Administrative controls include, but are not limited to, formal training programs for system operators, emergency training, a hot work permit program, a lockout/tagout program, a contractor safety program, incident investigation program, mechanical integrity program, management of change program, pre start-up safety review program and an RMP/PSM auditing and inspection program. Written standard operating procedures (SOPs) have been prepared for the chlorine system at the facility. The SOPs provide a basis for site specific operator training and a ready reference for operating and trouble-shooting the systems.\n\n\n\nTRWQCF is committed to maintaining the mechanical integrity of the chlorine system. A preventive maintenance system is utilized to manage the maintenance of the system. Preventive maintenance at the fa"

The system is used to track equipment performance and to create reports that are used by maintenance personnel to monitor the frequency of repairs and deviations from normal operating parameters.\n\n\n\nThe RMP/PSM regulations require facilities to identify and evaluate chemical release scenarios resulting from potential failures of the chemical handling systems covered by the RMP/PSM. Program 3 requirements of the RMP/PSM apply to the TRWQCF facility due to the quantity of chlorine used. Program 3 facilities are required to evaluate a worst-case release scenario (release parameters are defined by the regulations) and an alternative release scenario. The regulations define a worst-case release scenario as \"...the greatest amount held in a single vessel...released as a gas over 10 minutes.\" An alternative release scenario is identified as a release that is more likely to occur at the facility.\n\n\n\nThis facility has prepared worst-case and alternative release scenarios. These are not summarized herein as recommended by EPA, but are presented in the RMP/PSM.\n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nThe RMP/PSM regulations require a review of the 5-year accident history at the regulated facility. TRWQCF has had no reportable accidental release of chlorine during the past 5 years.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nTRWQCF has developed a written Emergency Response Program (Emergency Action Plan) in the unlikely event that a chlorine release occurs at the facility. TRWQCF is a non-responding facility and will rely on outside responders, mainly Turlock Fire Department and Stanislaus County HazMat Team, for control and mitigation of chlorine releases. Outside responders will be responsible for Incident Command, notification of other public agencies and the need for shelter-in-place or evacuation notices.

TRWQCF management has responded to all suggested mitigation measures promptly and has established completion schedules for proposed actions. Management responses and support will be consistent with TRWQCF's commitment to safe and environmentally responsible operations. Changes suggested during the PHA included:\n\n* Annual review of SOPs to better reflect current system configuration\n\n* Annual review of Prevention Program elements.\n\n\n\nTRWQCF recognizes that the RMP/PSM is a continuous process for evaluating, monitoring, and improving chlorine handling operations at its facility. As such, this document and related attachments and program elements will evolve as TRWQCF continues their ongoing focus and dedication of risk minimization and safety improvement for their employees and surrounding community. TRWQCF will submit revised information if a change occurs that is considered significant and requires resubmission under the regulations. However, minor improvements/modifications to the RMP/PSM, related attachments, and program elements will be incorporated consistent with TRWQCF's internal review practices, and TRWQCF will maintain the most current versions on site. Thus, the most current version RMP/PSM and related documents and elements maintained on site may vary slightly from the information in submittals made to EPA and other regulatory agencies.\n\n\n\n"
