The Facility Policy\n\n\n\nThe owners, management and employees of Glacial Plains Cooperative are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.   If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.  \n\n\n\n2.  Facility Information\n\n\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application to the soil as a crop production nutrient.\n\nThe maximum quantity of ammonia stored would be 100,000 pounds in our storage tanks and several nurse tanks which are not used as storage.  \n\n\n\n3.  This facility has developed worst-case and alternative-case scenario, but it has been withheld from this executive summary as security sensitive information as requested by EPA.\n\n\n\n4.  The accidental release prevention program.\n\n\n\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the Standards of the U. S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of anhydrous ammonia\".  In addition, Minnesota Department of Ag Rules.\n\n\n\n5.  The Five-year Accident History.\n\n\n\na.  There has been one accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that caused environmental damage in the form of damage to vegetation in the area of the release.  The release was caused by equipment failure as the result of a vehicle accident.\n\n\n\n6.  The emergency Response Program.\n\n\n\nThe facility has:\n\na.  A written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\nb.  Provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-"
