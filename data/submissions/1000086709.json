Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\nWe at the VERDINE STREET WATER TREATMENT FACILITY are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety. This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the. process at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, we are completely coordinated with the CITY OF SULPHUR FIRE DEPARTMENT which provides highly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\r\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\r\nOur facilities primary activities encompass TREATMENT OF WELL WATER FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION. We have I regulated substance present at our facility. This substance is Chlorine. The regulated substance at our facility is used for treatment of well water for human consumption.\r\nThe maximum inventory of Chlorine at our facility is 4000.00 lb.\r\n3. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA. This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with good engineering practices Our facility is also subject to EPCRA Section 302 notification requirements. Some sections below briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\r\n4. Release Scenarios\r\nWorst-Case Release Scenario Analysis\r\n\r\nHaving determined that the chlorine is the only regulated substance, a worst-case analysis for the chlorine was conducted. The city of sulfur uses chlorine for a disinfectant in the public water supply. The chlorine"

When the cylinder being used becomes empty, valves are used to disconnect the empty cylinder and to connect the full cylinder to the process.  As required, it was assumed the entire 2000 pounds of chlorine was released into the air at one time.  It was assumed that no administrative controls or passive mitigation were used to limit the quantity that could be released. Using EPA\u00bfs requirements and RMPComp32, it was determined that the distance to the endpoint is 1.3 miles.\r\n\r\nAlternative Release Scenario Analysis\r\n\r\nIn addition to the worst-case analysis and alternative release analysis were performed using chlorine as the regulated substance. The alternative release scenario assumed that the chlorine cylinder was punctured resulting in a 0.75 square inch hole. The tank pressure was assumed to be 90 psi, the tank temperature was assumed to be 80\u00b0 F, the topography was chosen to be urban, and the release duration was 10 minutes. It was assumed that no administrative controls or passive mitigation were used.  This resulted in a total of 1660 pounds of chlorine being released. Using RMPComp32, the distance to toxic endpoint was calculated to be 0.2 miles.\r\n\r\n5. Process Safety Information\r\n\r\nThe VERDINE STREET WATER TREATMENT FACILITY maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis\r\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently. The methodology used to carry out these analyses is the inspection and testing of all equipment related to chemical injection. The studies are undertaken by qualified personnel.

These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring. All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\r\nEmployee Participation\r\nThe VERDINE STREET WATER TREATMENT FACILITY operates under the principle that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort. Employees are encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend-improvements. In addition, our employees have access to all information resulting from process hazard analyses in particular.\r\nContractors\r\nOn occasion, our facility hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.
