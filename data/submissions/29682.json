              "Description": "Airgas Specialty Gases is an industrial gas distribution facility.  This facility best fits with NAICS Code 42269.  Our safety information was last reviewed on September 21, 2002.  We are subject to the handling codes of the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA), State Fire Codes, Texas Railroad Commission Regulations, American National Standards Institute, and applicable OSHA Regulations.  These standards have been implemented through written manuals and/or procedures.  The most recent hazard review was conducted for this facility on September 21, 2002.  To prevent/limit releases, this facility uses vents, relief valves, check valves, manual shutoffs, automatic shutoffs, grounding equipment and an excess flow valve.  Operating and training procedures were also last reviewed on September 21, 2002.  The employees at Airgas Specialty Gases are trained on-the-job with demonstration and observation competency testing.  Maintenance procedures were last reviewed on April 28, 1999.  Airgas Specialty Gases utilizes outside contractors to conduct any required manual maintenance on theie processes.  The contractors knowledge of these systems, as well as the safeguards they utilize during maintenance help in the overall prevention of releases for the ethylene system.  This is a repackaging system, so the standard operating procedures and maintenance chacks on the system are the main focus of the prevention program. \n\nThere has been a release of hazardous materials from this location in the past 5 years.  This release involved two products (ethane, and methane).  This release was due to an equipment failure.   Airgas has not repackaged either of these two products since.  They expect to repackage these two products in the future, yet below levels for RMP and PSM.  This release helped trigger an investigation into the safety aspects associated with the ethylene and mehtyl chloride systems.  The release (fire) occured on February 25, 1999, and there were no offsite impacts.\n\nEmployees who are trained in the proper operating procedures of the ethylene repackaging system are knowledgeabel in the Standard Operating procedures of the system, as well as the SOPs for the filling of compressed gas cylinders.  These procedures are followed to help in the prevention of releases of ethylene into the atmosphere.  Maintenance procedures are also conducted (though limited) for the ethylene system.  These maintenance procedures involve visual inspections prior to filling cylinders with the ethylene.  If any part of the system is in need of repair, the maintenance is conducted by an outside contractor (WesMor Cryogenic Services Inc.) who is knowledgeable with the ethylene system.  The contractor can utilize the O&M manual for information regarding valve types, piping, tubing, etc. to help maintain the mechanical integrity of the system.  This manual is located in the Plant Manager's office.\n\nAirgas Specialty Gases contracted Environemtnal Data Services, which triggered a review of the safety information. operating and maintenance procedures and training.  Airgas is a Level 3 Prevention Program, and is implementing Process Safety Management for their prevention program.",
