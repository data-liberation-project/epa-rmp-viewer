This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.  We also work closely with our public emergency responders providing them with training and equipment so that  they can respond safely and efficiently to emergencies that might occur at our facility.\n\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances \n\n\n\nThe Southwest Ozona Gas Processing Plant operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products (e.g., natural gas, propane, butane, condensate) from oil and gas wells.  The Southwest Ozona Gas Processing Plant handles methane, ethane, propane and butane which are regulated flammables.  The Southwest Ozona Gas Processing Plant does not use, process or store a reportable quantity of toxic regulated substances. \n\nHazard Assessment Results\n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nWithin the past five years the processes have had no accidental release that caused offsite impacts provided in the risk management program rule (40 CFR 68.10(b)(1)).\n\n \n\n General Accidental Release Prevention Program/Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Southwest Ozona Gas Processing Plant.

This information specifically addresses known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For specific process areas, the Southwest Ozona Gas Processing Plant has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition).  The Southwest Ozona Gas Processing Plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\n\n\nThe Southwest Ozona Gas Processing Plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)  \n\n\n\nThe Southwest Ozona Gas Processing Plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\n\n\nThe Southwest Ozona Gas Processing Plant primarily uses the Haz-Op and What-If  analysis techniques to perform these evaluations.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates haza"

Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\n\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the Southwest Ozona Gas Processing Plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration and the final resolution of the finds is documented and retained.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Operating Procedures\n\n\n\nThe Southwest Ozona Gas Processing Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators, and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.

New employees receive initial training in Southwest Ozona Gas Processing Plant operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., tests, skill demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\n\n\nContractors\n\n\n\nThe Southwest Ozona Gas Processing Plant uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the Southwest Ozona Gas Processing Plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform gas plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.

The Southwest Ozona Gas Processing Plant incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs.  This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and those proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.  Pre-startup safety reviews are also used to support the quality assurance program.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Safe Work Practices\n\n\n\nThe Southwest Ozona Gas Processing Plant has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.  Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment that is being worked on, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous materials before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work), and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.

Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by (1) equipment failures and (2) human errors.\n\n\n\nSpecialized Safety Features\n\n\n\nThe Southwest Ozona Gas Processing Plant has safety features on many units to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release.  The following types of safety features are used in the covered processes:\n\n\n\nRelease Containment/Control\n\n\n\n1. Process relief valves that discharge to a vent system to handle episodic releases\n\n\n\n2. Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated)\n\n\n\n3. Automated shutdown systems for specific process parameter (e.g., high level, high temperature)\n\n4.Curbing or diking to contain liquid releases\n\n\n\n5. Redundant equipment and instrumentation (e.g., uninterruptible power supply for process control system, backup firewater pump)\n\n\n\n6. Atmospheric relief devices\n\n\n\nRelease Mitigation\n\n\n\n1. Fire suppression and extinguishing systems\n\n\n\n2. Personal protective equipment el\n\n\n\n3. Spacing of equipment in accordance with IRI spacing guideline.  \n\n\n\n4. Emergency shutdowns strategically placed around the plant, which automatically shuts in the inlet and outlet and blows the plant down through the vent system.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\n\nThe gas plant maintains a written emergency response program, which is in place to protect wo"

The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first-aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post incident cleanup and decontamination procedures.  In addition the Personal protective equipment has procedures that address maintenance, inspection and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties.  The emergency response program is updated as necessary.  Any significant changes to the emergency response program are administered through the management of change (MOC) process, which includes informing and/or training affected personnel in the changes.\n\n\n\n The overall emergency response program for the Southwest Ozona Gas Processing Plant is coordinated with the Ozona Fire Department and the local EMT committee. The Southwest Ozona Gas Processing Plant conducts periodic emergency drills that involve the Ozona Fire Dept. and emergency response organizations. \n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nThe Natural gas processing plant resolves all findings from PHAs, some of which result in modifications to the process. The following types of changes are planned over the next few years in response to PHA, safety audit, and incident investigation findings:\n\n \n\n* Incident response drills involving off-site emergency responders\n\n* Process Hazards Analysis revalidations\n\n* Management of change \n\n* Mechanical Integrity & Quality Assurance\n\n* Compliance audits \n\n* Continued focus"
