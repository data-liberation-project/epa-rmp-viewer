This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, including training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release. \n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nValiant Midstream owns and operates a natural gas processing facility, the Stanberry Gas Plant, in Coal County, Oklahoma. Natural gas is gathered from wells in the surrounding fields and sent to the Stanberry Gas Plant for processing prior to being sold for domestic consumption. The Stanberry Gas Plant has a design capacity of 200 MMSCFD and consists of inlet separation/filtration, condensate stabilization, cryogenic processing, refrigeration, residue compression, and associated utility systems.  Condensate recovered from inlet gas is stored and loaded into trucks for shipment.  NGLs from the cryogenic units and natural gas from residue compression are sent offsite by pipeline.\n\nRegulated flammable substances in the process include:\n\n1.    Condensate and NGLs (Y-Grade) composed of:\n\na.    Methane\n\nb.    Ethane\n\nc.    Propane\n\nd.    Butane\n\ne.    Isobutane\n\nf.    Pentane\n\n\n\n2.    Propane, used as a refrigerant\n\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention Program\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nValiant encourages employees to participate in all aspects of Process Safety Management (PSM) and accident prevention. Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team. Employees have access to all information created as part of the facility accident prevention program. Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention prog"

These documents address (a) chemical properties and associated hazards, (b) limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and (c) equipment design basis/configuration information. \n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in safety data sheets (SDSs). This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.\n\nFor specific process areas, the facility has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g. temperature, level, and composition). The facility ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g. automated shutdown systems).\n\nThe facility also maintains documentation that provides information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment. This information provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as evaluating proposed changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised. \n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nValiant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the process are identified and controlled. Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nProcess Hazard Ana"

The team identifies and evaluates potential hazards and makes recommendations to mitigate the risk.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team. This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention. The final recommendations are tracked to closure, and resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the Stanberry Gas Plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews are conducted when major changes occur at the Plant, or at minimum every five years. The results and findings from these updates are also documented and retained.  \n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe Stanberry Gas Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for the training of new operators. These procedures are periodically reviewed to maintain correctness and annually certified as current and accurate.  In addition, the Stanberry Gas Plant maintains key process parameter documents that provide guidance on how to respond to upper or lower limit exceedance for specific process or equipment parameters. This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available in the facility for operators and other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Stanberry Gas Pl"

Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the station has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform facility personnel of any hazards that they find during their work. This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to beginning work. In addition, Valiant has a program in place to evaluate contractor safety programs and performance. Facility personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs) and Management of Change (MOC)\n\nValiant has a comprehensive system to manage changes to all covered processes.

      "SummaryText": "his system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented. Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and to (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change. Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes. In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.\n\nValiant conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information. The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service. This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready. The PSSR involves field verification of the construction and services as assurance that the accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented. \n\n&#8195;\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nValiant has established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition. The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures. In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.\n\nMaintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) app"

Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g. adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels). If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or a management of change team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\n\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance. The Stanberry Gas Plant incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs. This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\nSafe Work Practices\n\nThe Stanberry Gas Plant has safe work practices as mandated by OSHA and the EPA to help provide employee, public, and process safety. Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous substances before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e. hot work), and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space. These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nValiant promptly investigates all incidents that result"

The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent reoccurrence, and forwards these results to facility management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings. Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during PHAs and PHA revalidations.\n\n&#8195;\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nA compliance audit addressing all OSHA PSM and EPA RMP requirements is conducted at least every three years.  The audit team documents findings, develops recommendations, and provides the overall results to facility management in a written report. All corrective actions are tracked until they are completed, and the two most recent audit reports are retained at the facility.\n\nChemical - Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe processes at the Stanberry Gas Plant have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation. The following is a description of existing safety features applicable to the prevention of accidental releases of regulated substances in the facility.\n\nSpecialized Safety Features\n\nThe Stanberry Gas Plant has safety features to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of a release (mitigation).
