The facility is located at 301 Ridgemont Dr., Allen, Texas 75002.  The SIC code for the operation is 3674; the NAICS code is 334413.  The facility currently employs about 43 persons at this facility.  \n\nThe manufacturing process is epitaxial deposition using chemical vapor deposition (CVD) technology in which the silicon and dopants are brought to the single crystal surface by gaseous transport.  Epitaxy refers to the deposition of a crystalline over-layer on a crystalline substrate.  The over-layer is called the epitaxial film or epitaxial layer.\n\nThe process utilizes Trichlorosilane (TCS) as the source of silicon for the wafer deposition.  The deposition takes place in an epitaxial reactor operated at elevated temperatures.  The temperature is high enough to separate the silicon and chlorine atoms contained in the Trichlorosilane.  The dopant gases Arsine, Phosphine and Diborane also decompose at operating temperatures and are the source of the doping metals (Arsenic, Phosphorous or Boron) used in the process to create the desired characteristics of the final product.  \n\nHydrogen Chloride is used to remove silicon and dopant metal deposits on the reactor internal surfaces that accumulate during the reaction cycle.  Hydrogen chloride is also a major by-product of the deposition process.  HCL emissions are controlled in accordance with applicable state and federal air regulations.  The facility has obtained a permit from the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality for the emissions from the process.\n\nSilicon substrates are used to produce silicon wafers for manufacturing a variety semiconductor products.\n\nThe facility operates bulk Hydrogen Chloride (HCL) and Trichlorosilane (TCS) storage and distribution systems that supply the CVD epitaxial manufacturing process."

      "SummaryText": "Hydrogen Chloride (HCL) is a highly corrosive gas that will quickly combine with water vapor in the air to form Hydrochloric Acid.  The acid will quickly react and form less harmful chloride salts and water in the environment.  The above reactions occur quickly in the environment thus the reactive effects of a release will end shortly (within minutes to a few hours) of the time when the release stops.  The system consists of bulk storage and distribution piping and equipment.  The maximum inventory of HCL on site exceeds the reporting threshold for RMP.  \n\nHCL gas is withdrawn from the storage tanks through a series of regulators and automatic valves equipped with monitors, alarms, and automatic shutdowns that vent to gas scrubbers should there be any leaks.  Additionally, HCL gas is only withdrawn from the storage tanks as it is used.  This minimizes the amount of gas that would be released from using the system.  The pressure of the gas in the distribution system is kept relatively low to reduce the potential for leaks in the distribution system.  The distribution system is constructed using corrosion resistant Hastelloy steel, with welded connections where possible, valve enclosures vented through scrubbers, purge systems vented through scrubbers, alarms with automatic shutdowns, manual shutdowns, and employee training.  \n\nTrichlorosilane (TCS) is a colorless volatile liquid that is corrosive and extremely flammable.  TCS reacts with water to form corrosive compounds and may ignite on contact with water or air.\n\n \nThe TCS system consists of bulk liquid supply and distribution piping and equipment.  Liquid transfer is accomplished by pressurizing the bulk storage container vapor space with inert gas (argon).  The increased pressure forces the TCS into the distribution piping via a dip tube installed in the vessel.  When the active container is depleted, the system automatically switches to an alternate supply, typically a 55-gallon secondary supply source located"

It remains in the transport vessel at the facility.  No bulk liquid transfer is conducted at the facility.  Empty cargo containers are exchanged, as needed.  During container change out, the system piping and electrical controls function to first clear the lines of residual TCS to allow the empty cargo vessel to be safely disconnected, and second to check system integrity and cleanliness once a new container has been connected.  The operator works in conjunction with the microprocessor program to accomplish these tasks.  Trained representatives from the product supplier conduct these operations.\n\nLiquid from the supply vessel is routed through a manifold system to the process.  At the use points, the TCS is contacted with a carrier gas, typically Hydrogen, to provide vapor phase feed to a reaction chamber. Maximum intended inventory at the facility exceeds the reporting threshold for RMP.\n\nFive Year Accident History - \u00a768.155(d)\n\nThere are no known accidents or releases associated with the ammonia refrigeration system within the past five years which resulted in deaths, injuries, significant property damage, environmental damage, or evacuations, either onsite or off-site.\n\nRelease Prevention and Emergency Response Policies - \u00a768.155(a)\n\nThe facility has evaluated and reported one worst case scenario and has evaluated alternate scenarios and reported one which will result in an offsite impact that is more likely to occur than the worst case scenario.\n\nThe supplier of both distribution systems has incorporated safety provisions that include numerous alarms, automatic shutdowns, and employee procedures designed to insure that the HCL and TCS is safely stored and used in the process.

In addition, restrictive flow orifices and excess flow detection, low-low and high-high detection systems are in place with shutdown capabilities.  The TCS bulk delivery area is further protected with an AFFF foam suppression system, 14 ft. high fire walls, and 110% secondary containment.
