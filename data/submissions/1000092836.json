      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\n\nThe Avon Company's (Avon) Zanesville, Ohio facility is a state-of-the-art distribution center that handles 100% of Avon's US distribution and employs 271 people when fully operational. The site has one RMP Program Level 1 covered process designated as Aerosol Product Flammable Mixture Storage Area (Area) which is subject to the chemical accident prevention regulations under Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act and 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) part 68. The covered process has no public receptors within the distance to the endpoint (0.2 miles or 1,056 feet) from a worst-case release and has had no accidents with specific off-site consequences within the past five years.\n\n\n\nAvon associates responsible for coordinating health and safety management report directly to the facility's Local Crisis Management Team and the North American Regional Crisis Management Team (North American Corporate Legal and North American Manager, Treasury and Insurance Risk).  By assigning health and safety responsibilities to the associates who are directly involved in the facility's operational areas and reporting directly to senior (local and regional) management, the safety function becomes more effective and sends a clear message that ensuring facility safety is a basic management function and responsibility. While Avon's focus is on protecting people and property, we also work to achieve full compliance with applicable safety and fire protection-related regulations.\n\n\n\nTHE FACILITY\n\nDuring the construction of the Zanesville facility, significant portions of the project's capital went directly into designing the facility with Associate safety and property protection in mind. This focus, specifically included the design of the Aerosol Product Flammable Mixture Storage Area, which was designed and built with the following attributes:\n\n\n\n- Labyrinth designed access so that any shrapnel from an explosion cannot escape the room;\n\n- A two-hour rated firewall;\n\n- An in"

The system will activate once the temperature reaches 155 degrees Fahrenheit and will release 30 gallons of water per minute.  The sprinkler heads are protected against damage by a cage covering each head.\n\n- An independent overhead sprinkler system for the entire Area, which is triggered to activate at 165 degrees Fahrenheit;\n\n- Exterior doors that are clearly marked to designate the Aerosol Product Flammable Mixture Storage Area; and \n\n- A facility-wide fire alarm system.\n\n\n\nIn addition to the design specifications of the Area, additional ventilation equipment was installed to provide better air flow which will prevent the Area's ambient air temperature from elevating to potentially dangerous levels.\n\n\n\nIt should also be noted that the facility's fire detection system is connected to the Muskingum County 911 Emergency Directory, which is housed at the Muskingum County Sheriff's Department to ensure a rapid response to an emergency.\n\n\n\nAEROSOL CONTAINING MATERIALS HANDLING AND STORAGE POLICY\n\nAvon's M0002 \"Aerosol Handling and Storage\" Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) addresses the proper receiving, storage, and picking of aerosol containing pallets as well as the material handling equipment, waste management, and employee training requirements associated with the handling of flammable containing aerosols. Components of this policy include, but are not limited to:\n\n\n\n- Trucks or trailers carrying aerosol products must be kept away from the building, if possible, at least approximately 15 meters (50 feet).  The doors of the trailer must then be opened to allow the trailer to \"air out\" for at least 15 minutes before backing up to a loading dock door.\n\n- Move unloaded aerosol pallet loads to the Aerosol Product Flammable Mixture Storage Area immediately upon being received and processed. Temporary storage of aerosols in the Receiving area is prohibited.\n\n- Once an aerosol pallet has been deli"

Worst case scenario and endpoint calculations were based on this ratio as it represents the propellant mixture of the product with the highest on-site inventory at any one time.\n\n- The quantity of the flammable substance released would be released as a vapor cloud.\n\n- A vapor cloud explosion would result from the release.\n\n- No administrative controls or passive mitigation were in place.\n\n- The affected distance was rounded up to the nearest one-hundredth of a mile.\n\n- The largest flammable mixture container was five ounces.\n\n- The explosion took place outside of the Aerosol Product Flammable Mixture Storage Area.\n\n\n\nThe heat of combustion for the mixture (HCm) was calculated by using the method outlined in the Risk Management Program Guidance for Offsite Consequence Analysis (US EPA 550-B-99-009).  \n\n        \n\n        HCbutane = [(12,775/2.2) / (25,846/2.2)] x 45,719 = 22,597 kJ/kg\n\n        HCisobutane = [(7,750/2.2) / (25,846/2.2)] x 45,576 = 13,666 kJ/kg\n\n        HCpropane = [(5,321/2.2) / (25,846/2.2)] x 46,333 = 9,539 kJ/kg\n\n        HCmixture = (22,597) + (13,666) + (9,539) = 45,803 kJ/kg\n\n\n\nThe distance that an explosion would travel, from the center"

This provision requires an applicable facility to develop and implement a Risk Management Program and to coordinate a response plan with local emergency responders for all covered processes that handle or store listed toxic or flammable substances above the threshold quantities.  Additionally, under the Emergency Planning and Community Right-To-Know Act (Section 302, 311/312) the Zanesville facility is required to notify state and local authorities of the hazardous and extremely hazardous substances stored over a threshold quantity; this notification requirement is satisfied via "
