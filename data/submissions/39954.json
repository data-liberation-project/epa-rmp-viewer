      "SummaryText": "1.1  Executive Summary\n\nThis document represents the updated and revised Risk Management Plan (RMP) for the cogeneration facility owned by Ripon Cogeneration LLC, operated under the name of Ripon Cogeneration, located in Ripon, CA. This document has been prepared in order to address the following issues:\n\n- Repeal of the State RMP Program as delineated in HSC 25531-25543.3.\n- Promulgation of the Federal RMP program per 40 CFR 68.\n- Adoption of the Federal program requirements by the State of California.\n- Acknowledge the facility change of ownership.\n- Acknowledge the addition of processes at the facility which are subject to RMPP\n  requirements.\n\nThe RMP represents a revision of the previously required state document to incorporate the federal requirements as outlined in 40 CFR 68. Federal RMP requirements give facilities until June 21, 2004 to file the RMP, but the General Duty clause of the 40 CFR 68 regulations requires all facilities to properly:\n\n- identify hazards\n- design and maintain a safe facility\n- prevent releases\n- minimize consequences of releases.\n\nThe accepted approach to accomplishing the above is to have a documented risk management and prevention program which outlines all the steps and procedures a facility will take to prevent and mitigate accidental releases. \n\nPursuant to 40 CFR 68.155 the following summary is given:\n\n\u00bf The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the stationary \tsource are delineated in Sections 1.9, 1.10, 1.11, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, and 3.1.\n\n\u00bf The RMP applies to the Ripon Cogeneration, LLC. facility located at\n944 South Stockton St., Ripon, CA. 95366. The facility uses Anhydrous Ammonia for emissions reduction in the Selective Catalytic reactor and for inlet air cooling through a compression chiller system.\n\nThe ammonia system storage tank has a maximum capacity of 18,000 gallons. By law the tank cannot be filled to more than 85% of its maximum capacity. As a result of this requirement the tank cannot cont"

RCI has an internal operating policy that limits tank capacity to 25% of maximum or 4,500 gallons. \n\n\u00bf The worst case release scenario is the failure or the anhydrous ammonia storage tank.\n\nThe tank is monitored by five (5) ammonia detectors, one at the tank, and four surrounding the immediate vicinity of the tank. Leak detection is confirmed by the cogeneration operator console and the water suppression system is automatically initiated. The water suppression system is designed to mitigate a major portion of any tank related release. Administration controls present include the proper operation and maintenance of the facility process equipment. As well as training programs for facility operations and maintenance personnel on safety and maintenance of ammonia handling equipment.\n\n\n\n\u00bf Alternative release scenario is the rupture of the main section of ammonia distribution \tpiping.\n\nThe piping and distribution network is equipped with a number of manual and automatic valves that effectively limit the amount of any accidental release. System pressures are monitored at the control console. The inlet air cooling portion of the ammonia system has two monitors as well as an emergency diffusion tank to mitigate any potential releases from this system.\n\n\u00bf The general accidental release prevention program is comprised of the following \telements:\n\n1) Proper maintenance of all system equipment.\n2) Proper operation of all system equipment.\n3) Internal operating policies with respect to ammonia tank capacity.\n4) Comprehensive personnel training.\n5) A written emergency response plan.\n6) A written hazardous materials management plan.\n7) Documented safety procedures for employees and contractors.\n8) Inclusion of ammonia specific health, safety, and response data in the RMPP.\n9) Use of site-ambient monitors and chemical specific mitigation systems to detect and\n10) mitigate potential releases.\n\n\u00bf The site has experienced one accidenta"

The release was the result of a broken ferrule on a piece of stainless steel tubing that allowed ammonia and lubricating oil to be released into the chiller building. The leak was contained inside the chiller building and isolated by the Ripon Fire Department without any affects to the surrounding area. The OES representative reviewed the containment procedure and all cleanup measures that were implemented. The failed tubing was replaced and all other tubing associated with the chiller system was inspected for wear. The tubing is regularly inspected during maintenance intervals and monitored for potential wear.\n\n\u00bf The site has a written emergency response plan and procedures. See section 2.3. \nThis plan includes the following:\n1) emergency contacts and phone numbers\n2) designation of scene manager\n3) definition of ammonia emergencies\n4) steps to take in case of an emergency\n5) general ammonia information\n6) health hazard information\n7) first aid measures\n8) suggestions to physicians\n9) protective equipment locations\n10) training program details\n\nPresently, the facility is not considered as the primary or first responder for accidental releases. This responsibility is given to the Ripon Fire Department. Notwithstanding the previous statement, RCI has prepared appropriate emergency response procedures and plans pursuant to the General Duty clause of the 40 CFR 68 requirements. Ongoing utilization of these procedures and plan will ensure a rapid and comprehensive response to any accidental release of ammonia from the storage, distribution, or processing equipment at the facility.\n\n\u00bf The facility is constantly striving for improved performance and r"
