This RMP formalizes and documents these activities. Home Run Inn is committed to conducting its operations in a safe and responsible manner thereby reducing risks to human health and the environment. It is Home Run Inn\u00bfs policy to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local rules and regulations.\n\nThis RMP has identified potential hazards and has taken steps to design and maintain a safe facility in order to prevent releases, and minimize the consequences of accidental releases, which could occur. RMP addresses a potentially catastrophic chemical release that could result in immediate harm and acute health effects to offsite receptors (public and environmental). The RMP includes a Emergency Response Plan (ERP) that contains procedures that are designed to maximize the safety of all employees, contractors, and visitors in the event of an emergency and also guard against environmental consequences.\n\nAlthough ammonia is a listed toxic substance, it is also a ubiquitous material, which is used by the surrounding farmers for fertilizer.

The estimated population within a radius of 0.7 miles that could be affected by a potential anhydrous ammonia release is 920 people. The Bromberek Elementary School lies within the WCS radius. \n\nOffsite Impacts: Environmental\nThere were no potential regulated environmental receptors identified within this modeled radius. \n\n\nHazard Assessment \u00bf Alternative Release Scenario\nAn ARS was modeled for anhydrous ammonia whereby a release occurs as a result of a process pipe rupture located outside. The simplified Bernoulli equation was used in the ARS OCA to determine the toxic gas (ammonia) release rate. An engineering assumption was used whereby the liquefied ammonia vaporizes immediately, and the release rate of the liquid is the same as the release rate to the air. Using a conservative high-pressure receiver tank pressure of 180 psig with a hole-diameter of \u00bd-inch, the calculated continuous release rate was calculated to be 540 pounds per minute. An increased wind speed of three (3) meters per second and a lower stability Class D permits greater dispersion of the toxic gas plume as compared to the WCS analysis.\n\nSimplified Bernoulli Equation: QR = (HA)(203)(Pg)1/2\n\nWhere\t\t\t\t\t\nQR = Release rate [pounds/minute]\t\t\nHA = Hole area [square inches]\t\t\t\nPg = Gauge pressure [pounds per square inch gauge (psig)]\n\nA release rate of 540 pounds per minute would result in ERPG-2 200-ppm ammonia gas toxic endpoint distance of 0.2 miles across the \u00bfurban\u00bf topography.

      "SummaryText": "tegrity (MI) \u00bf Home Run Inn has developed a site-specific Mechanical Integrity Program that ensures written preventative maintenance procedures are developed and maintained, preventative maintenance tests and inspections are properly documented, and employees maintaining the process receive adequate training. The MI Program ensures that the ammonia refrigeration system is built, used, and maintained using preventive maintenance procedures to minimize unexpected breakdowns or failures.  The MI Program was reviewed and updated on May 7, 2007. \n\nIncident Investigation \u00bf Home Run Inn has developed a site-specific Incident Investigation Program that ensures each incident that either results in a release or could have resulted in a release of anhydrous ammonia is investigated within 48 hours. This Program ensures that any incidents are investigated, reviewed, and documented using an investigation team including at least one person knowledgeable in the process. This Program also makes provisions to ensure that a report is prepared at the conclusion of the investigation and findings are promptly reviewed and addressed.\n \nCompliance Audit \u00bf Home Run Inn has developed a site-specific Compliance Audit Program to ensure that compliance audits are conducted at a minimum of every three years to verify that Home Run Inn\u00bfs PSM/RMP Program is in place and working properly; and that practices and procedures are adequate and are being followed. The Compliance Audit Program also ensures that regular audits are performed. \n\nHot Work Permits \u00bf Home Run Inn has developed and implemented a Best Management Practice for hot work. This BMP ensures that a signed permit is obtained prior to any cutting, welding, or burning.\n\n\nHazard Assessment \u00bf Worst Case Scenarios (WCS)\nHome Run Inn\u00bfs WCS analysis consists of: \nRMP*Comp Version 1.07 Offsite Consequence Analysis Toxic Endpoint  Modeling Results\nLandView(6)  Census 2000 Population Estimate\nRMP*Submit Printout\nLandView(6)  / MARPLOT OCA Map show"

      "SummaryText": "ing endpoint distance and potential receptors\n\n\nWorst Case Scenario (WCS) / Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA)\nBecause of the prevention measures in place, a catastrophic release of anhydrous ammonia is not expected to occur; however, a worst-case release scenario was evaluated to estimate potential offsite consequences (i.e., offsite consequence analysis) to public and environmental receptors from a potential accidental release of anhydrous ammonia. \n\nThe Home Run Inn facility is located in an industrial park area and is not near major population centers or parks. The vessel containing that contains the most anhydrous ammonia is the HTRP-1 tank that is housed within the plant building. \n\nFor the WCS, the greatest amount held in a single vessel was considered. To be conservative, a release of 5000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia was used for the OCA rather than the lower quantity of 4000 pounds achieved from employing administrative controls (80-percent volume maximum). The OCA modeling approach considers an instantaneous release of 5000 pounds of liquefied anhydrous ammonia under pressure and subsequent evaporation over a 10-minute period. \n\nPassive mitigation of the building was considered in the release scenario. The unmitigated release rate was calculated to be 275 pounds per minute. Active mitigation is not used on this process. Because of the surrounding industrial buildings, the surrounding area is \u00bfurban.\u00bf\n\nThe Emergency Response Planning Guidelines (ERPG)-2 airborne toxic endpoint concentration of 200 parts per million (ppm) or 0.14 mg/L is the maximum which it is believed that nearly all individuals can be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms that could impair an individual\u00bfs ability to take protective action. \n\nRMP*Comp Version 1.07 was the model used, and the following parameters were used in the model to calculate the WCS OCA toxic endpoint distance:\n\nOffsite Impacts: Populati"
