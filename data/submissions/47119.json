As a requirement of the Clean Air Act Amendments 112(r) Accidental Release of Hazardous Air Substances program, Red Trail Energy, LLC. completed a Risk Management Plan (RMP) for any chemical stored on-site that will be above the reporting threshold of 10,000 pounds.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nRed Trail Energy, LLC. is committed to the protection of its employees, the greater community and the environment from hazardous substances used in the ethanol fuel production process, specifically aqueous ammonia and pentane, as a constituent of the natural gasoline used as the ethanol denaturant.  The ammonia is used for pH control directly in the process feed mixture to fermentation.  The denaturant is added to the ethanol to make the ethanol unfit for human consumption.  It is the policy of Red Trail Energy, LLC. to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  In the event of an emergency, including an accidental release of toxics and flammables, it is the policy of Red Trail Energy, LLC. to notify the Richardton Fire Department and Stark County Sheriff Department and evacuate all employees at the facility.  \n\nRegulated Substances Handled\nThe facility produces fuel grade ethanol from corn and a process by-product known as dry distillers' grain with solubles, which is used as a livestock feed.  Anhydrous ammonia is stored on-site and used in the ethanol production process for pH control.  The maximum anhydrous ammonia stored will be 168,000 pounds.  The fuel ethanol production process requires use of a denaturant (natural gasoline) which may contain approximately 40 percent pentane, an RMP regulated substance.  The maximum amount of denaturant on-site is estimated to be 1,046,100 pounds (total pentane approximately 418,440 pounds).  The natural gasoline is stored in an above ground tank as a liquid a"

      "SummaryText": "nd is introduced to the fuel ethanol in the final stage of production.  The denaturant tank is located in the facility's tank farm area which includes a secondary containment dike.  Unleaded fuel may also be used as a denaturant in place of natural gasoline and does not contain any regulated constituents above the threshold quantity.  Red Trail Energy, LLC. has evaluated the worst-case and alternative case scenarios as it related to the reportable substances.  Emergency response program for these scenarios has been prepared and implemented. Red Trail Energy, LLC. has coordinated emergency response with the local authorities and will conduct periodic drills.  \n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\nThrough completion of this RMP, Red Trail Energy, LLC. has complied with the EPA requirements under 40 CFR Part 68 and OSHA Process Safety Management requirements.  Process safety information and operations/maintenance procedures are documented on-site.  Periodic functions such as process hazard analysis, training, change management and incident investigation are conducted on a regular basis.  Audits of the overall RMP will be conducted on a regular basis to assure compliance with EPA regulations.\n\nFive Year Accident History\nRed Trail Energy, LLC. is a new facility and does not have a history of accidents which may have caused death, injuries, environmental or property damage, evacuations or in-place sheltering in the last five years.  This facility anticipates start up of operations the week of November 27, 2006."
