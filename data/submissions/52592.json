We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public, as well as protection of the environment.\n\nThe Enterprise Greenwood Terminal and Storage is owned by Enterprise Terminal & Storage, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Mapletree, LLC and operated by Enterprise Products Operating LLC.  We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help provide for the safety of our employees and the public, as well as protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n* A description of our facility and use of substances required by EPA's RMP regulation and the processes involved\n* A summary of results from our assessment of the potential offsite consequences from accidental chemical releases\n* Emergency Response Programs\n* General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n* A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals at the Greenwood Terminal that are regulated by EPA?s RMP rule.  \n\nFacility Description\n\nThe Greenwood Terminal is a liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) storage facility, as well as a pruified propane storage/loading facility.  The storage facility is regulated by Federal OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119 and 40 CFR Part 68.

Both of these pipelines have electric driven pumps that add horsepower to the product transfer down the pipelines, or the pump system can be bypassed when the pumps are not needed or down for maintenance.  The Greenwood facility also receives propane from one of the two natural gas liquids pipelines to two 63,000 gallon capacity storage tanks.  These tanks are used for distribution to the three propane truck transport loading docks which also has capabilities to stench the propane for retail sales companies.  The two propane storage tanks are administratively controlled to hold no more than 80 % of the full tank volume.\n\nIn addition, Enterprise has one 400,000 barrel mined cavern for propane storage.  The product for this cavern comes from and is delivered to the propane and the mixed natural gas liquids pipelines.  The storage cavern is regulated by the Department of Transportation.\n\nIn our process we use the following chemicals that the EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequence in the event of a substantial accidental release:\n\nToxics\n\nThere are no toxic chemicals handled by Enterprise Greenwood terminal.\n\nFlammables\n\nPropane is a finished product which can be delivered into one of two propane storage tanks via the dedicated propane pipeline or the mixed product pipeline.  This material is routed from these tanks to the truck transport loading docks for wholesale distribution to propane retailers.\n\nA small quantity of Ethyl Mercaptan is used to stench the propane at the truck transport docks.  Ethyl Mercaptan is stored at the Greenwood terminal, but the amount in storage is below the threshold quantity specified in the Risk Management Program regulation.\n\nKey Offsite Consequence Analysis Scenarios\n\nThe EPA's RMP rule requires that we provide information ab"

Regulated Toxic Chemical\n\nThere are no toxic chemicals handled by the Enterprise facilities at the Greenwood terminal..\n\nWorse Case Scenario ? Regulated Flammable Chemicals\n\nThis simulation involves the rupture or failure of one of the propane storage tanks resulting in a simulated vapor cloud explosion.  The entire inventory of one of the two identical  tanks is simulated as required by the Risk Management Program regulation.  This scenario assumes there would be no mitigation.  All emergency response and early warning procedures to inform employees and the community would be exercised immediately if this were to occur.  The quantity and endpoint of the simulation and the specifics of the simulation are available in the specified reporting of the Risk Management Plan\n\nAlternate Case Scenario ? Regulated Flammable Chemicals\n\nThe alternate release scenario is a simulated rupture of the propane supply pipe to the loading docks resulting in a ten minute release and simulated vapor cloud explosion.  This scenario assumed the pump continued to operate at a rate of approximately 500 gallons per minutes (gpm) for 10 minutes after the line break.  Mitigation measures were taken into account when selecting the alternative release scenario.  These measures consisted of reviewing the use of relief valves, check valves, manual shutoff valves, automatic shutoffs, startup and operating procedures, grounding equipment, and excess flow devices.

The quantity and endpoint of the simulation is contained in the data elements.\n\nWe are using this information to help us ensure that our emergency response plan and the community emergency response plan address all reasonable contingency cases.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nEnterprise maintains an Integrated Contingency Plan, which consolidates all of the various federal, state, and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning and reporting.  The program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  Furthermore, the plan is coordinated with the Lancaster County LEPC Director, which includes the Lancaster Sheriff?s Department, the local Police department, Fire Department, and Emergency Medical Service.\n\nIn the event of an accidental release, local Enterprise personnel are trained to sound the alarm, shut off the source from a safe location or activate the emergency shutdown system, contact 9-1-1 and secure the area.  The 9-1-1 system is used to notify the Lancaster County Sheriff?s Department and local Fire Departments.  Remote activation can also be accomplished from the system?s control center which is based in Houston, Texas.  The Enterprise Houston Control Center has area video cameras with dial-up access.  In addition, there are local gas detection systems that alarm locally and in Houston Control.  If these detectors annunciate, the facility can be shutdown remotely from Houston Control or locally by operations personnel.
