      "SummaryText": "The Piney Fork Sewage Treatment Plant (Treatment Plant) has been in operation since 1959 serving the Bethel Park and South Park communities. In order to the meet the ever increasing demands of the people we serve, we have made continuos improvements to the Treatment Plant and the way in which we operate.\n\nThe Federal Accidental Release Prevention Requirements under the Clean Air Act Section 112(r), codified in 40 CFR Part 68, were written to help prevent the accidental release of extremely hazardous substances and to minimize the consequences of any such release.  All facilities with threshold quantities (TQs) of the listed regulated acutely toxic and flammable substances are subject to these provisions.  The listed substances include 77 toxic chemicals with TQs ranging from 500 pounds to 20,000 pounds, while the 63 flammable substances typically have a TQ of 10,000 pounds.\n\nThe Treatment Plant has one chemical, chlorine, that meets its toxic substance TQ, and thus, chlorine must be included in a Risk Management Program for its respective operation.  The TQ for chlorine is 2,500 pounds.  \n\nThe major Clean Air Act Section 112(r) requirements with which the Treatment Plant must comply for use of chlorine include:\n\n-     Management System development and documentation,\n-     Hazard Assessment for each affected process,\n-     Prevention Program completion,\n-     Emergency Response Program coordination, and\n-     Risk Management Plan submittal.  \n\nIn addition, the Treatment Plant recognizes its responsibility under Section 112(r)(1) (the \"general duty clause\") to handle all Extremely Hazardous Substances safely to prevent their accidental release and to minimize the consequences of any such release.  Additional chemicals on site, not meeting their TQ or not identified in the 112(r) list rule, are managed using risk-management principles similiar to those applied to our chemical fully covered by 112(r).  \n\nThis Executive Summary of the Treatment Plant's Risk Management Pl"

      "SummaryText": "an (RMP) provides an overview of how we are effectively meeting our responsibilities to the community through compliance with the 112(r) rule.\n\nMANAGEMENT SYSTEM\n\nThe Treatment Plant has established a management system to oversee the implementation of its Risk Management Program responsibilities.  The management system is designed to help ensure that each element of our program is fully and effectively completed.  A qualified person has been assigned overall responsibility for the development, implementation, and integration of the program elements. Responsibility for implementing individual requirements of the Treatment Plant's program have been delegated to competent individuals.  An organization chart has been prepared to identify the responsible personnel and lines of authority for implementing the program.  Record-keeping responsibilities are also included in the management system.\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT\nThe Hazard Assessment portion of the 112(r) rule requires facility owners or operators to prepare \n\"worst-case\" and \"alternative\" release scenarios as appropriate to the operations.  From the release \nscenarios, facilities are then to determine offsite impacts using specified \"Offsite Consequence \nAnalysis\" parameters for worst-case releases and more realistic parameters for alternative releases.\n\nAs defined by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA):\n-     The worst-case release involves the release of the largest quantity of a listed toxic substance that\n       is estimated to generate the greatest distance in any direction to a toxic endpoint defined in the \n       112(r) regulation.  The probability that a worst-case release might occur or the possible causes of\n       such a release are not considered.\n\n-     The alternative scenario involves an accidental release that is \"more likely to occur\" than the worst-\n       case release scenario.  Scenarios to consider include transfer hose splits or uncoupling, process \n       piping failures, process vessel "

The entire contents of a single 1-ton container is released. \n\nThe Offsite Consequence Analysis of the chemical release was analyzed using appropriate air \ndispersion analysis and modeling techniques.  Air dispersion modeling is the use of a computer to\nsimulate the spread of air pollutants.  Dispersion modeling can be used to determine the movement and \nconcentration of toxic gases emitted from an accidental release. \n\nTo determine the OCA of worst-case and alternative releases of chlorine, the Treatment Plant used the most-recent version of several air dispersion models and modeling techniques, as follows:\n\n-     RMP*Comp is based on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) RMP Offsite \n      Consequence   Analysis Guidance (May 1996), as updated.  RMP*Comp provides rough estimates of \n      offsite impacts from evaporating pools of chemicals and vapor clouds.\n\n-     ALOHA (Areal Locations of Hazardous Atmospheres) dispersion model, developed by the National \n      Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the EPA, incorporates specific chemical release \n      characteristics that provide somewhat more refined estimates of offsite impacts from gaseous \n      releases and evaporating pools of chemicals.  ALOHA is part of the CAMEO (Computer-Aided \n      Management of Emergency Operations) system used by many emergency response teams.\n\n-     SLAB, developed by the Lawrence Livermore Natio"

According to U.S.EPA documentation, the ERPG-2 level represents the \"maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms which could impair an individual's ability to take protective action.\"  The estimated population within the worst-case release circle is 3,200, while the estimated population within the alternative release circle is estimated at 40.  The population beyond the circle should not experience an impact level of concern from a chlorine release.\n\nShould an accidental chlorine release occur that has potential for offsite consequences, alarms will sound. Treatment Plant personnel will immediately contact the local emergency management authorities and the chlorine response team.  Emergency shutdowns systems and procedures will be activated.\n\nModeling Limitations and Assumptions\n\nAir-dispersion models are limited in their ability to accurately predict the impact of a chemical release.  Their limitations increase as the complexity of the topography surrounding the release site increases.  The EPA-recommended models used in the Treatment Plant worst-case and alternative release scenarios have likely over-estimated the impact distance, because of several complicating conditions:\n\n-     Near the Chlorine Storage Building there are several large buildings and structures.  These features \n      disrupt and redirect air flow, but the models used assume winds are steady and moving in a straight \n      line.\n\n-     Beyond plant property, buildings, structures, vegetation, and terrain features also serve to disrupt and\n      red"

      "SummaryText": "irect airflow.\n\n-    The chemical emitted is assumed to have no reaction with the ground, other chemicals, or other \n      potential release conditions. However, it is likely that a release of chlorine will deposit on the ground \n      and other surfaces as it disperses from a ground-level source.  Vapors from liquefied chlorine gas are \n      initially heavier than air and spread along the ground surface and collect in low or confined areas. \n\nFurthermore, in non-uniform terrain, ambient-air concentrations tend to remain higher as the gas plume is constricted within a valley.  That is, downwind distances to the TE may be longer along a valley and shorter across a valley.  Therefore, the distance to the TE may be understated in situations with narrow valleys.  At the Treatment Plant, potential releases would be affected by both their proximity to plant buildings and hilly terrain.  These topographic features would tend to concentrate emissions close to the facility and lessen concentrations farther away.\n\nPREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe Prevention Program helps to ensure that regulated substances are safely stored, used, and handled.  In addition, if a chemical release occurs, the Prevention Program ensures that procedures and equipment are established to detect and mitigate the impact of such a release. \n\nSafeguarding the public from accidental releases through an effective Prevention Program is an important component of the 112(r) rule.  The Treatment Plant has retained Bailey-Fischer & Porter Company to operate its Plant Chlorine Gas Feed System Equipment.  Bailey-Fischer & Porter Company is a ISO-9001 certified company that performs periodic inspections and maintenance on the Treatment Plant Chlorine Gas Feed System.  The Treatment Plant has fulfilled the Program 2 Prevention Program requirements for safety information, hazard review, operating procedures, employee training, maintenance program, compliance audits and incident investigation.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n"

      "SummaryText": "For at least the past five years, no accidental releases from covered processes have occurred that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage onsite, or known offsite, deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nAn Emergency Response Program has been developed and implemented for the purpose of protecting public health and the environment.   An Off-Site Response Plan (Plan) has been developed in accordance with the provisions of the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 (SARA) Title III, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA) and the Hazardous Material Emergency Planning Committee for the Emergency Planning District of Allegheny County.  The Plan has been written in conjunction with the emergency planners at the Treatment Plant and represents the cooperative  efforts of both the community and industrial planners in response to hazardous material emergency at the facility.  The Plan has been filed with the townships of Bethel Park and South Park.  Facility specific training exercises have been conducted at the Treatment Plant by local emergency response departments. \n\nA chlorine gas leak detection system (Chloralert), maintained by Bailey-Fisher & Porter Company, will sound in-plant alarms and warning lights in the event of a chlorine leak. \n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe Treatment Plant will continue to the meet the ever increasing demands of the people we serve by making continuous improvements  to the Treatment Plant and retaining Bailey-Fisher & Porter Company as an outside consultant to assist in the operation of our facility"
