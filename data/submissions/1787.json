      "SummaryText": "1.  The Facility Policy:  The owners, management, and employees of Earlybird Grain & Fertilizer Service are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia by utilization of proper equipment, regular inspections, maintainance and training of all persons that work with the material.  Should an accidental release occur, the facility has orientated the local fire department and the local emergency planning committe so they can plan for response to any release and minimize the impact of the release to the people and the environment.\n\n2.  Facility Information:  The primary activity at the facility is the storage of anhydrous ammonia for sale to the farming and agriculture communitiy.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop nutrient.  The maximum quantity stored would be 224,000 pounds in the facility's two tanks.  The capacity of these tanks are 140,000 pounds and 84,000 pound.\n\n3.  The worst case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of the largest storage tank release as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 140,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards and company procedures.  The distance to the endpoint of dispersion based on the model used is 1.1 miles.\n\n4.  The accidental release program:  The facility complies with the Rules and Regulations relating to the Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia and Low Pressure Nitrogen Solutions, Equipment, Containers and Storage Facilities.  These regulations administered by the Illinois Department of Agriculture are consistant with ANSI K61.1 and OSHA 29 CFR 1910.111 regarding storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.\n\n5.  The Five year Accident History:  There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia for the covered process in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site; nor"
