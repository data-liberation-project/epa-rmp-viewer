      "SummaryText": "The Gibson Gas Processing Plant (Gibson Plant) utilizes more than the threshold quantity of a \u00bfregulated flammable substance (10,000 pounds)\u00bf in the processing of natural gas, where natural gas liquids (NGL) are extracted from the inlet gas using a cryogenic process and treated by a glycol dehydration unit prior to being delivered to the pipeline for further market distribution.  Therefore, this facility is subject to the Risk Management Plan (RMP) requirements codified in Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations Part 68 (40 CFR 68) administered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).\n\nThe Gibson Plant has not had an accidental release of a regulated substance where exposure to the substance, its reaction products, overpressure generated by an explosion involving the substance, or radiant heat generated by a fire involving the substance led to any off-site death, injury, or response or restoration activities for an exposure of an environmental receptor for the period of five (5) years prior to June 2008.  In addition, the estimated flammable endpoint for a worst-case release is less than the distance to any public or environmental receptor.  Furthermore, emergency response procedures have been coordinated between the facility and local emergency planning and response organizations.  Therefore, the Gibson Plant is subject to Program 1 requirements as stated in 40 CFR 68.10. \n\nThe Gibson Plant employs six (6) full-time employees on-site who will ensure the proper operation and maintenance of the facility. \n\nCrosstex LIG Liquids, LLC (Crosstex) first submitted a RMP to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) in June 2004.  However, in June 2008, Crosstex installed additional equipment to support the existing natural gas processing operation, which increased the processing capacity of the facility.  As a result, the RMP must be updated and resubmitted to the USEPA.\n\nThe following information serves as the 2008 RMP update and resubmission"

NGL is a regulated flammable mixture that is an aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbon mixture.  The regulated flammable chemicals contained in the NGL mixture include methane, ethane, propane, isobutane, N-butane, isopentane, and N-pentane.  The maximum inventory of NGL at the facility at any given time is 2,577 gallons (11,122 lbs).  \n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe Gibson Plant maintains a consistent accidental release prevention program to eliminate or minimize releases of NGL.  The Gibson Plant is subject to Occupational Safety and Health Administration\u00bfs (OSHA\u00bfs) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29 CFR 1910.119). OSHA\u00bfs PSM standard closely parallels requirements outlined in USEPA\u00bfs RMP Rule.  All elements required by USEPA\u00bfs 40 CFR 68 \u00bf Program 3 Prevention Program are also required by OSHA\u00bfs PSM.  The Gibson Plant\u00bfs Prevention Program are included in the facility\u00bfs PSM Plan, which is kept on-site as a separate document.  \n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe Gibson Plant maintains written Emergency Shutdown and Startup Procedures (ESSP) that provide guidance for emergencies expected at the facility.  Further safety information is also detailed in the ESSP.  In addition, operating procedures and equipment design codes and standards associated with the oper"

Furthermore, the facility has coordinated the emergency response plan with the Terrebonne Parish Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and the East Gibson Volunteer Fire Department.  The East Gibson Volunteer Fire Department is designated as the first responder in the event of NGL release.  \n\nA site map, MSDSs, and a list of chemicals kept on-site are maintained at the facility.  Complete details on the Emergency Response Program required under the PSM Rules are included in the Gibson Plant\u00bfs PSM Plan, which is kept on-site as a separate document.  \n\nSAFETY IMPROVEMENTS\n\nMaintenance checks, compliance audits, management of change procedures, and incident investigations will identify changes to improve safety.  The Gibson Plant has a continued commitment to update equipment and improve safety pertaining to the covered process when necessary."
