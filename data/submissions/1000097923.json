      "SummaryText": "The China Draw CF3 Central Facility has a standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, Battleship Centeral Facility trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe China Draw CF3 Central Facility , located : Section 13, Block 58, Township 1, T&P Railroad Company Survey, Reeves County, Texas, operates a liquid recovery process to produce petroleum products (e.g., natural gas liquids) from natural gas. The China Draw CF3 Central Facility has regulated flammables, such as propane and butane.\n\n\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n\nThe Worst-Case Scenario (WCS) associated with a release of flammable substances at the China Draw CF3 Central Facility is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) from a catastrophic vessel failure involving the inventory of the inlet slug catcher natural gas and natural gas liquids. The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this WCS is offsite resulting in an impact of the facility parking lot. Although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for passive mitigation measures was taken into  account in evaluating this WCS.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the China Draw CF3 Central Facility. Because processes at the China Draw CF3 Central Facility are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) risk management program (RMP) regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM) standard, this sum"

This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.  The PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution. Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team. This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention. All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.  To help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the China Draw CF3 Central Facility periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating. The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained. Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe China Draw CF3 Central Facility maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process.
