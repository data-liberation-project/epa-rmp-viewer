In fact, we have a comprehensive safety program that establishes many levels of safeguards against accidental releases and against the injuries and damage that could occur.\n\nLimiting the use of hazardous substances.  Before using a hazardous substance, we always consider less hazardous alternatives.  When we must use a hazardous substance, we consider the potential for this substance to adversely affect our workers, the public, and the environment and take steps to prevent any such effects.\n\nPreventing releases of the hazardous substances used at the facility.  When a hazardous substance is used, the equipment used to contain it is carefully designed, built, maintained and operated to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release.  Industry and government standards are closely adhered to in the design, construction, and operation of the equipment.\n\nLimiting damage from a release, if such a release occurs.  We work daily to prevent accidental releases from occurring.  However, we also train our workforce to recognize accidental releases, quickly assess the severity of a release, and respond to mitigate and stop the release. We work closely with the Ashtabula Township Fire Department and the Ashtabula County Local Emergency Planning Committee to ensure appropriate plans are in place to minimize the impact of the release on our workers and the community.  Our safety program consists of a number of elements, only, some of which are required by the RMP rule.  This RMPlan is primarily intended to describe those parts of the safety program required by the RMP rule.\n\n1.

We provide emergency response training to our personnel so that they are well prepared to handle emergency situations and execute emergency response actions.\n\n2.  Regulated Substances We Produce\n\nChlorine is covered as a toxic material by the RMP rule.  We produce and store chlorine in sufficient quantity to be covered by the RMP rule.  ASHTA has two activities that meet the definition of process in OAC 3745-104-01.  The manufacturing process includes two 270,000-pound chlorine storage tanks that are connected to a 90-ton railcar for a maximum quantity of 720,000 pounds.  The second process is on-site storage of full 90-ton chlorine railcars.  Based on site history, the maximum number of railcars ever expected to be on site at one time is 18, which results in a maximum quantity of 3,240,000 pounds for this process.\n\n3.  Offsite Consequence Analysis\n\nWe performed an offsite consequence analysis to estimate the potential for an accidental release of chlorine to affect the public or the environment. We evaluated one worst-case release scenario and one more reasonable (but still highly unlikely) alternative release scenario.\n\nWe do not expect a worst-case release scenario to ever occur.

An alternative release scenario represents a release that might occur at a facility like ASHTA Chemicals.\n\nThe main objective for performing the offsite consequence analysis was to determine the distance at which certain effects on the public might occur because of an accidental release (called the endpoint distance). For exposures to chlorine, most people at the endpoint distance would be able to walk away from the exposure without any long-term health consequences, although some short-term consequences (e.g., strong eye or throat irritation) are likely.  Some people who are particularly susceptible could experience more serious effects.  At distances less than the endpoint distance, the effects would be more severe; at distances greater than the endpoint distance, the effects would be less severe.\n\nThe following information summarizes the offsite consequence analysis. \n\n3.1  Worst-case Release Scenario \n\nThe worst-case release scenario is a failure of a 270,000-lb chlorine storage tank.  When we assume that (1) the storage tank is full and (2) all the chlorine is released and vaporized over a 10-minute time period, the predicted distance to the toxic endpoint (3 ppm) extends off site 17 miles, and public receptors are within the distance to the endpoint.\n\n3.2  Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nThe alternative release scenario for chlorine is a malfunction of the chlorine scrubber system.  In this scenario, an ASHTA Chemicals employee will stop chlorine production within 10 minutes.  During this time, an estimated 500-lb of chlorine will be released through the scrubber vent. The resulting distance to the endpoint extends off site one-quarter mile; however, there are no residences within the distance to the endpoint.\n\n4.

For ASHTA Chemicals, the prevention program requirements of EPA's RMP rule are nearly identical to the PSM regulation.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of our prevention program that address the RMP rule requirements. \n\n4.1  Prevention Program\n\nOur accident prevention program consists of the following 12 elements:\n\n4.1.1.  Process safety information.  We maintain a variety of technical documents, including an Emergency Preparedness Plan, to help ensure that our employees and local emergency responders know about the hazards associated with our facility.  These documents address (a) physical properties of the hazardous substances we handle, (b) operating parameters for our equipment, and (c) design basis and configuration for our equipment.  We ensure that this process safety information is available to all our employees.\n\n4.1.2.  Process hazard analysis.  We perform and periodically update process hazard analyses of our processes to help identify process hazards and make recommendations that might improve the safe operation of the process.  A multidisciplinary team is assembled to analyze the hazards of our processes.  This team includes personnel with engineering and process operating experience and a leader with process hazard analysis experience. The team systematically addresses the hazards associated with operation of the equipment in the process areas. The team then prepares a written report describing the results of the analysis, including a list of recommendations.  Responsibility for resolving the recommendations is assigned to area personnel, and, when appropriate, changes to enhance the safety of the process are implemented.  Each analysis is revisited at least every 5 years to ensure it is current.\n\n4.1.3.  Operating procedures.

Steps for safely conducting activities\n? Applicable process safety information, such as safe operating limits and consequences of process deviations\n? Safety and health considerations, such as chemical hazards, personal protective equipment requirements, and actions to take if exposure to a hazardous substance occurs\n\n4.1.4.  Training.  We train workers to safely and effectively perform their assigned tasks.  Our training program includes both initial and refresher training that covers (a) a general overview of the process, (b) the properties and hazards of the substances in the process, and (c) a detailed review of the process operating procedures and safe work practices.  Both written and oral reviews are used to verify that an employee understands the training material.\n\n4.1.5.  Mechanical integrity.  We maintain our process equipment to help prevent equipment failures that could endanger workers, the public, or the environment.  Our mechanical integrity (preventive maintenance) program includes (a) an inspection and testing program to help identify equipment deterioration and damage before the equipment fails and (b) a quality assurance function to help ensure that new and replacement equipment meet the strict design standards required for service in our processes.\n\n4.1.6.  Management of change.  We evaluate and specifically approve all proposed changes to chemicals, equipment, technology, and procedures to help ensure that the change does not negatively affect safe operations.

Pre-startup safety review.  We recognize that new or newly modified processes are historically more likely to be involved in accidental releases.  Therefore, we perform safety reviews of new or modified processes before placing them into service to help ensure their safe operation.  This review confirms that:\n? Construction and equipment are in accordance with design specifications\n? Adequate safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency procedures are in place\n? Employee training has been completed\n? For a covered process, a process hazard analysis has been performed if the process is new, or management of change requirements have been completed if an existing process has been modified\n\n4.1.8. Compliance audit.  One of the cornerstones of an effective prevention program is a regular, thorough assessment.  We audit our processes every 3 years to be certain our prevention program is effectively addressing the safety issues of our operations.  We assemble an audit team that includes personnel knowledgeable in the PSM and RMP regulations and in our process designs, and this team evaluates whether the prevention program satisfies the requirements of these two regulations and whether it is sufficient to help ensure safe operation of the process.  The results of the audit are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate enhancements to the prevention program are implemented.\n\n4.1.9.  Incident investigation.  We investigate all incidents that could reasonably have resulted in serious injury to personnel, the public, or the environment so that similar accidents can be prevented in the future.

We encourage active participation of personnel in the prevention program activities of all processes at the facility.  Employees are consulted on and informed about all aspects of our accidental release prevention program.\n\n4.1.11.  Hot work permits.  We have a hot work permit program to control spark- or flame-producing activities that could result in fires or explosions in our facility.  We reviewed OSHA's fire prevention and protection requirements and created a hot work permit form to comply with these requirements.  Personnel who are to perform hot work are required to fill out the form, and the appropriate supervisor reviews the completed form and work area before work can begin.  Training on hot work activities and on the requirements of the hot work permit program is included in our safe work practices orientation.\n\n4.1.12.  Contractors.  We have a program in place to help ensure that contractor activities at our facility are performed in a safe manner.  We explain to the contract supervisors the hazards of the processes on which they and their employees will work, our safe work practices, and our emergency response procedures.

The Ashtabula County Emergency Management Agency is responsible for notifying the public of emergency situations, if necessary.\n\nThe written emergency response plan complies with other federal contingency plan regulations [e.g., OSHA regulation 29 CFR 1910.38(a)], and a copy of the plan has been provided to the fire department. Also, an Ashtabula County Emergency Operations Plan has been developed by the Local Emergency Planning Committee, of which an ASHTA Chemicals representative is a member.\n\n7.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nWe constantly strive to improve the safety of our processes using recommendations developed through the prevention program and a program soliciting safety suggestions from our employees.  All recommendations received by plant management are evaluated and implemented if safety can be improved.  On an annual basis, we review all of our operating and safety procedures to ensure that they are correct, and we provide training to our employees and contractors on a wide variety of safety and operating topics.  ASHTA Chemicals is constantly being modified as new and improved equipment is placed in service, which helps to maintain the high standard of safety that the plant has achieved in the past."
