If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, and other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.Facility Information:\n\n\u00bfThe primary activity at the facility is the storage of fertilizers for sale to farmers.\n\u00bfAnhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for the direct application of fertilizers for crop production nutrients.\n\u00bfThe maximum quantity stored would be 79,000 pounds in our one 18,000 gallon storage tanks.  \n\n3.The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario:\n\na.The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank (or tank car) released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 79,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.76 miles.\nB.The alternative release scenario based on the five-year accident history (or the most likely potential incident) is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 0.83 miles.\n\n4.The accidental release prevention program:\n\nThe facility has referred to the provisions of \u00bfSafety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, Kk-611.1\u00bf, published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \u00bfStorage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\u00bf.\n\n5.The Five-year Accident History:\n\na.There have been no accidental release"
