If an emergency should happen, we would notify the Dysart Fire Dept. to respond to the emergency. This facility is farm cooperative.  We offer fertilizer, chemicals, feed, seed, fuel, and grain storage to the farm community in Tama and Benton Counties.  Anhydrous Ammonia is one of the fertilizers we offer to our growers.  We have a 30,000 and a 26,000 with 25 1000 gallon nurse tanks and valves, pipes, and hoses to go with them.  The worst case scenario is failure of our 30,000 and 26,000 gallon storage tanks when filled to capacity, resulting in vapor explosion.  The distance to the end point is 4.4 miles.  There are office buildings, retail stores, schools, nursing home and private homes within this distance.  The population within this end point is about 1250 people.  The Anhydrous Ammonia system is maintained in accordance with OSHA29 CFR 1910.38 and state law.  Our facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and state and local regulations.  In the past five years, we have never had an accident involving Anhydrous Ammonia that caused death, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, or evacuations.  In the event of an emergency involving our Anhydrous Ammonia tank it is our policy to notify the Dysart Fire Dept.  We have discussed this policy with our fire dept.  Our fire dept. inspects our facility once a year.  We have no planned changes to improve safety."
