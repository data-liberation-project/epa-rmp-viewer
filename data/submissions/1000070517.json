The property is bounded on three sides by Metro East Industries.  The site runoff water and any possible spill on the site into the site sewer system empty into a 100,000 gallon waste water pit.  The material collected in this pit is analyzed for pH prior being pumped to the local POTW.\n\n\n\nThe Alorton Plant is required to comply with the Solvay Process Hazard Management Program.  This program meets or exceeds the minimum requirements as listed in 29CFR1910.119 OSHA's Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals standard for the same regulated substance - Hydrogen Fluoride and Ammonia - that are also covered by the Clean Air Act (CAA) Section 112 A; or as more commonly referred to as the Risk Management Plan (RMP) program.\n\n\n\n1.    Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\n\nSolvay Fluorides, LLC., is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.   This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement controls to prevent possible release of regulated substances.  Safe work practices and training of our personnel supplement the safe design of the plant.  Automatic and manual means of water mitigation are available throughout the process area to reduce the potential effects of accidental release\n\n\n\n2.     The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled:\n\nSolvay fluorides, LLC, primary activities encompass the manufacture, processing and sales of chemicals for industrial use"

These substances are Hydrogen Fluoride/Hydrofluoric Acid and Anhydrous Ammonia.  Hydrogen Fluoride/Hydrofluoric Acid is used for the source of fluoride ion in each of our four products manufactured at our Alorton plant.  Anhydrous Ammonia is used to manufacture Ammonium Fluoride.\n\n\n\n3.     The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternate Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigations measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario.\n\n\n\nThis facility has developed worst case and alternative scenarios in accordance with 40 CFR 68.  Given the state of current events, this information is being withheld from this Executive Summary, as the USEPA considers this (FR 69 vol. 69, pg 1 8819-188832) security sensitive information.\n\n\n\n4.     The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:\n\nOur facility has taken all necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR 68, Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with applicable State & industry codes.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information \n\nSolvay fluorides, LLC., maintains a record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment design associated with all processes.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our covered"

The SARA methodology is essentially HAZOP with LOPA included in the methodology.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations. They are revalidated at least once every five years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Solvay Fluorides, LLC., maintains written operating procedures.   These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\nSolvay Fluorides, LLC. has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating  procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every 3 years and more frequently as needed.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nSolvay Fluorides, LLC. carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operation.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training, as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.
