A primary aspect of this commitment is the City of \n\nZanesville Wastewater Treament Plant system to help ensure the safe operation of the water chlorination process.  Our commitment is also demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as \n\nconsidering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our process, as well as, extensive training of our operating personnel. \n\nIn the event of an accidental release, the City of Zanesville Wastewater Treament Plant has procedures that are designed to control and contain the release in a manner that will be safe for our employees and \n\nwill help prevent injury to the public and the environment.  The City of Zanesville Wastewater Treament Plant's emergency response personnel receive thorough training in handling accidental releases.  An \n\nemergency response coordinator has been assigned to oversee response activities and to coordinate response efforts with local emergency agencies.  Communications with the Local Emergency Planning Committee \n\n(LEPC) have been ongoing throughout the preparation of this plan and policies.\nIn order to effectively implement these policies, the City of Zanesville Wastewater Treament Plant established a management system headed by the Plant Superintendent to ensure the proper implementation and \n\neffectiveness of our Risk Management Program.\n\n\n2.0  City of Zanesville Wastewater Treament Plant and Regulated Substances\n\nThe City of Zanesville Wastewater Treament Plant handles one substance regulated by the EPA Risk Management Program Rule (RMP Rule) rule in quantities above the Threshold Quantity. \n\nProcess Description: Chlorination\nProgram Level: 3\nRegulated Sub"

The regulated substance was evaluated for a possible worse-case release scenario and alternative release scenario.  It is important to understand that the City of Zanesville Wastewater Treament Plant has invested extensive resources to prevent releases, and the potential for a worse-case release is extremely small.  The alternative release scenario represents a more realistic potential for occurrence and is based on historical data from our process or other similar processes.  By identifying these potential releases, the City of Zanesville Wastewater Treament Plant has developed an extensive program to prevent such an occurrence.  \n\nThis program is discussed in detail in the Prevention Program section of this plan.\n\nThe primary objective of performing the offsite consequence analysis is to determine the distance at which certain effects might occur to the public and/or the environment as a result of an accidental \n\nrelease.  This point is called the endpoint distance.  At distances less than the endpoint distance, the effects would be greater; at distances farther than the endpoint, the effects would be less.\n\n3.1  Hazard Assessment - Toxic Substances\n\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with Regulated Toxic Substances is a failure of a full, one ton (2000 lb) cylinder of liquid chlorine.  A toxic cloud formed by the evaporating chlorine would reach offsite endpoints and public receptors.\n\nAn alternative release scenario (ARS) for chlorine releases is a release from a vessel leak.  The modeled release lasted for 30 minutes before it is stopped.  A toxic cloud formed by the evaporating chlorine would reach offsite endpoints and public receptors.\n\n\n4.0  Accidental Release Prevention Program - Program 3\n\nThe City of Zanesville Wastewa"
