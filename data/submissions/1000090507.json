All operators are thoroughly trained in the process operation and fire fighting techniques.  The facility has an Emergency Response Plan with an imbedded third party response team to assist with fire brigade, hazardous materials, high angle rescue, and medical response.  All employees are trained in hazardous materials.\n\n\n\n2)    Stationary source and regulated substances handled:\n\n\n\nThe YCI Methanol One Plant is located at 6586 Highway 3127 in St. James Parish, Louisiana.  The facility produces methanol from natural gas.  The regulated substance handled is methane.  There are no other regulated substances above threshold quantities at the site.\n\n\n\n3)    The general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\n\n\nAlthough YCI is a classified as Program 1 under RMP, the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) rules apply to the methane containing process.  Therefore, YCI will implement all PSM requirements including Employee Participation, Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Contractor Management, Pre-Startup Safety Review, Mechanical Integrity, Hot Work Safe Work Practices, Management of Change, Incident Investigation, Emergency Planning and Response, and Compliance Audits.  \n\n\n\n4)    The five-year accident history:\n\n\n\nThis is a new facility that is projected to begin operations in late 2020.  Therefore, there have been no accidents in the last five years.\n\n\n\n5)    The emergency response program:\n\n\n\nThe YCI Emergency Response Program designates an Emergency Response Team to respond to plant emergencies.  All plant personnel will receive training on the program to ensure understanding of each person's role.  The plant will maintain a site-wide alarm"
