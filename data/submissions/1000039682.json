(Publix) Orlando Distribution Center (DC) is located at 7371 South Golden Rod Road, Orlando, Orange County, Florida.  Publix requires each facility to develop and maintain accident prevention programs and an emergency response plan appropriate to the site.  Each site is also responsible for regulatory compliance issues that apply to the site.  A site PSM Coordinator is appointed to facilitate compliance.  Publix' corporate and division environmental and safety personnel provide assistance in training for site employees and in budgeting and procurement of the safety and training services. \n\n\n\n2.     Facility and Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nThe Orlando DC is located on Goldenrod Road, north of the FL-528 and the Orlando International Airport.  The Distribution warehouse consists of areas for dry, frozen and cooler storage of non-perishable and perishable items for distribution to the Publix Super Markets.  The facility includes a freezer with an Automated Storage and Retrieval System (ASRS).  To provide cooling to these areas, the facility uses anhydrous ammonia as the refrigerant in quantities above 10,000 pounds.  The refrigeration equipment is located within a dedicated engine room; emergency relief is to a dilution water tank.\n\n\n\n3.     Prevention Program\n\n\n\nThe facility exceeds the ammonia threshold quantity for OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard, 1910.119, and the process is therefore subject to PSM requirements.  For RMP compliance purposes, this places the refrigeration process in the Program 3 level.  The facility will use its PSM program as the required Program 3 Prevention Program.  \n\n\n\nThe Orlando DC has a program in place to comply with the OSHA PSM Standard, 29 CFR 1910.119.  It includes a preventive maintenance plan which requires all ammonia refrigeration equipment to be periodically inspected and serviced.  This will ensure that equipment rem"

The program implemented at Orlando mirrors programs in place at other Publix ammonia refrigerated facilities.  \n\n\n\nIn developing the PSM program, the Orlando facility also developed written operating procedures for the refrigeration process. These procedures cover all phases of operation and include information on safety devices.  These procedures are used to train all operators and mechanics who work on the ammonia refrigeration processes to ensure consistency of operation and minimize human error. These measures ensure that all refrigeration operators and mechanics are properly trained.  Publix has also implemented safe work practices and procedures such as lockout/tagout and hot work permitting to ensure that all non-routine work can be performed safely.  \n\n\n\nOther components of the prevention program include collection and periodic review of all equipment information, including Piping and Instrumentation Diagrams (P&IDs).  The staff ensures that if equipment design deficiencies are identified that they are corrected.  These actions will ensure that equipment meets all refrigeration industry standards and that accurate equipment information will be available when needed.  \n\n\n\nTo ensure that Orlando DC's refrigeration staff has the skill necessary to identify unsafe conditions, they are included in a refrigeration training program and receive support from refrigeration staff at Publix facility in nearby Lakeland, Florida.  Training includes Process Hazard Analyses, Operating Procedures, Maintenance Procedures, Emergency Response, and Safe Work Practices.  The ammonia refrigeration staff, with the assistance of a consultant, performed a PHA of the process in April 2014 prior to startup.  Additional PSM procedures, including Management of Change, Pre-Startup Safety Review, Compliance Audits, and Incident Investigation also ensure the continued safe operation and"

Five-year Accident History\n\n\n\nThe Orlando DC has had no accidental releases as this is the initial RMP Submittal.  \n\n\n\n5.     Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\nThe Orlando DC has a written Emergency Response Plan for ammonia in place.  The program complies with 29 CFR 1910.38.  The facility also has internal emergency response capability and has developed a program to comply with paragraph (q) of 29 CFR 1910.120.  The current plan has been coordinated with local responders.  Notification is made locally by dialing 911 or contacting the Florida State Warning Point at (800) 320-0519.  \n\n\n\n6.     Plans to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nTo improve safety, the facility will continue to implement the prevention program procedures and revise the procedures as additional operational experience is obtained.  \n\n\n\n"
