The total annual gallonage from all sources \n\nfor 2003 is 2.02 Billion Gallons* with a peak day of 15.7 MG*. \n\nTo supply this amount of water, we operate two surface water treatment \n\nplants. The Missouri River Water Treatment Plant (MRTP) located at \n\n2560 Canyon Ferry Road, and The Ten mile Water Treatment Plant west of \n\nHelena at 1115 Rimini Road. The Ten mile Water Plant is in operation year \n\nround while the MRTP is used only during the summer months for peak demands. \n\nAdditional water is obtained from the Hale system which consists of \n\nthe Oro Fino and Eureka well collectors. The department's two treatment \n\nplants are maintained, evaluated and upgraded to stay abreast of \n\nadvancements in technology, health science and governmental regulations.\n\n\n\nThe Helena water distribution system consists of six-finished water \n\nstorage reservoirs \n\n(Malben, Winne, Hale and Upper Hale, Woolston and Knob Hill the newest \n\ncompleted 2002) and Pumping stations Forrest Estates, Hale, Eureka, \n\nDahlhausen, Reeders Village) linked together with 185 miles of \n\nwater transmission and distribution pipelines. The Chessman (530MG) \n\nand Scott (195MG) reservoirs in the Ten mile Watershed also provide \n\nadditional water for the Ten mile Water Plant during low flows. \n\nThese Reservoirs are filled with spring run off water. \n\n \n\nCarollo Engineers of Boise, Idaho completed a Water Master Plan Update \n\nfor the City of Helena in April 1997. The Public Works Department has \n\ncopies of the Water Master Plan if customers would like to review it. \n\nPhase on"

      "SummaryText": "e of this update determined that the existing Missouri River \n\nTreatment Plant should be rehabilitated or replaced due to age of equipment, \n\npublic health risks, and operational safety issues. Plant replacement or \n\nrehabilitation costs are significant. This past year the Missouri River \n\nTreatment Plant Just received new filters and Media, along with an \n\nautomation upgrade. In addition to those upgrades the City of Helena has \n\ncontracted with an Engineering firm,HDR in 2004 to update our Water Master \n\nplan. Also we are in talks with the United States Bureau of Reclamation to \n\nrenew our contract for water from the Missouri River for another 40 years.\n\n\n\nThe Facility and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nThis is a local government owned and operated facility for the production \n\nof potable water for the City of Helena.  The only reportable regulated \n\nsubstance for the RMP plan is chlorine.  One to two tons of chlorine are \n\nstored at this facility in ton cylinders.  No more than two ton cylinders \n\nare on line at a time. The online tanks are operated by new vacuum regulators \n\nthat reduce the chlorine pressure to a vacuum state. Chlorine feed equipment \n\nsupplies a vacuum to the tanks allowing the release of chlorine to the feeders. \n\nAll feed lines supply chlorine below atmospheric pressure. Should a leak \n\ndevelop the feeders would be unable to supply enough vacuum to continue the \n\nrelease of chlorine and the feed would stop at the Chlorine Pressure Reducing Valve \n\n(CPRV) attached to the tank.  Each tank has its own CPRV. No flammable substances \n\nare stored in the chlorine room.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorst-Case Scenario\n\n\n\nThe worst-case scenario would be the total loss of one ton of chlorine \n\nthrough catastrophic valve or tank failure.  There are no mitigation \n\ncontrols.  Response time could be so limited (less than an hour) that \n\nunder the right conditions total loss of one ton of chlorine is possible.\n\n\n\nAlternate Scenario\n\n\n\nValve failure or leak while tank is being c"

Operators would close the tank valve thus shutting off the \n\nchlorine so repairs can be made.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention\n\n\n\nOperators are trained in the proper way to change tank CPRV's.  Regular \n\nmaintenance is kept on the CPRV's, lines, and feeders.  Cylinders with \n\nexceptionally difficult or tight valves are returned.  SCBA's are kept \n\nin a separate room.  Operators are trained in proper leak detection and \n\ncorrection needed.  Two operators are required for tank changes or repairs.  \n\nA third operator is notified of any leaks and told to notify emergency \n\nresponders if no communications for more than 20 minutes. \n\nTwo operators are required for changing chlorine tanks as part of our \n\nstandard operating procedures.  Self Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA) \n\nare stored in an adjacent room on wall mounted quick release brackets.  \n\nAn emergency repair kit is available.  A chlorine detector is installed \n\nin the room connected to an alarm panel and Autodialer.  \n\nIf an alarm condition exists it will call personnel till acknowledged.  \n\nAll alarms and autodialers are on uninterruptible power supplies, \n\nBatteries.\n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nNo accidents in the last five years.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\n\nAs written in the plant emergency response manual.  This manual is stored on  \n\nthe office desk. These manuals are stored in plain view by office door.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes\n\nNew improvements include a new Clearwell, chlorine equipment, and high \n\nservice pump station.  Storage improvements includes a new west side \n\nreservoir.  This new construction will begin in one to two years from \n\nnow depending on budget restraints and final approval from City and \n\nCommunity advisory groups.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
