The Production Manager acts as the Emergency Contact.  Contact information for both can be found in Sections 1.7 and 1.8 in Appendix A for this procedure.\n\nThe BASF Corporation Mauldin SC facility considers protection of employees, the public and the environment to be its most important responsibility. A key element of its protection program is the development and implementation of plans to prevent accidental chemical releases. In addition, if an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to respond in an organized and effective manner. \n\nThe BASF Corporation Mauldin, SC facility accident prevention and emergency response programs have been developed in accordance with federal and state regulations, industry standards, and guidance from Greenville County emergency response organizations. Although the programs have been highly successful - the facility has never had a significant chemical release the facility continually seeks ways to improve its prevention and response programs. \n\nThis document, the Risk Management Plan (RMP) for the facility, was prepared to comply with federal regulatory requirements regarding the prevention of accidental chemical releases (40 CFR Part 68 Accidental Release Prevention Requirements). The purpose of the regulation is to reduce the potential for an accidental chemical release and strengthen emergency response planning at the facility and within the community. The RMP describes the incident at the facility which would have the most catastrophic effects (the worst case) and several scenarios of lesser magnitude (alternative cases).  Although it is technically unfeasible for the worst case described in this report to occur, worst case in"

The facility has a broad range of manufacturing capabilities, including proprietary blending and complex esterification and ethoxylation/propoxylation reactions. Built in the 1950's, the 38-acre facility has undergone multiple upgrades and modernization program, which has helped to make the facility a leader in productivity, process control and environmental stewardship. \n\nThe facility has a 2.8 million-gallon biological wastewater pretreatment system that is able to process the wastewater generated throughout the facility.  The wastewater pretreatment plant has received the Compliance Excellency Award from Western Carolina Regional Sewer Authority/Renewable Water Resources for many years for achieving perfect compliance with all permit requirements. \n\nThe facility is subject to numerous environmental, health and safety regulations and is regularly inspected by agency representatives. The following activities are specifically regulated: (1) Air Emissions: Regulated by various air permits issued by SC Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC); (2) Wastewater discharge regulated by permit issued by Renewable Water Resources; (3) Storm water discharge regulated by permit issued by SC DHEC; (4) Hazardous Waste Generation Activity under SCD058745894; (5) Process Safety Subject to OSHA Process Safety Management Rule; (6) Emergency Planning Subject to SARA 311/312 Reporting; (7) Release Reporting Subject to SARA 313.

There are no regulated flammable substances at the threshold quantity at this facility. Since ethylene oxide and propylene oxide are used in the following processes, these processes are covered by the RMP Rule: \n\n5.\tOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS \n\nFollowing EPA guidance, the facility performed an offsite consequence analysis (OCA) to determine the potential for an accidental release of a regulated substance that could have an impact on the public or the environment. The OCA consists of evaluating both worst case scenarios (WCSs) and alternate release scenarios (ARSs). Based on facility design and prevention programs, the facility does not believe the worst-case release scenario could ever occur. Although it is also highly unlikely that the ARS would occur, the ARS represents a release that is more likely to occur during the lifetime of a facility like the Mauldin facility. \n\nThe main objective of performing the OCA is to determine the distance at which certain effects might occur to the public because of an accidental release (called the endpoint distance). The concentration at the endpoint represents the maximum concentration below which nearly all people can be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing irreversible or serious health effects or symptoms which could impair the ability to take protective action. \n\n5.1\tWORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS \n\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) at the Mauldin facility is a catastrophic failure in the ethylene oxide (EO) storage tank resulting in a release of 185,385 pounds of EO over a 10-minute period.  The EO tank is below grade in an open vault, which serves as a dike. In the event of a release, the vault/dike would contain the released EO, which would evaporate, forming a vapor cloud. EPA defines the toxic endpoint as that point where the concentration of EO is 50 ppm (0."

Based upon the facility location and 2010 U.S. Census Data, this corresponds to an approximate residential population of 201,543 within the Distance to Endpoint.  \n\nDocumentation related to the modelling for the WCS and the Census data used are found in Appendix B.\n\nAlthough the facility has numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for administrative controls or active mitigation measures were considered when calculating the distance to the endpoint. \n\nThe facility has modern, redundant systems designed to prevent this scenario from ever happening These systems are described in further detail in the section on Chemical Specific Prevention Steps. \n \n5.2\tALTERNATE RELEASE SCENARIOS \n\nThe alternative release scenario (ARS) for EO is a failure of the seal in the loading arm boom attached to the rail car during the EO unloading process. The 1-minute release duration is the approximate time needed for engineering controls to stop the release. Failure of the seal was chosen as the potential release because, historically, seals have been a release point for operations of this type in the chemical industry. \n\nThe ARS for propylene oxide is a failure of the seal in the loading arm boom attached to the rail car to provide the necessary emergency response services during the PO unloading process. The 1-minute release duration is the approximate time needed for engineering controls to stop the release.

Examples of employee participation include updating and compiling technical documents, reviewing chemical safety information, and participating in process hazard analyses (PHAs). Employees have access to extensive process and chemical safety information. Employee involvement in safety programs is documented in the facility's Process Safety Manual. \n\n7.2\tProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA) \n\nSafe operation of a process starts with a detailed identification of the hazards associated with the process. The Mauldin facility has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with each process are identified and controlled. To do this, each process at the facility is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards. \n\nThe facility primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations. HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques. The analyses are conducted using a team of trained personnel who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. The team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. \n\nImplementation of mitigating options in response to PHAs is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team. This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention. All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained. \n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the facility periodically updates a"

The Mauldin facility maintains extensive technical information about the safe operation of its processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. Specific departments within the facility are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety data.
