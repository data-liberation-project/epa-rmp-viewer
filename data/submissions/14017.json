The source was identified as a threaded piping fitting on an ice maker high above the top of the ice tank.\n\nThe ammonia loss caused no problems on- or off-site.  It was undetected until discovered by an employee working on the ice maker downwind.  This type of leak is an improbable one and is not considered a negative indicator of LES Rokeby Station ability to control hazards on the site.\n\n6.

Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies.\n\n\nThe Lincoln Electric System (LES) is a municipally-owned and operated electric utility with sole service responsibility in and around Lincoln, Nebraska   As a publicly owned utility, we operate and maintain all of the equipment in our system in a manner representing prudent utility practices and in conformance with our customer/owner's expectations. We strive for excellence in the operations of our facilities, and for full compliance with all local, state, and federal laws and regulations.\n\nMeeting environmental requirements is part of our policies and we are complying with federal Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions (40 CFR Part 68) and the Risk Management Program defined in it.  We are committed to the accidental release prevention program.  \n\nLES has a thorough detailed Emergency Response Plan designated specifically for an ammonia release for the Rokeby Station.  The plan has been reviewed with response organizations and others.  \n\n\n2. The stationery source and regulated substances handled.\n\nThe LES Rokeby Station, owned and operated by LES, provides emergency, peaking and base load electric power generation. There are two gas turbines located on the 160-acre site. To augment power output at the LES Rokeby Station during high summer air temperatures, a cooling system is used to lower turbine inlet air temperatures.  This system utilizes ammonia refrigeration to make ice that is stored in a 1.1 million gallon concrete tank \n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system contains a total of approximately 12,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia and this is the maximum plant inventory.  This ammonia quantity requires that Rokeby Station develop a Risk Management Program and Plan.  Rokeby Station is covered by Program 2 requirements.\n\n3.
