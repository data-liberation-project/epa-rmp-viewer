      "SummaryText": "The T. L. Amiss Water Purification Plant is a surface water treatment facility that supplies drinking water to the City of Shreveport.  Following conventional treatment, the water is dosed with chlorine and ammonia to form chloramines, providing a long-lasting disinfectant residual in the distrubution system.  Historically, chlorine and ammonia have been provided in the gaseous form due to low cost and ease of operation.  During the last five years, there have been no reportable accidents associated with the use of chlorine gas and ammonia gas.  The plant is currently undergoing a major capital renovation, involving upgrades to the filters, chemical feed system and other improvements.  Eventually, plans are for all chemicals to be stored in fully enclosed areas, thereby minimizing any potential release threats.    Current safety, training, operation, and maintenance practices at the T. L. Amiss Water Treatment Plant follow the guidelines set forth in the risk management program.  Procedures documenting compliance with the rule are provided in a three-ring binder located at the plant.  Compliance audits will be performed as required by the Safety Specialist for the City's Department of Operational Services.  As mentioned above, the plant is currrently undergoing a major capital improvement program which should ultimately result in the full enclosure of chemicals, which in turn may affect how the RMP rule applies."
