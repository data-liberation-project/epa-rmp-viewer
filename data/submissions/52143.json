The accident prevention programs in place are in compliance with the OSHA's Process Safety Management  (PSM) rule and the EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) rule. All systems here at Organic Technologies have been designed for safety. This includes a process technology system covering the hazards of materials, equipment design basis and process design basis. This incorporates extensive safety instrumentation such as temperature indication, pressure indication, level transmitters, high-level safeties, % LEL gas detectors, coupled with the Delta V Process Control System providing alarms and interlocks. The facility is maintained by identifying all process safety critical equipment and performing routine inspections to ensure proper operation and mechanical integrity. A work order management system is used to control maintenance on the systems. All maintenance employees are trained in preventive maintenance and operations employees are trained to properly follow approved procedures. The individual elements of our prevention program work together to prevent accidental chemical releases. The CD-106 distillation system was built following NFPA 58 design and ASME Pressure Piping Code and installation guidelines. Organic Technologies has an active Accident/Incident Investigation program and initiates investigations within 48 hours.
