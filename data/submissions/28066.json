Public and employee safety, as well as environmental protection, are primary issues of concern to Continental Gas, Inc. (CGI). Accidental release prevention is a key factor in the design, construction and operation of all CGI facilities.CDGI facilities are constructed in accordance with applicable codes/standards and are evaluated to ensure the equipment complies with recognized and generally accepted good engineering practices. CGI facilities are equipped with many engineering safeguards (ie : pressure relief valves, shutdowns, alarms etc.)that are designed to prevent situations that would require an emergency response. CGI also has implemented a mechanical integrity program to ensure the continued integrity of the process. CGI does however, realizes the necessity of having an Emergency Response Plan that addresses the actions to take if an emergency situation were to involve anyone outside of the facility. This plan is provided to applicable outside agencies that might be called upon for assistance in an emergency situation (ie: police department, fire department, etc.)                                                                                                                                                                             \n(b) Stationary Source and Regulated Substances. The Matli Gas Plants is a stationary source as defined in 40 CFR 68.3. The regulated substance at the facility is a flammable chemical mixture, Natural Gas Liquids ( NGL), which is an aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbon mixture. The mixture includes N-pentane, isopentane, N-butane, isobutene, propane, ethane and methane. These chemicals have an RMP regulated threshold quantity of 10,000 lbs. The facility has an aboveground storage tank for NGLS that has a maximum controlled capacity of 15,000 gallons.

The worst-case release scenario (WCRS) would be a rupture of the NGL Product Storage Tank. Such a release has the potential of the formation of a vapor cloud that could explode when exposed to an ignition source. Using the EPA?s RMP* Comp program, the WCRS distance/endpoint was calculated to be .2 miles from the tank. Based on this calculation it was determined that no public receptors were within the WCRS. Various administrative and mitigative (engineering) controls have been implemented/installed as safeguards to prevent deviations outside safe operating limits. Administrative controls include utilizing a well trained operation and maintenance staff that periodically visit and inspect the facility. Mitigative (engineering) safeguards include such things as high pressure/overpressure relief valves, high pressure shutdowns, high temperature shutdowns, high level shutdowns, etc.                                                                                                                                                                       \n(d) General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps. CGI?s general accidental release prevention program is focused upon release prevention. CGI senior management believes release prevention must be a major factor in:\n   1) the original design and construction of a process that handles and/or stores hazardous chemicals;\n   2) the development and implementation of operating and maintenance procedures (including the facility?s mechanical integrity program); and \n  3) the training of process operation and maintenance personnel. CGI has also developed and implemented a company hazard communication program that ensures : 1) an MSDS is on file for applicable containers of hazardous chemicals used or stored in the facility; 2)all applicable containers of hazardous chemica"

No written program/plan can address every conceivable situation, but a general plan of action can give the employee the tools they need to make timely and effective decisions. The Emergency Response Plan is updated whenever a required change is needed and reviewed at least once a calendar year to ensure it is current/up-to-date.
