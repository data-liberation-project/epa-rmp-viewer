The resin facility consists of three chemical process:  a resin manufacturing process that was originally constructed in 1959, a formaldehyde manufacturing process constructed in 1980 and a Spray-dry process constructed in 1995.  Overall, the facility employs 73 full-time employees.\n\n\n\nGP is committed to operating the Conway, North Carolina plant in a manner that is safe for its workers, the public, and the environment.  As part of this commitment, GP has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility.  One component of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the Conway Plant and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements:  Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMP Plan) describing the risk management program at the Conway Plant.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMP Plan requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at the Conway Plant.\n\n\n\nThe risk management program at the Conway Plant consists of the following three elements:\n\n\n\n- A hazard assessment to help understand (a) the potential offsite consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and (b) accidents that have occurred during the last five years associated with the use of substances regulated by the RMP rule (regulated substances).\n\n- A prevention program to help maintain and safely operate the processes containing more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance (covered processes).\n\n- An emergency response program to help respond to accidental releases of regulated substances from covered processes\n\n\n\nInformation further describing the"

In fact, the Conway Plant has a comprehensive safety program in place establishing many levels of safeguards against release of a hazardous substance and injuries and damage from a release of a hazardous substance.\n\n\n\nGP limits the use of hazardous substances.  Before using a hazardous substance at the Conway Plant, less hazardous alternatives are considered.  When a hazardous substance is used at the Conway Plant, GP considers the potential for this substance to adversely affect plant workers, the public, and the environment and takes steps to prevent any such effects.\n\n\n\nGP prevents releases of the hazardous substances used at the facility.  When a hazardous substance is used at the Conway Plant, the equipment is carefully designed, built and operated to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release.  Industry and government standards are closely adhered to in the design, construction, and operation of the equipment. \n\n\n\nGP limits damage from a release, if such a release occurs.  GP trains its workers to respond to an accidental release, reducing the consequences of a release if it occurs.  In addition, GP works with the local fire department and with the local emergency planning committee (LEPC) to help prevent injuries and/or environmental damage if a release does occur.\n\n\n\nThe safety program at the Conway Plant consists of a number of elements, only some of which are required by the RMP rule.  This RMP Plan is primarily intended to describe those parts of the safety program at the Conway Plant that are required by the RMP rule.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nGP is committed to the safety of workers and the public, and the preservation of the environment, through the preven"

These controls include training programs for personnel, programs to help ensure safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of processes at the Conway Plant; and programs to evaluate the hazards at the plant.\n\n\n\nIn the event of an accidental release, the Conway Plant controls and contains the release in a manner that will be safe for workers and will prevent injury to the public and the environment.  GP provides response training to its personnel, designates an emergency response coordinator to oversee response activities, and coordinates response efforts with the local fire department.  Response activities have also been discussed with the LEPC and the Conway Volunteer Fire Department.  \n\n\n\nIn order to effectively implement these policies, GP established a management system headed by the Plant Safety Committee Chairman / Process Safety Coordinator to oversee safety-related activities.\n\nRegulated Substances:\n\nThe Conway Plant handles two regulated substances in sufficient quantity to be covered by the RMP rule.  These two materials are Formaldehyde & Ammonia.  \n\n\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis:\n\nThe Conway Plant performed an offsite consequence analysis to estimate the potential for an accidental release of a regulated substance to affect the public or the environment.  The offsite consequence analysis evaluates a worst case release scenario and an alternative release scenario.  GP does not expect a worst case release scenario to ever occur.  The alternative release scenarios were selected to help the LEPC improve the community emergency response plan.  An alternative release scenario represents a release that (1) might occur at a facility like the Conway Plant and (2) would result in the greatest potential offsite consequences if the release occurred.\n\n\n\nThe main objective of performing the offsite conse"

The following effects could occur at the endpoint distance.  At distances less than the endpoint distance, the effects would be greater; at distances greater than the endpoint distance, the effects would be less.\n\n\n\nWhen considering the release of a toxic substance, most people at the endpoint distance would be able to walk away from the exposure without any long term health consequences, although some short term consequences (e.g., strong eye or throat irritation) are possible.  Some people who are particularly susceptible to the substance released could be incapacitated.\n\n\n\nThe RMP rule includes specific requirements for the worst-case and alternative release scenarios that must be reported by GP.  These requirements are:\n\n\n\n-One worst case release scenario in Program 3\n\n-One alternative release scenario for each of the toxic substances in a Program 3\n\n\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis:  The OCA was conducted in accordance with 40 CFR, Part 68, Subpart B.  The OCA is summarized in Section 2-5 of the RMP Registration.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nSince 1993, the Conway Plant has used a prevention program to help prevent accidental releases of hazardous substances.  Beginning in 1994, the plant formalized this prevention program for the formaldehyde manufacturing and storage process to comply with the 14 elements of the OSHA process safety management (PSM) prevention program.  In 1996, the EPA RMP rule established one level of prevention requirements that apply to this facility:\n\n\n\nProgram 3 is essentially the same as OSHA PSM, except that the program also focuses on protecting the public and the environment\n\n\n\nThe following sections briefly describe the elements of the Conway Plant's Program 3 prevention programs that address EPA's RMP rule prevention progra"

      "SummaryText": "'s fire prevention and protection requirements in 29 CFR 1910.252(a) and created a Hot Work Permit Form to comply with these requirements.  Personnel who are to perform hot work are required to fill out the Hot Work Permit Form.  The Shift Supervisor reviews the completed form before work can begin.  Training in the use of the Hot Work Permit Form is included in the plant's safe work practices orientation.\n\n\n\n\n\nContractors\n\nThe Conway Plant established a program to help ensure that contractor activities at the plant are performed in a safe manner.  The program reviews the safety record of all contractors to help ensure that the plant only hires contractors who can safely perform the desired job tasks.  The plant explains to the contract supervisors the hazards of the process on which they and their employees will work, the plant's safe work practices, and the plant's emergency response procedures.  The plant requires that the contractor supervisors' train each of their employees who will work at the plant before that worker begins work at the plant site.  The plant annually reviews contractors' training documents and work performance to help ensure that safe practices are followed.  Each Contractor receives a yearly evaluation or at the conclusion of a big project from Georgia-Pacific personnel\n\n\n\nChemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nIn addition to the required prevention program elements, the Conway Plant has implemented safety features specific to the hazardous substances used at the plant.  The following paragraphs describe some of these features.\n\n\n\nAqueous ammonia-Industry standards are followed at the plant to help ensure safe handling of aqueous ammonia.  The ammonia vendor supplies aqueous ammonia via a Department of Transportation (DOT) approved tank truck and follows DOT standards when loading the aqueous ammonia storage tank.  The storage tank design and construction are consistent with American National Standards Institute (ANSI) standards.  Workers who p"

The storage tank is surrounded by a concrete dike which is large enough to contain 100% of the volume of the tank should its entire contents be spilled.  When the tank is filled, a vapor balancing system is utilized which reduces ammonia vapors by 98%.\n\n\n\nFormaldehyde solution-Industry standards are followed at the plant to help ensure safe handling of formaldehyde.  Most of the formaldehyde stored in the plant's storage vessels is piped directly from the formaldehyde plant.  However, to make-up for shortfalls in formaldehyde production, some formaldehyde is delivered to the plant from other GP facilities or Suppliers using GP trucks or common carriers.  The formaldehyde vendor supplies formaldehyde solution via a DOT approved tank truck and follows DOT standards when loading the formaldehyde storage tank(s).  The storage tank(s) design and construction are consistent with ANSI standards.  Workers who perform operations involving formaldehyde receive training emphasizing safe handling procedures for formaldehyde developed by the plant.  The storage tank(s) is surrounded by a concrete dike and adjacent cement basin, which are large enough to contain 100% of the volume of the tank should its entire contents be spilled.  All air emissions from the storage tank(s) are directed to an oxidizer which destroys >98% of the vapors.\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nThe plant has completed a review of the five-year accident history and based on this review the Conway Facility has had no accidents meeting this criterion during this time frame.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Programs\n\nThe Conway Plant has established a written emergency response program to help safely respond to accidental releases of hazardous substances.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for the following:\n\n\n\n- Informing the local fire department and the public about accidental rele"

All plant personnel are trained in evacuation procedures.  The plant periodically conducts emergency response drills, which are coordinated with the local fire department.  The written emergency response plan complies with other federal contingency plan regulations (e.g., the OSHA regulations 29 CFR 1910.38(a), 29 CFR 1910.120(a)) and has communicated to local emergency response officials through the local fire department.  The plant maintains a regular dialogue with the local fire chief, and the plant provides appropriate information to the fire chief.  A copy of the plant's Emergency Response Plan is maintained in the Resin Plant Control Room, Environmental Files Office and in the PSM Coordinator's office. A secure electronic copy is also located on PI in the EMS.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety \n\nThe Conway Plant constantly strives to improve the safety of the processes at the facility through both the incident investigation program and a program soliciting safety suggestions from the workers.  The following changes to improve process safety are planned or have recently been completed.\n\n-?Annual assessments of the PSM and Safety& Health Programs conducted by the Regional Safety & Health Manager\n\n- Utilization of the TRAX System for tracking & investigating safety requests, Near Misses and PSM Incidents all to completion.  Continuous Safety Auditing conducted by the Plant Supervisors\n\n-?Updated Safe Work Permitting process, that drives structured"
