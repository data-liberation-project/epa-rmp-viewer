The following effects could occur at the endpoint distance.  At distances less than the endpoint distance, the effects would be greater; at distances greater than the endpoint distance, the effects would be less.\r\n\r\nWhen considering the release of a toxic substance, most people at the endpoint distance would be able to walk away from the exposure without any long-term health consequences, although some short-term consequences (e.g., strong eye or throat irritation) are possible.  Some people who are particularly susceptible to the substance released could be incapacitated.\r\n\r\nThe RMP rule includes specific requirements for the worst-case and alternative release scenarios that must be reported by BAKELITE.  These requirements are:\r\n\r\n-One worst case release scenario in Program 3\r\n-One alternative release scenario for each of the toxic substances in a Program 3\r\n\r\nOffsite Consequence Analysis:  The OCA was conducted in accordance with 40 CFR, Part 68, Subpart B.

The resin facility consists of three chemical process:  a resin manufacturing process that was originally constructed in 1959, a formaldehyde manufacturing process constructed in 1980 and a Spray-dry process constructed in 1995.  Overall, the facility employs 73 full-time employees.\r\n\r\nBAKELITE is committed to operating the Conway, North Carolina plant in a manner that is safe for its workers, the public, and the environment.  As part of this commitment, BAKELITE has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility.  One component of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the Conway Plant and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements:  Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMP Plan) describing the risk management program at the Conway Plant.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMP Plan requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at the Conway Plant.\r\n\r\nThe risk management program at the Conway Plant consists of the following three elements:\r\n\r\n- A hazard assessment to help understand (a) the potential offsite consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and (b) accidents that have occurred during the last five years associated with the use of substances regulated by the RMP rule (regulated substances).\r\n- A prevention program to help maintain and safely operate the processes containing more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance (covered processes).\r\n- An emergency response program to help respond to accidental releases of regulated substances from covered processes\r\n\r\nInformation further desc"
