Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy at Birdseye Foods Brockport.\n  \n    This is to inform all interested persons, including associates that Brockport Birds Eye Foods is complying with OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard called (Process Safety Management or PSM), Title 29 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 1910.119, EPA's Risk Management Program Regulation called (RMP), Title 40 CFR Part 68, managing the risks involved with the storage, handling, and processing of hazardous chemicals. Our compliance program promotes overall plant, worker, and public safety.  Our program enables this facility to minimize the occurance, and consequences, of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents. Overall, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, illesses, and avoid physical property damage. \n   Our Safety programs are applicable to any activity involving hazardous chemicals including their use, storage, handling, or the on site movement of such chemicals. Any group of vessels which are interconnected, and separate vessels which are located such that a hazardous chemical could be involved in a potential release shall be considered a single process.\n   Our Safety programs minimize accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices that govern individual processes, activites, or pieces of equipment. These programs are detailed and improved as necessary. They are communicated to and accepted by all associates at the facility.\n\nII.  Regulated Substances Handled  1 - ( Anhydrous Ammonia)     \n\n  The ammonia refrigeration process at the facility consists of various pumps, compressors, and condensers that are used to change the state of ammonia from a gas to a liquid. This occurs in a closed system. The system's operation is similar to a household refrigerator, though on a much larger scale. The total ammonia inventory on site is 35,000 pounds. The ammonia "

General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical - Specific Prevention Steps.\n\n  The General accident program and ammonia -specific prevention steps was developed as required and complies with OHSA PSM Standard 29 CFR 1910.119 and EPA  RMP  Program Regulations 40 CFR Part 68. Facility accident prevention program(s) and procedures(s) are as follows:\n\nGeneral:\n\n  Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Standard Operating Procedures, Training, Mechanical Integrity Program, Management of Change Program, Pre-startup Review, Compliance Audits, Incident Investigation, Employee Participation, Hot Work Permit, Contractor Qualification Program, Contractor Safety Program, and Contractor Facility Safety Review.\n\nSpecific Chemical (Anhydrous Ammonia):\n\n   Daily visual inspection of the entire system to include piping, evaporators, vessels, compressors, condensers, liquid pumps, liquid receiver level, and proper operation of entire overall system. Checking for damage, cleanliness, metal integrity, proper operation, structural soundness.\n\n  Daily:  Compressor Check List\n\n  Weekly: Vessel and Evaporators Check List\n\n  Semi - Annual:  Pressure Relief Valves, High & Low Pressure Cut Out Safety Check List andf Condenser PM List.\n\n  Annual: Isolation Valve Check List, Solenoid Check List, Float Valve Check List, Oil Differential Pressure Cut-out Check List,\n              High Temperature Cut - Out Check List, Piping Check List, Liquid Ammonia Pump Check List.\n\n  Annual: Tear down and Rebuilding of all Ammonia Compressors and Liquid Ammonia Pumps.\n\nIV.  Five Year Facility History:\n\n  This facility has not had any accidents or releases with in the past five years.\n\nV.  Emergency Response Progam:\n\n  The emergency response program for Brockport is based on OSHA requirements for Emergency Action Plans (29 CFR 1910.38 and 1910.119) and HAZWOPER (29 CFR 1910.120).

This plan is coordinated with the Monroe County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and the Brockport Fire Department. We conduct annual drills onsite, and with other Birds Eye Facilities at their locations. We conduct these drills to practice our implementation of the facilities Emergency Response Plan, and to practice our coordination with our LEPC and our local fire department.\n\nVI.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\n  The Brockport facilities refrigeration system was first installed in about 1923.  We have several areas although running well some equipment and vessels are coming to the end of their useful life. We have every year since 1990 purchased new components to upgrade the refrigeration system and rid our system of old potentially unsafe equipment. Last year we replaced four small uncertified high pressure receivers with a single new larger receiver and eliminated several valves, piping connections and potential leak problems. This year we are presently replacing two of our old ammonia condensers with two new ones which  again will eliminate several older valves, solenoids, and old piping.  Our five year plan is to continue updating the older equipment which will continue to make the entire system simpler and safer.  We are not changing the process just updating equipment and components of the refrigeration system."
