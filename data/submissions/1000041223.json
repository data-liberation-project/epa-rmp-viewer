              "Description": "A prevention program is in place to minimize the risk of hazardous chemical releases in accordance with the Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29 CFR 1910.119) and the EPA Risk Management Program.  This prevention program covers those processes that handle HF, aqueous HCl, chlorine, and flammable substances (including vinylidene fluoride) above the threshold quantity of either the PSM or RMP rules.\n\n\n\nThe prevention program provides a structured approach to preventing accidents.  Some of the specific activities in the prevention program include:\n\n- In-depth process hazards analyses are completed every five years by qualified personnel using techniques approved under the OSHA PSM standards;\n\n- Written operating procedures (kept up-to-date) are used for training and directing the work of operators, who receive refresher training every three years;\n\n- Operators, mechanics, and contractor personnel are qualified, trained in the general hazards in the facility, and informed of any temporary situations affecting safety;\n\n- A safety work permit system assures that process work is done safely and properly;\n\n- A management system is in place to ensure that changes are managed safely;\n\n- Critical equipment is inspected on a planned, periodic basis to assure proper operating condition;\n\n- Pre-startup reviews are done to insure that conditions for safe operation have been satisfied prior to starting new or modified equipment;\n\n- Incidents are investigated and actions are taken as part of a continuous improvement effort; and\n\n- Routine audits are conducted to assure that safe practices are being followed.\n\n\n\nThis systematic approach to process safety involves employees and strives for continuing improvements in accident reduction.  The training, qualifications, and safety awareness of our operations, maintenance, and emergency response personnel are a key element in reducing and mitigating accidents.\n\n\n\nGeneral, yet extensive, measures through equipment and piping design and construction are in place that would prevent the developed scenarios for HF, aqueous HCl, chlorine, and vinylidene fluoride.  These measures include:\n\n- Storage tanks are pressure vessels that are designed and constructed in accordance with American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) pressure vessel standards using industry-standard materials of construction.  Furthermore, design specifications incorporate Zone 3 earthquake standards.\n\n- As part of the mechanical integrity program, pressure vessels and atmospheric storage tanks are inspected and tested according to the American Petroleum Institute Standard 510 and Standard 653, respectively.\n\n- The risk of overfilling is addressed by high level alarms and interlocks\n\n- The risk of over-pressure is prevented by a system of pressure relief valves vent headers.\n\n- Tanks are generally located in areas where no overhead construction is allowed or equipment is located that could fall and impact a tank.\n\n- Access to the facility is restricted through security barriers and trained security personnel, thereby minimizing the risk to the tanks of vehicular damage or sabotage.\n\n-Rail stops (or wheel chocks) to prevent movement of the car.\n\n\n\nAlso, there are certain chemical-specific measures in addition to these general measures:\n\n- Daily (HF) or per use (chlorine) hose inspections and tests with regular replacement.\n\n- Automatic valve in the pump discharge line that closes automatically when the pump shuts down to prevent backflow from the tanks (HF).\n\n- Extra heavy-walled piping and vessels (HF).\n\n- Materials of construction designed for specific service.\n\n",

      "SummaryText": "Introduction\n\nA Risk Management Program has been implemented at Arkema's Calvert City production facility for the reduction of accidental releases of hazardous materials.  This Risk Management Plan (RMP) summarizes the management, administrative, procedural, and technological controls that work together to minimize the risk to the community of hazardous chemical releases.  \n\n\n\nArkema Policies for Health, Environment, and Safety\n\nArkema's commitment to health, environment, and safety (HES) starts with the CEO.  Senior management routinely dedicates time to a review of HES matters.  This emphasis on safety is carried through to the facility level, where the plant manager, the HES manager, and the Plant Safety Committee regularly review safety performance, take corrective actions, and strive for continuous improvement.  The success of Arkema's HES programs is also reflected by a strong commitment to safety by employees and contractors.\n\n\n\nFacility Identification and Regulated Substances in Covered Processes\n\nThe Arkema Calvert City facility, a wholly-owned contiguous facility of Arkema Inc., is located at 4444 Industrial Parkway, Calvert City, Kentucky.  As such it is considered a single stationary source requiring one RMP submittal.  The facility manufactures refrigerants by continuous chemical reaction and purification processes in three operating units (designated as K-97, K-98 and F-134a) and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) plastic resin through a combination of continuous (monomer) and batch (polymerization) processes.  In addition, the company operates an AHF storage facility and a hazardous waste incinerator.  Certain substances used and produced within these operating units are regulated under 40 CFR Part 68, the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) Rule.  The substances that are present at or above the minimum threshold for RMP applicability are hydrogen fluoride (HF), chlorine, aqueous hydrogen chloride (HCl), and vinylidene fluoride (R-1132a).

      "SummaryText": "re used as raw materials in the production of refrigerant gases.  Aqueous hydrogen chloride is a co-product of the refrigerant process, producing a 36% HCl solution.  Vinylidene fluoride is both a product for off-site sale and a reactant in a polymerization process.\n\n\n\nIt is possible, due to brief process upsets, for a production unit to produce hydrochloric acid at a strength of greater than 37% and collect it in a short-term storage (shift) tank.  Because the plant HCl production specification requires acid strengths between 35.21 and 36.9%, plant procedures require that any off-specification acid will be disposed of or diluted to meet specifications before packaging.  As such, aqueous HCl will be included as predictive reporting.\n\n\n\nHydrogen fluoride is shipped to the facility in railcars and off-loaded into three storage tanks.  In addition to the normal inventory of HF railcars kept in at the plant, it is possible that production interruptions may allow additional railcars of HF to accumulate in the plant before the supply can be interrupted.  These railcars can account up to 7.4 million pounds of additional HF inventory.  As a precautionary notification, Arkema has included in this submittal a quantity equal to the maximum number of railcars that could be expected on site at any one time.  \n\n\n\nLiquid chlorine is transferred from a railcar to a storage tank in the F-134a area, where it is distributed throughout the plant.  Normally a railcar is ordered when one car is unloaded, using a production forecast to determine when a car should be needed.  It is possible, however, that a production interruption could allow a car to arrive in the plant before the storage tank has enough room to allow the car to be unloaded, increasing the plant's overall inventory.  This submittal predicatively assumes that the storage tank contains 130,000 pounds of chlorine (normally the tank is below 20,000 pounds before a car is unloaded) and a full 90-ton railcar is onsite.\n\n\n\nMonom"

The predictive assumption used for the inventory was that of the 20 trailers in service, 15 would be filled and onsite, along with the storage capacity within the process.\n\n\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenarios\n\nA worst-case scenario has been prepared for each covered chemical in each operating unit.  From these, the largest toxic release footprint for each material was determined and submitted as the worst-case scenario for that chemical.  Where releases occurred of mixtures containing toxic materials, the weight percentage of the toxic material is listed in the submittal, but the release rate and quantity is reported as pure toxic material.\n\n\n\nThe Calvert City facility uses urban terrain for its modeling in RMPComp.  The number of structures in the process areas, the surrounding forested area, three nearby industrial facilities, and the hilly terrain would tend to cause better dispersion than that predicated by the flat, open terrain described by rural.\n\n\n\nThe multiple layers of existing preventive measures make it very unlikely that a significant release will occur.  In addition, in the unlikely event that a release occurs, Arkema uses an array of mitigation measures to reduce any potential impacts.  Passive mitigation systems include diking to limit the spread of and the release impact of HF and chlorine.\n\n\n\nActive mitigation systems cannot be considered in modeling worst-case scenario impacts, but the significant investment that Arkema has made in active mitigation measures should effectively reduce the impact associated with an RMP incident.  These include:\n\n- HF and aqueous HCl could be pumped from a damaged tank into another storage tank to reduce the amount potentially released, while chlorine could be nitrogen-padded to a separate dump tank.\n\n- Diking systems are provided with an open drain to a trench with a pumping system that can be manually activated to contain and colle"

A single alternate release scenario for each covered chemical in every operating unit was selected, using a combination of furthest impact, historical plant experience, and a common scenario (drain valve left open during startup).  Where releases occurred of mixtures containing toxic materials, the weight percentage of the toxic material is listed in the submittal, but the release rate and quantity is reported as pure toxic material.\n\n\n\nWhile the alternative release scenarios are, by definition, more likely than the worst-case scenario, they are still very unlikely given the facility's prevention program.  With the exception of diking and local detectors, no credit was given for mitigative measures, giving the most conservative results.  However, if a release should occur, Arkema has an array of passive and active mitigation measures to reduce any potential impacts.  Examples of mitigation measures that would lessen the impacts of the alternative release scenarios are listed below.\n\n\n\nHF\n\n- HF unloading is conducted under strict supervision.
