      "SummaryText": " treatment process control systems. \nChlorine is an EPA and OSHA-listed toxic chemical.  It is an irritant and it is corrosive.  Chlorine is a halogen with the formula Cl2.  It is a chlorinating or oxidizing agent that is not flammable.  It has a 1 ppm OSHA ceiling Permissible Exposure Limit (PEL) and a NFPA health rating of 4, severe; with immediate and delayed health hazards.  Chlorine is not a carcinogen.\nThe maximum threshold quantity stored on site is 24 one ton containers.  This equals 48,000 pounds.\n\n2.    HAZARD ASSESSMENT\nA hazard assessment was performed to determine the effects a release would have on the public. For chlorine, the distance to a set endpoint concentration of the gas would travel must be determined.  In addition, an estimate of the population that could be affected by a release of chlorine was determined, and sensitive receptors such as hospitals, schools, and nursing homes were identified. The hazard assessment considers two release scenarios-a \"worst case\" and an \"alternative case\" and also compiles the five-year accident history for the WTP chlorine system.\nTwo offsite consequence analyses were conducted which include two chlorine release scenarios.  The first is a A?worst case releaseA?.  The second is a more probable A?alternative release scenarioA?.  The first scenario is defined by EPA, which states that A?the operator shall assume that the maximum quantity in the largest vessel is released as a gas over 10 minutesA? due to an unspecified failure.  The alternative scenario is defined as A?more likely to occur than the worst-case scenarioA?.\nAtmospheric dispersion modeling was performed to determine the distance traveled by the chlorine released before its concentration decreases to the A?toxic endpoint.A?  The EPA specified endpoint for chlorine is 0.0087 mg/l which equals 3 ppm. The 3 ppm endpoint is the Emergency Response Planning Guideline Level 2 (ERPG-2).  This is defined by the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) as the"

WORST CASE   (C) (1)\nAtmospheric dispersion modeling for the worst case scenario was performed using the EPA assumptions and EPAA?s RMP Comp Program.  Results demonstrate a distance to the toxic endpoint of 1.3 miles containing 5.3 square miles of area assuming an urban topography without an enclosure.  The residential population that could potentially be affected by the release is ___ individual based on the U. S. Census 2000 demographic data.  There is one residence and industry included in that release area.  However, there are ___ residences within the radius. The population data is maintained in the Plant's PSI.\n\n2.2.    ALTERNATIVE CASE   (C) (2)\nThe alternative release scenario involves the failure of the regulator of the pressure system or the wip on pipes/valves connected to one of the one-ton containers.  This failure was defined during the recent Process Hazards Analysis.  This failure is equal to creating a 0.03 square inch hole in the wip tube, a pipe, or even the container itself.  Modeling using the EPA/RMP Comp and EPAA?s water guidance demonstrated the rate of chlorine release is 200.0 lb. /minutes for a period of 60 minutes releasing a total of 2,000 pounds of chlorine.  The toxic endpoint distances determined is 0.30 miles and is in the process safety information.  The residential population that would be impacted by this release is ____ and is recorded in the process safety information.  Receptors in this area were identified as ___ adjacent to the plant.
