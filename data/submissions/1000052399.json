The Brady Geothermal facility actively manages all operational permits and safety programs such as Nevada Department of Environmental Protection Air Quality, Chemical Accident Prevention Program, Underground Injection Control as well as OSHA's Process Safety Management. In addition, Ormat is ISO 14000 and 9001 certified and undergoes several audit processes to ensure all facilities are aggressively pursuing the highest quality, safety and environmental standards. Ormat is committed to handling the n-pentane systems in a safe manner to protect the environment. Copies of emergency response, process hazard analyses, Chemical Accident Prevention Program and process safety management plans and all technical drawing (P&IDS) for process equipment are maintained onsite for reference.\r\n\r\nFacility Description \r\nThe Brady Geothermal Power Plant is wholly owned by Brady Power Partner's. The Brady Geothermal facility is located in Churchill County. The physical plant is located at 7042 Old Highway 40, east of Fernley, Nevada. The leased acreage covers the defined geothermal resource area and receptive injection zones.\r\n\r\nBrady consists of 3 steam powered turbines and one O.E.C (Ormat Energy Converter) each steam turbine puts out approximately 9 MW maximum (gross), and the O.E.C. puts out approximately 7 MW gross. Spent geothermal fluid is injected back into the subsurface reservoir via two injection wells.\r\n\r\nThe Brady Power Plant is operated by Ormat's Western Nevada Operations Group. The WNV-Operations Group (WNVOPS) is comprised of management, administration, maintenance, engineering and operations personnel. WNOPS operate the Western Nevada power generation facilities owned or operated by Ormat.\r\nBrady is a remotely operated facility. Remote opera"

On site staff will typically consist of one plant operator, two maintenance personnel and two electrical personnel which are shared between the Desert Peak II facility and the Brady facility. Additional operational, maintenance, management and administrative support will be provided to the Brady facility from the Steamboat Complex located in Reno, NV. The Desert Brady facility will operate continuously 24 hours a day and 365 days of the year(excluding scheduled maintenance downtime or plant upsets). \r\n\r\nRegulated Substance Handled\r\n\r\nBrady Geothermal Power Plant stores n-pentane (CAS # 109-66-0) as the motive fluid used in the Ormat Energy Converter (OEC) units. In accordance with 29 CFR 1910.119 the use of n-pentane as a process or motive fluid in a quantity greater than 10,000 lbs requires the establishment of a PSMP, CAPP and RMP. The total projected amount of n-pentane to be stored on site is 68,750 pounds. \r\n \r\nWorst Case Scenario: Worst case scenario assessment has been made and potential off-site consequence analysis (OCA) was undertaken. However, in conformance with Office of Emergency Management guidance, the OCA for worst-case and/or alternative release scenario(s) has not been included in this Executive Summary because of security concerns.\r\n\r\nSafe Work Practices: Safe work practices have been developed and implemented to provide for the control of hazards during work activities such as lock out/tag-out, confined space entry, opening process equipment or piping, and control over entrance into a facility by maintenance, contractor, laboratory or other support personnel. These safe work practices apply to both employees and contractors.\r\n\r\nMaintenance Procedures: A Mechanical Integrity Program (MIP) has been developed for the Brady facility.

Refresher training for all personnel shall be conducted annually at a minimum.\r\n\r\nSafety Training: Some equipment at the Brady Power Plant poses potential fire, explosion, and electrical hazards that could cause serious personal injuries and costly property damage if safety procedures are not followed correctly. Safety training, conducted monthly and required of all employees, identifies the different hazards to be found on the sites. These subjects include Emergency Action Plan (EAP), motive fluid hazards, fire prevention and hot work, lock out and tag out procedures, hazard communication, confined space, hearing conservation, personal protective equipment, accident, injury and incident reporting. Safety training is supplemented by the use of the Standard Safety Procedures.\r\n\r\nn-Pentane system: Deviation from the design limits of operation for the n-pentane transfer system will not normally occur since the individual components are rated beyond the highest achievable values of pressure, temperature, and flow within the system.\r\n \r\nOEC Units: The OEC units are controlled and monitored by their own dedicated HMI Programmable Logic Controller (PLC).

Each pressure relief valve relieves directly to atmosphere, and some installations have extension pipes installed to direct the relief valve discharge away from critical machinery. Additionally, each pressure relief valve is installed immediately above a rupture disk designed to fail at the relief pressure of its corresponding relief valve. Individual relief valve locations are equipped with \"telltale\" gauges in between the relief valve and its rupture disk to allow easy identification of leaking or blown rupture disks. \r\n\t\r\nVentilation System Design: All components of the n-pentane transfer and storage systems and the OEC units are located outdoors and well ventilated.\r\n\r\nSafety Systems: Beyond the relief system the Brady OEC units have extensive fire protection, detection, and alarming systems as well as an administrative control system aimed at fire prevention.\r\n\r\nThe fire detection systems include gas monitors which continuously monitor the area surrounding the OEC's, and ultraviolet/infrared flame detectors throughout the plant. The facility has a fire water system setup in a continuous loop around the generating units and within reach of the n-pentane storage tank.

The Control Room Operator assumes initial communications with site over emergency situations until relieved by either the Plant Manager or Operations Manager.\r\nEmergency Response Personnel: Fire, police, and/or ambulance crews will be called as necessary.  The senior employee on site at the time of the incident will give a report to the person in charge of the emergency teams.  This report will include currently known causes and effects, reports of injured personnel and their locations, etc.  All other employees are instructed to stay clear unless specifically requested to assist in some manner.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nThe plant has been operating safely for many years and Ormat will continue to ensure extensive training is provided to the operators as they are essential to plant safety. In addition, Ormat will continue to evaluate any new mitigation or control technology that may improve safety at the Brady Geothermal Power Plant."
