The program in place covers all aspects of OSHA's CFR 1910.\n\nIRPS has a program for employees covering lockout tag-out and Personnel Protective Clothing (PPE), PPE testing emergency response training, and confined space training. Yearly inspections are performed on all aspects of the process.\n\nFacility Description and Regulated Substance\n\nIRPS is a refrigerated warehouse that uses anhydrous ammonia for the refrigerant. It is located on Pier 3 of Virginia International Terminals at 8791 Hampton Blvd., Norfolk, Virginia 23505. The warehouse, which was completed in 1997, is a 100,000 square feet facility designed to freeze and store frozen commodities for export. \n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system has a capacity of 2059 tons and is a two stage recirculated system consisting of three high stage compressors, one single stage compressor, and three booster compressors. It utilizes roof top evaporative condensers.\n\nWorst Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nThe worst case scenario is the high-pressure receiver, which can hold up to 7365 pounds of anhydrous ammonia. If this vessel was damaged and all 7365 pounds released over a 10 minute period (the required assumption by the Risk "

There is no passive mitigation system to mitigate the release of gas.\n\nAn Alternate Release Scenario, which is more likely, would be a pipe leak that could leak approximately 150 pounds of anhydrous ammonia within a 10-minute period. A toxic endpoint level of 200 PPM is 0.04 miles from the release point as calculated by the OCA Guidance Analysis. There are no residences that will be affected by the alternative release.\n\nThe facility was designed so that material-handling equipment would not be able to accidentally damage ammonia piping. The facility is controlled by a computer system that can assist in reducing the quantity of ammonia released. The computer system can be controlled from off-site also.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe engineers have been trained to follow the PSM program guidelines established for this facility. Employees participate in regular safety meetings, safety inspections, and annual training classes on ammonia safety.\n\nA preventative maintenance program and facility check lists provide routine inspection of the refrigeration system. An annual inspection following the International Association of Refrigerated Warehouses (IIAR) guidelines is performed on the equipment. The facility design incorporated good safety practices for ammonia refrigeration.\n\n5 Year Accident History\n\n There have been no accidental releases at this facility in the past 5 years.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe Emergency Response Program includes coordination with the local LEPC and the City of Norfolk Department of Fire & Paramedical Services. The facility is located on the property of Virginia International Terminals. Alarm Systems are connected to Virginia International Terminals Security System.\n\nThe facility engineers have received the 24 hour Emergency Responder Training and receive"

A training program has been put in place to inform and provide additional information to employees about company safety programs. Our insurance company provides regular inspections of our equipment. Infrared scans of all electrical switch gear and fire protection systems are performed semi-annually.\n\nThe facility has been designed and constructed in accordance with current good safety practices and procedures.
