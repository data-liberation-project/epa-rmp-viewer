These Regulations deal with the risk involved with the storage, handling, and processing of hazardous chemicals.   In complying this way, we promote overall facility, employee, and public safety. Valleydale's program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence of, and minimize the consequences of, significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents.   Overall, these programs are in place to prevent the potential for accidental injury, illness, death, and to avoid the potential for property and environmental damage.\n\nValleydale's safety programs are applied to all activities involving hazardous chemicals including use, storage, handling, or the on-site movement of chemicals. Any group of vessels interconnected and separate vessels, which are located such that a hazardous chemical could be involved in a potential release, shall be considered a single process.     \n\nValleydale's safety programs prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and best practices which govern processes, activities, and or pieces of equipment. These rules are detailed and revised as necessary. All information is communicated to employees of Valleydale through training and documentation. \n\nValleydale Foods, Inc. is a pork processing and packaging company which utilizes approximately 20,000 pounds of Anhydrous Ammonia in its refrigeration system to cool the facility's production and shipping area's.\n\nIn a Worst Case Scenario, failure of the high pressure receiver containing 2,690 gallons of ammonia, under"

The release would travel up to 1.4 miles before no longer posing a significant hazard to the public. However, this scenario is highly unlikely for the following reasons:\n\nWorst case weather conditions are uncommon...\nThe vessel is in a protected area clear of vehicular and pedestrian traffic...\nIndustry standards for the construction and quality control of pressure vessels...\nSafety relief valves preventing over-pressurization of the vessel are in use\nAccident prevention programs in place...\nMechanical integrity program, inspection and testing procedures are in place\nEmergency alerting alarms integrated into the process system...\nEmergency response and action plans in place at the facility...\n\nIn an alternative case scenario, a mechanical pump seal deteriorating under pressure could release approximately 2,180 pounds of ammonia over a ten minute period before no longer posing a significant threat or hazard. The vapor could travel as far as .18 miles. Mechanical deterioration of an ammonia pump seal was chosen as an alternative release because of its higher likelihood that it could occur. This scenario even though potentially possible, is unlikely for the following reasons:\n\nEmergency shut-down procedures...\nRegular maintenance seal and valve upgrade...\nInspection and rounds made daily of the process system to ensure safe operation...\nEmergency response plan and refrigeration personnel on-site around the clock...\n\nValleydale's accidental release prevention program's are based on safe work practices as referenced by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, Environmental Protection Agency, American National Safety Standards, and the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration 2 - 1992.

The accidental release occurred in 1997 which consisted of approximately 200 pounds of ammonia being released from a pressure relief valve after the electricity was interrupted as a result of a severe thunderstorm. Due to this area-wide power outage, the receiver pressure increased as the ammonia heated.  One up-wind facility was evacuated as a precaution, and the system was brought back on line in approximately 20 minutes. There were no injuries, on or off-site. There have been no near misses in our 5-year history.  \n\nThe facility emergency response program is based on OSHA's Regulations for Emergency Action Plans (1910.38 and 1910.119) and HAZWOPER (29CFR1910.120).

This plan is coordinated with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), Fire Department, Police, and Emergency Medical facilities (EMF) to ensure communication with all potential or actual involved resources should their involvement be necessitated by a release.\n\nThrough Process Hazard Analysis, inspections, annual reviews, and audits, Valleydale continuously improves it's process system, procedures, programs, and training to ensure mitigation, control, technology, equipment, and organizational changes remain consistent and in force.
