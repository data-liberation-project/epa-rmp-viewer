      "SummaryText": "NEDAK Ethanol, LLC is located in North Central Nebraska.  NEDAK\u00c2\u00bfs Risk Management  program includes the Atkinson and the O\u00c2\u00bfNeill facilities.  The Atkinson facility is located on the east side of Atkinson, a town of around 1200 people.  The O\u00c2\u00bfNeill location is used only to load out rail cars.  The facility is located on the West side of O\u00c2\u00bfNeill, a town around 3,000 people.  NEDAK has developed three Risk Management Plans to preserve and protect the health of NEDAK \u00c2`s employees and to help prevent and plan for an accidental release and it\u00c2\u00bfs affects on the surrounding communities and environments.\n  \nA Risk Management Plan was developed for the Atkinson facility for the quantities of the Aqueous Ammonia.  NEDAK developed a worst case scenario with a release of the greatest amount held in a single vessel and the greatest amount of pipe.  Parameters include; the entire quantity of ammonia is released as a plume, the release occurred at ground level, temperatures were at 77 degrees and wind speed was less than 5 miles per hour.  The scenario assumed that there was a failure of the tank and the containment building that houses the tank and the containment area immediately around the tank. Under this scenario a large portion of the city of Atkinson would be affected by this release.  \nAn alternate scenario with the Ammonia was developed involving a puncture in the tank inside the storage building resulting in a leak 2 inches in diameter.  Exposure would be limited to only those within the storage building and immediate surrounding area.  \nA Risk Management Plan was developed for the Atkinson facility for the quantities of the Pentane solution.  NEDAK developed a worst case scenario with a release of the greatest amount held in a single vessel and the greatest amount of pipe.  Parameters include the entire quantity of a denaturant tank is released as a flammable vapor cloud, the release occurred at ground level, temperatures were at 77 degrees and wind speed was less t"

Under this scenario the south east corner of the City of Atkinson would be affected by this release as well as the Elkhorn River.  \n \nAn alternate scenario with the Pentane solution was developed involving a sheered pipe connection creating a pool and flammable fumes evaporating from the pool for 10 minutes.  The vapors are ignited forming a pool fire.   Exposure would be limited to only those within the immediate vicinity of the incident. \n \nThe berm area around the storage tank is located outside and is built to withstand a liquid release of 110% of product from the largest tank.  The ethanol storage tanks are 540,000 gallons and the denaturant tank is 90,000 gallons.  Under the worst case scenario, assuming the denaturant tank is at capacity, the berm area would more than hold any product eliminating any release onto the land or nearby Elkhorn River.  The product would also contain 2.5% pentane at the most. A flammable vapor could be saturated with water and contained in this area for added protection to the surrounding citizens.

A pool was created and it was assumed flammable vapor fumes evaporate from the pool.  The vapors ignite forming a pool fire.  The pool is contained within the spill trays and some of the material is spilled onto the surrounding gravel and porous sand. However, the spill trays do spill back into the main berm area that holds the storage tank which would allow a limited pool to form. \n   \nAs with the Atkinson facility, the berm area around the storage tank is located outside and is built to withstand a liquid release of 110% of product.  The ethanol storage tank holds approximately 993,000 gallons.

The site has a locked gate and is not occupied continuously.  When occupied, employees verify integrity of the tanks and routine maintenance is conducted to assure proper working order. \n \nEach facility complies with their appropriate air construction permit as issued by the Nebraska Department of Environmental Quality.  Due to the physical locations of each plant, accounting for their actual distance to the towns, air releases would generally not affect many citizens of the towns.  \n\nNEDAK has organized various walk through\u00c2\u00bfs and drills with each towns associated emergency services.  Within the last two months the Atkinson facility conducted a release drill with the local emergency response services.  The drill depicted a spill of a pentane product with the potential for a fire.  The drill was presented as a surprise event to both the fire department and NEDAK employees, but was coordinated by management from NEDAK and the Atkinson Fire Department.  Both entities acted according to the training they had been given.  NEDAK is committed to the involvement between local responders and the company.  \n\nNEDAK will continue to train their employees on all emergency situations.  NEDAK is committed to protect the health of its employees and to help prevent and plan for an accidental release and it\u00c2\u00bfs affects on the surrounding communities and environments."
