In the event of a release while the facility is unmanned, the off-site alarm company will notify the P&O Chief Engineer.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nA review into the accident history of the facility revealed that there have been no reportable releases of ammonia over the past five years (June 1999 - June 2004.)\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe facility has an Emergency Action Plan (plan) in effect at the facility.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:  \n\n? Save lives;\n? Minimize and avoid injuries;\n? Protect the environment; and\n? Minimize property damage.\n\nFacility personnel will respond to an ammonia release at the facility which poses a health or safety threat, the Plan provides the notification procedures and evacuation routes for emergencies that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year to ensure compliance with the PSM, RMP, and CalARP regulations.  Facility personnel receive annual training regarding the emergency procedures.\n\n PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nPrior to the system being filled with ammonia, the refrigeration system was thoroughly examined for safety hazards by way of a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA).  The PHA of the refrigeration system consisted of a:\n\n? Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) study;\n? Series of safety checklists; and\n? Facility inspection.\n\nThe mitigation measures include additional training, key maintenance-related tests/inspection, and reviewing emergency response issues including wind sock locations, posting of maps, and conducting drills with facility personnel following startup.\n\n\nThis technical assessment was conducted to fulf"

      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\nThe facility uses ammonia as a refrigerant within a closed system.  Ammonia is a hazardous substance that must be handled properly in order to prevent accidental releases and injuries.  It is the policy of all P&O Cold Logistics facilities located in California, to conduct all operations (including the ammonia refrigeration system) in a safe manner.  This policy extends to all employees and contractors at the facility.  P&O implements this policy towards chemical and general safety through on-going employee participation, training, written operating procedures, maintenance, inspections, safety committee meetings, and safety reviews/evaluations.  These programs are in effect at the facility to prevent the accidental release of ammonia.  In the event of an ammonia accident, the facility has an Emergency Action Plan to notify the appropriate authorities and safely evacuate the facility.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nP&O Cold Logistics is located at 3420 E  Vernon Ave in the city of Vernon ,California The area immediately surrounding the facility is commercial.\n\nThe primary business of P&O Cold Logistics is to provide refrigerated warehousing and storage for various food products.  In order to conduct operations, the facility maintains a refrigeration system containing approximately 17,200 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, a regulated substance.  The refrigeration system, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, and then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for dock operations, cooler/freezer storage, and glycol underfloor heating.  Typical operating conditions range from vacuum 0 psig on the low pressure side of the system to 130 psig on the high side of the system.  \n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nIn order to operate the ammonia ref"

The following summarizes the key compliance programs that have been implemented by P&O Cold Logistics to prevent the accidental release of ammonia from the facility.  The Operating Procedures program ensures that the ammonia system is operated in a safe manner.  The Training program ensures that personnel fully understand how to perform their jobs in a safe manner.  The Mechanical Integrity program ensures that the ammonia system is in proper working condition based upon routine testing, inspections, and maintenance according to manufacturer's specifications and industry standards.  The Management of Change program ensures that process modifications are implemented in a safe manner.  The Pre-Startup Safety Review program ensures that adequate safety measures are in place before ammonia is introduced into a process.  The Hot Work Permit program ensures that P&O\u00bfs employees and contractors perform hot work (e.g. welding) in a safe manner.  The Contractor Safety program ensures that contractors understand the hazards of ammonia and must take specified precautions to safely complete job requirements.\n\nIt is important to note that the refrigeration system has been designed with several safety features to prevent the accidental release of ammonia.  For example, the compressors are equipped with safety mechanisms that will cause the units to shut down if operating conditions exceed designated safety limits.  Also, level indicators, alarms, and switches are installed in key points within the system to monitor the supply of liquid ammonia and to ensure that a vessel is not overfilled.  The facility has also installed a"
