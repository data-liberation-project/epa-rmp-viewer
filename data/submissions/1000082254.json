This facility treats municipal wastewater and has a permitted capacity of 1.225 mgd. Chlorine is used at the facility for disinfection of wastewater. There have been no chlorine incidents in the most recent five-year history period.\n\n\n\nIn 1995, a Process Safety Management (PSM) program was initiated at the Plant using a consulting organization. A PSM Compliance Manual was developed for the site. Key items included in the manual were:\n\n\n\no    Written site specific procedures for Employee Involvement, Management of Change, Incident Investigation, Pre-Startup Reviews and Self Audits.\n\n\n\no     Chlorine safety information as required by the regulations\n\n\n\no     Standard Operating Procedures for chlorine management\n\n\n\no    Chlorine system maintenance procedures \n\n\n\no    Training on PSM and its key components including Management of Change, Mechanical Integrity and Incident Investigation.\n\n\n\no    Conducting  Process Hazards Analyses for the three chlorine processes\n\n\n\no    Developing an initial Emergency Response Plan \n\n\n\no    Training in support of the certification of operators\n\n          \n\nIn addition to RMP/PSM compliance, the plant has implemented a number of programs to improve the safe handling of chlorine and other chemicals.\n\n\n\no    A new chlorine system was designed and installed to extensively use a vacuum to transfer chlorine. The vacuum process has proven to greatly reduce leaks by reducing the amount of equipment that is exposed to pressurized chlorine.\n\n\n\no       A new chlorine leak detection system was installed in January 2012 and has been integrated into our SCADA system that was installed in September 2012.\n\n\n\no    Plant inventories are being restricted to (2) full cylinders(4,000 lbs total) of chlorine"

The County LEPC and other local response organizations have been incorporated into the ERP. The services of a Hazmat Team to provide hazardous materials response has been obtained. Where necessary, communication plans have been developed to residences that may be impacted by a release. Chlorine Response Drills are being routinely conducted.\n\n\n\nAt the Wastewater Plant, there are safety meetings to review an OSHA subject or discuss a safety issue. Routine training is conducted for topics such as:\n\n\n\n- Hazard Communications\n\n\n\n-Personal Protective Equipment\n\n\n\n-Lockout/Tagged\n\n\n\n-Confined Space\n\n\n\nAs a result of our programs, the plant has an excellent safety record. There have been no reportable chlorine releases from the plant.  \n\n"
