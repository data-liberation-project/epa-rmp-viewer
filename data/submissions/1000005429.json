Bruce Buxton General Manager\nRe: RMP-Executive Summary\nDate: 06/08/2009\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention / Emergency Response Plan \n Farmers Cooperative Company Shell Rock, Iowa\n\nThis facility complies with ANSI Standard K-61.1-1995 requirements for Anhydrous Ammonia storage. Farmers Cooperative Company owns this fertilizer facility, and it is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state and local laws. If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to immediately notify the Shell Rock Fire Department (with a 911 call) and request that it respond to the emergency. Incidental to the notification to the fire department, a call to the Butler County, Iowa LEPC will be made. \n\nWhile we have planned for an emergency, it is acknowledged that a real emergency will be unexpected and may very well be much different and cannot be ensured to duplicate what may have been planned. In reality, the situation that develops may not happen in the manner in which it has been planned. In that event, what has been planned will serve only as a guideline to follow.\n\nThe Emergency Action Plan for this facility describes certain procedures that are intended to minimize the hazards associated with human health and the environment from fires, explosions, the sudden and unexpected release of chemicals (i.e. anhydrous ammonia), tornadoes, bomb threats or other accidents or acts of God which might occur on our premises. \n\nThe primary emergency coordinator for Shell Rock, Iowa location is Bruce Buxton, general manager, Sherwin Smith ,Location Manager and Marv Orth, agronomy manager, Kent Morgan Safety Coordinator. Their work phone, 24 hr. phone and cell phone numbers are provided in the registration section of this document. \nIn addition, the following individuals (with associated work and 24hr. emergency response telephone numbers) are to be contacted in order:\n\nName:        Work Number:    24 hr.

The anhydrous ammonia that is stored at this facility is distributed to agricultural corn producers in the surrounding area who utilize anhydrous ammonia as a crop nutrient.\n\n   The anhydrous ammonia plant is only operated on a seasonal basis (spring and late fall). At maximum, the plant operates a total of three months a year. \n\n\nSince this facility is located in a relatively close proximity to the town of Shell Rock, provisions have been designed to notify all affected persons and evacuate the area using the local police and firemenA?s force.\nGeneral Accidental release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:\n\nThis facility complies with EPAA?s  accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations. The anhydrous ammonia system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with ANSI StandardK-61.1 1995 and State law.\n\nAccident History:\nFarmers Cooperative Company has never had an accident involving ammonia that caused death, permanent injury, property or environmental damage, or evacuations. \n\nEmergency Response Program:\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving our anhydrous ammonia plant, it is our policy to notify the Shell Rock Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency. (We have one volunteer firemen who work here at the Cooperative.) They would in turn call the Haz-Mat team in Waterloo. We have visited with the fire department about this policy. \n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\nThe plan is to minimize those hazards to human health and to the environment that are associated with accidental releases of anhy"

Employees working at the bulk storage plant make routine observations prior to and during transfer operations of the anhydrous ammonia from the storage vessel to nurse tanks. In so doing, they are able to detect any problems that should be fixed. \nThis routine inspection helps identifies any portion of the system which may be under stress or about to fail. Repairs can be made before they become a problem. In addition the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship performs regular inspection of this facility. Employees are trained annually to recognize the hazards associated with storage handling of anhydrous ammonia. In addition to annual training for employees who have been on the job for a number of years, the company conducts training for new hires. This training includes classroom instruction and a written test. It is our policy to start a new hire with and order employee in the beginning. It is our policy to replace all safety relief valves, fittings, and hoses in accordance with the law. The Farmers Cooperative Company maintains a written log that shows a record of any maintenance performed on all anhydrous ammonia equipment."
