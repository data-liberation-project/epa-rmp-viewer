      "SummaryText": "Source and Process Description.\n\nThe main operation at New Orleans Cold Storage is the warehousing and distribution of frozen bulk foodstuff.  The facility consists of several cold storage rooms that are cooled by a main refrigeration system.  An additional blast unit is used to maintain one room at very low temperatures (-30 degrees F.)\n\nBoth refrigeration units utilize Anhydrous Ammonia (100% conc.) as the system coolant.  The main refrigeration unit has a maximum capacity of 10,000 pounds of ammonia.  The blast unit has a maximum capacity of 7,000 pounds.  At this facility, both systems are independent.\n\nSummary of Major Hazards.\n\nThe primary hazard associated with a release of Anhydrous Ammonia is exposure of persons and sensitive environmental areas to toxic levels of ammonia vapor.  Anhydrous Ammonia is a toxic gas that is also a corrosive irritant to eyes, skin, respiratory tract and mucous membranes.  Contact of evaporating liquid with skin will freeze the tissue, then produce a caustic burn.  However, the burn hazard should be considered secondary to the toxic effects from exposure to the gas.\n\nThe toxic endpoint for Anhydrous Ammonia has been determined to be 200 parts per million (ppm).  It is defined as the concentration that almost all persons can withstand for one hour without permanent adverse effects.  However, aggravation of existing respiratory and skin diseases may occur at concentrations below the toxic endpoint.\n\nConsequences of Failure to Control the Hazards.\n\nAlthough the release of all the Anhydrous Ammonia (10,000 pounds) within a 10 minute period (considering a catastrophic failure of the main receiver) is extremely unlikely, these are the parameters used in the worst case scenario.  In this case, the toxic endpoint was calculated to be 0.9 miles.  Based on the population density of Orleans Parish (2751.6 persons/sq. mi.), the area within the toxic endpoint radius (2.54 sq. mi.) and the estimated percentage of that area that is residentia"

      "SummaryText": "l (20%), an estimated 1400 people reside within the vulnerable zone.  Several schools and hospitals are located within the vulnerable zone.\n\nThe alternative scenario is based on an actual incident at another facility at which approximately 2,500 pounds of ammonia was released into a cold storage room.  In this alternative scenario, 3,000 pounds of ammonia is released within 30 minutes.  The toxic endpoint is calculated to be 0.1 miles.  At this distance, the residential population is essentially zero.  \n\nThere are no designated environmental management areas within the worst case vulnerable zone, however, the local zoo and adjacent park is within the vulnerable zone.\n\nExplanation of How Releases are Prevented\n\nThe primary mitigation system for this facility is the Engine Room enclosure.  Although a catastrophic release would have ample opportunity to be vented to the atmosphere, the engine room enclosure would provide a significant degree of isolation in the more likely release scenario.   An active countermeasure to any leaks or releases is the ammonia sensors in the engine room.  If ammonia is detected, an audible alarm is immediately sounded within the warehouse and an alert is sent to a 24 hour/day monitoring service.\n\nOther process controls include automatic cut-off devices in the event of deviation from prescribed limits (pressure, temperature, process level, etc.), check valves and relief valves.\n\nTo further reduce the likelihood of an accidental release, an extensive inspection program has been established for all system components and operating parameters.

These reviews provide a means for continuous improvement.\n\nAs an example, in response to a recommendation from an incident investigation report from another facility, two sets of impervious body suits and self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) are positioned at all NOCS facilities.  All engineers are trained in the use of this equipment as an enhanced way of personnel rescue, release response and rapid control.\n\nResponse Action in the Event of a Release.\n\nUpon initial discovery of a leak or release, whether by sensor and alarm or personnel, a rapid and decisive response is critical to minimizing the potential impacts to off-site populations and other sensitive areas.  As noted above, on-site control and mitigation, along with personnel evacuation and accountability, is coupled with a rapid notification plan to bring in local and state agencies for assistance in the event the local population may potentially be affected.\nS1FACILITY|RMP*Submit|1.1.7|F|Nashville Ave. Wharf Facility|New Orleans Cold Storage||100000143882|||008162380||Nashville Avenue Wharf||New Orleans|LA|70115||071|295454.0|-0900735.0|I1|CE|New Orleans Cold Storage & Warehous|5048954826|Nashville Avenue Wharf||New Orleans|LA|70115||Gary Escoffier|President|Ricky Calligan|Warehouse Manager|5048954826|5046168889|||5048954826|www.nocs.com|Orleans Parish LEPC|25|Y|Y|||||Never had one|||||||\nS1PROCESS|1165|3||Refrigerated Storage\nS1PROCESSNAICS|1223|1165|49312\nS1PROCESSCHEMICAL|1494|1165|Ammonia (anhydrous)|7664-41-7|19000|\nS2TOXIC|1494|100|c|EPA's RMP*Comp(TM)|b|10000|1000|10.0|1.5|F|a|0.90|1400|Y|Y|Y||Y|Y|Audubon Zoo & Park||||Audubon Zoo"

The facility consists of several cold storage rooms that are cooled by a main refrigeration system.  An additional blast unit is used to maintain one room at very low temperatures (-30 degrees F.)\n\nBoth refrigeration units utilize Anhydrous Ammonia (100% conc.) as the system coolant.  The main refrigeration unit has a maximum capacity of 10,000 pounds of ammonia.  The blast unit has a maximum capacity of 7,000 pounds.  At this facility, both systems are independent.\n\nSummary of Major Hazards.\n\nThe primary hazard associated with a release of Anhydrous Ammonia is exposure of persons and sensitive environmental areas to toxic levels of ammonia vapor.  Anhydrous Ammonia is a toxic gas that is also a corrosive irritant to eyes, skin, respiratory tract and mucous membranes.  Contact of evaporating liquid with skin will freeze the tissue, then produce a caustic burn.  However, the burn hazard should be considered secondary to the toxic effects from exposure to the gas.\n\nThe toxic endpoint for Anhydrous Ammonia has been determined to be 200 parts per million (ppm).  It is"

      "SummaryText": "defined as the concentration that almost all persons can withstand for one hour without permanent adverse effects.  However, aggravation of existing respiratory and skin diseases may occur at concentrations below the toxic endpoint.\n\nConsequences of Failure to Control the Hazards.\n\nAlthough the release of all the Anhydrous Ammonia (10,000 pounds) within a 10 minute period (considering a catastrophic failure of the main receiver) is extremely unlikely, these are the parameters used in the worst case scenario.  In this case, the toxic endpoint was calculated to be 0.9 miles.  Based on the population density of Orleans Parish (2751.6 persons/sq. mi.), the area within the toxic endpoint radius (2.54 sq. mi.) and the estimated percentage of that area that is residential (20%), an estimated 1400 people reside within the vulnerable zone.  Several schools and hospitals are located within the vulnerable zone.\n\nThe alternative scenario is based on an actual incident at another facility at which approximately 2,500 pounds of ammonia was released into a cold storage room.  In this alternative scenario, 3,000 pounds of ammonia is released within 30 minutes.  The toxic endpoint is calculated to be 0.1 miles.  At this distance, the residential population is essentially zero.  \n\nThere are no designated environmental management areas within the worst case vulnerable zone, however, the local zoo and adjacent park is within the vulnerable zone.\n\nExplanation of How Releases are Prevented\n\nThe primary mitigation system for this facility is the Engine Room enclosure.  Although a catastrophic release would have ample opportunity to be vented to the atmosphere, the engine room enclosure would provide a significant degree of isolation in the more likely release scenario.   An active countermeasure to any leaks or releases is the ammonia sensors in the engine room.  If ammonia is detected, an audible alarm is immediately sounded within the warehouse and an alert is sent to a 24 hour/day moni"
