      "SummaryText": "Like most food manufacturing facilties, we use anhydrous\n\nammonia in our refrigeration system. Ammonia is the best refrigerant \n\navailable for our use.  Because of its moderate toxicity and slight flammability, \n\nammonia is considered a hazardous material.\n\n\n\nGiorgio Foods is committed to maintaining a safe manufacturing operation\n\nfor our employees and the surrounding community. Our refrigeration system \n\nobeys our local building and fire codes, as well as industry-consensus codes\n\nand standards where appropriate.  In accordance with the Federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration (29 CFR 1910.119) and Environmental Protection Agency (40 CFR 68).  The system has a total of 16,149 lbs of anhydrous ammonia.  With this input, the RMP*Comp output is 888 lb/min for 10 minutes.  The quantity of the release therefore is 8880 lbs for the worst case scenario for the exercise.  \n\n\n\nOur priority is to prevent accidental releases of hazardous materials instead of\n\nmerely responding to problems.  Our RMP program includes\n\nelements addressing:\n\n- Employee Participation: We involve our employees at all appropriate\n\npoints in our program. A copy of the policy is posted on the employee awareness bulletin board.\n\n- Process Safety Information: We maintain information relating to the\n\nsafety of ammonia and the refrigeration system design so\n\nthat our employees are fully informed. This is reviewed periodically.\n\n- Process Hazards Analysis: We conduct detailed studies of our\n\nrefrigeration system to identify the\n\nimportant hazards and safeguards. The HAZOP methodology was used to conduct this review.\n\n- Operating Procedures: We provide written operating procedures to\n\nhelp our staff stay within the safe operating limits of the\n\nrefrigeration equipment.\n\n- Mechanical Integrity (Maintenance and Quality Control): We have established a\n\ncomprehensive program of inspections and preventive maintenance to\n\nkeep mechanical failures from occurring. Compliance with this program is audit"

This knowledge is conveyed to the workers on the lines.\n\n- Management of Change: Alterations to the refrigeration system are\n\nscreened to verify that they are within the original safe design\n\nlimits.\n\n- Pre-Startup Safety Review: For certain types of major changes, we\n\nconduct a formal safety review before startup to ensure that the new\n\nequipment has been designed and installed properly.\n\n- Contractors: We carefully screen contractors who work on our\n\nproperty to ensure that they have a safe work record.\n\n- Hot Work Permits: We strictly control welding and other work that\n\ncould start a fire near the ammonia equipment.\n\n- Emergency Response: We coordinate our response to emergencies\n\nwith the local Fire Department.\n\n- Incident Investigation: After an incident, we investigate to\n\ndetermine the causes and any suitable actions to address them.\n\n- Compliance Audits: Every 3 years, we examine the\n\nsafety program in detail to identify areas for improvement.\n\n- Trade Secrets: OSHA and EPA require us to maintain a trade secrets\n\nprogram in case confidential information affecting the safety of the\n\nammonia refrigeration system is ever found.\n\n- Management System: An overall management system monitors the ongoing\n\nprogress of safety items.\n\n\n\nThrough our RMP program, Giorgio Foods looks continuously\n\nfor possible ammonia refrigeration system changes to improve safety in our facility."
