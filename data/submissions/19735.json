All refrigeration employees and numerous supervisors are trained in the 24 hour HAZMAT course to respond to accidental releases.  All refrigeration maintenance personnel go through training on all the SOP's from the PSM program.  These procedures are reviewed yearly to help insure that all problems are corrected.  All refrigeration maintenance personnel are currently scheduled to go through ammonia refrigeration school to teach them the operations and safety.  The school is located in Garden City, Kansas and is part of the local community college.  The preventative maintenance program is periodically reviewed and updated as the monitoring and repair on equipment is performed.  This process has been of great benefit to the plant in finding problems in a timely manner.\n\nThe Monfort, Inc. plant in Garden City, Kansas, is a beef slaughter and processing facility.  The plant is defined by the EPA as a \"Complex Slaughter\" facility.  Final products produced include: meat products, edible tallow, inedible tallow, dried blood, meat and bone meal, and brined hides.  The regulated substance used at this facility that meets threshold quantities is anhydrous ammonia.  Ammonia is used as a manufacturing aid in the refrigeration process.  Refrigeration is used in processing and storing of the meat and meat products.  The total calculated amount of anhydrous ammonia in the facility is equal to 222,308 pounds.  This combined total is the result of equipment and piping in two separate systems within the plant.\n\nThe worse case scenario for this facility is a rupture in intermediate vessel (accumulator) resulting in a loss of the entire contents of 70,320 pounds of ammonia.  This loss will occur within 10 minutes and the spilled liquid will vaporize at room temperature releasing gas to the building envelope and to the"

The American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) has determined that the maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals can be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms which could impair an individual's ability to take protective action for anhydrous ammonia is 200 parts per million (ppm).  Under the worse-case weather conditions with dispersion into an urban area, the distance that the release would travel before it no longer causes a health threat is 4700 meters (2.92 miles).  The result of a release of this amount is very unlikely because of the protection of the equipment and the safety measures in place at the plant.\n\nThe more likely scenario or alternative toxic release of ammonia is the result of the rupture or failure of a relief valve.  This would result in the loss of 2,000 pounds of ammonia within a 60 minute period of time.  The likelyhood of a release of this magnitued is low because of the PSM and safety measures in the plant.\n\nThe Monfort, Inc. facility is in compliance with all OSHA PSM regulations and this RMP rule requirements.  The procedural and managerial steps that are in place are a preventative measure to accidental release prevention as well as maintenance and training programs that are in place.\n\nThere have been no releases at this facility in the past five years that have resulted in death, injuries, or property damage on site or in death, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage offsite.\n\nThe Monfort, Inc. facility has an emergency response plan on file with the local emergency planning committee (LEPC).
