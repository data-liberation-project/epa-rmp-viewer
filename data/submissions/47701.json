Brenntag Great Lakes, LLC is part of Brenntag North America Inc.  Brenntag Great Lakes, LLC is an advanced distribution company providing customers worldwide with products, chemicals and advanced materials.  Our major operations are located in the Midwest and employ approximately 240 people.\n\nThe Brenntag Great Lakes, LLC (Brenntag) facility, located in Wauwatosa Wisconsin, is a chemical warehousing and distribution facility with an NAICS code of 42469.  Two of the chemicals handled at the facility trigger RMP threshold values.  These chemicals include Toluene Diisocyanate \u00bf Mixed Isomers (TDI) and Epichlorohydrin (EPI).  The TDI storage process was previously reported to be a Program Level 1 process.  EPI is being reported in this Risk Management Plan submittal as a Program Level 2 process.  A release of EPI has been determined to be the worst-case release scenario.  An alternative release scenario is also included in this submittal for EPI.\n\nIt is the worldwide policy of Brenntag to design, blend and distribute its products, and to manage those products throughout their life cycle in a manner that protects the environment and safeguards employees, customers, and the public from unacceptable risk.  This facility participates in the Responsible Distribution Process program of the National Association of Chemical Distributors.  The Distribution Process program brings chemical distribution plants and local communities together through communication and cooperative emergency planning.  It is our company policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local regulations. \n\nBrenntag safety programs are designed to prevent fires, explosions, and accidental chemical releases.  The program requires safety audits, inspection, maintenance programs, and safety training for employees and contract workers.  Facility"
