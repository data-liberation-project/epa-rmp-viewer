It is also designed to transfer ammonia by truck, rail, pipeline, or barge.\r\n  \r\nThe ammonia stored is used primarily as an agricultural nitrogen fertilizer.  Ammonia is received by refrigerated barge through a pipeline from a riverport dock to the terminal, by pressurized rail containers, and may be received by pressurized truck containers.  \r\n\r\nThe maximum inventory of 36,000 tons is contained in two low temperature, low pressure storage tanks; a 20,000 ton and a 16,000 ton tank.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3.0\tGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL - SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nThe Lemm Corporation has developed an OSHA PSM program for the T/A Terminal ammonia terminal. At T/A Terminal, ammonia falls under the RMP Program 3 Prevention Program, which is identical to the OSHA PSM program. EPA has said that if the process is in compliance with OSHA PSM, then it is compliance with RMP Program 3. Thus, T/A Terminal ammonia PSM has been reviewed and determined to be complete for the RMP document. \r\n\r\n4.0\tFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nThere has been no reportable release from T/A Terminal in the last five years. \r\n\r\n5.0\tEMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\r\n\r\nAs mentioned previously, the T/A Terminal facility has developed an Emergency Action Plan. The response plan is a detailed document which discusses the role of employees and management in an emergency situation. The plan outlines specific procedures for evacuations for plant personnel. For all emergencies, the Facility Manager, has operating authority for emergency response at the site of release and assumes control of the incident scene beyond the first responder awareness level.\r\n\r\nThis document contains specific information regarding: contact numbers; emergency communication; incident team job descriptions; evacuation zones; emergency evacuation procedures; notification procedures; training; emergency shutdown procedu"

This document consists of the executive summary and registration data elements (68.155 through 68.185).\r\n\r\n1.0\tRELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\r\n\r\nThe Lemm Corporation (Lemm) operates an ammonia terminal, T/A Terminals, Inc. (T/A Terminals) located in Meredosia, Illinois.  The terminal stores anhydrous ammonia (ammonia) on site that requires protection as defined under the Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation and the Risk Management Plan (RMP) Threshold Quantity of 10,000 pounds (lbs.).  Lemm has implemented a PSM program to provide information to employees to deal with the risks involved with the storage, handling and processing of highly hazardous materials.  The program emphas the application of management controls and standard operating procedures when addressing the risks associated with handling or working near highly hazardous chemicals.  Lemm has also implemented a RMP to document how a response to a release at T/A Terminals is conducted and the information to be provided to the emergency response agencies.  This submittal is the five year update as required by 40 CFR 68.190(b)(1).\r\n\r\nThe facility has implemented an Emergency Response Program to ensure the safety of its employees, the community, and the environment. This detailed emergency response program includes procedures for handling an emergency.   All of these components make the Emergency Action Plan a thorough and comprehensive plan for release prevention and emergency response. The emergency response policies at the T/A Terminal facility ensure that there is emergency response coverage 24 hours - 7 days per week. \r\n\r\nIn accordance with the 2004 amendment to the RMP regulations, the off-site consequence analyses (OCA) are not included in this executive summary.\r\n\r\n2.0\tPROCESS DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nThe termin"
