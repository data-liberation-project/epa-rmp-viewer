The last lost-time injury occurred on March 24, 2011.\r\n\r\n2.0\tPROCESSES AND SUBSTANCES SUBJECT TO 40 CFR PART 68\r\n\r\nGAC Chemical Corporation manufactures primarily inorganic chemicals at its Searsport, Maine, facility.  With regards to 40 CFR Part 68, anhydrous ammonia, agueous ammonia (> 20% concentration), and chlorine are handled and stored at quantities exceeding the threshold quantities.\r\n\r\nAnhydrous ammonia is used at the facility to produce aqueous ammonia and ammonium sulfate.  No anhydrous ammonia is shipped from the facility.\r\n\r\nThe anhydrous ammonia is received in 80 ton capacity rail cars.  It is unloaded in a closed system using a compressor to remove vapors from the larger storage vessel and pressurizing the rail car with this vapor.  The resultant differential pressure pushes the liquefied anhydrous ammonia to the storage vessel.  The maximum pressure in the anhydrous ammonia system during unloading and storage is 120 psig.  The operational pressure rating for the storage vessel is 250 psig.  The operating plan calls for two to four 80 ton rail cars of anhydrous ammonia at the plant at any one time.  Only one car will be in service at any time.\r\n\r\nTransfers of anhydrous ammonia from the larger storage vessel to either aqueous ammonia production or to the smaller vessel is via small transfer pumps.\r\n\r\nThe aqueous ammonia unit started production in May 1995.

      "SummaryText": "queous ammonia is produced by injecting a controlled volume of anhydrous ammonia in a re-circulating flow of unfinished aqueous ammonia.  The batch production process is continued until the desired concentration of ammonia in the solution is reached.  The maximum batch  (limited by the working capacity of the production tank) is approximately 9,000 gallons.  \r\n Finished aqueous ammonia is stored in a 28,400 gallons working capacity tank.  Both of the aqueous ammonia vessels are located in a common containment structure.\r\n\r\nAmmonium sulfate has been produced in Searsport since 1949.  A new modern production unit went into service in October 1992.  The older unit was shutdown in August of 1992.\r\n\r\nAnhydrous ammonia is supplied to the ammonium sulfate process as a vapor.  The smaller anhydrous ammonia tank is coupled with a small vaporizer.  The combined units are maintained at a constant level to permit steady-state vaporization of the ammonia.  The maximum pressure in this anhydrous system during ammonium sulfate production is 120 psig.  The operational pressure ratings for both the smaller storage vessel and the vaporizer are 250 psig each.\r\n\r\nNo regulated waste ammonia, anhydrous or aqueous, is generated by any handling or processing at the Searsport facility.  The conversion of the anhydrous ammonia in both processes is 100 percent.\r\n\r\nChlorine was used for the first time at the Searsport facility on January 17, 2002, with the startup of a Powell Continuous Bleach Plant.  The facility includes no permanent storage for chlorine.  Chlorine is supplied to the process directly from the rail cars.  The facility has capacity for many rail cars, but the operating plan calls for two to four 90 ton rail cars of chlorine at the plant at any one time.  Only one car will be in service at any time.\r\n\r\nChlorine is transferred to the production unit from the rail car in liquid form.  There are no intermediate storage vessels or vaporizer systems for chlorine.  The chlorine is 10"

      "SummaryText": "0 percent consumed in the production of sodium hypochlorite bleach solution.  Chlorine is not used in any other processes nor is it repackaged and shipped from the facility.\r\n\r\nThe chlorine is transferred to the process via a permanent pipeline with flexible hoses for attachment to the rail car valves.  The transfer process is accomplished using dry compressed air so that corrosion of the system is eliminated.  The pipeline is constructed of welded steel with a minimum of flanged or threaded joints.  All welds have been x-ray tested to assure the quality of the welded joints.  The maximum pressure in the chlorine system during unloading is 150 psig.  The pressure rating for the rail car is 375 psig.  The piping system has a pressure relief system utilizing rupture disks, rated at 300 psig, which relieve into expansion tanks.  Every section of pipe that can be isolated between two valves is fitted with a rupture disk/expansion tank system.  The tanks have both local pressure indication, as well as pressure switches which will be tied into the control and monitoring system. \r\n\r\nThe unloading system incorporates the Powell Unloading Valve Closure System.  Chlorine detectors are located in the vicinity of the rail car and a rail car movement detection system is attached to the car.  All devices are connected to a monitoring and control system that will issue warnings and/or alarms as appropriate.  For any failure or alarm condition, the Powell Unloading Valve Closure System will activate closing the rail car valves.  The unloading system has been designed to allow for the depressurization and complete purging of the chlorine from the chlorine pipeline via the Powell Prevent Scrubber System.\r\n\r\nIn the production of bleach, a controlled flow of chlorine is injected into a re-circulating flow of dilute caustic soda/bleach solution.  The chlorine is 100 percent consumed in the reaction to form the sodium hypochlorite bleach solution.  The bleach plant started production on"

      "SummaryText": "January 17, 2002.\r\n\r\nNo regulated waste chlorine or chlorine byproduct is generated by any handling or processing at the Searsport facility.\r\n\r\n3.0\tRELEASE SCENARIOS\r\n\r\nFour regulated processes exist at the facility.  They are as follows:\r\n\r\nProcess 1: Anhydrous ammonia receiving and storage; Process 2: Aqueous ammonia production and storage; Process 3: Ammonium sulfate production; Process 4: Chlorine receiving and handling.\r\n\r\nAll release scenarios were analyzed using RMP*Comp for the impact radius calculations and landview III for estimating the affected population within the impacted areas.\r\n\r\n4.0 \tPREVENTION PROGRAMS\r\nAll aspects of ammonia and chlorine handling and use at the facility are covered by a Process Safety Management Plan.  The standard operating procedures (SOPs) are reviewed and updated whenever an operational change is made.  If no operational changes are made, the SOPs are reviewed at least every 5 years and updated as necessary.\r\n\r\nMandatory training sessions are attended by all production and maintenance employees.  The subject include annual training of SOPs, hazards communication, fire safety, electrical safety, and pollution prevention.\r\n\r\nGAC supports a fully trained and equipped HAZMAT team to address incidents that may occur at the facility or in the transportation of product shipped from the facility.  Depending on the circumstances of an on-site or transportation incident, a contract responder such as Clean Harbors may be called for assistance.\r\n\r\n5.0 FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nThere have been no accidents in the past five years.\r\n\r\n6.0 EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN(ERP)\r\n\r\nThe ERP for the facility was first published in April 1991.  It is reviewed and updated on a regular basis.  The plan is coordinated with the Waldo County Emergency Management Agency and the Waldo County LEPC.  Copies have been supplied to the Maine Emergency Management Agency, the town of Searsport and the neighboring town of Stockton Springs.\r\n\r\n7.0 PLANS FOR IMPROVEME"
