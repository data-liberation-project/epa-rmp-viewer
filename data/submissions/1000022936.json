This stationary source / facility's accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates procedures and management practices. Applicable procedures of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Prevention Program are followed. The facility's emergency policy involves the preparation of plans tailored to the facility and to the emergency response services available in the community.\n\nThe facility spill prevention policy seeks to implement appropriate controls to prevent accidental releases of regulated flammable substances. In the event such a release occurs facility personnel are prepared to work with the local fire department, Local Emergency Planning Commission, and other authorities to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe Harley Dome HCDP Facility is located near the intersection of US Highway 6 and Book Cliffs Ridge Road in rural Grand County, Utah.  The facility processes up to 30 mmscf/d of natural gas for the extraction of Natural Gas Liquids (NGLs).  NGL is a flammable pressurized liquid mixture of aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons including regulated flammables ethane, propane, butane isobutane, isopentane and pentane. There are no threshold quantities of toxic substances present. This facility was designed and constructed in accord with applicable state and federal regulations.\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE AND PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe necessary steps have been taken to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements of 40 CFR part 68. This stationary source was designed and constructed in accord with applicable state and federal regulations and applicable good engineering practices. The following briefly d"

This information is updated when a change occurs that makes the information inaccurate. \n\nChemical specific information describing the chemical hazards associated with regulated substances is maintained e.g. material safety data sheets. For specific process areas, safety related limits for specific process parameters (e.g. temperature, pressure, level) are documented. Process controls and monitoring instruments, protective instrument systems and trained personnel are used to maintain the process within these limits.\n\nInformation about the design and construction of the process equipment is maintained and readily available. This information provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities as well as evaluating proposed changes to make sure that process safety features are not compromised.\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nA hazard review and safety inspections are conducted to identify and control hazards associated with the process and regulated substances including the potential equipment malfunction or human error and the safeguards needed to detect, control or prevent hazards, equipment malfunction and human error.

The procedures address deviation from operating parameters and actions to correct and to avoid deviations and equipment inspection. The procedures are readily accessible to operators involved with the process; and are updated, if necessary, upon a major change and before startup of a changed process.\n\n\nTraining\n\nAn operator training program is in place to train employees involved in the process. New employees receive basic training in process operations followed by on-the-job supervision until they are determined to be competent to work independently. Training in updated or new procedures is provided before process startup after a major change.  Refresher training is provided at least ever 3 years or more frequently if needed or requested.
