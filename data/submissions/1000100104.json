The plant uses chlorine to disinfect water to provide safe drinking water to the public. Treated water is distributed citywide for use in homes, industry and for firefighting purposes.\r\n\r\nThis facility collects its water from the Catawba River.  The water is treated through an alum flocculation process and disinfected via chlorination.  In the disinfection process, a chlorinator mixes chlorine gas with water to make a chlorine solution.  The treated water is allowed to mix with the chlorine solution in a contact chamber, killing pathogens that are dangerous to humans, animals and aquatic life that remain after flocculation treatment.\r\n\r\nChlorine is a regulated toxic chemical by 40 CFR Part 68, and therefore any process utilizing over 2,500 pounds of chlorine must implement Risk Management Plan (RMP) requirements.  The Belmont Water Treatment Plant stores a maximum of nine one-ton chlorine cylinders (approximately 18,000 pounds of chlorine) and is therefore subject to RMP requirements.  The storage of chlorine in this amount also makes the facility subject to OSHA's Process Safety Management requirements.\r\n\r\nThe worst case, toxic release scenario is a release of gas from a single 2,000 pound cylinder in ten minutes.  The alternative toxic release scenario is a slower release approximated as a leak evacuating a cylinder in a total of 100 minutes.  Again, this would involve a release of 2000 pounds, over a longer period of time.  These releases could affect local populations.\r\n\r\nTo prevent toxic releases of chlorine, the facility complies with the OSHA PSM standard.  All tenets of the Process Safety Management Program are included by reference into this RMP.\r\n\r\nAspects of the release prevention program include written operations procedures, inspections of equipment, employee training, automatic shutoff equipment, and a chlorine gas dete"

As a testament to these programs, the Belmont Water Treatment Plant has not had a chlorine release in the past five years.\r\n\r\nEmergency response to accidents and releases is coordinated with the Gaston County LEPC, Hazmat Team, and Belmont Fire Department.  In the event of a chlorine accident or release, facility personnel are trained to notify these authorities and evacuate the facility.  Trained response staff will evaluate the situation and make further decisions.\r\n\r\nThe City of Belmont is committed to operating all of its facilities in a safe and environmentally sound manner.  Compliance with these regulations is only a portion of the city's commitment."
