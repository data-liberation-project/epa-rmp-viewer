      "SummaryText": "The City of Albany, Texas (City) operates the 2.5 MGD Water Treatment Plant (WTP) which is located at 9895 South Highway 283 in Albany, Shackelford County, Texas.  The WTP produces potable water for the City of Albany, as well as for Fort Griffin Special Utility District. This facility is an ultra-filtration WTP. Chlorine gas is used in the disinfection process at the plant.  Up to 10,750 pounds of chlorine may be stored at the WTP.  Because the stored quantity of chlorine onsite exceeds the threshold quantity for chlorine (?68.130; Table 1), the City developed this Risk Management Plan (RMP).  The WTP is subject to Program 2 RMP requirements (?68.12(c)).  A Management System overseen by the City's Treatment Superintendent is implemented to ensure that the RMP and associated Prevention Program are implemented correctly and maintained up to date.  The City's accidental release prevention and emergency response policies include a commitment to safety and implementation of safe procedures to ensure accidental releases of chlorine gas are prevented.\n\n\n\nThe accidental release prevention program (Prevention Program) includes required elements of 40 CFR Part 68 such as safety information, hazard review, operating procedures, training, maintenance, compliance audits, and incident investigation.  Detailed documentation of each element of the Prevention Program is contained within the text of the RMP.  Operator training is key to the effectiveness of the Prevention Program.  The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) licensing program for water operators is used as a training tool, along with site-specific RMP training.  TCEQ licensing testing and on-site observation and demonstration are used to evaluate comprehension of all training materials.  Written operating procedures are used in conjunction with on-the-job training to ensure that certified WTP operators are proficient in performing their duties before being allowed to work with chlorine storage and feed syst"

      "SummaryText": "ems.  Certified WTP operators conduct daily inspections and any problems with the chlorine systems are corrected and documented.  In addition, the certified WTP operators ensure that the equipment used in the disinfection process is maintained according to the manufacturers' recommendations (?68.56(a)).  Because of these efforts, the WTP has not had a chlorine release that resulted in an injury, either on-site or off-site, within the previous five (5) years (?68.42(a)).  As part of the Program, the City will periodically perform compliance audits, hazard reviews and incident investigations, according to a predetermined schedule described in the RMP and as needs dictate. These compliance audits and hazard reviews document any planned changes to improve safety (?68.50 & ?68.58). \n\n\n\nThe WTP complies with the emergency response regulations per Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) 29 CFR ?1910.38, as well as with applicable standards set forth by the Chlorine Institute and the Texas Administrative Code. Coordination activities are conducted in accordance with ?68.93 with the first responders [the City of Albany Volunteer Fire Department] and Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) (Shackelford County Sheriff) at least annually, and more frequently if necessary.  The WTP is a non-responding Facility for emergency response.  The WTP operators are trained to notify the City's Volunteer Fire Department via call to 9-1-1 in the event of a release from the WTP.  The City of Albany's Fire Department serves as the first responder and coordinate the emergency response according to the county-wide Emergency Response Plan, including the evacuation of surrounding residents when required (?68.90(b)).\n\n\n\n"
