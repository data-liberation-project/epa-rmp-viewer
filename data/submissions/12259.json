If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the Saginaw Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.  Also, StyroChem has a contract agreement with Garner Environmental Services to respond in case of some specific types of releases.\n\n\nDescription of your facility and the regulated substances handled:  \nThis facility manufactures polystyrene resin and expandable polystyrene (EPS).  The EPS is used by customers to manufacturer expanded polystyrene foam products.  Pentane impregnation converts polystyrene beads into EPS.  The pentane system consists of one Triblend pentane storage tank, two normal pentane storage tanks, eight reactors, and associated pipes, valves, and other miscellaneous equipment.\n\n\nWorst-case release scenario:  \nPer EPA requirements, our worst-case scenario is a failure of the Triblend pentane storage tank resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  There are no schools, hospitals, churches, or parks within the distance to the endpoint.  There are other businesses and several residential buildings within the distance to the endpoint.  It should be noted that the worst-case scenario as defined in the regulation is a highly unlikely event for pentane.  The American Petroleum Institute studies demonstrate that the endpoint distance estimate can be overly conservative and misleading.\n\n\nAlternative release scenario:  \nOur alternative scenario is a pipe rupture resulting in a pool fire.\n\n\nGeneral accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:  \nThe facility will comply with EPA's accident prevention provisions, OSHA's process safety management rules, and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.  The pentane system is designed and maintained in accordance with good engineering practices.\n\n\nFive-year accident history:  \nThe five "

      "SummaryText": "year accident history was prepared in accordance with 68.42.  The accidents reported in the RMP data elements only include accidents related to a regulated chemical that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.  There was one accident in the past five years involving an EPS reactor explosion.  However, this accident did not have any listed consequences and is not reportable under EPA requirements.  \n\n\nEmergency response program:  \nIn the event of an emergency, it is our policy to notify the Saginaw Fire Department and Garner Environmental Services and request that they respond to the emergency.  We have discussed this policy with the fire department and LEPC representatives.  Minton facility has an emergency notification action plan and trains its employees in the appropriate procedures. \n\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety:  \nStyroChem has already implemented many elements of safe process management.  StyroChem believes that safety is a never-ending process.  We will continue to evaluate and improve safety for the life of the process."
