However, public receptors are considered as part of our overall Environmental Management System.\n\nBased on the nature of warehousing, the actual volume at the facility may be either greater than, or less than, the threshold level on any given day.  Based on a worst case scenario, the maximum that can be expected to be on site is 250,000 lbs (based on maximum propellant fill of 30% and our maximum storage capacity of 801,000 pounds of aerosol products), with the typical expected maximum amount to be closer to 50,000 (based on the typical propellant fill rate of 6%).\n\nThe regulated substance can be found throughout the facility, though the vast majority is stored in an \u00bfaerosol room\u00bf which was built to NFPA standards for aerosol warehousing.  Among the features built into this room are the use of \u00bfblast walls\u00bf to separate it from the main warehousing areas, fire doors that \u00bfautomatically\u00bf close in the event of a major fire; extra sprinkler system capacity.  In addition the sprinkler system is fed through an on-site water retention pond which is maintained at an appropriate level via rainfall and a pump system.  The retention pond is also connected to a hydrant which can be accessed by the fire department.  In addition, the retention pond is located close to the aerosol room providing a ready source of water for additional fire fighting operations.\n\nStorage of the substance outside of this room is limited to levels permitted by NFPA standards for \u00bfgeneral\u00bf warehouses and is done for the purpose of small order processing including less than pallet quantities and single case shipments.\n\nGeneral accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps\n\nPursuant to our accidental release prevention policy, there are two major components to our accidental release prevention program.\n\n  I.

Training in these procedures is company-wide and is both instructional (classroom based) and practical (drill based).\n\nFire\n\nIn the event of a fire involving or threatening to involve the regulated substance, the discovering associate determines if the fire is a \u00bfsmall\u00bf fire, or a \u00bflarge\u00bf fire.  If the associate determines it is a small fire, the associate responds by utilizing the appropriate fire extinguisher to put out the fire.  If the associate determines it is a \u00bflarge\u00bf fire, the associate implements our evacuation procedure and the local fire department is contacted.\n\nTraining associated with this emergency includes:\n\u00bf Fire size/risk evaluation\n\u00bf Evacuation procedures and routes of egress\n\u00bf Fire extinguisher type, application and use\n\nMaterial Release\n\nIn the event of a release of the regulated substance the discovering associate determines if the release is a minor or a major release.  If the associate determines it is a \u00bfminor\u00bf release, the immediate area of the release is evacuated and ventilated.   Following ventilation, associates perform clean-up activities while wearing appropriate safety equipment.  If the associate determines it is a \u00bfmajor\u00bf release, or that it appears that a \u00bfmajor\u00bf release is imminent the facility is evacuated and the local fire department is contacted.  It should be noted that the full release from a single container of the regulated substance would be considered a \u00bfminor\u00bf release, and any \u00bfmajor\u00bf release involving the regulated substance would require the release of the substance from a number of containers and may be expect to occur in the event of either a fire or a result of severe weather.\n\nTraining associated with this emergency includes:\n\u00bf Release size/risk evaluation\n\u00bf Evacuation procedures and routes of egress\n\u00bf Spill Clean-Up methods\n\nSevere Weather\n\nIn the event of severe weather, associate relocate to designated areas to wait out the severe wea"

The bulk of the operation is the movement of packaged goods from trucks, to racking and floor storage, and back to trucks.  Additional activities include the \u00bfbuilding of mixed pallets\u00bf and the processing of single case shipments.  No repackaging is done, except for the processing of damaged/returned materials.  Repackaging is limited to the boxing/re-boxing of containers and the transference of liquids from damaged containers to secure containers.\n\nThere is only one regulated substance stored at the facility at amounts approaching, or exceeding, the threshold levels listed in 40 CFR 68.  This is a flammable mixture containing both propane and isobutene.  This mixture is used as the propellant in a number of the aerosol products stored at the facility.  These products are typically brake parts and specialty cleaners, lubricating oils, paints, and polishes.  These products packaged in consumer size cans ranging from 4 oz to 20 oz and are packed in DOT 2P and/or 2Q cans and are packed 6 or 12 cans per shipping case.  As a result of this packaging, the distance to the endpoint of any single container release is less than 0.01 miles (53 ft).  This means that all release are expected to reach their endpoints prior to being released from the building proper so there are no expected public receptors to our operations regulated under"

In addition, the SST receives suggestions from associates which may also pertain to the storage and/or handling of the regulated substance.  \n\nThe second group is the Environmental Management System Team.  The primary focus of this group is minimizing the adverse environmental impacts of operations including how to prevent releases of materials.
