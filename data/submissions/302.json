The  NH3  Facility  Policy;\n\n       - The owners,  management, operators and employees of LaSalle Farmers Grain Company (LSFG)\nare committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of Anhydrous Ammonia.  If an accidental\nrelease should occur,  the facility is prepared to work with Madelia Vol. Fire Dept. and /or other authorities\nto mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to  people and the environment.\n\n\n   2.    Facility Information;\n\n       -The Primary activity at the facility is the storage , transfer and application  of fertilizers (specifically\nof concern ...Anhydrous Ammonia)  for sale to  farmers.\n\n       -Anhydrous Ammonia is received, stored , applied or distributed for / as a crop production nutient.\n\n       -the maximum quantity stored could be as high as 250,000 # in our Three 12000 gal & One 14000 gal\nstorage tanks and 200,000# in our Forty-Four 1000 gal  & Eleven  1450 gal nurse tanks.\n\n       -The maximum quantity handled would be the loading of 1450 gal nurse tank holding 6400# or the\nunloading of a 9500 gal transport holding 26000#.\n\n  3.   The Worst-Case Release scenerio and the Alternative Release scenerio.\n\n        a.  The  WORST-CASE release scenerio would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank \nreleased as a gas over 10 minutes.   The  maximum quantity released would be 62000#, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85  percent of capacity as limited by design standards.  The\ndistance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is  .89 miles ..\n\n        b.  The ALTERNATIVE release scenerio based on the five-year accident history (or the most likely\npotential incident) is a release from a rupture in a transfer hose. The distance to the"
