Facility accidental release and emergency response policy.\nThe management and employees of GRAINCO FS, Inc. are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.  The stationary source and the regulated substances handled.\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.\n\n3.  The accidential release prevention program.\nThis facility complies with EPA's Accidential Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.  This facility has implemented the provisions of Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1, published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc. as adopted by state regulation and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration(OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.\n\n4.  Five year accident history.\n1/6/2006 incident involved the release of 1 pound of anhydrous ammonia in a human error situation. Transport driver did not open the main valve, pressure built up and when valve was opened the the vapor line blew. Transport driver was NOT an employee of LaSalle County Farm Supply Co.
