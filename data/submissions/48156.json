We preforma thorough annual audit program and monitor facility compliance with the safety standards and overseen assistance with this speciality firm. The program consists of iternal audit utilizing checklists survey forms that are reviewded regularly and updated as necessary to ensure all applicable federal, state, and local regulations are covered. The checklists are used to measure regulatory compliance including those governing the safe handling and storage of anhydrous ammonia.

Anhydrous Ammonia is received by truck, is handled and stored on-site and is regulated substance by the EPA requireing us to comply with this Risk Management Program. We sell anhydrous ammonia to growers in nurse tanks manufactured to the requirements to do such. The customer applies the ammonia into the soil as a needed source of nitrogen fertilizers for crop production nurtrients.\n\nOur facility maintains 2 - 30,000 gallon stationary storage tanks on site.\n\nWORST CASE SCENARIO\n\nOur worst case scenario is the loss of the total contents of the 2-30,000 gallon storage tanks, when filled to the greatest amount allowed (85% capacity), released as a gas over 10 mins, resulting total vaporization. The maximum quanity released would be 140,000 pounds. According to DEGADIS modeling, the distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) would have off-site impact. It should be noted that our company has never had a total release of an entire storage tank.\n\nALTERNATE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nThe most common alternate release scenario from an anhydrous ammonia storage facility would not reach an endpoint off-site. The alternate release scenarion modeled for the purpose of this plan is a two-minute release from a stationary storage tank representing a valve and hose failure requring a manual shutdown. The total amount of anhydrous ammonia released in this scenario would be 12,000 pounds from a storage tank. The distance to the endpoint would have no impact.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELAESE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe ammonia storage system is designed, installed and maintained in accordance with ASTM standards and the ASME codes. This facility complies with the ANSI K61.1 standard ( 1989 edition), OSHA-29 CFR 1910.111, EPA's Accendetal Release Prevention Rule as well as all applicable federal, state, and local codes and regulations.\n\nOur ammonia system is protected from major release by intrenal excess f"

All the main storage tank valves and the risers are locked when not in use. Lighting for the facility has increased to discourge the increase in meth theft.\n\nOur anhydrous ammonia system is inspected on a regular basis with maintenance and preventitive maintenace scheduled and documented. Liquid and vapor valves, hoses, excess flow valves, guages, and relief valves are replaced when necessary and/or according to the guidelines within the ANSI standards.\n\nTraining is provided to all employess at least annually, whenever there is a change in the process or whenever completency with regulations are questioned. In accordance with the 1989 ANSI standards, training is also offered for all ammonia customers to attended on a regular basis and offered to the local fire department personnel during their annual tour of our facility and operations. These training courses consist of classroom lecture, current and approved videos or compact discs, testing both verbally and written, demstration and observation for each person working with the process that are certified while on-going job training is always improved upon.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIENT HISTORY\n\nThere has been no accidents involving anhydrous ammonia that has caused deaths, recordable injuries, property or environmental damage including evacuation on or off site.\n\nThe 'EMERGENCY RESPONSE AND CONTINGENCY PLAN'\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving our ammonia system, it is our policy to notify the local communtiy fire department and request that they respond to the emergency with the facility's personnel assistance.
