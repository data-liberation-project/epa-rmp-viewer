To assist with ongoing compliance, a \"Chemical Accident Prevention Compliance Manual\" has been prepared.  Concerning the emergency response policy at the facility, the owner has made the decision that employees will not respond to accidental releases of regulated substances and will instead evacuate.\r\n\r\nThis facility processes natural gas,  natural gas liquids (NGL) and oil from various wells.  High pressure gas from the wells are sent to a high pressure separator and subsequently routed to the gas plant.  The gas plant strips out NGL liquids which are stored in a single 15,000  gallon pressurized bullet tank operating at approximately 200 psig.  The NGL is removed from the facility by transfers to tank trucks.  Liquids separated from wellheads are routed to six (6) 400 BBL atmospheric stock tanks. The facility is subject to the RMP requirements because it exceeds threshold quantities of  regulated flammable substances. \r\n\r\nThe NGL is a mixture of hydrocarbons consisting of butane, 2,2 Dimethylpropane, ethane, isobutane, methane, propane, isopentane, and pentane.  For purposes of determining the largest weight on site, the highest density substance was used (isopentane).\r\n\r\nSince this facility is a Program 1, a documented prevention program is not required.  The operator is aware of the General Duty Clause in the Louisiana regulations (see Section 1.4 of the facilities \"Chemical Accident Prevention Compliance Program\" document) and accidental release prevention is a policy adopted by the operator.\r\n\r\nThe facility has not experienced a release as defined in the regulation within the past five years.  \r\n\r\nSince this facility is a Program 1, a written Emergency Response Plan is not required.  However, an Emergency Action Plan has been developed,  it is mantained by facility personnel, and these"
