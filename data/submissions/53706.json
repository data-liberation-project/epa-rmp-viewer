The facility produces various specialty gases and gas mixtures in an assortment of high pressure compressed gas cylinders.  There are two substances on site in a process (storage) at sufficient quantity to be covered by the New Jersey TCPA, namely fluorine (F2) and nitric oxide (NO), both stored in compressed gas cylinders.\n\nSpectra Gases is committed to safety and the protection of the environment both inside and outside of our fenceline.  To achieve safe operations, we have an extensive safety, health and environmental protection program that covers all aspects of our operations, including the safe storage of chemicals and cylinders.  Spectra Gases is covered by and complies with OSHA Process Safety Management.  We perform Process Hazard Analyses on new and existing chemical processes; we perform Job Hazard Analyses on work tasks and activities; and we conduct routine inspections of work areas to identify potential hazards.  We have operating procedures for our covered process activities, and all employees are trainined on the procedures that are applicable to their job.  We have an active Safety Committee consisting of employees from various departments. These covered process chemicals are stored in DOT specification cylinders and maintained per 49 CFR part 180 subpart C (Qualification, Maintenance and Use of Cylinders.)  As a result of this extensive program, we have not had a release from the covered process during the last five years.  \n\nSpectra Gases, Inc has an on-site Emergency Response (HazMat) Team for handling emergency situations that may arise at the Alpha facility, including but not limited to the covered process.  The team is made up of several employees who have completed extensive training, both internally and through outside agencies and training organizations, on how to respond to e"

      "SummaryText": "mergencies involving hazardous materials relevant to our facility.  Additionally, all employees on site are trained in the site Emergency Action Plan, which includes the appropriate actions (primarily alarm identification and subsequent evacuation) for each employee to take in the event of an incident.  Our Emergency Response program is coordinated with local authorities and agencies.\n\nSpectra Gases is continually striving to improve our safety performance, most importantly as it affects the covered process.  Recent improvements include the installation of additional cylinder support systems, additional lighting and gas detection monitors in the cylinder storage area.\n\nAlternative Release #1 clarification:\nSpectra Gases Alternative Scenario #1 (Fluorine): Slightly more likely to occur than valve shear is a breach of passivation layer leading to a fire with burn through of cylinder wall.  This could be initiated by extreme external fire or very strong mechanical impact to the cylinder. SGI has not experienced this with any cylinders in our covered process over our 25 year history. SGI technical experts have made the following determinations regarding a full F2 source cylinder:\n     The reaction in the cylinder prior to and during the leak will reduce the net quantity of Fluorine released by approximately 40%.\nThe remaining 60% = 2.82 lb of Fluorine would be available at time of cylinder breakthrough. Breakthrough will begin as a pinhole.  We are estimating  time to empty cylinder as 40 minutes at a leak rate of  0.07 lb/min.  RMP Submit data field does not allow entry of 0.07 lb/min.  It defaults to 0.1 lb/min.  RMP Submit data field does not allow entry of 2.82 lb release quantity.  It defaults to 3 lb total release.  Modeling in Aloha results in a toxic endpoint of 95 yards (0.05 miles.)  \n\nAlternative Release #2 clarification:\nSpectra Gases Alternative Release Scenario #2 is a scenario of valve damage to a cylinder of nitric oxide emptying the cylinder in 24 hours"

      "SummaryText": ".  SGI has not experienced this with any NO cylinder in our covered process since we started the NO product line approximately 4 years ago.  We estimate a leak rate of 0.0034 lb/minute with a release duration of 24 hours.  We estimate our Emergency Response Team would respond within 30 minutes and transfer the cylinder contents into a non-leaking cylinder.  A 30 minute leak at .0034 lb/min would release 0.1 lb of nitric oxide.  RMP Submit data field does not allow entry of .0034lb/min.  It defaults to 0.0 lb/min.  RMP Submit data field does not allow entry of 0.1 lb.  It defaults to 1 lb.  We used the following data for modeling in Aloha:  0.10 lb released at a release rate of 0.0034 lb/min for 30 minutes.  This results in a toxic endpoint of 13 yards (reported as 0.01 mile.)"
