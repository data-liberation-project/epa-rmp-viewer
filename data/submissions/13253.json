We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n *  A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulation\n *  A summary of results from our assessment of the potential offsite consequences from accidental chemical releases\n *  An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\n *  A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule\n *  An overview of our emergency response program\n *  An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment\n *  The certifications that EPA's RMP rule requires us to provide\n *  The detailed information (called data elements) about our risk management program\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nOur facility produces Lubricants,  Specialty Solvents, and Gasoline using a variety of chemicals and processing operations.  The Lubricant and Specialty Product division includes a refinery which consists of a Crude Unit, Platformer, ROSE Unit, Extraction Unit, MEK Unit, Bulk Loading and Tank Farm.  In our ROSE and MEK processes, we use the following chemical that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release:\n\n\nRMP-regulated flammable chemicals"
