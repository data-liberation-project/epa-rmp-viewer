Using the RMP-\r\n                    Comp program from the EPA a worst case\r\n                    scenario distance to end point for such\r\n                    a release is 0.2 miles. Measures to\r\n                    limit the distance are not advised. The\r\n                    containment of a flammable, compressed\r\n                    gas due to a catastrophic failure\r\n                    presents a whole new set of hazards.\r\n                    These hazards would place response team\r\n                    members at great risk. The compressed\r\n                    gas expands and dissipates at such a\r\n                    high rate of speed, an incident would be\r\n                    over before any attempt at containment\r\n                    could begin. The gas should be allowed\r\n                    to dissipate. Since containment is not a\r\n                    practical procedure, limiting  the\r\n                    severity of the incident would include\r\n                    eliminating any ignition source with-in\r\n                    the affected area. This would include\r\n                    auto traffic, motors, electrical\r\n                    devises, lawn mowers, or any sources of\r\n                    heat. The flammability limits of 152a\r\n                    are 3.9% to 16.9%, and for DME 3.4% to 27%, therefore with a\r\n                    distance to end point of 0.2 miles all\r\n                    ignition sources within that distance\r\n                    should be eliminated.
