      "SummaryText": "Company History:\n\nMarChem Southeast designs and manufactures custom polyurethane and PVC formulations for a wide variety of industrial applications. MarChem Southeast does not produce any part, but rather supplies these formulations in a liquid state to end product fabricators. MarChem Southeast has a trained technical and quality control staff which develops all of our products, follows then through the manufacturing process and tests them for quality prior to shipment. This site has been in operation for more than thirty years. \n\nThe Covered Process:\n\nThe Delivery, Storage and Use of Toluene Diisocyanate to manufacture Urethane Binders\n\nToluene Diisocyanate (TDI) is delivered to MSE via over the road tanker cars. Once at MSE, the tanker is unloaded into a storage tank with a maximum capacity of 7500 gallons. The TDI is then pumped into one of two batch units on site which are used to produce polyurethane pre-polymers or quasi pre-polymers. Each of these units has a capacity of 500 \u00bf 6000 gallons. These pre-polymers are manufactured by reacting long chain polyols with Toluene Diisocyanate (TDI) in a 2:1 molar ratio to produce NCO terminated high viscosity pre-polymers. These pre-polymers can be chain extended by the end product fabricators with water, short chain polyols or diamines to produce molecular weight polymers. Quasi pre-polymers are manufactured by reacting only part of the long chain polyol with Toluene Diisocyanate which improves mixing, reduces volatility, improves compatibility, improves the mix ratio balance, reduces the exotherm and helps match viscosity differences.\n\nBoth batch units have hot oil jackets which control the temperature of the reaction. A MDA Scientific (Model TLD-1) monitor with a TDI keys is used to monitor the levels of TDI in the air. The monitor sounds an alarm if the atmospheric concentration of TDI exceeds 5 ppb. All MSE personnel who handle TDI, operate the covered process or perform quality control tests on TDI based material"

The team consists of the Laboratory Manager, the Vice-President of Operations, The Maintenance Supervisor, and the individual Shift Supervisors. \n\nThe Laboratory Manager has the overall responsibility for the management of the RMP at MarChem Southeast. The Laboratory Manager is also responsible for the release scenarios, incident investigations and the RMP review and updates required under this RMP. The Laboratory Manager is assisted in his tasks by the VP Operations who is responsible for the hazard review, safety information, compliance audits and training program under this RMP and the initial submission of this RMP. The Maintenance Supervisor is responsible for the maintenance program for the covered process.
