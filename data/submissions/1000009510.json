Risk prevention and emergency response procedures are in place at this facility.  The Emergency Response Plan lists the responsible personnel and the policies for responding to an accident involving the regulated substance.\n\nMann Packing Company facility has both fixed and portable refrigeration systems onsite composed of screw compressors, evaporative condensers, evaporative cooling coils, pressure vessels, ammonia pumps and diffusion tanks. All compressors have safety switches that would shut down the compressors upon detection of unsafe operating conditions. All the pressure vessels and the compressors are protected by safety relief valves against high pressure situations.  There are ammonia detectors in the cold rooms and in the mechanical room for alarming. There is a list of responders experienced with ammonia refrigeration that would respond and determine specific responses for any incident.  Safeties and detection equipment are tested and maintained by experienced maintenance personnel as spelled out in the SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures) and testing and inspection program.\n\nEmergency response training will be conducted yearly for current employees and as required for new employees.  Records will be kept of all training performed at the site for a minimum of five (5) years.\n\n2.\tDescription of Source and Substance Handled\n\nAmmonia refrigeration systems are used for cold storage, water chilling, produce precooling and ice generation. A fixed system is attached to the main storage and processing building and is used for cold storage, water chilling, ice generation, and hydrocooling.  There are refrigerated dock and holding rooms remote from the main facility that are supported by fixed and portable trailer mounted refrigeration units.  These portable un"

The remote dock was started in 1994 and a holding room was added to the dock in 1995.  A broccoli drier with refrigeration coils was added in 2001. These rooms meet the intend of the current codes and standards.  Portable units vary in age but are well maintained and in good condition.  In 2006, a new cold room was added adjacent to Cold Rooms 4 and 5 and six new fancoils along with three ammonia sensors were installed in the new cold room.  A new high pressure receiver and a low pressure liquid recirculation package were installed and tied to the portable refrigeration trailer to support the vacuum tubes, Cold Rooms 4, 5, 6, and the new cooler.  The total charge for the all the refrigeration systems is approximately 40,820 LBS. \n\nAnhydrous ammonia (NH3) is a gas in its natural state and is extremely irritating to mucous membranes and lung tissue. The gas is pungent and may be suffocating as shortness of breath and labored breathing can develop if inhaled. Prolonged inhalation of high concentrations may cause bronchitis and/ or pneumonia, with some residual reduction in pulmonary functions. Repeated or prolonged contact of high concentrations of ammonia to the skin can cause frostbite, redness, pain and serious skin burn. \n\n3.\tAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nMann Packing Company maintains a release prevention program to eliminate or minimize releases.  The program includes regular inspections, monitoring equipment and logging conditions, scheduled maintenance, and operator training.  There is a program (Incident Investigation Projedures) to analyze releases for ways to prevent a similar future releases. A Risk Management Program, which includes accident prevention procedures for the ammonia refrigeration system, is maintained on-site along with the RMP. \n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system ha"

They are also trained in emergency response procedures in the event of an ammonia release.  There are emergency shut off switches outside the mechanical room for shutting down the system.  Ammonia detectors are installed in all refrigerated rooms and the mechanical room.  Personnel will automatically be notified if any detector exceeds set point.  Monitoring is 24 hours per day.  An emergency control box and diffusion tank allows system pressure to be relieved manually.  All relief valves at the facility are tied into ammonia diffusion tank to prevent high pressure releases to ambient.\n\n4.\tEmergency Response Program\n\nIn event of a release, certain personnel are designated to determine the potential hazard and coordinate response procedures.  The Hazmat Team Chief is responsible in coordinating emergency response and will be contacting emergency response agencies, schools, daycare centers, and acute care facilities that may be affected by the release.  The Hazmat Team Chief will also be responsible for evacuation of employees if necessary and for coordination with community emergency responders if off-site evacuations are required.  A description of the Emergency Response Program is included in RMP.\n\n5.\tFive-Year Accident History\n\nAccording to Mann Packing Company Personnel, only incident within last 5 years happened on September 01, 2008, where refrigeration technician bled down residual ammonia vapors from equipment into approx. 39 gallons of water. He then attempted to discharge aqua ammonia into drain where vapors daylighted from a downstream drain grate affecting 4 employee. Refrigeration technician stated that he ran fresh water down the drain while discharging aqua ammonia into stream. Total discharge of aqua ammonia is estimated at 14-15 gallons and a Ph of 11.\n\n6.\tPlanned Safety Improvements\n\nSpecific recomm"
