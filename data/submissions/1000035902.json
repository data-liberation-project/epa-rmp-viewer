As a requirement of the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP)\n\nProgram and Clean Air Act Amendments 112&reg; Accidental Release of Hazardous Air Substances program,\n\nPacific Ethanol Stockton, LLC has completed a risk management plan (RMP) for chemicals stored on?]site\n\nabove RMP reporting thresholds. Regulated chemicals at Pacific Ethanol Stockton, LLC include isopentane and\n\npentane (each exceed 10,000 pound threshold) and aqueous ammonia (exceeds 20,000 pound threshold).\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nPacific Ethanol Stockton, LLC is committed to the protection of its employees, the greater community and the\n\nenvironment from hazardous substances used in the ethanol production process, specifically aqueous\n\nammonia and isopentane and pentane (constituents of the natural gasoline used as a denaturant). The\n\nammonia is used for pH control directly in the process feed mixture to fermentation. The denaturant is\n\nadded to ethanol to make the ethanol unfit for human consumption. It is the policy of Pacific Ethanol\n\nStockton, LLC to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local laws. In the event of an emergency,\n\nincluding an accidental release of toxics and flammables, it is the policy of Pacific Ethanol Stockton, LLC to\n\nnotify the Stockton Fire Department and the San Joaquin County Office of Emergency Services and evacuate\n\nall employees at the facility.\n\n\n\nRegulated Substances Handled\n\nThe facility produces fuel grade ethanol from corn and a process by?]product known as wet distillers' grain\n\nwith solubles, which is used as a livestock feed. Aqueous ammonia is stored on?]site and used in the ethanol\n\nproduction process for pH control. The maximum amount of aqueous ammonia stored is approximately\n\n34,200 pounds (20?]30 percent ammonia in solution). The fuel ethanol production"
