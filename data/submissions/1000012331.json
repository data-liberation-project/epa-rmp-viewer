A primary goal of the LEPC is to protect local citizens by developing and maintaining a coordinated emergency response plan and working with industry to minimize the impact of chemical hazards.  Through the LEPC, citizens can obtain information about hazardous substances handled at local facilities and about emergency planning efforts designed to successfully cope with accidents if they occur.  The LEPC maintains a coordinated emergency response plan for the community detailing operational procedures to be followed in the event of an accident involving hazardous materials.  The plan is available for public inspection.\n\n\n\nTippecanoe Labs actively supports local community outreach efforts through Community Advisory Panels and neighborhood groups.  These panels provide feedback from the community and advise Evonik on community issues.  Evonik also hosts plant tours and informative evening programs for nearby neighbors.  \n\n\n\n2.  THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED:\n\n\n\nTippecanoe Labs is divided into three main functional areas.  1) Bulk Pharmaceutical Manufacturing, manufactures bulk drug substances and clinical trials materials for human health products.  This area includes manufacturing facilities and warehouses.  2) Fermented Products Manufacturing, manufactures antibiotics and animal feed additives. This area includes manufacturing facilities, Utilities, Solvent Recovery, and storage tanks.  3) Site Services, includes Environmental Controls, Solvent Recovery and storage tanks, Incineration and infrastructure areas that provide services to the entire site.  The site also has laboratories and pilot plant facilities supporting research and development.  The facility has a Title V operating permit under the Clean Air Act.\n\n\n\nThe following regulated substances are handled at Tippecanoe Labs in quantities"

The sites's response is coordinated by the plant security using the plant's emergency response teams and equipment.   The emergency response plan spells out the \"hows\" of emergency response and the roles and responsibilities of the incident response and management response teams.  Regular drills test readiness and help employees practice responses to alarms and incidents.\n\n \n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE TEAMS\n\nTippecanoe Labs maintains a fully trained emergency response organization that is on-site 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  The site has approximately 55 fully trained emergency response personnel.  Site emergency response teams undergo regular training by security coordinators and officers.  These trainers attend and receive certification from the best emergency response schools in the country.  Each response team member receives at least 40 hours of training in handling industrial fires and hazardous materials.  The emergency response organization has responsibility for custom-designed, state-of the-art response equipment.  Vehicles on site include a fully equipped chemical response van, and ambulance, an incident command vehicle, and two modern fully equipped fire trucks.  Tippecanoe Labs also has an on-site medical facility.\n\n\n\n6.  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\n\n\n\nTippecanoe Labs in committed to ongoing safety improvement.  Accident prevention is incorporated into each stage of the facility's life cycle, from the up-front design and construction through start-up, operations and maintenance to any facility expansion or modification.  The multiple safeguards ensure accident prevention.  Ongoing safety improvements include safely designing, building, or modifying facilities.  Employees and contractors are appropriately trained and tested.  Equipment is safely started or re-started following pre-startup safety reviews.  The plant"
