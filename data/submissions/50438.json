Butler Street Gas Plant\nAtmore, AL\n\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\nIntroduction and Policies\n\nButler Street Gas Plant, owned and operated by Enbridge Processing (Mississippi) LLC, is committed to the same band of safety and environmental excellence that all other Enbridge assets promote.  This philosophy involves making each and every employee and contractor accountable for their own safety as well as that of the community around them.  As a company we follow a close adherence to all applicable federal, state and local laws to ensure a safe and healthy environment for all. \n\nEmployees who enter the Butler Street facility complete a thorough training, both in the classroom and on-the-job, that enables them to address emergency issues as they arise.  This preparation includes standard operational, emergency operational, and release prevention training.  In addition, periodic refresher courses help to keep operators? problem solving abilities up to date and in sync with our recurring safety improvements.  Our regular internal audits provide an excellent checks and balances system for monitoring these high standards that we set.\n\nButler Street Gas Plant is an unmanned natural gas liquid extraction LP-Gas Processing facility with LP-Gas mixture and LP-Gas storage and sales to wholesale markets.  The site is composed of 18,000 and 12,000-gallon LP-Gas mixture storage tanks and a 1,000-gallon propane storage tank with the associated fixtures (e.g. piping).  Propane and the NFPA-4 LP-Gas mixture are the regulated substances handled as part of the LP-Gas storage and sales process.  There are no toxic substances present at the plant.  The facility is classified as Program Level 2 under the regulation.  The purpose of this Risk Management Plan (RMPlan) is to provide information about our operations at the facility, our programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, our emergency response plans in case an accidental release should occur, our 5 year accident history, and our p"

      "SummaryText": "lanned changes to improve safety at the facility.\n\nPrevention Program\n\nThe Butler Street Gas facility complies with the EPA?s accidental release prevention rule and applicable state and local codes and regulations.  This natural gas liquid extraction processing and liquefied petroleum gas handling and storage facility is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with NFPA-58 and state law utilizing ASME, ANSI, and API codes and guidance.  This facility has in place an active SPCC plan developed in accordance with 40 CFR 112.7.\n\nFive-year Accident History\n\nNo incident resulting in onsite or offsite impacts from a hydrocarbon release has occurred at the Butler Street Plant within the last five years.  Although we take pride in that record, we also place daily emphasis on our prevention and safety programs to ensure this record continues.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving our natural gas liquid extraction LP-Gas handling and storage facility system, it is our policy to notify the Huxford Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.  We have discussed this policy with the Escambia County Emergency Response manager and he has inspected our facility.\n    \n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nNo improvement are planned to date."
