We are proactive in release prevention and emergency response policies. We use combination of engineered controls and employee training to ensure that we have a safe and environmentally friendly work place for our partners and a safe environment for the public in the city of Houston and Chickasaw County, Mississippi. What follows is:\n\n?    A description of our facility and the use of chemicals regulated by the EPA?s Risk Management Plan (RMP) regulations\n?    An overview of our accident release prevention program\n?    A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemical regulated by the EPA? RMP \n?    An overview of our emergency response program\n?    An overview of engineering controls we are putting in place or will be putting in place to prevent accidental chemical releases and to protect our employees, the public and the environment\n?    The certifications that the EPA and RMP rules require us to provide\n\nOur Facility and Regulated Chemical Handled and Used\n\nMPI produces bonded carpet padding using a variety of chemical and processing operations. We are housed in approximately 220,000 square foot buildings located in an industrial area next to a small residential area. The process area is in the part of our facility that is call the Bonding Building.  Inside the bonding Building is our chemical tank farm. All our tanks are diked to contained 1 ? the capacity of the largest tank. Also located in the Bonding building are the Surge Hopper, Blender, and Extruder. In our process, we use the following chemical that the EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequences in the event of a substantial accidenta"

The maximum amount of TDI that can be stored at this facility is 247,294 pounds\n\nOur accident release programs and our contingency planning efforts help us to effectively manage the hazards that are posed to our employees, the public, and the environment by use of these chemicals.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:\n\nWe take a systematic proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals. Our management systems address each of the key features of successful prevention programs including:\n\n?    Process hazard Assessment\n?    Process Hazard Review\n?    Operating Procedures\n?    Training\n?    Mechanical Integrity (Preventive Maintenance)\n?    Compliance Audits  (Inspections)\n?    Incident Investigations\n?    Employees Participation\n?    Hot Work Permits and Lockout/Tag-out\n?    Contractors\n\nAs part of our prevention efforts, we have implemented the following chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\n1.    Inventory Control of TDI\n2.    Two-way communication during off loading of TDI\n3.    Never leaving off-loading area during off-loading\n4.    High level alarms on TDI tanks and all chemical tanks\n5.    Standard Operating Procedures\n6.    Preventive Maintenance of all TDI off-loading equipment\n\n\nThese individual elements of our prevention program work together to prevent accidental chemical releases. Our company and our employees are committed to the standard that these management systems set for the way we do business, and we have specific accountabilities and controls to ensure that we are meeting our own high standards for   \naccident prevention.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nWe will keep records of all significant accidental chemical release that occur at our facility that are covered under EPA?s RMP rules.\n\nThere has been no accidental release of TDI at our facility.\n\n\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nWe maintain an integra"
