There has been no accidental release during this period.\r\n\r\n5.\tEmergency Response Plan\r\nIsla Blanca Wastewater Treatment Plant employees will not respond to releases of regulated substances.  This facility is included in the community emergency response plan.  This facility carries a written emergency response action plan to minimize the duration and effects of an accidental release of hazardous materials.  The employees will take actions only on incidental responses such as small chlorine or sulfur dioxide leaks.  \r\n                                                                                                                                                                                     Our employees are aware of the limits of an incidental response and have been trained on the proper steps to follow for emergency notification and employee evacuation procedures in case of a release of a regulated substance.  Appropriate procedures are in place to notify emergency responders such as the Local Fire Department who will then notify the Cameron County LEPC.  The Fire Department Emergency Response Plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public.\r\n\r\n6.\tPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\nSeveral developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program.  Further training on a more continuous basis will be provided to the plant operators."
