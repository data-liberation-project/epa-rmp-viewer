Our refrigeration system has 2 systems that both utilize anhydrous ammonia and are not connected.\nWe comply with OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM), OSHA Emergency Action Plan, Emergency Response, EPA Oil Spill Prevention Countermeasure and Control plan and applicable EPCRA regulations at state and local levels.\nWe have Emergency Response Teams on sight that train and drill on a regular basis.  The local fire department tours on a regular basis and reviews our systems for emergency response.  We also review with the fire dept. the key points to know about our refrigeration system and invite them to participate in our emergency response training.  Evacuation drills are held on a regular basis with all stakeholders.  These drills are critiqued and any deficiencies are reviewed and appropriate corrective action taken. \nPreventive Maintenance is tracked on a computer maintenance management system.  This is allowing us to build trend history in an organized manner and allowing us to become predictive vs. preventive in our maintenance and further ensuring safe operation of our systems.
