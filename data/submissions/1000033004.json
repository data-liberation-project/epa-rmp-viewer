Acceptance to this program is granted after a facility applies to OSHA and demonstrates a safety and accident incident rate well below industry averages.  Next, after several visits to the facility by OSHA and industry safety officials, our facility and its safety programs were audited and interviews with plant personnel were conducted.  Finally, after reviewing the commitment we have made to the Safety of everyone involved in the operation of our facility, we were accepted into this program.  This program is reviewed every 3 years to insure our ongoing commitment.\n\nThe facility manufactures surimi seafood and uses anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant for coolers, chillers and freezers.  The facility has about 13,086 pounds of ammonia in the system.  The system is a two stage system consisting of a discharge side, intermediate stage and suction side.  All compressors are located inside the facility in the machinery room.  Coolers, freezers, chillers and piping are located throughout the facility.  The condenser units and the high pressure receiver are located outside within a fenced enclosure.  The system is monitored and operated using a state of the art computer software program.\n\nOur facility uses ammonia in excess of the thresh hold limit, and is subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management Program (PSM) and the Risk Management (RM) requirement.  These programs have specific requirements to ensure the protection of workers and the community.  The sections of the program insure employee participation and the formation of a management system for the operation of the refrigeration system and the organization of the emergency response plan.  This insures the system is properly designed, operated, and maintained.  Other sections of this program provide guidance for training personnel and managing system c"

There have been no evacuations, no incidents of sheltering in place, or environmental damage as a result of an ammonia release.\n\n\n\n"
