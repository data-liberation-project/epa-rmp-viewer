The City of Tampa Water Department (TWD) accidental release policy involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices.  All applicable federal and state prevention program guidelines are adhered to.  The TWD emergency response policy involves the preparation of response plans which are tailed to     each facility and to the emergency response services available in the community.  Emergency response plans include coordination with the local fire departments and COT emergency response units.\n\nb.  The Morris Bridge Water Treatment Plant (MBWTP) is a ground water treatment facility producing potable water from the Morris Bridge Wellfield in Tampa, Florida, utilizing a lime softening treatment process. MBWTP maintains an inventory of  40,000 pounds of chlorine in twenty one ton chlorine cylinders located within an enclosed chemical building.  Chlorine is used as the primary disinfectant in the potable water treatment process.  Secondary disinfection for potable water storage and distribution is achieved with chloramine, a combination chlorine and anhydrous ammonia.    Anhydrous ammonia is stored in one 2000 gallon horizontal pressurized tank.  Anhydrous ammonia storage tanks are filled only to 85% capacity as required under manufacturer specifications.  This  tank has a maximum weight storage capacity of 9,675 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  This is below the threshold limit for anhydrous ammonia under the RMP rule and is not included in this RMP.  The treatment facility is currently manned 24 hours per day, 7 days per week.  The MBWTP has been designed for the safe storage and handling of chlorine and ammonia as referenced in the Combined Process Safety Management Program for the City of Tampa Water Department, Production Division.  Chlorine storage at MBWTP is the only chemical used in a process at this facility covere"

The offsite consequence analysis includes consideration of two chlorine release scenarios, identified as \"worst case release\" and \"alternative case release\".  The \"worst case release\" scenario is defined by EPA as \"a chemical  release of the maximum quantity in the largest vessel released in a 10 minute period\", due to an unspecified failure.  The alternative release scenario is defined as \"more likely to occur than the worst case release scenario\".\n\nAtmospheric dispersion modeling has to be performed to determine the distance traveled by the chlorine released before its concentration decreases to the \"toxic endpoint' selected by EPA under the Emergency Response Planning Guideline 2.   The defined endpoint used for chlorine was the ERPG2 concentration of 3 PPM chlorine.  The Emergency Response Planning Guideline 2 (ERPG2) is \"the maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms which could impair an individual's ability to take protective action\".   The residential population within a circle with a radius corresponding to eh toxic endpoint has to be defined to \"estimate the population potentially effected.\nWorst -case release scenario:\n\nThere are twenty one ton chlorine cylinders stored in the chlorine building at MBWTP.  Ten of the one ton cylinders are active at one time incorporated into two banks of 5 one ton cylinders each feeding a common manifold line.  Worst case release criteria under RMP regulations specifically state the release of the full contents of the largest storage vessel or line in a ten minute period.  For MBWTP this would be the release of a single one ton cylinder in ten minutes.  Mitigation for a building enclosure is set at 55% of the total release quantity.  For a one ton cylinder  the mitigated release quantity would be 1,100 pounds of chlorine.\n\nThe rel"

A rupture of the manifold transfer piping will create degassing of chlorine into the enclosed building.
