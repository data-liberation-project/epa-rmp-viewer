Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n     At this facility we handle anhydrous ammonia which is considered a regulated toxic substance by the  EPA.  We utilize bulk storage of liquid propane gas, also, which is a flammable substance.  The properties of both make it imperative to observe certain safety precautions in handling the substance to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as our co-workers', and to reduce the threat to members of nearby communities.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal and state regulations.\n     Our emergency response program was developed with the assistance of the local fire department.   A copy of our Tier II report including a captioned aerial view map of our entire business site is mailed annually to that department.  Additionally, our primary employee handler of anhydrous ammonia is a volunteer member of the same department and is trained on a continuing basis in emergency response proceedures which are relevant to our operations.  Our emergency response training and plan includes procedures for notification of the local fire department and sheriff's office via the 911 emergency communications system.  \n     \n2.  Source and regulated substances handled:\n     The primary purpose of this facility is to distribute anhydrous ammonia to corn crop producers  on  a retail basis.  The anhydrous ammonia is used as a nitrogen fertilizer.  We receive the substance by truck (transports) and store it in three side by side storage tanks as well as in  1,000 gallon (4,250 pound) capacity nursetanks as supply/demand dictates.  The ammonia is distributed to customers via the  nursetanks.  The maximum amount of anhydrous ammonia that can be stored in the bulk plant is 80,000 pounds.  We have the capacity to store upto an additional 178,500 pounds in the nursetanks o"

Worst-case and Alternative  release scenarios:\n\n     Worst-case Scenario for Anhydrous Ammonia - \n     Failure of all bulk storage when filled to capacity would result in a release of 80,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  Company policy limits the maximum filling capacity of the tank system to 80%.  It is assumed that the entire contents are released as a vapor and extends beyond the facility boundary to a distance of 9.3 miles which would encompass residences, schools, businesses and recreation areas.  \n   \n     Alternative Scenario for Anhydrous Ammonia - \n     Overfilling of the bulk storage causing 2,125 pounds to be released beyond the facility boundary to a distance of .62 miles would encompass residences, a business and a recreation area. \n\n                                                        ***          ***         ***          ***         ***\n\n     Worst-case Scenario for Propane - \n     Failure of the storage tank when filled to capacity would release 10,200 pounds of propane.  It is assumed that the entire contents are released as vapor which finds an ignition source, 10% yield factor was used in the TNT-equivalency formula.  The distance to endpoint of 1 psi overpressure for this scenario is .17 miles.  This distance extends beyond the facility boundary and encompasses two residences.\n\n     Alternative Scenario for Propane - \n     Overfilling of the bulk storage causing 500 pounds of propane to be released would result in a distance to endpoint of 1 psi overpressure of 211 feet.  This distance does not extend beyond the facility boundary.\n\n4.  This facility complies with all applicable EPA and state codes and regulations to prevent accidental releases.  \n\n5.  This facility has had no accidental releases over a twenty year history."
