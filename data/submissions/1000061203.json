      "SummaryText": "Facility Description\n\nPacific Ethanol Pekin, Inc., located at 1300 South 2nd Street Pekin, Illinois, and operates a dry mill & wet mill ethanol facilities to produce ethyl alcohol or fuel ethanol from primarily corn.  The site also includes a yeast reclaim facility.  As a requirement of the Clean Air Act Amendments 112(r) Accidental Release of Hazardous Air Substances program, Pacific Ethanol Pekin completed a risk management plan (RMP) for any chemical stored on-site that is stored in quantities above the applicable RMP reporting threshold. This information represents a 5-year update to the current facility RMP.\n\n\n\nRegulated Substances Handled\n\nThe Facility produces fuel grade ethanol from corn using both wet mill and dry mill processes. The fuel ethanol production process requires use of a denaturant to render the distilled alcohol unfit for human consumption; denaturant is added to the distilled alcohol at a concentration of approximately 2 percent by volume. Pacific Ethanol Pekin intends to use natural gasoline as a denaturant, which is a flammable mixture that may contain the following RMP-regulated components: iso-pentane (40%), pentane (57%). Percentages represent the maximum quantity from 4 manufacturer Safety Data Sheets.  The maximum amount of denaturant on-site is estimated to be 788,340 pounds. The denaturant is stored in an above ground tank as a liquid and is introduced to the fuel ethanol in the final stage of production. The denaturant tank is located in the Facility's tank farm area, which includes secondary containment. The Facility also stores anhydrous ammonia on-site in an above ground, pressure vessel. Anhydrous ammonia is used in the ethanol production process for pH control and a nutrient for yeast during fermentation. The estimated maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia stored is 79,101 pounds. Pacific Ethanol Pekin has evaluated worst and alternative case scenarios as it relates to each of these reportable substances. Emergency actions for t"

Pacific Ethanol Pekin has coordinated emergency response with the local authorities and conducts drills.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nPacific Ethanol Pekin is committed to the protection of its employees, the greater community and the environment from hazardous substances used in the ethanol fuel production process, specifically the flammable mixture natural gasoline, which may be used as the ethanol denaturant, as well as anhydrous ammonia. The denaturant is stored in secondary containment to minimize the potential for off-site migration of spilled material and to allow for prompt response in the event of a material release. The anhydrous ammonia is stored with process controls in place to minimize the potential for release. It is the policy of Pacific Ethanol Pekin to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local laws. In the event of an emergency, including accidental release of denaturant or anhydrous ammonia, it is the policy of Pacific Ethanol Pekin to notify the Tazewell County Local Emergency Planning Committee and the Pekin Fire Department and evacuate all employees at the Facility, as needed based on the extent of the emergency.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nPacific Ethanol Pekin maintains a consistent accidental release prevention program to eliminate or minimize releases of denaturant and anhydrous ammonia. The Prevention Program required under 40 CFR 68 is very similar to the prevention program required under Occupational Safety and Health Administration's Process Safety Management (PSM). Pacific Ethanol Pekin's Prevention Program 3 elements, as required under 40 CFR 68 Subpart D, are included in the facility's PSM Plan. Required elements include:\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nTraining\n\nContractors\n\nPre-startup Review\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nHot Work Permits\n\nManagement "

      "SummaryText": "of Change\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nEmergency Response\n\nTrade Secrets\n\n \n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nPacific Ethanol Pekin has not had any accidents related to the RMP-regulated substances which may have caused onsite or known offsite deaths, injuries, environmental or property damage, evacuations or in-place sheltering in the last five years.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nPacific Ethanol Pekin has chosen to maintain a written Emergency Action Plan (EAP) that provides guidance to ensure employee safety in the event of an emergency. In general, the EAP provides procedures for employees to report a fire or other emergency; procedures for emergency evacuation; procedures to for employees who remain to operate critical plant operations prior to evacuation; contact information for employees responsible for communicating plan information; details regarding the employee alarm system; an employee training program for evacuation; and procedures for routine review and updates to the plan. In addition, the Facility has coordinated with the Tazewell County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and is a part of the written community Emergency Response Plan. The Pekin Fire Department provides first response for all Facility emergencies. For these reasons, Pacific Ethanol Pekin meets the exceptions listed in 40 CFR 68.90(b) and therefore the Facility is not required to an Emergency Response Program. A site map, SDSs, and a list of chemicals kept on-site are maintained by the Facility. Complete details on the EAP required under the PSM Rules are included in Pacific Ethanol Pekin's PSM/RMP Program.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nPacific Ethanol Pekin completed a Process Hazard Analysis Revalidation in September 2016. The Facility is in the process of implementing the changes recommended during the Process Hazard Analysis and anticipates that the changes will be completed by September 2018.\n\n"
