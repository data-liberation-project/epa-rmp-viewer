Formaldehyde is produced by processing methanol, which is delivered to the plant via rail car and tank truck.  The specialty resins are produced using formaldehyde and various other raw materials.  Finished products are shipped offsite in tanker trucks, drums and totes.  The maximum quantity of formaldehyde in storage in one vessel is 50,000 gallons at a concentration of 53.5% by weight. \n\n\n\nAPPLICABILITY OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe threshold quantity for formaldehyde is 15,000 pounds. The three identified processes at Arclin Toledo which are subject to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program are the Formaldehyde Manufacturing process and the Resin Manufacturing process, which includes two resin reactors (K1 & K2).  \n\n\n\nENVIRONMENT AND SAFETY POLICY OF ARCLIN USA, LLC\n\n\n\nArclin is committed to a clean, safe and healthy environment through the implementation of a management system dedicated to the prevention of pollution and continual improvement of our environmental, health and safety performance. We are committed to complying with applicable governmental laws and regulations and to meet the requirements of other organizations to which we subscribe. Our employees are our most important asset, and an integral part of the success of our environmental, health and safety programs.  We will properly train, equip, and direct employees to perform their jobs in a safe and environmentally responsible manner.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nAll covered processes at Arclin are in Program 3 and meet the requirements of the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) program.  The existing OSHA PSM program meets nearly all RMP requirements.  Where the programs differ, the Arclin's program elements have been expanded to incorporate RMP issues.  An example would be that the complia"

      "SummaryText": "nce audit procedures required as part of Arclin's PSM program have been modified to include evaluations of the RMP implementation.  Another example would be that pre-startup review procedures have been modified to incorporate reevaluation of the facility accident scenarios to determine whether the worst case and alternate case scenarios for releases are still consistent with the design and operation of the process being started.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY \n\n\n\n5/19/18, 04:30 (release duration - approximately 1 minute) - Arclin had a process incident in the PF reactor (K-2) resulting from a plant power outage which was caused by a car accident on Benore Rd. The loss of cooling to the reactor during the power outage resulted in activation of the kettle rupture disk and approximately 10,325 pounds of in-process liquid phenol-formaldehyde resin being released onto the roof of the Resin Plant and onto the ground behind the Truck Bay (in an area known as the \"Bone Yard\"). The formaldehyde concentration of the resin material at the time of the release was approximately 1.4%.  Offsite response from emergency or environmental agencies was not required.  At the time of the release the wind was calm, there was no precipitation, and the low temperature was 57?F overnight.  All of the released resin material remained onsite and was cleaned up and disposed of in a non-hazardous waste landfill. Vegetation and dirt had to be removed/replaced but there were no lasting environmental impacts. The cause of the release was due to the inability to get cooling water to the reactor during the power outage. Arclin has implemented corrective measures which allow the Production Operators to get cooling water to the reactor manually in the event of a power outage and the control system is down.  This will prevent a similar accident in the future.\n\n \n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nArclin Toledo has established a facility emergency response plan that meets the requirements of both the OSHA PSM"

This response plan describes the procedures for informing the public and local emergency response agencies of a release, provides documentation of proper first-aid and emergency medical treatment for accidental exposures, and procedures and measures for emergency response after a release.  Local emergency response and medical treatment personnel have worked with Arclin to provide for the safe control and treatment of releases of formaldehyde.  Arclin employees receive mandatory training on emergency response procedures and emergency response equipment use, inspection, testing, and maintenance.  Emergency response procedures are reevaluated as part of the management of change and pre-startup review requirements of the PSM and RMP programs.\n\n"
