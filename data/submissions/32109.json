THE OWNER, MANAGEMENT, AND EMPLOYEES OF CONAGRA \nINTERNATIONAL FERTILIZER ARE COMMITTED TO THE PREVENTION OF \nANY ACCIDENTAL RELEASE OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA.  IF AN \nACCIDENTAL RELEASE SHOULD OCCUR, THE FACILITY IS PREPARED TO \nWORK WITH THE LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENT, OR OTHER STATE AND LOCAL \nAUTHORITIES, TO MITIGATE ANY RELEASE AND TO MINIMIZE THE IMPACT \nOF THE RELEASE ON PEOPLE AND THE ENVIRONMENT. THE FACILTY WILL MAINTAIN                                                 AN INTERNAL WRITTEN EMERGENCY PLAN.\n\nII. FACILITY INFORMATION:\n\nA. THE PRIMARY ACTIVITY OF THE FACILITY IS DISTRIBUTING NON-\nHAZARDOUS LIQUID FERTILIZERS FOR USE IN THE GEOGRAPHICAL \nAGRICULTURAL MARKET.  IN ORDER TO PROVIDE THE NEEDS OF OUR \nAGRICULTURAL CUSTOMERS, WE RECEIVE ANHYDROUS AMMONIA BY \nRAIL ON A SEASONAL BASIS, WHICH IS USED AS A CROP NUTRIENT.  AS IT \nIS BEING UNLOADED IT IS NEUTRALIZED INTO A NON-HAZARDOUS \nFERTILIZER AND STORED AT THE FACILITY UNTIL TRANSPORTED TO \nVARIOUS LOCATIONS IN THE GEOGRAPHICAL AREA.  TYPICALLY, \nAMMONIA IS AT THE FACILITY FROM 14 TO 21 DAYS IN THE SPRING, AND \n14 TO 21 DAYS IN THE FALL. THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY OF A RAIL CAR IS \nAPPROXIMATELY 150,000 POUNDS. A PLANT EMPLOYEE, TRAINED IN THE \nOPERATION OF UNLOADING AND HANDLING AMMONIA, IS IN \nATTENDANCE DURING THE TIME THE CAR IS HOOKED UNTIL THE TIME \nUNLOADING IS SUSPENDED AND THE CAR IS DISCONNECTED AND \nSECURED FOR SAFETY AND SECURITY.\n     \n III. THE ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM:\n\nTHE FACILITY HAS IMPLEMENTED THE PROVISIONS OF \"SAFETY  \nREQUIREMENTS FOR THE  STORAGE AND HANDLING OF ANHYDROUS \nAMMONIA, K-61.1\", PUBLISHED BY THE  AMERICAN NATIONAL \nSTANDARDS INSTITUTE, INC.
