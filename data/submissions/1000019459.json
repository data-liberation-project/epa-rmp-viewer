The owners, management and employees of Backes and Toelke dba Marthasville Ag are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, Warren County LEPC, and other authorities to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the residents and the environment of our community.\n\n2.  Facility Information. The primary activity at the facility is the distribution of products to farmers.  The fertilizer product, anhydrous ammonia, is received, stored and distributed for direct application as a nutrient for crop production. Anhydrous ammonia is stored in tanks designed for this purpose.\n\n3. Accident Release Prevention Program. This facility follows the provisions of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Adminstration (OHSA), 29 CFR 1910.111, Storage and Hadling of Anhydrous Ammonia and our State regulations covering anhydrous ammonia.   \n\n4.  Five-Year Accident History. There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia during the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge has there been any accidental releases resulting in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n5.  Emergency Response Program. Our facility has coordinated with the local responders and we do not plan to have our employees respond to a major release.  If a large release of anhydrous ammonia takes place at our facility, the response action is to evacuate the area of the release and call 911 and all the applicable emergency response numbers listed in our Emergency Action Plan.\n\n6. Planned Changes to Improve Safety.  Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to access the conditions of the faciltiy.  We are actually replumbing the system to help prevent any accidental or"
