Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe Golden State Vintners, located at 7409 West Central Avenue, Fresno, California handles anhydrous ammonia and sulfur dioxide, which are considered hazardous materials that are regulated substances and are considered in the Risk Management Plan (RMP).  The properties of ammonia make it necessary to observe safety precautions in handling to prevent human exposure, and to reduce the threat to the facility's workers and nearby members of the community.  It is the facility's policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State of California rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the safe procedures used to handle ammonia; the safety devices and systems designed and constructed into the facility; and the training of the pertinent personnel.\n\n2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe Golden State Vinters Production Facility uses ammonia in their cooling system to aid in heat exchange during the fermenting process and in the cooling process to chill and store their wine.  The heat exchangers are flooded with anhydrous ammonia as it is boiled off and compressed, heat is generated again.  To remove the heat, the ammonia goes through a cooling to be condensed into a liquid giving off it's heat to the water in the cooling tower.  The largest container for the anhydrous ammonia is a 11,000 pound tank.  Sulfur dioxide is used during the grape crushing process.  Sulfur dioxide is added to the crushers to prohibit the growth of wild yeast.  The largest container for the sulfur dioxide is a one-ton cylinder.\n \nAnhydrous ammonia is delivered by a commercial ammonia supplier for use at the facility.  Off-loading is done in accordance with the supplier off-loading procedures.  The ammonia is stored in the main storage area east of the crushers and northwest corner by Tank 1022.  The sulfur dioxide is also delivered by a commercial supplier in"

The sulfur dioxide cylinders are stored near the crush pad\n\nThe receipt, storage, and handling of the subject substances are considered as part of one complete process.\n\n3a.  Worst Case Release Scenario\n\nThe 11,000 pound ammonia container is the largest vessel size in the ammonia system.   The Worst Case release scenario to be modeled for the 11,000 pounds ammonia container assumes that the full 11,000 pounds of ammonia is released over a ten minute period resulting in a release rate of 1100 pounds per minute. The distance to the endpoint of  .14 mg/l for the Worst Case scenario is .9 miles.  This ammonia release will extend beyond the boundaries of the winery.\n\nThe one-ton sulfur dioxide container is the largest vessel size in the sulfur dioxide system.   The Worst Case release scenario to be modeled for the one-ton sulfur dioxide cylinder assumes that the full cylinder of sulfur dioxide is released over a ten minute period resulting in a release rate of 200 pounds per minute. The distance to the endpoint of  .078 mg/l for the Worst Case scenario is 1.3 miles.  This sulfur dioxide release will extend beyond the boundaries of winery.\n\n3b.  Alternative Release Scenario\n\nThe Alternative Release scenario for sulfur dioxide for the one-ton container located at the facility assumes a release from a valve packing, resulting in an estimated release of no more than 2 pounds per minute.  The period of release is taken to be one hour in duration, resulting in a total release quantity of 120 pounds of sulfur dioxide. The distance to the endpoint of  .078 mg/l for the Alternative Release scenario is 0.1 mile.  This sulfur dioxide release will extend beyond the boundaries of the winery.\n\nThe Alternative Release scenario for anhydrous ammonia for the one-ton container located at the facility assumes a release from the discharge valve, resulting in an estimated release of 195 pounds per minute.

Administrative Controls\n\nAdministrative controls to limit the distances for each reported scenario exists to restrict to a minimum the amount of ammonia released, if a release were to occur, and preferably to not have a release occur.  This administrative control is inherent in the operational procedures for the ammonia systems and the training provided to the operators.\n\n3d.  Mitigation Measures\n\nMitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario exists to restrict to a minimum the amount of ammonia released, if a release were to occur, and preferably not to have a release occur.  The mitigation measures are based upon the design, inspection, testing, and maintenance of the ammonia system and its related equipment and components.\n\n4. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe facility complies with all applicable federal and state codes and regulations.  There are safety meetings and safety training.  The Process Safety Management (PSM) program \nimplemented at the facility for the ammonia related activities and equipment represents one of the facility's main active commitments to an accidental release prevention program.\n \n5. Five Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no incidents involving the release of ammonia or sulfur dioxide within the past five years at the facility.\n\n6. Emergency Response Program\n\nThe Golden State Vintners facility's Emergency Response Program is based on alerting personnel at the facility of the need to evacuate the facility and await the arrival of responders from the Mid Valley Fire Department Fire and the Fresno Police Departments at the evacuation assembly location if a release occurs that causes the evacuation to be initiat"

Current applicable codes and regulations are reviewed as part of the PSM to determine if other commitments need to be made to achieve increased operational safety for the regulated ammonia system.
