      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\n\n40 CFR 68.155 states that the owner or operator of a regulated source shall provide an executive summary in their Risk Management Plan (RMP) that includes a brief description of the Risk Management Program elements established under the rule.  This Executive Summary is intended to satisfy those requirements.\n\n\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n\n\nSimplot Phosphates LLCs Phosphate Fertilizer Manufacturing plant is located approximately 4.5 miles southeast of Rock Springs, Wyoming on Highway 430 in Sweetwater, County.  With the exception of a small residential subdivision to the southwest of the plant, the area is undeveloped.  This facility manufactures phosphate fertilizer used primarily for agricultural food crops.  The facility employs approximately 290 full time staff and operates 24 hours per day, 7 days per week.  Simplot Phosphates LLC is a solid and responsible member of the local community.  The Company and its employees strive to contribute and improve the community they work and live in through their involvement, volunteerism and support of local programs.  \n\n\n\nSimplot Phosphates is committed to protecting the environment and preserving natural resources through the elimination or reduction of toxic substance use, pollution prevention at the source and responsible recycling, treatment and disposal of waste materials. This September 2017 resubmission is being done to reflect the new ammonia manufacturing plant located adjacent to the existing facilities. This plant will allow Simplot Phosphates to produce ammonia at Rock Springs rather than bring in ammonia via railcar.  Railcar import of ammonia will still remain a viable alternative and backup.  In addition, the facility will begin to export ammonia via railcar and possibly truck.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\n\n\n\nSimplot Phosphates LLC, Rock Springs Phosphate Fertilizer Plant near Rock Springs, Wyoming, is committed to being a responsible community partner.

      "SummaryText": "esponse planning and training of all employees is current and on going.  The company fully supports an emergency rescue team, whose members receive more advanced training.  Every reasonable effort is made to prevent a significant accidental release to the air from the facility.  Local fire departments and emergency management agencies receive annual Sara Title III reports that give information about materials that are manufactured, stored, and used at the facility.  It is Simplot's policy to fully cooperate with all inspections and requests for information from all regulatory agencies.\n\n\n\nRegulated Substances Processed, Stored, or Used: \n\n\n\nSimplot's Rock Springs Plant manufactures phosphate fertilizer products and industrial chemicals. These processes require the use of anhydrous ammonia used to provide the nitrogen component of the mono-ammonium and 40-Rock phosphate fertilizer products.    \n\n\n\nThe Rock Springs plant transfers, stores, and processes anhydrous ammonia in quantities exceeding the rule applicability threshold limits, therefore requiring the facility to develop a Risk Management Program and submit an associated plan.  Because anhydrous ammonia and associated processes is also subject to the OSHA-PSM standard and is not eligible for Program 1, the processes that contain this substance will be regulated as a program 3 process under the RMP rule.  Anhydrous ammonia is regulated as a toxic substance under the rule.  \n\n\n\nThere are no regulated flammable substances above their respective threshold quantities at this facility. \n\n        \n\nWorst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios:\n\n    \n\n    The RMP rule requires facilities containing Program 3 processes to provide a hazard assessment of the potential worst-case and alternative release scenarios involving the regulated substances.  The rule requires that a worst-case scenario representative of all toxic substances and an alternative release scenario for each toxic substance be evaluated and reported in the RMP.  Simp"

      "SummaryText": "lot has evaluated a worst-case scenario involving the largest vessel of anhydrous ammonia and has determined that the worst-case scenario is dictated by the catastrophic failure of one of pressurized anhydrous storage tanks.  This hypothetical release dictated by the rule involves the sudden failure and subsequent release of the contents of one tank, administratively controlled to 161.5 tons over a 10 minute time span.  This release is assumed to occur during worst-case release conditions of low wind speed, stable atmospheric conditions and maximum ambient temperature.  Assuming these conditions, the release was evaluated using EPA's RMPComp Tool.  The modeled results indicate that the impact from this hypothetical release will extend offsite, and under certain wind directions, could encompass public receptors.  In addition to the extremely unlikely probability of such a hypothetical scenario occurring, Simplot has numerous prevention and safety features including elevation of the storage tanks, concrete barriers around all storage tanks, a comprehensive inspection program, pressure relief and emergency shutoff valves and water fog nozzles in place in order to reduce the potential for this scenario. \n\n\n\nThe new ammonia manufacturing plant includes a new 18,000 ton atmospheric ammonia storage tank.  A second worst case release scenario has been added as an alternate release scenario for this tank, but the smaller pressurized tank still shows the largest hypothetical impact using the RMPComp Tool.  The new tank does have several layers of safety systems that greatly minimize the possibility of an accidental release including a large containment area and water and chemical suppression and a flare system.\n\n\n\nAlternative release scenarios should be modeled and be representative of scenarios that may have occurred or are more likely to occur.  The anhydrous ammonica process regulated under this rule has not had any previous accidental releases in the 31 year history of th"

      "SummaryText": "e facility, therefore the alternative release scenario for this chemical is also based on a hypothetical, although more likely potential scenario.  \n\n\n\nThe hypothetical anhydrous ammonia alternative release scenario consists of an accidental rupture of an 8-inch diameter overhead transfer pipe due to an impact from a mobile crane.  The scenario assumes that the pipe is completely severed, releasing anhydrous ammonia liquefied by pressure for approximately five minutes before the automatic shutoff valves cut off the flow and/or the control operator turns off the compressors.  The contents of the unblocked pipe length is assumed to subsequently drain out, prolonging the release slightly.  A total quantity of over 12,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia is estimated to be released.  This scenario was also modeled using the RMPComp Tool.  The impact of this scenario is predicted to extend offsite and under certain wind conditions, could potentially impact public receptors.  This release is highly unlikely to occur due to the general facility accident prevention program requiring all employees to be aware of potential dangers and other prevention steps in-place, such as signs and markings clearly indicating the location of the pipes and warning crane operators of potential danger.  \n\n\n\nThis alternate scenario is still applicable to the facility, even with the addition of the new manufacturing plant. Simplot Phosphates may add more alternative releases in future submissions once some practical experience with the plant is gained.\n\n\n\nAlthough both the worst-case and alternative release scenarios are hypothetical and unlikely to occur, Simplot is prepared to respond to any release at the facility through the implementation of its Emergency Response and Crisis Management Plan and deployment of the emergency rescue team and local response agencies, thus minimizing the impact of any release.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-specific Prevention Steps:\n\n\n\nThe pro"

      "SummaryText": "cesses and substances regulated by the RMP rule have also been subject to the OSHA-Process Safety Management (PSM) standard for many years.  Under the OSHA Program, the facility is required to develop a prevention program, which is equivalent to that required by the Risk Management Program rule. Simplot developed and implemented the prevention program in accordance with the OSHA-PSM requirements well before the RMP required them to do so.  The prevention programs for the covered processes establish a multi-element program and management policies and procedures which when implemented will facilitate the prevention of accidental releases and will minimize any potential release.  Simplot staff assigned to work on these processes are highly trained in the safe handling of all hazardous materials present at the facility, especially those in the covered processes. Each employee receives initial training and annual refreshers appropriate to the job when hired or when re-assigned. Additional PSM training was provided to most managers and supervisors in 2017.\n\n    \n\nIn addition to Training, the following prevention program elements inherent in the Process Safety Management (PSM) program have been implemented in all areas where anhydrous ammonia is present. The following elements of PSM decrease the likelihood of a release:\n\n\n\n(1)    Mechanical Integrity is a preventative maintenance program that assures the structural integrity of process vessels and piping.\n\n(2)    Hot Work Permits are required to prevent fires in areas where ammonia would be affected.\n\n(3)    Process Hazard Analyses are performed on all new processes and periodically on existing process that contain ammonia or chlorine.\n\n(4)    Management of Change procedures are followed in order to help prevent failure due to improper engineering or modifications.\n\n(5)    Operating Procedures are in place and operators are trained on these procedures.\n\n(6)    Incident Investigations are done on any accident or near miss to find possible chan"

A much more comprehensive PSM program was developed for the new ammonia manufacturing plant and some additional tools for information storage and sharing were added.\n\n\n\nFive-year Accident History:\n\n\n\nThe RMP rule requires that accidental releases of regulated substances from covered processes which resulted in prescribed onsite or offsite impacts be reported in the Risk Management Plan.\n\n    \n\nThe Rock Springs Plant has not had significant accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia with onsite or offsite consequences within the last five years.  The facility has not seen such a release in the 31 year history of operation.  This is a tribute to the effectiveness of the prevention programs implemented and the operators dedication to proper process control and adherence to the prevention program.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program:\n\n\n\nThe Simplot Rock Springs facility has established an Emergency Response Program, which includes a written Emergency Response and Crisis Management Plan in compliance with the RMP rule requirements, and other applicable emergency response programs.

However, the facility has expended much effort to assure that in the unlikely and unforeseeable circumstance of a release the proper emergency response mechanisms are in place to act quickly to minimize any release and potential consequences to plant staff, the public and the environment.  A more advance emergency notification system is currently being evaluated.\n\n\n\nContinuous Safety Improvement:\n\n\n\nAchieving a \"ZERO-INJURY\" workplace and protection of facility employees is the continuous goal of Simplot Phosphates LLC.  The Simplot Rock Springs plant has always had a recordable incident rate well below the industry average and the facility was accepted into Wyoming OSHA VPP program as a star status facility in 2008 and has maintained the required programs and incident rate to stay in the program in 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013.  The facility dropped out of the VPP program in 2014 and has been working on a more fundamentally sound safety culture.\n\n\n\nSafety training is an on-going process. The training consists of new employee orientation, safety/environmental/health training and fundamental skills and process/job specific training. A skill assessment is given to each employee in order to document a level of understanding.  In addition, the operating personnel for the new ammonia manufacturing plant have participated in a very robust training program that includes a process simulator.\n\n\n\nSimulated emergency and security drills are conducted by the facility's ERT and EHSS staff to maintain skills and update the level of knowledge as necessary.  The process prevention programs are systematically evaluated and improvements made continuously to enhance the reliability and safety of the process.\n\n"
