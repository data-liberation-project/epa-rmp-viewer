It is the policy of Columbia Fruit to adhere to all applicable federal and state safety and environmental regulations.\n\nColumbia Fruit's emergency response policy involves the preparation of response plans and training of employees. Columbia Fruit has trained its refrigeration personnel in hazardous materials response (24 hours).  This training includes emphasis on anhydrous ammonia, in addition to other requirements set forth in 29 CFR 1910.120(q) and WAC 296-62, Part P (HAZWOPER).\n\nAt Columbia Fruit, anhydrous ammonia is used on-site. Ammonia is considered hazardous by EPA and is listed on the Extremely Hazardous Substance (EHS) list.  Chemical properties of ammonia make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling ammonia in order to:\n7 Prevent unnecessary human exposure\n7 Reduce the threat to our personnel\n7 Reduce the threat to the community\n\nB. Facility and Regulated Substance Handled\n\nColumbia Fruit is a fruit packing and cold storage facility, located at 2575 Euclid Ave., Wenatchee, WA.  The facility is located in Chelan County.\n\nThe regulated substance used at Columbia Fruit is anhydrous ammonia (CAS# 7664-41-7). The use of anhydrous ammonia is as a refrigerant.\n\nThere are 12,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia in the refrigeration system.\n\nColumbia Fruit uses other hazardous substances on-site, however they do not meet or exceed the threshold limits established in 40 CFR 68.130.  Columbia Fruit has established policies, procedures and training to reduce the risk of an accidental hazardous substance release for the safety of its employees and surrounding areas.\n\n C.Worst-Case and Alternative Scenarios\n\nThe off-site consequence analysis co"

The worst case scenario is defined by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which states that \"the owner or operator shall assume that the maximum quantity in the largest vessel is released \".  The alternative scenario is defined as \"more likely to occur than the worst case scenario\".\n\nWorst-Case Scenario. - Failure of the largest vessel would release 11,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia. The release would occur inside the compressor room, which is not in direct contact with the outside. Although for modeling purposes, no mitigation was taken into account.  While building mitigation was not used, the building containment would be a substantial mitigation factor.  Modeling was done by use of RMP-COMP.\n\nThe distance to the EPA end-point is off-site\n\nAlternative Release Scenario - For the alternative scenario, it was assumed that the system would loose its entire inventory over a 6-minute period, without any mitigation.  Modeling was done by use of RMP-COMP.\n\nThe distance to the EPA end-point is off-site\n\nBoth the \"worst-case\" and \"alternative\" scenarios are highly unlikely due to the safety systems employed on the refrigeration system\n\nA more realistic scenario would be that of a pressure relief valve lifting, discharging ammonia vapor from vents on top of the building and the EPA end-point just extends past the boundaries of the plant.\n\nColumbia Fruit has coordinated notification procedures with the Chelan County Fire District 1 Fire Chief.\n\nD.General Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nColumbia Fruit's accidental release prevention program is based on the following key elements:\n7 High level of training of personnel\n7 Preventative maintenance program\n7 Written safety procedures and safety equipment\n7 Use of accurate and effective written operating procedures\n\n Columbia Fruit also complies with: \n7 OSHA's and Washington State's process safety management rule.\n7 Appli"

Piping is elevated to prevent accidental damage to the system from moving vehicles.  Engine room doors are tight fitting and open outwards.  Other safety devices Columbia Fruit utilizes include:\n7 Computerized controls, which can be operated remotely\n7 Suction trap hi-level float\n7 High discharge pressure shut down\n7 Low suction pressure shut down\n7 High discharge temperature shut down\n7 Oil pressure failure shut down\n7 High amperes shut down\n7 Automatic timer to prevent short cycling\n7 Oil filters plugged shut down\n7 250 psi relief valves on high pressure side, to prevent overpressure situations\n7 150 psi relief valves on low pressure side, to prevent overpressure situations\n7 Emergency ventilation\nOperating Procedures have been prepared by Columbia Fruit to be used by employees performing operational functions.  The operating procedures are kept in the refrigeration manager's office.  These procedures include: \n7 Pre-start up procedures\n7 Routine operations\n7 Maintenance\n7 Response to minor releases\n7 Emergency action plan\n\nE.Five-Year Accident History\n\nColumbia Fruit has not had any accidents involving ammonia in the last five years.\n\n F. Emergency Response Program\n\nIn addition to the operating procedures, Columbia Fruit has established Emergency Response Guidelines for releases involving ammonia.  These procedures are part of the ongoing training. \n\nRefrigeration personnel have received appropriate technician level training from the Ammonia Safety Training Institute (ASTI).\n\nG. Planned Safety Improvements\n\nCurrently, Columbia Fruit plans to install separate audible alarms for both fire and an ammonia release.  These will "
