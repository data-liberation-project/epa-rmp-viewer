      "SummaryText": "The Airgas USA, LLC facility located in Harrisburg, PA stores and distributes Acetylene cylinders. Acetylene is stored on site in quantities that exceed the Threshold Quantity for Acetylene. (Defined in Part 68.130 of the EPA Risk Management Program Rule).  \n\n\n\nThe Worst Case release scenario for the Acetylene process did not affect the public. There are no public receptors within the distance to the end point from a worst case release scenario. The Acetylene storage is EPA RMP Program level 3. \n\n\n\nStorage is in excess of OSHA PSM Threshold Quantity and is therefore a Program Level 3 process.  The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies for the Harrisburg facility are located in the Process Safety and Risk Management binders. Airgas' Process Safety and Risk Management Program provides instructions for implementing processes that produce employee participation, RMP related deliverables, and training activities that are compliant with 40 CFR Part 68.\n\n\n\nAt the time this Executive Summary was written, the covered process had not been involved with an accidental release that could have lead to property damage, catastrophic consequence, injury, or death within the past 5 years. In addition, an accidental release had not lead to a response or restoration activity for an exposure of an environmental receptor.\n\n\n\nEmployees of the Harrisburg facility site will not respond to accidental releases of regulated substances.  The facility has an evacuation plan and has coordinated emergency response activities with Swatara Township, PA fire department. The review of the acetylene PHA produced no recommendations to improve safety. At the time this Executive Summary was written, there were no additional plans for improvement."
