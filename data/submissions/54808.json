Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nFoothill Orange Coast Chemical (also \"FOCC\") stores and repackages chlorine, which is considered a hazardous material that is a regulated substance and is considered in this Risk Management Plan (RMP).  The properties of chlorine make it necessary to observe safety precautions in handling chlorine to prevent human exposure, and to reduce the threat to the facility's workers and nearby members of the community.  It is the facility's policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the safe procedures used to handle chlorine; the safety devices and systems designed and constructed into the facility; and the training of pertinent personnel.  FOCC has Emergency Response Procedures in the office at the site, which includes procedures for reporting hazardous chemical accidents or releases and the emergency contact telephone numbers.  FOCC has Emergency Medical and First Aid Response Procedures, which are a quick reference for employees and office personnel on what to do if a person is exposed to chlorine gas, as well as Emergency Respirator Procedures, which detail how to use the emergency respirator (escape mask) in the event of an accidental  release.   \n\nFOCC's Emergency Action Plan is in Section N of the PSM, and its Emergency Response Plan is filed with local agencies as directed.  Employees will respond only to incidental releases and the Upland Fire Department has agreed to be the first responder for emergencies.  When filling cylinders with chlorine, safety goggles/glasses, gloves, an emergency shower, eye wash and an emergency escape respirator are available.  Employees test the System using ammonia for leak detection prior to filling the system with chlorine from the ton container.  A chlorine leak detector with sensor and audible alarm is also installed for early warning of any leak.  A verbal notification system is in place to alert personnel and"

Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nFOCC provides chlorination service to swimming pools.  Chlorine is repackaged at the facility from one-ton containers to twenty pound net capacity service cylinders in accordance with the Chlorine Institute's Chlorine Manual.  The twenty pound cylinders are used by the facility's service staff to chlorinate customer swimming pools. The company typically operates five days a week (M-F) and 50 weeks per year.\n\nThe Facility consists of an office and a warehouse, with the fill area at the back end of the facility.  One building is a dedicated office building and the other building is used for storage of supplies and vehicles.  There is a fire wall behind the warehouse, and the repackaging and storage of chlorine are exclusively in this area.  The driveway and yard area provide adequate room for the delivery and parking of delivery vehicles during the off-loading of full one-ton containers and the loading of the empty one-ton containers.   \n\nThe fill yard area is removed, and is not exposed to vehicular traffic.  All of the chlorine containers are stored in the fill yard area, which is surrounded by a high fence and is locked after normal working hours.  Company policy does not allow unauthorized personnel entry into the facility.  Signs are posted indicating a restricted area, and the entire facility is surrounded by another locked fence.  Container handling and storage is per applicable local, state and federal regulations. \n\nThe amount of chlorine packaged per month is seasonally dependent.  The summer months are the busiest swim times of the year and the quantity of chlorine on site is highest during this period. FOCC stores a maximum of 18,000 pounds of chlorine which exceeds, which exceeds the Federal threshold of 2,500 pounds.  This amount includes t"

Delivery of one-ton containers is during normal working hours.  The one-ton containers, up to a maximum of 6, are stored and/or used in  the fill yard area beyond the fire wall.  \n\nOff-loading of the one-ton containers from the commercial delivery vehicle is accomplished with a crane/hoist or a lift gate.  The one-ton containers are placed on the rails in the fill yard area.  The one-ton containers are manually rolled to the desired location and chocked to prevent movement.  The ton container in process is chained to prevent movement during any potential seismic activity.  Empty and full twenty pound cylinders are segregated and are chained or strapped into place in an upright position.  The company has administrative procedures in place that limit the amount of chlorine at the facility to no more than a maximum of 18,000 pounds.  The procedure, in part, requires the owner/operator to verify existing chlorine inventory to ensure that an order and delivery of a one-ton container will not cause the aggregate quantity to exceed 18,000 pounds.  The fill area is also designed such that the rails only hold a maximum of six (6) tons on site.\n\nChlorine is repackaged from one-ton containers into twenty pound net-capacity, DOT approved cylinders.  Any residual chlorine is directed into a liquid caustic absorption tank through a vacuum system.  The twenty pound cylinders are transported by company service vehicles to customer's swimming pools where the service personnel dispense the chlorine as a gas into the pool.   \n\nThe receipt, storage, and repackaging of chlorine is considered a single process.

The transfer system is operated under pressure from the ton container.  Filling commences by opening the one-ton container liquid valve, the cylinder valve, and various other proprietary and confidential steps in the transfer assembly.  After filling, which is indicated by weight on the pan scale reaching the desired value, the transfer tubing is evacuated into the chlorine absorption system prior to disconnecting the full service cylinder.  The caustic solution comprising the absorption medium is prevented from being sucked back into the system using the unique design of the proprietary and confidential chlorine packaging system.  Operational and test procedures are in place which ensure that the vacuum system is operating correctly.  \n\nChlorine is not vented to the atmosphere.  Full twenty pound cylinders are stored in the packaging area until loaded onto delivery trucks.  Transport and loading of the cylinders adheres to DOT and other regulations.\n\nFilling is done by trained, qualified personnel.  Written fill procedures exist and are followed.

Five Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no reportable releases of chlorine in the last five years.\n\n6.  Emergency Response Plan\n\nThe emergency response program is based upon alerting personnel at the facility to evacutate the facility and await the arrival of local emergency responders at the evacuation assembly location if a reportable release occurs.  FOCC's Emergency Response Plan is located at the fill yard / office as a quick reference for how to handle an emergency, and has also been filed with local agencies as directed.  \n\n7.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nFOCC's Process Hazard Analysis element of the Process Safety Management (PSM) was recently updated as indicated in Section E of the PSM in conjunction with the local CUPA.
