Building on established corporate policies, this facility has developed and follows an OSHA process safety management plan that complies with the level 3 prevention program requirements.\r\n\r\nSiemens demonstrates its management's commitment to safety through the efforts of corporate and facility safety personnel. Through safety committee meetings, internal audits1 and monitoring of new regulatory and industry developments, Siemens meets or exceeds process safety requirements. For compliance with 40 CFR 68. Our facility maintains a PSM/RMP team which meets at least monthly. Our policies and procedures are reviewed by the team on a 12 month cycle. All Management of Changes and Pre-Startup Safety Reviews are reviewed by the team before filing. Siemens also utilizes the expertise of outside contractors to provide the guidance that the facility requires along with updates from various regulatory reviews to insures continued compliance.\r\n\r\n\r\nFacility and regulated substance:\r\n\r\nSiemens Mishawaka Plant is part of Siemens HealthCare Diagnostics Point of Care Division. It manufactures self-testing products for blood glucose and point-of-care products such as urine chemistry analyzers and reagent strips to test for indication of kidney and liver disease.\r\n\r\nProcess cooling and the cooling of office areas is accomplished with a refrigeration system charged with anhydrous ammonia. It is a dosed loop system capable of producing up to 1,800 tons of refrigeration. Anhydrous ammonia is compressed to approximately 180 psig and condensed with the help of water-cooled evaporative condensers. Liquid ammonia from the condensers is collected and stored in two receivers from which it is then transferred on demand to chillers to cool glycol which then provides cooling to work areas and processes.

To achieve and maintain this compliance, Siemens has in place many procedural and technological safeguards. The procedural safeguards include an extensive employee training program and detailed operating and maintenance procedures for those employees involved in operating the covered process. The technological safeguards include level controls, sensors, alarms, relief valves, and redundant systems. All of these serve to prevent unintended releases of ammonia, or at least minimize the effects of a release.\r\n\r\n\r\nFive-year accident history:\r\n\r\nThis facility has had no accidental releases of ammonia 'which meet the criteria of 98.42 of the RMP ruler. However, other incident investigation program is a 2-tiered program which assure all reports of ammonia odor are documented.\r\n\r\n\r\nEmergency response program:\r\n\r\nThe facility has developed a written emergency response and preparedness plan that is coordinated with the local emergency responders. The Mishawaka City Fire Department or the South Bend Hazmat Team is the primary responder. Their response is triggered by phone communication. Siemens employees handle incidental releases of ammonia and are trained and equipped to do so.\r\n\r\nThe emergency response and preparedness plan Includes procedures for reporting emergencies, notifying the public, evacuation/ system shutdown, and post-response, or cleanup, activities.

The Mishawaka Plant Security Command Center is staffed continuously. Fire alarms and firefighting sprinkler systems are provided throughout the facility. These are connected to the Plant Security Command Center. In addition, there is a deluge system that can be used to mitigate a release of ammonia. Automated process controls are also available to mitigate any ammonia release as well as manual intervention systems to be used as needed.\r\n\r\nPlanned changes to improve safety:\r\n\r\nThe maintenance and improvement of safety is an ongoing job at this facility. Training in matters of safety takes place throughout the year. Safety-related recommendations from employees, whether made during formal sessions like process hazard analysis or made upon observation of a potential hazard, are always considered carefully for Implementation. This process is continuous and, even at times when no major process changes are anticipated, existing safety systems and procedures are fine-tuned as a matter of course.\r\n\r\nPlanned maintenance and upgrades to the facility are regularly completed. Several Management of Changes have been initiated to improve our process. Additional changes will be initiated as potential hazards are identified."
