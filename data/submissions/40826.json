This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  At the time of this filing, the FHR refineries in Corpus Christi continue to enjoy a safety record paramount in the refining industry of greater than seven million man-hours without a lost-time work injury. This RMP is for FHR West Refinery in Corpus Christi, Texas.  The FHR East Refinery is addressed in a separate EPA RMP submittal.\n\nThe FHR facility at Corpus Christi performs a number of processing functions that would traditionally be classified as Petrochemical Refining and Specialty Chemical Processing.  For the remainder of this submittal, the FHR West refinery in Corpus Christi will be referred to as 'FHR' and the primary processing function at the facility will be generically referred to as 'Refining'.\n\nFHR has enjoyed a nearly perfect safety record, and our emergency response capabilities are among the best in the refining industry.  The cornerstones of our emergency response capabilities include a 24-hour, 365 day/year, fully paid, in-plant industrial emergency response group (Refinery Terminal Fire Company - RTFC).   In addition, due to the Corpus Christi Port Industrial consortium, over one hundred trained emergency responders could be deployed with state-of-the-art emergency response equipment within an hour if necessary.

CAN is a computerized calling network that is capable of making multiple phone calls simultaneously to pre-determined calling zones.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nFHR operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products (e.g., natural gas, propane, butane, condensate) from raw crude oil.  The refinery has several regulated flammables, such as propane, butane, etc.  In addition, the refinery uses hydrogen fluoride (HF) which is also regulated toxic EPA RMP substances.\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT RESULTS AND FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY (KPG WEST REFINERY)\n\nProgram Level 3 Toxic Scenarios\n\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with toxic substances in the refinery is a catastrophic failure at the HF Alkylation Unit of the HF turnaround storage tank, resulting in a significant release of HF gas over a 10-minute period.  Although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage the consequences, no credit for engineered or administrative controls or passive mitigation measures was taken into account in evaluating this scenario.  The maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.016 mg per liter could be as far as 22 miles for the WCS. \n\nThe HF Alkylation Unit alternative release scenario (ARS) is a tandem pump seal failure of the second stage HF acid circulation pump.  The duration of the potential accident scenario is the assumed time necessary to isolate and mitigate the release event e.g., 15-minutes.  Early detection and mitigation of the HF release would be facilitated by the presence of HF detectors, shutdown/isolation valves and remotely controlled water spray monitor network capable of delivering 9,000 gallons per minute of water when needed.  The 15-minute response time is a conservative estimate and it is likely the response and mitigation time would be much less given the refinery's HF detection and mitigation systems.

Although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage the consequences, no credit for engineered or administrative controls or passive mitigation measures was taken into account in evaluating this scenario; therefore, the full tank inventory is assumed to be released, completely vaporize, and resulting VCE occurs.  The maximum impact distance to the 1-psi endpoint could be as far as 1.8 miles for the WCS.  \n\nFor all of the ARS reviewed, none have offsite impacts to residential public receptors; however, one commercial receptor could be impacted.  The ARS scenario postulates a propane release from a storage tank (FB-210) over a 15-minute period and an ensuing VCE occurs. The 15-minute release duration is the maximum time necessary to isolate and mitigate the release scenario.  The maximum potential distance to the 1-psi endpoint could be as far as 0.18 miles.  \n\nProgram Level 1 Flammable WCS\n\nOf the units reviewed for RMP qualification, seven refinery-processing units were determined to be Program 1.  This category of units includes the following process areas: (1) Treaters, (2) HDS, (3) Cumene, (4) Coker, (5) West Crude, (6) #1 Sat Gas, and (7) UDEX Complex.  Potential offsite consequences for these units range from 0.1 miles to 0.3 miles impact distances assuming a 1 psi endpoint threshold.  For each scenario it was assumed that mixed light end hydrocarbons (C3-C5) were released and an ensuing VCE occurs.

Because processes at the refinery that are regulated by the EPA RMP rule are also subject to the OSHA PSM standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.  For all process units containing threshold quantities (TQs) of highly hazardous chemicals (HHCs) per OSHA PSM, the programs summarized below are applied equally to EPA RMP covered and EPA RMP non-covered process units.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nFHR encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the refinery accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the refinery and addresses each accident prevention program element.  In addition, the refinery has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and employee safety issues.  These initiatives include forming teams to promote both process and personal safety.  The teams typically have members from various areas of the refinery, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and refinery management.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nFHR keeps a number of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.

The majority of the information that is maintained by the records department is available on the FHR Intranet.  \n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDS) that are maintained on the FHR Intranet.  This information specifically addresses known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For specific process areas, the refinery has documented safety-related limits for certain process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in the unit operating procedures, which can be found on the FHR Intranet.  The refinery maintains these parameters within defined limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems). \n\nThe refinery also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nWithin the PHA program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and confirm that adequate controls are in place to manage potential hazards.  FHR primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform the majority of the PHA evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The an"

The PHA team is led by a leader with experience and qualification in the HAZOP analysis technique.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. \n\nThe PHA team findings are typically addressed by assigning action items to PHA team members responsible for managing unresolved issues during the PHA.  Implementation of action items in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All PHA action items are tracked and maintained in FHR Intranet software, Koch Incident Tracking System (KITS).  Within this software, each employee assigned an action is responsible for execution of the action item by an assigned target date.  If the employee neglects or forgets to execute their action item, they are automatically reminded via email of their assigned action and upcoming due date.  For delinquent action items supervisors are emailed notification of employee's outstanding action items and the supervisor is responsible for taking appropriate action.  The completion of action items at FHR is considered a minimum expectation of all employees and if not completed will decrease an employee's performance pay.\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, FHR periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.

These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The procedures are maintained current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process or FHR's \"Operating Procedure Review/Approval Process (5/99; Rev 0)\" procedure.\n\nIn addition, FHR maintains upper and lower safe operating limits for all process equipment in the Unit Operating Procedures and provides guidance on how to respond to upper or lower limit exceedances for specific process or equipment parameters.  This information, along with written operating procedures is available on the FHR Intranet and at each control room area.\n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, FHR has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in refinery operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing the basic training, an operator in training is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.

Before a contract employer is accepted at FHR, the contract employer is asked to complete a pre-qualification form (PQF) indicating the contract employers' safety record in industry.  The PQF is FHR's initial screening process for accepting a contract employer to work at the refinery and also used as an ongoing screening tool to renew and approve continued support from contract employers.  \n\nBecause some contractors work on or near process equipment, the refinery has procedures in place designed to oversee that contractors:\n? perform work in a safe manner, \n? have the appropriate knowledge and skills, \n? are aware of the hazards in their workplace, \n? understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, \n? understand and follow site safety rules, and \n? inform refinery personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.  \nThis is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to beginning work.  In addition, FHR evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.  Refinery personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\nFHR conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.

The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to refinery management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked and maintained in KITS.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings.  Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHA revalidations. \n\nCompliance Audits\n\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, FHR periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.
