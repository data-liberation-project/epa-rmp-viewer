This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our objective is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control, contain and mitigate the release.\n\n\n\nAnchorage Chemical Terminal (ACT), a chemical terminal for the storage and distribution of chemicals products, is owned by Exxon Mobil Corporation (ExxonMobil) and operated by Intercontinental Terminals Company, LLC (ITC).  ACT follows ExxonMobil's structured safety management system entitled Operations Integrity Management System (OIMS).\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nThe Anchorage Chemical Terminal employs 30 associates who live and work in the Port Allen, LA and surrounding areas.  In business at the same location since 1977, the company is a bulk storage/distribution facility for LPG-like chemicals.  Butadiene is shipped to companies around the United States, who in turn use the chemical to manufacture products like tires, automotive parts, roofing materials, wire and cable coating, etc.  Propylene, which is shipped primarily to local users, is a key ingredient to produce plastic and rubber products.  \n\n\n\nACT is a storage and shipping/receiving facility.  The chemicals typically stored or handled onsite on a day to day basis exceeding the ARP threshold quantities include 1,3-Butadiene, Crude Butadiene, Chemical Grade Propylene, and Dilute Propylene.

Isobutylene in quantities exceeding threshold is occasionally off-loaded directly from ships to tank cars.  1,3-Butadiene (stabilized), BRCP Offspec Green Oil, Mixed Butylenes, and Crude Isoprene are on site occasionally and are unloaded from tank cars into the Crude Butadiene storage unit (Sphere 697) and transferred out via pipeline as a Crude Butadiene mixture.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\n\n\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the Anchorage Chemical Terminal.  EPA's Program 3 prevention requirements were implemented because the covered process at the terminal meet Program 3 criteria and are also subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.  In addition, Anchorage Chemical Terminal has implemented Operations Integrity Management Systems (OIMS) that includes the aspects of EPA's prevention program.  Further, OIMS has been attested as equivalent to ISO 14001 as a valid management system to oversee the implementation of the risk management activities.\n\n\n\nAdditional details are included in the Data Element section of the RMP plan. Due to the ongoing nature of our safety program, the dates associated with the various activities in our accident prevention program are constantly changing.  We selected March 1, 2019 as the benchmark for last activity conducted.  Consequently, most of the reviews/updates conducted after that date are not reflected in the Data Element information.\n\n\n\nEMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION\n\n\n\nThe Anchorage Chemical Terminal encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling operating "

This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n\n\nPROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS\n\n\n\nThe Anchorage Chemical Terminal has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\n\n\nThe Anchorage Chemical Terminal primarily uses the Knowledge Based Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) study that is an adaptation by ExxonMobil Research and Engineering and ExxonMobil Chemical of widely used industry methodologies to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating experience and engineering expertise on the process to be evaluated.  This PHA team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when appropriate.\n\n\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local management for resolution.

New employees receive basic training in terminal operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with an experienced operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After employees demonstrate (e.g. through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operations personnel periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained.  This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\n\n\n\n\nCONTRACTORS\n\n\n\nThe Anchorage Chemical Terminal uses contractors to supplement its workforce.   Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the terminal has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) "

In addition, the Anchorage Chemical Terminal evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.  Terminal personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\n\n\nPRE-STARTUP SAFETY REVIEWS (PSSR'S)\n\n\n\nThe Anchorage Chemical Terminal conducts a PSSR for any facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information and therefore, is controlled by management of change (MOC).  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves as a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\n\n\nMECHANICAL INTEGRITY\n\n\n\nThe Anchorage Chemical Terminal has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.

Written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training.  Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended, and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g. adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels).  If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or an MOC team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\n\n\n\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance.  The Anchorage Chemical Terminal incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs.  This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHot Work\n\n\n\nThe Anchorage Chemical Terminal has a work permit system in place to protect personnel, site facilities, and the surrounding community.
