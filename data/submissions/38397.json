              "Description": "The Process Safety Management Program at the King County South Treatment Plant (STP) was put into place to prevent accidental release of hazardous chemicals, to protect workers, the nearby community and the environment from exposure. The program was reviewed in 2002, by conducting the scheduled audit. The purpose of the audit was to determine if the program elements meet the regulatory requirements and to suggest improvements in the program elements that would strengthen the program. Management has addressed the findings and is working to implement the recommendations, where appropriate. Through the work of South Treatment Plant Management and staff, two of the formerly covered toxic chemicals (chlorine and sulfurdioxide) were replaced with sodium hypochlorite, a less toxic, non-covered chemical. This action has greatly reduced the possibility of hazards to the community and environmental receptors.",

The facility complies with regulations and good engineering practices in the operation of one process which has a greater than threshold quantity of a hazardous chemical as defined in the RMP requirements.  This process is the digester gas system, which contains methane, a flammable mixture.\nThe STP has de-commissioned its Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide systems and currently disinfects and de-chlorinates with non-regulation covered chemicals. It is the policy of King County to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws in the operation of the remaining covered process, and to design and operate the system in accordance with industry standards to protect workers, visitors, and the public. The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the STP are implemented by King County?s Department of Natural Resources and Parks, Wastewater Treatment Division.  If an accidental release to the atmosphere were to occur, it is the policy of the King County DNRP, WTD to notify the Renton Fire Department HAZMAT and request that they respond to the emergency.\n\nThe STP is an integrated sewage treatment facility that provides both primary and secondary treatment of domestic and industrial wastewater prior to discharge to Puget Sound.  The 88-acre site takes in water from 19 pump stations on the east and south sides of Lake Washington, an area of about 140 square miles.  The plant capacity is approximately 70 million gallons of sewage per day.  Sodium Hypochlorite (a non-covered chemical) disinfects all of the wastewater following treatment before being pumped to Puget Sound.  The digester gas results from the anaerobic biological waste treatment in the secondary treatment system.  The methane from the dig"

      "SummaryText": "ester gas is compressed and sold to a commercial pipeline for use as domestic natural gas.\n\n\nThe general and accidental release prevention programs for the digester gas system is implemented by the staff of the King County Department of Natural Resources and Parks, specifically the staff and management of the STP.  The facility complies with EPA?s accident prevention rules, and known applicable state and local rules.  The piping system for handling the digester gas prior to introduction to the commercial natural gas pipeline is designed and installed according to standard industry practice.\n\nThe STP has not had a reportable accident in the last five years that involved deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, or sheltering in place.  Procedures and policies are in place to record any such future events.\n\nThe emergency response program has evolved from successful existing programs to assure worker safety at the facility.  It is the policy of the King County DNRP, WTD to notify the Renton Fire Department and request they respond to emergency conditions at the facility.  This policy has been discussed with the fire department and they are aware of the specific chemical that exceeds threshold quantities.\n\nThe WTD has developed a Process Safety Management Program manual to centralize safety information and better ensure existing RMP program elements are being properly implemented at the site.  Periodic formal audits are conducted to assure that the program is being implemented properly."
