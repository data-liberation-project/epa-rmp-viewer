MZ is committed to being a responsible member of the Martinez and greater Contra Costa County communities. We place a high priority on operating our facility in a safe, healthful, and environmentally sound manner.\n\nShell requirements dictate their facilities continually identify methods to reduce the use of hazardous materials, evaluate risk, and reduce the risk to the community and environment through implementation of process design, engineering controls, and safe work practices and procedures. This commitment to healthy, safe, secure and environmentally sound operations is documented in the Shell HSSE (Health, Safety, Security, and the Environment) Commitment and Policy (Attachment 1). The MZ Risk Management Program (RMP) is incorporated into this HSSE Commitment and Policy through the MZ Health, Safety, Security, and Environmental Management System or HSSE-MS. Specific Plant RMP-related action items are identified, evaluated, resourced, and checked via an action tracking tool. These documents, as well as other related materials are readily available to all workers.\n\nMZ stresses safe, healthful, secure, and environmentally sound operations via an annual employee training program and various safety meetings. MZ has a Health, Safety, Security, and Environmental (HSSE) and Administrative Procedures Manual that comprehensively covers various aspects of management systems conformance. Each employee and field contractor at MZ also receive a Basic HSSE Requirements Handbook. Shell also maintains internal HSSE Audit and Management Review programs under its HSSE-MS. Plant, Corporate, and Contract Personnel conduct internal audits at various time intervals (weekly to once every 3-5 years). Management reviews occur continually throughout the year and are formalized annually.\n\n****"

      "SummaryText": "A Description of the Martinez Catalyst Plant and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nMZ consists of 2 main batch processes: Ethylene Oxide (EO) Catalyst and RM-17. The EO Catalyst Process produces a silver-based catalyst sold to industrial customers that convert hydrocarbons to ethylene oxide. A specially formulated impregnating solution is produced at MZ and absorbed onto carrier pellets to make the EO Catalyst products. \n\nMZ has a selective catalyst reduction (SCR) process to reduce emissions of oxides of nitrogen (NOx) from the EO Catalyst Process and associated pollution abatement devices. As part of this system, MZ has an aqueous ammonia addition system, consisting of a storage tank, unloading station with pump, and transfer system with pumps and filters. In this operation, aqueous ammonia is pumped, filtered, and directly injected into the process gas stream to convert NOx into nitrogen and water prior to discharge to the atmosphere. The aqueous ammonia is consumed in the process. This system uses tank (393V), which is purposed for aqueous ammonia service. The aqueous ammonia system unloading pump and supply pumps have been specified for the aqueous ammonia system. \n\nThe RM-17 product is manufactured by reacting a proprietary raw material (containing toluene as a carrier) with a heavy olefin in the presence of a liquid catalyst. A series of simple distillation steps removes the lighter boiling components (including the toluene). The purified product is then shipped to other Shell Chemical facilities for further use in the process of manufacturing detergent products.\n\nPlease note for the purposes of this CalARP document, accidental release scenarios have only been determined for CalARP regulated substances. However, the management system, prevention program, and emergency response elements discussed later in the document apply to the entire MZ Site.\n\n****Accidental Release Management System Program/Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps \n\n**Management System\nMZ has d"

They also verify all equipment is designed, maintained, inspected, tested, and operated in a safe manner.\n\n****PROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS\n\nBy systematically examining and identifying process safety hazards associated with the operation of a covered process, MZ has been able to plan and take appropriate action to improve the safety of our workers, the community, and the environment. MZ has performed a PHA covering the EO Catalyst Process every 5 years since 1999, with the last one conducted in 2024. The PHA for the aqueous ammonia process was conducted in July 2017 and updated in 2019 and will be revalidated every five years thereafter.\n\nThe purpose of the PHA is to:\n\n\u0095\tIdentify hazards.\n\u0095\tIdentify credible human errors and/or equipment failures that could lead to an external event.\n\u0095\tEvaluate the likelihood and/or consequence of various scenarios.\n\u0095\tDetermine if existing chemical specific prevention steps/controls are adequate, and, where existing controls are inadequate, identify additional steps that can be taken to control the hazard.\n\nIn accordance with Section 2760.2 of the CalARP regulations, MZ consulted with Contra Costa County Health Services Department (CCCHSD) and determined the guideword Hazard and Operability Study (HAZOP) methodology was the approach best suited for the PHAs of the EO Catalyst and Aqueous Ammonia Processes.

The Green Valley fault is approximately 2.5 miles northeast of the site. The Hayward fault is within 12 miles of the site to the west. The Concord and Green Valley faults have a potential to create most of the earthquake concern for the site. The Green Valley-Concord fault has a 16 percent probability of one or more greater-than-6.7-magnitude earthquakes between 2014 and 2043, and the Rodgers\u0092 Creek-Hayward fault has a 33 percent probability of one or more greater-than-6.7-magnitude earthquakes between 2014 and 2043. These faults, particularly the Concord fault, create most of the earthquake concern at the Martinez Site.\n\nAccording to the ABAG (Associated Bay Area Government) Liquefaction Susceptibility Map, the potential for liquefaction at MZ is very low. The ground surface at MZ includes soils that have been disrupted, modified, removed, built over, or filled with crushed rock or other material resistant to weathering, such as blacktop (asphaltic compounds), concrete, or compacted gravel, sand, silt and clay. Soil conditions are considered to be alternating layers of claystone, siltstone, and sandstone varying from dense to very dense. Based on this information, the S"

Recommendations from the incident investigation will be communicated through a variety of meetings (HSSE Committee, Employee Team Meetings Leadership Team, Plant Manager update) to the employees (including contractors), the county, the public, and the surrounding neighbors as applicable to the incident. \n\nAn incident investigation report includes:\n\u0095\tDescription\n\u0095\tStatus\n\u0095\tResponsible Department\n\u0095\tEvent Type\n\u0095\tIncident Sub Types\n\u0095\tResponsible Supervisor\n\u0095\tDate of Incident\n\u0095\tDate Reported\n\u0095\tCreated By\n\u0095\tDate Created\n\u0095\tLasted Updated By\n\u0095\tLast Update\n\u0095\tImmediate Actions Taken\n\u0095\tActivity Types\n\u0095\tLocation\n\u0095\tFor any qualifying CalARP incidents, any additional information listed in California Code of Regulations Chapter 19 Section 2750.9(b) relating to CalARP.\n\n**Employee Participation\nMZ relies on the expertise of employees (including hourly and contract employees) at all levels and disciplines to optimize operations and safety and maintain an effective release prevention program. This is achieved by consulting with (i.e., exchanging information with, and soliciting input and participation from) personnel to ensure consideration of their knowledge and experience in all applicable areas of the prevention program. MZ has developed a written employee participation plan (HSSE-002) that satisfies the requirements of OSHA PSM and the requirements of Section 2760.1 of the CalARP regulation.

The intent of this information exchange is to create an informed community while also documenting accidental releases are investigated, and concrete changes are made to protect against reoccurrence. \n\nDuring the 2024 PHA and the County Cal-ARP (2Q 2022), SPHERA incident investigation reports back to 2017 were reviewed. The objective was to identify accidental releases of EDA that resulted or could have resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage onsite, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage. No accidental releases of EPA or Cal-ARP regulated substances (e.g., EDA or Ammonium Hydroxide) were identified that met these criteria.\n\n****THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nOverall safety at MZ is governed not only by the ability to prevent accidental releases of regulated substances from occurring, but also by the ability to mitigate any accidental releases. MZ has implemented an emergency response program to minimize the effects of accidental releases on employees, the public, and the environment.
