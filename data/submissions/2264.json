Best Kosher Foods Corporation\u0012s operations include the processing of meat products (kosher meats) for public consumption.  Best Kosher Foods Corporation has been in operation at this facility for over 30 years providing quality meat products and over 250 jobs to the local community.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICY\n\nBest Kosher Foods Corporation is committed to protecting the health of its employees, the surrounding community, and the environment; therefore it is Best Kosher Foods Corporation\u0012s policy to manage a safe and healthy workplace, protect the environment and maintain compliance with safety, health, and environmental regulations: 40 CFR 68 as well as Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations promulgated as Title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 1910, Section 119 (29 CFR 1910.119), and OSHA\u0012s Hazardous Operations and Emergency Response regulations (29 CFR 1910.120).\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCES AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nBest Kosher Foods Corporation is required to maintain low temperatures in the food processing areas of the plant that are within standards required by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) to ensure quality in the final products.  Best Kosher Foods Corporation uses anhydrous ammonia (the 112(r) regulated substance) as a refrigerant to maintain the  facility within the required range of operating temperatures.  Anhydrous ammonia is an industry-standard refrigerant.  Best Kosher Foods Corporation\u0012s refrigeration system consists of receivers, compressors, evaporators, condensers, and piping.\n\nWORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nAs required by 40 CFR 68 Subpart B, Best Kosher"

      "SummaryText": "Foods Corporation has evaluated a worst-case release scenario for anhydrous ammonia using the parameters specified by the EPA.  Best Kosher Foods Corporation\u0012s worst case release scenario is the rupture of the largest single receiver when filled to 57.9% capacity (maximum fill capacity per administrative controls) over a 10-minute period.  Using the National Safety Council\u0012s ALOHA program, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint includes offsite receptors.  The worst-case release scenario was developed following EPA regulations and is not considered to be a likely release scenario.\n\nATERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nA more realistic release scenario (alternative release) was developed by Best Kosher Foods Corporation taking into consideration the 5-year history of operation\u0012s experience and the hazards identified in the process hazard analyses (PHAs) conducted to ensure that (company) hazards are identified and minimized.  These analyses were conducted under the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations promulgated as Title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations Chapter 1910, Section 119 (29 CFR 1910.119).  The most likely release scenario identified by Best Kosher Foods Corporation would be a release caused by a damaged ammonia pipe.  The release could occur as a result of a leak from a pipe connected to the pressurized tank.  In developing the release parameters of this alternative scenario, Best Kosher Foods Corporation considered that the release would occur from a 0.5-inch diameter pipe/valve, located 5 feet from the tank bottom.  Using the ALOHATM program, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint extends offsite.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is designed and constructed in accordance with ANSI/IIAR 2-1992 Standard for Equipment, Design, And Installation of Ammonia Mechanical Refrigerating Systems.  To prevent and mitigate accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia,"

Best Kosher Foods Corporation encourages employee participation in development of the control measures used at the plant by means of verbal discussion and training sessions. Written management of change procedures have been established by Best Kosher Foods Corporation.\n\nBest Kosher Foods Corporation understands that maintaining the refrigeration system in good working order is essential to preventing accidental releases; therefore Best Kosher Foods Corporation has implemented a preventative maintenance program.  The preventative maintenance program is scheduled, documented and managed using an equipment log attached to each major piece of equipment to ensure that regular maintenance occurs.
