              "Description": "The SCR process that uses anhydrous ammonia at the Whiting Clean Energy facility in Whiting, Indiana is subject to Program 3 requirements. Whiting Clean Energy has implemented a prevention program based on the PSM program implemented at the facility.  As part of the implementation, Whiting Clean Energy has completed a thorough pre-startup safety review for the anhydrous ammonia system, as well as a what if/checklist process hazard analysis.  In addition, Whiting Clean Energy conducts employee training on the hazards of handling anhydrous ammonia on an ongoing basis.  Whiting Clean Energy has developed the operating procedures for the anhydrous ammonia system, incorporating safe work practices for conducting hot work, lockout/tagout, and confined space operations at the facility.  Whiting Clean Energy has also developed a mechanical integrity program for the anhydrous ammonia system equipment to ensure the equipment is maintained in optimum working condition; Whiting Clean Energy uses equipment manufacturers? recommended maintenance tasks and schedules, as well as past operating experience to complete the mechanical integrity program. Whiting Clean Energy has developed a contractor safety program for contractors hired to work on the anhydrous ammonia system.  Finally, the PSM written program incorporates the facility's emergency response plan and places special emphasis on handling accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia and coordination of emergency response with local fire departments, the neighboring BP Whiting Refinery HAZMAT team and the Lake County LEPC.",

The facility is located on the BP Whiting Refinery property at 2155 Standard Avenue in Whiting, Indiana.  Whiting Clean Energy is owned and operated by BP Alternative Energy.\n\nWhiting Clean Energy uses selective catalytic reduction (SCR) to control emissions of nitrogen oxides (Nox) from the facility?s two heat recovery steam generators.  The SCR system reduces Nox emissions by reacting ammonia with exhaust gas Nox in the presence of a catalyst to yield elemental nitrogen and water vapor.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia, a liquefiable colorless gas with a sharp, intensely irritating odor, is stored in a 13,000-gallon storage tank located at the Whiting Clean Energy facility. The tank can be charged to 85% of its fill capacity (11,050 gallons) in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.111 Section (b)(11)(ii). At full capacity, the tank can store 57,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia (assuming a density of 5.15 lb/gallon at 60? F). \n\nWhiting Clean Energy stores more than 10,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia in a 13,000-gallon pressurized tank.  Anhydrous ammonia is listed in 40 CFR 68.130 (Table 1) as a regulated toxic substance with a threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds  The facility?s use and storage of anhydrous ammonia is therefore a covered process and is subject to the risk management program requirements.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\nWhiting Clean Energy is committed to the safe operation of the SCR anhydrous ammonia process at the Whiting facility. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources Whiting Clean Energy has invested in accident prevention, including training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the anhydrous ammonia storage tank.  Whiting Clean Energy?s policy is to implement reasonable controls"

However, if a release does occur, facility personnel will respond to, contain, and control the release.\n\nWhiting Clean Energy has developed a written PSM program to protect employees and the surrounding community from exposure to an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  Whiting Clean Energy?s implementation of the PSM program includes employee education in the hazards of anhydrous ammonia and measures that can be used to reduce employee and community exposure to accidental releases of ammonia. The plan includes preventive maintenance programs (mechanical integrity) for the anhydrous ammonia system that incorporates inspections of the system in accordance with recognized standards of equipment inspection within the ammonia industry, as well as tests of system components in accordance with component manufacturers? recommendations.\n\nFive-year Accident History\nThe RMP regulations require facilities to compile a five-year accident history.  This is defined as ?all accidental releases from covered processes that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage? (40 CFR Part 68.42). \n\nSince the submission of the October 2003 update of the Whiting Clean Energy RMP, no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia resulting in the consequences listed in 40 CFR Part 68.42 have occurred. \n\nEmergency Response Program\nWhiting Clean Energy?s emergency response plan emphasizes handling of accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia and coordination of emergency response with the local fire department and the Lake County LEPC. The response plan details the emergency response organizational structure and includes personnel responsibilities and procedures within that structure.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response including air medical evacuation, proper first aid, medical treatment for expo"

The plan also includes procedures for notification of local agencies in the event of an incident, facility evacuation, and decontamination.  Finally, the plan discusses emergency preparedness and planning, including plans for conducting emergency response team training and drills.\n\nThe management of Whiting Clean Energy is committed to supporting the emergency response team and its prescribed functions. The facility?s emergency response team is drawn from the existing employee pool and is dedicated to the safe operation of the Whiting facility. The emergency response team operates in conjunction with the BP Whiting Refinery HAZMAT team, the local Whiting Fire Department and the Lake County LEPC alleviate safety concerns about handling anhydrous ammonia."
