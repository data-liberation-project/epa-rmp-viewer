The methodology used to carry out these analyses is What If/Checklist (combined).  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of 5 years.

It\u00bfs designed to provide the Fresno County CUPA with necessary details required for review. The original program was filed and approved in 1999. It was updated per regulatory requirements in 2004,2009,2013.\r\n\r\nThere were minor changes in refrigeration equipment with no inventory change or releases in the last 5 years. The only changes at the facility was ownership change, General Manager change and replacing 2 underd High Pressure Receivers with a single HPR large enough to hold the entire charge. \r\n\r\nA Compliance Audit was completed in 2012. Suggestions from the Compliance Audit will be followed and implemented, or rejected and any suggestions documented in the follow-up section. The major recommendation was more complete documentation of inspections, training, contractor qualifications and employee awareness.\r\n\r\nThe original Process Hazards Analysis was reviewed as required at 5 years. Since Royal Valley Fruit Growers did an excellent job of implementing recommendations in the original PHA, and since no equipment changes had occurred since the first PHA, no revisions were required to update the original PHA in 2004. The most significant item was that SRV's will be replaced on a 5 year basis rather than the previously proposed testing program. In the 2009 PHA Update 21 recommendations were made.\r\n\r\nA current detailed copy of RMP, PSM including PHA materials can be reviewed at the facility by contacting Curt Morton. Since the materials consist of several 2 binders and facility drawings which are constantly updated as changes are implemented, any reproduction becomes obsolete at the time of printing.

This facility will not make specific RMP or OCA information available to the public or included in the Executive Summary.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nCabot Packing, LLC is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our use of Industrial Refrigeration Contractors for all maintenance including remote system monitoring in addition to our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls and perform preventative maintenance to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\r\n\r\nStationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nOur facility's primary activities are consistent with SIC code 0723. Specific activities include washing, packing, pre-cooling and cold storage of grapes and tree fruit.  The flooded Ammonia refrigeration system provides 3 pre-coolers, 3 storage rooms 1 refrigerated hallway/dock and a hydro-cooler.  Ammonia (anhydrous) refrigerant is the only regulated substance present at our facility above thresholds requiring an RMP.  Total system NH3 capacity is estimated at 17,262 lbs..  Sulphur Dioxide seasonally used for fumigation is also present however quantities are under 300 lbs.\r\n\r\nWorst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\r\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the EPA's RMP Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration Reference Tables or RMP Comp Software.

Potential impacts by forklift or other facility traffic typical to this type of operation or errors made during maintenance/construction are the most likely cause of a reportable release. Any catastrophic earthquake, fire or weather type events would result in the same impacts as presented in this OCA or less. Details are not included in the executive summary to prevent potential abuse of public information.\r\n\r\nSince no accidents or near - misses occurred, a common compressor shaft seal failure was used for the alternate release scenario. This is a realistic release that is expected to happen at least once over the life of the system. To simulate it a seal or flange leak of \u00bc diameter gas release is assumed. The release rate is 10 lbs/minute at a pressure of 154 psig corresponding to 86\u00b0F condensing pressure. A response time of 30 minutes is assumed. Plant maintenance personnel could respond more quickly in most cases. The distance of <0.1 miles is obtained from RMP Comp software corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L. Using tables which have values less than .1 miles it's actually less than .06 miles. \r\nFive-year Accident History\r\nThe previous owner and Cabot Packing, LLC has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies, there have been no reportable accidental releases or injuries during this period.\r\nProgram 3 General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps \r\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.
