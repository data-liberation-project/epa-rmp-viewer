The chemical products sold by VWR are received from manufacturers in U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) approved containers (typically ranging from 1 pint to 55 gallons in volume).  VWR does not manufacture, formulate or otherwise engage in direct handling of chemicals outside of the containers in which the chemicals are received.  VWR operations consist of warehousing and distribution activities, and the risk of a serious chemical-related emergency is low.  However, VWR has a strong commitment to the safety and well being of its employees, the environment and the surrounding community.  The company has established a management system, consisting of policies, procedures, training, inspection, maintenance and other elements that are designed to prevent incidents from occurring.  In the event a minor or major emergency does occur, facility personnel have been trained to effectively manage the incident.\n\nAll warehousing operating involving regulated chemicals are considered a single \u00bfcovered process\u00bf for regulatory purposes.  The VWR facility is considered to be covered under the Program 2 eligibility requirements (per 68.10\u00a9) because VWR is not covered by one of the SIC codes listed under Program 3 nor OSHA\u00bfs Process Safety Management requirements.\n\nAt the present time, hydrochloric acid solution (>36%) exceeds the Threshold Quantity (TQ) for that substance under the revised New Jersey Toxic Catastrophe Prevention Act (NJ TCPA).  Additionally VWR has chloroform in stock and anticipates that it may exceed the TQ for that substance even though at most times it will be below that level.\n\nThe worst case release scenario is based on a hypothetical incident in which the single largest container stored at the site, a 200 liter (55 gallon)  drum, is pierced by a forklift and the contents are otherwise spilled on the floor of the distribution center.

However, both release scenarios considered indoor releases using building mitigation.\nVWR\u00bfs prevention program consists of several key elements, including:\n\n\n\u00b7\tSafety Information \u00bf includes detailed information about the hazards of the regulated chemicals, maximum intended inventory, facility design features, applicable standards, equipment use and maintenance.\n\n\u00b7\tHazard Review \u00bf a process of evaluating facility operations, using warehouse industry checklists, to identify and control potential hazards.\n\n\u00b7\tStandard Operating Procedures \u00bf written SOP\u00bfs to guide employees in safety conducting normal, temporary and non-routine/emergency operations.\n\n\u00b7\tTraining \u00bf includes training commensurate with the types of activities employees are expected to perform during normal and emergency situations.\n\n\u00b7\tMaintenance \u00bf required maintenance activities are performed by trained employees or qualified workers.\n\n\u00b7\tCompliance Audits \u00bf conducted at least once every three years to verify compliance with regulatory requirements for Accidental Release Prevention.\n\n\u00b7\tIncident Investigation \u00bf conducted whenever an incident occurs that results in, or could have resulted in, a catastrophic release (i.e., a release that presents an imminent and substantial endangerment to public health and the environment).\n\nThe need for chemical specific prevention steps is very limited because chemicals are contained within sealed DOT-approved containers, and the containers are not opened during handling.
