      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\n\nDescription of Facility and Regulated Substance Handled\n\n\n\nBarber Ice Cream Co., Birmingham, Alabama, processes ice cream and frozen desserts.  The facility utilizes anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant to maintain the proper temperature of ice cream and frozen desserts within the facility.  Anhydrous ammonia is an effective refrigerant that has been used for many years by most food processing facilities.  Ammonia is normally a gas at ambient temperatures but is handled as a gas liquefied under pressure.  The refrigeration system consists of a high-pressure receiver, evaporators, compressors, piping, and valves.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nBarber Ice Cream Company is committed to promoting safety for the plant, its employees, and the surrounding area.  The facility is complying with OSHA?s Process Safety Management Standard (PSM), Title 29 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 1910.119, and EPA?s Risk Management Program regulations (RMP), Title 40 CFR Part 68.  The purpose of these programs is to ensure that the refrigeration system is operated safely in order to prevent releases of ammonia from the system.  In addition, these programs serve to develop procedures to minimize releases in the event that they do occur and to outline appropriate emergency response steps to take in the event of a release.\n\n\n\nWorst Case Scenario\n\n\n\nEPA?s ?Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration? (November 1998) and the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration?s (IIAR) Risk Management Guidelines (1998) were the primary documents used to develop the worst case release scenario.  The worst case release is one that is unlikely to occur.  The purpose of the worst case release analysis is to support a dialogue with the community on release prevention.  It is a conservative analysis and is not to serve as a rational basis for actual emergency response planning.\n\n\n\nThe worst case release scenario (as defined by EPA)"

      "SummaryText": " is the release of the largest quantity of ammonia from a vessel or process line failure that results in the greatest distance to a toxic endpoint.  The worst case release scenario for the refrigeration process is assumed to be a case where the total quantity of ammonia in the largest vessel is released.  The release scenario was performed assuming that the vessel was filled to 100% capacity (the greatest amount that would ever be placed in the vessel).  The vessel, however, is normally filled to 75% capacity.  There were no passive mitigation systems (dikes, berms, drains, sumps, or enclosures) considered in the analysis since the vessel is located outdoors.\n\n\n\nThe toxic endpoints used for this scenario must be where the ambient concentration of ammonia is 0.14 mg/L or less.  This endpoint is a concentration below which nearly all individuals could be exposed to for one hour without serious health effects.  Based on Exhibit 4-4 in EPA?s guidance, a release form the vessel would result in a situation where public receptors would be within the distance to the toxic endpoint.\n\n\n\nAlternative Case Release Scenario\n\n\n\nThe alternative case release scenario selected is one in which a pressure relief valve is activated.  EPA?s ?Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration? (November 1998) and the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration?s (IIAR) Risk Management Guidelines (1998) were the primary documents used to develop the alternative release scenario.  The alternative release scenario is one that is more likely to occur that the worst case release scenario.\n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario must meet two criteria:\n\n1.    Must be more likely to occur that the worst case release scenario, and\n\n2.    Must reach an endpoint off site unless no such criteria exist.\n\n\n\nA possible release scenario is one in which a pressure relief valve is lifted to relieve a build up of pressure within the system.  Relief valves are set at a minimum to activate when assumed th"

These programs include:\n\n\n\n1.    Process Safety Information\n\n2.    Process Hazard Analysis\n\n3.    Operating Procedures\n\n4.    Training\n\n5.    Mechanical Integrity\n\n6.

Contractor Safety\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Information\n\n\n\nAs a part of the PSM Program, the facility maintains an Emergency Action Plan that was prepared in order to improve responsiveness to an emergency incident and to increase the reliability of actions taken during an incident.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evaluations, notification of local emergency response agencies as well as the public.\n\n\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving the ammonia system, it is the policy of the facility to request assistance as necessary by calling 911, which will notify the Jefferson County Fore Department.  In addition, the Jefferson County LEPC has included Barber Ice Cream Company in its local emergency response planning.\n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nBarber Ice Cream Company has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last five years.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies, there has been no accidental release"
