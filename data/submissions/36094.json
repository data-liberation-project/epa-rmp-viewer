Risk prevention and emergency response procedures are in place at all T&A facilities and the same management and maintenance personnel are responsible for maintaining the ammonia refrigeration equipment to prevent accidents, and for responding to an emergency.  The Emergency Response Plan lists the responsible personnel and the policies for responding to an accident involving the regulated substance.\n\nThere are both portable and fixed refrigeration systems onsite and all have safeties to detect unsafe operating conditions.  Fixed systems support a cold storage and a processing facility.  These systems have ammonia detection systems tied into an alarm system that is monitored 24 hours per day.  The portable systems have no detection since the units are outdoors.  Operators are present to monitor these units when they are running.  There is a list of responders experienced with ammonia refrigeration that would respond and determine specific responses for any incident.  Safeties and detection equipment are tested and maintained by experienced maintenance personnel as spelled out in the SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures) and the maintenance program.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND SUBSTANCE DESCRIPTION\n\nAt the Yuma facility, ammonia refrigeration systems are used for processing produce, cold storage, produce precooling and ice generation.  There are two fixed systems attached to the cold storage and processing buildings which are completely separate and in different locations.  The portable refrigeration equipment is trailer mounted and is used for precooling and ice generation.  The cold storage and processing systems are designed as per current applicable building and safety codes.  Portable units vary in age but are well maintained and in good condition.  The total charge for the all the refrigeration systems is approximately 73,000 LBS.   The largest system ha"

The program includes regular inspections, monitoring equipment and logging conditions, scheduled maintenance, and operator training.  Releases are documented and analyzed for ways to prevent a similar future release.  A Risk Management Program which includes accident prevention procedures for the ammonia refrigeration system is maintained on-site along with this RMP. \n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system has specific safety procedures to prevent a release.  Operators and mechanics are trained for safe operation and maintenance of the refrigeration system.  They are also trained in emergency response procedures in the event of an ammonia release.  There are emergency shut off switches outside the mechanical room of the main cold storage for shutting down the system.  An alarm and detection system will monitor the facility for unsafe ammonia concentration levels and for operating conditions outside of safety set points.  Monitoring is 24 hours per day. \n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere has one ammonia release in the past five years.  The release was on 9/29/01 and was due to liquid being trapped in an evaporative condenser.  The main valve on the condenser drain line was closed due to system repairs and liquid was trapped in the condenser.  High ambient temperatures caused the ammonia liquid to vaporize and resulted in a piping break in the condenser.  The release lasted approximately 25 minutes with approximately 300 LBS released.  This was a release due to human error and equipment failure.  Operating procedures have been amended and safeties added to equipment in order to avoid a future release of this type.  Additional information regarding the release is contained in the Data Elements and Section 6 of this RMP.  \n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nIn event of a release, certain personnel are designated to deter"

The emergency coordinator is responsible for contacting emergency response agencies, schools, daycare centers, and acute care facilities that may be effected by the release.  The coordinator will also be responsible for evacuation of employees if necessary, and for coordination with community emergency responders if off-site evacuations are required.  \n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nSpecific recommendations resulting from the PHA are listed in the Risk Management Program kept on file at this facility.  All refrigeration equipment is well maintained and operated in a safe manner by trained personnel.  Operating, maintenance, training and safety procedures will be formalized with improved written documentation."
