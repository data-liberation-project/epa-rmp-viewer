Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Baker Petrolite Bowman, North Dakota are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. If such an unforeseeable release were to occur, we would coordinate our efforts with the Bowman Fire Department to help control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility is primarily in the storage and distribution of our products to our oil field customers. We have one (1) regulated substance present at our facility.  This substance is acrolein [2-propenal].  The regulated substance at our facility is stored and distributed to our oil field customers. Acrolein is stored in a pressurized vessel to minimize emissions during storage.  There is no material handling of acrolein except moving of containers.\n\nThe maximum possible inventory of acrolein [2-propenal] at our facility is 11,000 lbs. The daily average is usually much less.\n\n3.The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternate Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario.\n\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the ALOHA model purchased from the National Safety Council. Local emergency planners, including LEPC's and fire departments use this program.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.  \n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted  involves a catastrophic release from acrolein storage.  The "

      "SummaryText": "scenario involves the release of 370 pounds of acrolein [2-propenal].  Toxic liquid is assumed to be immediately released to form a pool of height 1centimeter, from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated over 32 minutes.  Under worst case weather conditions, namely Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s wind speed, the maximum distance of  2.8 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of .0011 mg/L.\n\nOne alternate release scenario has been submitted for acrolein [2-propenal], which considers the most likely scenario.  The alternate release scenario for acrolein involves a release from a tank in the acrolein storage process.  The scenario involves the release of 370 pounds of acrolein [2-propenal]  via a punctured cylinder.  Toxic liquid is assumed to be immediately released to form a pool of height of 1 centimeter, from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated over 39 minutes.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of .0011 mg/L is .63 miles.\n\n4. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility in Bowman, North Dakota has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68. Our acrolein [2-propenal]  storage process at our facility is subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119. \nThe following sections briefly describe the elements of our release prevention program that are in place at our facility.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nBaker Petrolite in Bowman, North Dakota maintains a detailed records of written safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with acrolein [2-propenal].\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nBaker Petrolite's Bowman, North Dakota facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are ide"
