Recognizes management's responsibility in protecting it's employees, equipment, property, and the environment. The safety and health of all personnel are very important.  The control of accidents has been and will continue to be a basic responsibility of all personnel in the facility.\n\n     The Atlas Cold Storage  PSM/RMP program assigns and documents the specific responsibilities for developing, implementing and  integrating the OSHA PSM and the EPA RMP standards into its safety program.  The Atlas Cold Storage  PSM/RMP program focuses attention on Making PSM/RMP the way we manage our ammonia based refrigeration system rather than a project we expect to complete and put on the shelf when the fileing date has passed.\n\n     Atlas Cold Storage believes that employee participation is the key to a successful program.  Operating level employees, particularly the Chief Refrigeration Engineer and the Refrigeration System Operator, have been deeplly involved in the PSM/RMP program development, implementation and integration and they assume the major responsibility for operating the Sikeston, Missouri facility safely.\n\n     The Atlas Cold Storage Emergency Response Program has been developed with the complete cooperation and support of the Sikeston Fire Department.  All Atlas Cold Storage employees have received documented emergency response training.\n\n\nII.  STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\n     Atlas Cold Storage, MO Ltd. Is a Public Refrigerated Warehouse specializing in ice cream storage and distribution.  The refrigeration system contains no more than 13,600 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  Anhydrous ammonia is the only hazardous material on site in quantities above the threshold quantity.\n\n\nIV.

Atlas Cold Storage considers the PSM/RMP manuals to be living documents that must be updated and revised regularly to maintain their viability.\n\n     Atlas Cold Storage emphasizes and insists on  employee participation from the refrigeration system operators in all aspects of the developent, implementation, and integration of their PSM/RMP program.\n\n     Atlas Cold Storage provides a comprehensive, computer based, user friendly training program with one-on-one teacher involvement in specific training modules for each ammonia refrigeration employee.\n\n     Atlas Cold Storage maintains a pro-active open-door policy toward neighbors and concerned community citizens.  Facility tours and risk management discussions are scheduled and conducted upon written request.\n\nV.  FIVE YEAR ACCIDENTAL RELEASE HISTORY\n\n     There have been no releases of ammonia that resulted in an injury, or that had an off-site impact, or that resulted in significant property damage either on-site or off-site.\n\nVI.  Emergency Response Program\n\n     Facility employees have been trained to respond to accidental ammonia release.  The site emergency plan has been coordinated with the community emergency plan under the jurisdiction of the Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC) and the Sikeston Fire Department.\n\nVII.  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n      Atlas Cold Storage recognizes that (even though their Ammonia release and injury experience has been excellent) their PSM/RMP program will provide much needed improvement to their safety effort.
