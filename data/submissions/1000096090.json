Initially RMP was prepared for La Francaise Bakery facility that has undergone several ownership changes since then. However the nature of operations at the site has remained the same except for addition of new products and modifications to the building. It is Aspire Bakeries LLC policy to comply with all of requirements of the EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Program regulation as well as all other applicable Federal and State rules and regulations.  The company will maintain and continuously update the Process Safety Management Plan (PSM/29CFR 1910.119) and Risk Management Plan (RMP) pursuant to US EPA regulation 40 CFR 68 under the Clean Air Act.  Aspire Bakeries is presently updating its RMP prior to its five year anniversary and due to recent ownership change. The PSM written program incorporates Aspire Bakeries emergency response plan (ERP) and places special emphasis on handling accidental releases of hazardous chemicals and coordination of emergency response with local fire departments and other emergency response organizations.  The emergency action plan (EAP) is updated periodically to incorporate modification and changes to the plant.  Training on implementation of the EAP is given to all the employees on an annual basis.\n\nIt is the intent of Aspire Bakeries to continue and improve upon all Safety Programs that have been previously established by Aryzta LLC.\n\n\n\nFacility and Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nAspire Bakeries LLC, located in Northlake, Illinois is owned by Aspire Bakeries LLC and is engaged in the business of manufacturing and marketing a variety of gourmet baked products to the food service industry.

For refrigeration and cooling, the company operates a mechanical refrigeration system charged with anhydrous ammonia.  The quantity of ammonia in the refrigeration is 21,000 lbs and no changes have occurred since the last RMP was submitted.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps:\n\n\n\nFor the ammonia system, Aspire Bakeries followed the ANSI/IIAR Standard and manufacturers recommended specification for equipment, design, and installation of Ammonia Mechanical Refrigeration Systems. Aspire Bakeries has implemented an RMP Program 3 Prevention Program that is equivalent to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) program. This is one of the most important ways for preventing ammonia releases and for minimizing the impacts of any release that does occur. The Company backs up its commitment to safety by developing and implementing procedures for critical operations and communicating hazards of the process and chemicals used through Hazard Communication Programs.  The Company has ongoing safety programs implemented with the help and participation of specialized consultants.  All safety programs are implemented under the direct supervision of senior management personnel.  Pursuant to the Risk Management Plan regulation and Process Safety Management standard, Aspire Bakeries has developed a comprehensive PSM written program to protect the employees and surrounding community from accidental releases of ammonia from the refrigeration system.  The facility used a What-If technique for process hazard analysis (PHA).  Further, the implementation of the PSM program includes education in the hazards of ammonia, a preventive maintenance program for the ammonia system, program for pre-startup safety reviews and management of change.  The program also includes specific requiremen"

The Plant Management implements the Plant Safety Program. The objectives of the Plant Safety Program are to: maximize safety performance; eliminate human suffering, losses and property damage resulting from injuries and accidents. \n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History:\n\n\n\nThere has been no history of accidents in the past five years.\n\n\n\nThe Worst-case Release Scenario and the Alternate Release Scenario:\n\n\n\nThe Aspire Bakeries facility is located in a commercial and industrial zoned section of the City of Northlake. The expressways I-294 and I-290 are located on the west side of the facility at close proximity. The setting is urban.\n\n\n\nThe worst-case scenario is considered to be a rupture of the high pressure receiver, which contains most of the ammonia in the system at any given time.  It is contemplated that a rupture such as this would cause loss of all the ammonia in the receiver (10,000 lbs.) over a period of 10 minutes, being released at a constant rate.  The toxic endpoint is taken to be an ERPG-2 of 0.14 mg/1 and was estimated to be 1.2 miles from the source.  The consequences are modeled in atmospheric stability category F, at a wind speed of 3.4 miles per hour and a temperature of 77 degrees F.  The modeling has been developed by using EPAS RMP Comp Software. However, it is important to emphasize that a worst-case release is extremely unlikely to occur because of the many safety features inherent in the design and operational systems for the plant.\n\n\n\nIn the unlikely event of a tank rupture such as this, there will be offsite impact of the toxic chemical release.  The released ammonia fumes will travel in the direction of the wind.  The distance of travel will depend on the prevailing weather conditions.  Ammonia concentration in the air will be signif"

In this case, the company will implement the Emergency Action Plan.\n\n\n\nIn a less severe but most likely situation - referred to as a alternative scenario, a release can occur due to gasket rupture, pump seal leak, relief valve leak or broken hose equivalent; this would go through an orifice, which has a diameter of A? to A? inch.  A typical rate of release would be 7.5 lbs/minute and typical weather condition would be Atmospheric Stability Category D with a wind speed of 6.7 miles per hour.  The toxic end point of 500 feet was derived from the EPAS RMP Comp Software as a typical urban site and the smallest rate of release with minimal off-site impact. Only the immediate neighboring facilities will be affected and may require limited evacuation.  Passive mitigation to a release of 100 lbs/minute is considered to be the building housing the refrigeration equipment.  Such a release could be contained until automatic and manual shutoff systems could be activated.  Responders could further mitigate the release by absorption in water from a fire hose, and neutralizing the resulting mixture with an acidic media or chemical.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program:\n\n\n\nAspire Bakeries has reviewed its emergency response program in August 2021 to include response procedures addressing the event of an accidental release of ammonia.  The update of the plan was done to include minor modifications to the building and addition of a new product lines.  As required, various scenarios have been analyzed.  Company personnel are trained to respond to minor releases and minor repair/maintenance problems.  However, in the event of a release having offsite impact, the facility will work with a HAZMAT team of the Northlake Fire Department to control the emergency and protect the surrounding community.  Notification will be done through the local police and fire department in case evacuation becomes necessary.  The facility has identif"
