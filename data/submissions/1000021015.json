The main activity carried out by the company is the distribution of chemical substances and related materials. These materials are stored in two main areas, a closed warehouse and open area on the backside of the facility. The business consist of buying and selling chemicals for industrial customers in the island. The facility receives the materials included in this RMP already in their end use package. For this reason, the major risk encountered is the possibility of a package rupture during the forklift handling.\n\nIn order to prevent the risk, Mays Ochoa has implemented a safety and security program in which training to personnel in forklift operation, hazardous materials handling and warehouse safety is included. Also, to address this issue we have prepared the following procedure:\nPREVENTION, PREPAREDNESS, CONTINGENCY AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN FOR THE WAREHOUSE FACILITIES\nThe information contained in this plan has been prepared in accordance with the requirements for a Prevention, Preparedness and Contingency Plan as set forth in 40 CFR Parts 265.50 through 265.56, as well as any applicable Commonwealth of Puerto Rico laws, rules and regulations. Also, elements of Emergency Response Plans (in accordance to EPCRA requirements), and of Risk Management Plans (40 CFR 63) have been incorporated. The content of this plan have been expanded to cover not only hazardous wastes but also hazardous materials present at the facility.\n\nThis contingency plan has been designed to minimize hazards to human health or the environment resulting from fires, explosions, or any unplanned sudden or non-sudden release of hazardous waste/materials or any of its constituents to the air, soil or surface water. The provisions of this plan will be carried out immediately whenever there is a fire, explosion or release of hazardous waste/materials or any of its constituents which"

Emergency Coordinators\nAt all times, there will be at least one employee either on the facility premises or on call with the responsibility for coordinating all emergency response measures related to the events covered herein. In the case an emergency situation that requires the activation of this plan arises, the discoverer shall contact the Emergency Coordinator.\n\nMr. Gilbert Rivera, Primary Emergency Coordinator, should be contacted first. In case he is not available, the following person in the list should be addressed. In any case, the order of the persons appearing on the list will be strictly followed for this notification process until someone is reached. The Primary Emergency Coordinator and alternates shall have complete authority to commit company resources in the event of an emergency.\n\n3.  Emergency Procedures and Implementation\nThe decision to implement the Contingency Plan depends upon whether or not an imminent or actual incident could threaten human health or the environment.\n\nThe Contingency Plan will be implemented in the following situations:\na) Fire and/or Explosion\ni) When the fire and/or explosion will cause the release of toxic fumes.\nii) When the fire spreads and could possibly ignite materials at other locations on site or could cause heat-induced explosions.\niii) When the fire could possibly spread to offsite areas.\niv) When the use of water or water and chemical fire suppressants could result in contaminated    runoff.\nv) When an imminent danger exists that an explosion could occur, causing a safety hazard due to lying fragments or shock waves.\nvi) When an imminent danger exists that an explosion could ignite other materials in the surrounding areas.\nvii) When an imminent danger exists that an explosion could result in the release of a toxic material.

Emergency Response Procedures (Countermeasure Action Plan)\n- Alert Procedures\nUpon observation of situation that will require the plan to be implemented (refer to section 5.0), the person making the discovery shall immediately, only if within his or her capabilities, perform the tasks outlined in the following standard operating procedure:\na) Proceed to evaluate the incident for fire and/or explosion, safety and health hazards.\nb) If the incident is due to a spill, stop the flow of the material if possible (only trained personnel refer to Section 21.0).\nc) Immediately notify the Emergency Coordinators.\n\nOnce a designated Emergency Coordinator has been notified, he or she will initiate the response efforts only if these are within the response capabilities of the response team. The material should be contained immediately to prevent it from reaching areas such as water supply systems, sewers and private property. After containment, the material will be cleaned up (only trained personnel) and disposed of properly.\n\nOnce the necessary information has been collected, the communication of the spill to the responsible agencies will be initiated, if applicable and only by personnel authorized to perform these duties. If the spill or incident is beyond the capabilities of the internal response team, then the Emergency Coordinator will order evacuation of the premises if necessary and will contact a trained emergency response agency or, qualified HAZMAT contractor.\n\n- Action Procedures\nThis plan will be activated upon the occurrence of any spill related to the storage, usage or handling of hazardous materials at any"

Emergency contacts, provide a quick reference guideline to follow in the event of a major spill. If an employee discovers a chemical spill or process upset resulting in a vapor release, he or she will immediately report it to the area supervisor.\n\nThe area supervisor will contact the designated Emergency Coordinator at the time of the incident. When contacted, the designated Emergency Coordinator will proceed as follows:\ni) Identify the material spilled or released.\nii) Identify location of the release or spillage of the hazardous material.\niii) Estimate the amount released and the rate at which it Js being released.\niv) Determine the direction in which the spill or vapor or fume release is heading.\nv) Determine if there are any injured persons.\nvi) Determine the possibility of a fire and/or explosion.\nvii) Determine the area and materials involved and the intensity of the possible fire and/or explosion.\n\nThis information will help the Emergency Coordinator to assess the magnitude and potential seriousness of the spill or release.

The intent of any initial response effort will be to protect human health and safety, and then the environment. Identification, containment, treatment and disposal will then become the secondary response.\nIn the event of a leak or spill, a contractor will be summoned to remove any standing liquids and haul the material to a facility approved to handle such materials.\n\nIf for some reason the spill is not contained within a dike or sump area, an area of isolation will be established around the spill. The  of the area will generally depend on the  of the spill and the characteristics of the materials involved. If the spill is large and involves the rupture of a tank or pipeline, an initial isolation of at least 100 ft. in all directions will be established to allow clean-up and repair and to prevent exposure. When any spill occurs, only those persons involved in overseeing or performing emergency operations will be allowed within the designated hazard area. If possible, the area will be roped, taped or otherwise blocked off and properly posted to indicate the hazards present. If the spill results in the release of a toxic vapor or fume cloud, further evacuation will be enforced. An area of at least 500 ft. wide and 1000 ft. long will be evacuated downwind of where volatile materials are spilled. Because winds in the area tend to vary, the quickest and most accurate assessment is through the installation of a wind sox. When this is not feasible, the Weather Service can be contacted at 791-0376 or the Luis Munoz Marin International Airport can be contacted at 791-6153 for accurate wind conditions.\n\nThe Puerto Rico Environmental Quality Board and the National Response Center will be notified whenever one of the following situations occur:\ni) A spill discharges to a surface water and the quantity of hazardous material is equal to or greater than the Reportable Quantity specified under 40 CFR"

These are only general guidelines and actual circumstances may dictate that certain alterations be made to these procedures:\ni) If a leak develops or a spill occurs, the person discovering the discharge will immediately contact the Emergency Coordinator. The Emergency Coordinator will obtain the following information:\na) Person(s) injured, if any, and seriousness of injuries.\nb) Location of the spill or leak, material involved, and source.\nc) The approximate amount spilled, an estimate of the liquid and/or gas discharge rate, and the direction the liquid flow or gaseous cloud is moving.\nd) Whether or not a fire is involved.\n\nii) Next, the Emergency Coordinator will:\na) Initiate evacuation of the hazard area.\nb) Initially isolate least 100 ft. in all directions and keep all persons upwind of spill.\nc) Obtain medical attention for any injured persons.
