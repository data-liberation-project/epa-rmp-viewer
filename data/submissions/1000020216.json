As stated on the company's website, \"As the 2nd largest warehousing and logistics provider in the U.S., Lineage Logistics has the scope to serve highly varied customer needs across many different regions. With 60+ facilities and 290 million cubic feet, we already provide solutions for many of the largest food customers in the U.S. We have demonstrated the ability to grow our platform, expand our capabilities, and increase our markets served quickly to meet the needs of our customer base. Built upon a legacy of family values and integrity, our mission is to provide innovative, world-class customer service and a safe, enjoyable workplace. Our vision is to be the world's most dynamic temperature-controlled logistics company.\"\n\n\n\nLineage Logistics senior management is not only committed to offer superior service, but to also maintain a safety and environmental program to promote a safe environment for all its employees and the surrounding communities.  Lineage Logistics' safety and environmental policies are administered by the Safety Director.  Weekly inspections of the facility are conducted by the facility Refrigeration Manager and Refrigeration Technicians to ensure compliance and oversee the entire safety and environmental programs.    These programs include forklift safety, hazard communications, lockout/tagout, Hazardous Materials Emergency Business Plan, employee safety manuals, manufacturers' documentation, Emergency Action Plan, as well as the Risk Management Plan.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\n\nThe Lineage Logistics facility is located at 1001 Columbia Avenue, in Riverside, California, which is approximately 1 mile east of Interstate 215 and 1.5 miles north of California Freeway 60.

In order to conduct operations, the facility maintains a refrigeration system containing approximately 47,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, a regulated substance.  The refrigeration system, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, and then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for cold, freezer, and dock storage areas.  Typical operating conditions range from 2\" Hg on the low pressure side of the system to 165 psig on the high side of the system.  Table 1 lists the ammonia equipment at the facility while Figure 1 shows the location of the facility and Figure 2 shows the facility plot plan.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nIn order to operate the ammonia refrigeration system, the facility complies with the following risk management regulations:\n\n\n\n?    EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP);\n\n?    OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM); and\n\n?    California Accidental Release Prevention Program (CalARP).  \n\n\n\nAdministrative Measures:\n\n\n\nThe facility operates in accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines and standards including the following:\n\n\n\n?    IIAR Bulletin 107, \"Suggested Safety and Operating Procedures When Making Ammonia Refrigeration Tie ins\"\n\n?    IIAR Bulletin 109, \"Minimum Safety Criteria for a Safe Ammonia Refrigeration System\" \n\n?    IIAR Bulletin 110, \"Startup, Inspection, and Maintenance of Ammonia Refrigeration Systems\"\n\n?

For example, the Lineage Logistics facility operates in accordance with the Process Safety Management (PSM), Risk Management Program (RMP), and California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program.  It is important to note that the refrigeration system has been designed with several safety features to prevent the accidental release of ammonia.  For example, the compressors are equipped with safety mechanisms that will cause the units to shut down if operating conditions exceed designated safety limits.  Also, level indicators, alarms, and switches are installed in key points within the system to monitor the supply of liquid ammonia and to ensure that a vessel is not overfilled.\n\n\n\nEngineering Measures:\n\nOther safety features of the ammonia refrigeration system include: emergency shutdown switches that kill power to the engine room equipment (located outside each Engine Room door), an emergency pressure control system to relieve pressure from a high pressure suction line to a lower pressure suction line, relief valves on all pressure vessels, continuous ventilation (controlled by a thermostat), and emergency ventilation in the Engine Room to prevent explosions. The facility has also installed ammonia sensors at strategic locations throughout the facility. Table 2 details the sensor locations, setpoints, and actions.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThe facility has not yet begun operations on the ammonia refrigeration system since it is still under construction. System startup is scheduled for March 2011.  Thus, there is no accident history to report. \n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe facility has an Emergency Action Plan (plan) in effect at the facility.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:  \n\n\n\n?    save lives;\n\n?    minimize and avoid injuries;\n\n?    protect the environment; and\n\n?    minimize property damage.\n\n\n\nLineage Logistics maintains a safety committee whose members are the d"

The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year. This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM/RMP/CalARP regulations.  \n\n\n\nLineage Logistics personnel circulate throughout the plant, taking note of unusual conditions in any portion of the systems.  In the event that an ammonia leak is discovered, the person nearest to the leak will alert any personnel in the immediate area who are unaware of the danger, and the Maintenance Manager.  The Maintenance Manager will contact the Plant Manager, Lineage Logistics Safety Director, and Senior Vice President of Engineering to evaluate and ascertain the significance of the leak.  If the ammonia leak is considered minor and/or minimal, the repair will be conducted by the Lineage Logistics refrigeration mechanical staff.  An outside refrigeration contractor may be contracted to further assist in the potential repairs to the equipment pertaining to the ammonia system.  For major ammonia leaks, emergency agencies will also be notified as necessary as outlined in the Emergency Action Plan.  Action is promptly taken to mitigate the leak so normal operations can resume.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nA Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) was performed on November 31 and December 1, 2011, at the Lineage Logistics facility.
