      "SummaryText": "GTUIT, LLC (GTUIT) is a service company that provides mobile flare gas treatment for the oil and gas industry.  GTUIT operates a mechanical refrigeration unit (MRU) type gas dew point control and liquids recovery skid designed to recover propane, butane and natural gasoline from natural gas prior to gathering and final treatment. Enerplus Resources (USA) Corporation (Enerplus) is required, by Title 40 Part 68 Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions of the Code of Federal Regulations (40 CFR 68), to develop this executive summary for the enclosed Risk Management Plan (RMP). This RMP is applicable to the Spices Pad oil and gas production pad owned and operated by Enerplus.  \n\n\n\nGTUIT is a limited liability company that provides services to the oil and gas industry, and their operations are portable. GTUIT services include recovery of natural gas liquids (NGLs) which are regulated substances under 40 CFR 68. The regulated substances include natural gas liquids that contain mostly liquid petroleum gas, which is a mixture of propane and butane, with small amounts of ethane.  These are considered flammable substances under 40 CFR 68. GTUIT will deliver an 18,000 gallon tank to a well site, collect these NGLs from produced gas, and then offload to a transport tanker the recovered NGLs for sale in the market. The well sites at which these collections will occur operate automatically and are considered to be unmanned. \n\n\n\nUnder the authority of section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act, the Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions require facilities that produce, handle, process, distribute, or store certain chemicals over the regulated thresholds to develop a Risk Management Program, prepare a RMP, and submit the RMP to EPA. Covered facilities were initially required to comply with the rule in 1999, and the rule has been amended on several occasions since then, most recently in 2004. This facility is regulated under Title 40, Part 68 of the Code of Federal Regulations (40 CFR 68),"

      "SummaryText": " more commonly known as the Risk Management Program (RMP) rule. RMPs must be prepared for processes that store in excess of the thresholds set forth by 40 CFR 68.130. For natural gas components (e.g. butane, ethane and propane), the threshold is 10,000 lbs. The GTUIT MRU system stores approximately 68,526 lbs. of natural gas liquids modeled as all propane which exceeds the 10,000 lbs. threshold.\n\n\n\nThis facility falls under a Program Level 1 facility as defined under 40 CFR 68 due to three factors:  there is no accident history associated with this facility, there are no permanent employees at this remote location (unmanned) and there are no environmental or public receptors within the buffer zone of the worst case release scenario.  In order to comply with the Program Level 1 requirements of 40 CFR 68, Enerplus as incorporated operation of the GTUIT NGL skid into its Emergency Response Plan.  This includes periodic training on scenarios involving a failure of the 18,000 gallon storage unit and how a response would proceed in this scenario.\n\n"
