The chances of this of accident occurring are minimal because of the types of controls and the nature of the gas.\r\n\r\nThe alternative release scenario includes the assumption that one of the one ton cylinders was ruptured while unloading the cylinder.

      "SummaryText": "This Risk Management Plan is for the planning of the response to a potential chlorine leak at the City of Pasco's Butterfield Water Treatment Plant.  The City uses chlorine as the primary disinfectant in the water treatment process.  We have not had an accidental release of chlorine in the past five years.\r\n\r\nPersonnel that work for the City of Pasco, continues to treat chlorine gas with the utmost care and respect.  As mentioned in the original RMP, written Standard Operating Procedures for handling chlorine and an Emergency Response Procedure were established in June 1994.  Since that time, the City of Pasco has written a Process Safety Management Plan for chlorine at the Water Treatment Plant that conforms to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and has also completed an update of the plan which included updates of training requirements, egress and respiratory protection, and chlorine tank changing procedures.  The City also has a written plan that conforms to the State Department of Labor and Industries requirements for Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals.  This plan was developed to provide guidelines for response to threatened or an actual chlorine release that will minimize the potential for employee and/or public exposure to these hazardous materials.\r\n\r\nAs discussed in the original RMP, the requirement of the Risk Management Guidance for offsite Consequences Analysis covers two scenarios for modeling.  The first scenario being the worst case release, which represents the very worst that can happen; and a second scenario being the alternative release, representing the most probable situation for a possible accident.\r\n\r\nThe worst case scenario includes the assumption that all four of the Water Treatment Plant one ton chlorine cylinders that are on-line would be released into the atmosphere in ten minutes time.  A release of this would affect the operation of the Water Treatment Plant and a large portion of the population of the Ci"
