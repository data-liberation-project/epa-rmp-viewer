The RMP established \nthree levels of requirements for the program.  Programs 1 and 2 are for facilities that\npose less risk to the environment and therefore have reduced compliance\nrequirements.  Program 1 is designed for \"no impact\" facilities and has the fewest\nrequirements, while Program 3 is the most stringent of the three levels.\n            \nThe program level for each facility is determined by:\n         \n       Use of regulated substances in threshold quantity\n       Impact of an off-site public receptor (e.g., residence, school, park)\n       North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code\n       Five-year accident history\n       OHSA PSM (29 CFR 1910.119) applicability. \n          \nThis facility is regulated under Program 2 requirements under 40 CFR 68.10 because:\n          \n       It stores anhydrous ammonia in excess of the threshold quantity\n       A release from this facility could impact an offsite public receptor (residence)\n       It does not operate under a NAICS code specified in the rule\n       It is not subject to OSHA PSM (this is a retail facility).\n\n40 CFR Part 68 Subpart G applies to an owner or operator of a stationary\nsource that has more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance in a process,\nas determined under 40 CFR 68.115.

The facility has one stationary storage tank with a storage capacity of \n30,000 water gallons (140,000 pounds).  The facility also stores numerous smaller \ntransportable tanks (nurse tanks) that are actually used in the fertilizer application process.          \n\nThe facility is required to complete one worst-case release scenario per 40 CFR 68.165(a)(2) to\ndetermine program applicability.  Battle Creek Farmers Cooperative has chosen to use the\nDEGADIS+ to determine offsite impacts.\n\nWorst-Case Scenario Parameters\n     1.   Land Use - Rural\n     2.

The\nworst-case scenario requires a ground-level release height (0 feet).

The alternative release scenario considered is in accordance with the \nguidelines provided in 40 CFR 68.22 and 68.28.  Alternative release parameters are \npresented below:\n\nAlternative Scenario Parameters                \n           \n    1.   Land Use - Rural                 \n    2.

Release Duration - 10 min\n      \nThe alternative scenario chosen for this facility involves a release because of a\nsudden split in the hose during transfer.  While this scenario is still unlikely because\nthe transfer hoses used have multiple layers of rubber and a layer of braided stainless\nsteel wire underneath the outer sheath (to prevent abrasions, cuts, and splits) it is\nmore likely than the worst-case as required by 40 CFR 68.28(b)(i).  This scenario is also the\nmost likely to occur, since overfilling is prevented by a return vapor line to the tank\ntruck making the delivery.  The transfer hose rupture area is assumed at 0.5 square\ninches.  Because personnel are always present at the facility during transfer, Battle Creek \npersonnel will respond within 10 minutes.  Release rate was calculated using \nthe OCAG tank release equation (Section 8.1.1).             \n        \nInput of the preceding data into DAGADIS+ revealed an alternative release scenario impact \nof 0.23 miles for the facility. There are no residences located within 0.23 miles from the facility. \nIn fact, the closest residence is located approximately 0.4 miles away.  The amount of ammonia\nthat would have to be released to reach this residence is as unlikely as the worst-case scenario. \nThus, this alternative release scenario satisfies the conditions of 68.28.
