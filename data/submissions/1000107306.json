Employees at the Reading DC are trained in accident prevention, hazard communication, emergency response, safe material handling practices, and fork truck driving safety.  Central to PPG's focus on safety and the environment is its EHS Policy. The policy provides the guidelines under which PPG markets, distributes and manufactures products globally in a responsible manner that protects employees, neighbors, customers and the environment.\nII.\tRegulated Substances Handled\nPPG Reading DC is part of the PPG Architectural Coatings business unit.  The Reading DC stores paint, stain, and related products and distributes them to dealers, stores, and home centers. Products are stored in various containers including aerosol spray cans.  Some of the aerosols contain propane, butane, isobutane, and methyl ether, which are used as propellants.  These four materials are regulated flammable substances under the EPA RMP regulation.  The aerosol products are stored in a separate storage room designed for this purpose.\nIII.\tWorst-Case Scenario:\n(This Text was removed at the request of Mary Hunt (EPA)\nIV.\tGeneral Accidental Release Prevention and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps:  The PPG Reading DC complies with EPA RMP regulations for the safe storage of flammable aerosols. Under the RMP regulations the Reading facility's aerosol storage process is classified as a Program Level 1 because the worst-case scenario does not result in off-site impacts and there have been no accidental relea"
