This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nThe NuStar El Paso Products Terminal adheres to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  NuStar carries a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials. NuStar personnel are trained to respond to minor incidents; however, if response is unsafe for NuStar personnel or the event is a major incident/emergency, the City of El Paso Fire Department is notified and asked to respond.  \n\n\nFacility Description\nOur facility?s primary activities encompass the storage and sale of motor fuel and propane.  The facility includes 11 propane bullet tanks.  Ethyl mercaptan, which is added to the propane as an odorant, can be present above the threshold quantity.\n\n\nThe General Accident Release Prevention Program and the Chemical Specific Prevention Steps \nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the OSHA PSM standard as well as the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  \n\n\nFive-year Accident History\nNuStar El Paso Products Terminal has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last five years.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies, there has been no accidental release during this period.\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\nNuStar El Paso Products Terminal carries a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.

In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nHistorical developments and findings from our facilities across the country have resulted in the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program company wide.  Monthly safety training, operator training and certification are some of the major programs we use to improve safety at our facility.  These programs are currently implemented and changes are continuous."
