This commitment is reflected in a comprehensive accidental release prevention program. This program addresses the design, installation, operation, maintenance, and employee training associated with the process equipment at the facility. \n\n\n\nOberon Fuels' senior management is not only committed to offering superior service, but also to maintaining a safety and environmental program to promote a safe environment for all its employees and the surrounding communities. Oberon Fuels' safety and environmental policies as they relate to the methanol to dimethyl ether conversion process are administered by the Plant Manager, who conducts inspections of the facility to ensure compliance.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nThe Oberon Fuels facility is located at 5451 Kershaw Road in Brawley, California, which is approximately 1 mile north of County Highway S26 and 1 mile east of CA Highway 111.  The area immediately surrounding the facility is rural.\n\n\n\nThe regulated substance of concern at the Oberon Fuels facility is dimethyl ether (DME).  The facility utilizes a methanol to DME conversion process to produce fuel grade DME in accordance with the IEA AMF standard for DME as a fuel for vehicles.  \n\n\n\nThis conversion process is designed to produce 12.5 tons per day (1042 lb/h) of DME from a feed of approximately 17.4 tons per day (1451 lb/h) of methanol. The conversion of methanol to DME occurs by the catalytic dehydration of methanol as follows:\n\n\n\n2CH4O => C2H6O + H2O\n\n\n\nThe reaction takes place in a catalytic distillation column which allows for a highly efficient conversion (nearly 100%) of methanol to DME with minimum energy input in a compact, space efficient plant footprint. The process also produces water as a byproduct. This water will contain small quantities of methanol (< 50 ppm) along with small quantities o"

Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system.  For example, the facility operates in accordance with Cal/OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation.  The facility conducts preventative maintenance and any necessary minor repairs in house, but an outside contractor is hired for major repairs or maintenance.\n\n\n\nThe facility, including the methanol to dimethyl ether conversion process, was designed and constructed in accordance with the Uniform Mechanical Code applicable at the time of construction (April 2013), which specifically outlines requirements for the safe operation of the methanol to dimethyl ether conversion system.  \n\n\n\nIn addition to the Uniform Mechanical Code, Oberon Fuels has developed a preventive maintenance program to complete regularly scheduled inspections and tests of the methanol to dimethyl ether conversion process as well as repairs as needed to process equipment.\n\n\n\nThe methanol to DME conversion process at the Oberon Fuels facility is equipped with various system controls and status indicators intended to minimize potential methanol and DME related accidents and to allow operators to monitor system operations.  Level indicators are located on the methanol storage tank, the catalytic distillation column, the Reflux Drum, and the DME storage vessels. Pressure and temperature indicators are located throughout the process. The level, pressure, and temperature indicators allow operators to monitor system operations and to determine potential adverse situations in the event of deviations from standard or acceptable operating conditions."

      "SummaryText": " Regular system inspections also permit operators to monitor operations.\n\n\n\nPressure relief valves are present on all vessels and on various sections of piping.  These devices are designed to ensure high pressure conditions within the equipment do not transpire.  The design ratings of these valves are dependent upon the operating pressure of the equipment.  All of the relief valves in the system vent to the atmosphere. \n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThe methanol to dimethyl ether conversion process at Oberon Fuels is of new construction.  System start up is scheduled for April 2013.  Therefore, there have been no releases of DME that meet the EPA criteria for the five year accident history. In addition, there have been no injuries resulting from a DME release, nor any releases or \"near misses\" that warranted an internal incident investigation.\n\n \n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe Oberon Fuels facility has an emergency action plan in effect.  The Emergency Action Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of this PSM/RMP/CalARP document. This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n\n\n  1.)  To save lives.\n\n  2.)  To minimize and avoid injuries.\n\n  3.)  To protect the environment.\n\n  4.)  To minimize property damage.\n\n\n\nThe operator of the facility maintains a safety committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, methanol and dimethyl ether health hazards, and mitigation procedures, which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year. This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM, RMP and CalARP regulations.\n\n\n\nIn case of a dimethyl ether emergency, the facility plans to evacuate all employees and contractors and activate the facility's action plan to respond to th"

The facility plans to coordinate emergency response efforts with the fire department on a periodic and ongoing basis.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nThe Process Hazards Analysis, with the initial review conducted on August 2, 2012 and the official study performed on February 12, 2013, included a Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) study and provided mitigation measures to improve safety at the Oberon Fuels facility.  The Oberon Fuels safety committee is planning to complete several items over the next year, as a continual effort to provide a safe work environment for their employees.  These changes include the following items:\n\n\n\n1. Continue to train all employees in the facility Safety Plan/Programs.\n\n\n\n2. Continue to have employee involvement in Safety Plan Development.\n\n\n\n3. Continue employee involvement through safety team participation.\n\n\n\n4. Continue internal and external safety audits/inspections and implement changes as needed.\n\n\n\nNOTE:\n\n\n\nThe initial PHA review for the methanol to DME conversion process took place on August 2, 2012, and the official study was performed on February 12, 2013."
