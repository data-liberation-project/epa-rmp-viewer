The facility is located in southwest Lowndes County, Georgia.  \n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nThe facility has had one CERCLA reportable accident within the past five years.  The accident resulted in the release of 15 pounds of chlorine, which was contained and controlled.  There were no injuries and no offsite impacts.  The accident was fully investigated.  The investigation resulted in the replacement of certain equipment and re-evaluation of the annual maintenance program.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention\n\nThe Withlacoochee River WPCP complies with generally accepted measures for this business type, and with all state and federal regulations.  The facility has chlorine storage and feed systems within enclosed buildings.  Process area monitors are used to provide prompt notification of a chlorine release.
