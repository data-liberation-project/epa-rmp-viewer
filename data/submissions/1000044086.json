It is the sincere objective of the City to operate processes that involve hazardous chemicals safely and to take all precautions necessary to prevent an accidental release.  Management places top priority on providing resources and qualified personnel to maintain safe operations.\n\n\n\nStationary Source Information\n\nThe Withlacoochee River WPCP is a NPDES permitted wastewater treatment facility, publicly owned and operated by the City of Valdosta.  The facility uses chlorine in the disinfection process before discharge of treated wastewater to the Withlacoochee River.  The facility is located in southwest Lowndes County, Georgia.  \n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nThe facility has had one CERCLA reportable accident within the past five years.  The accident resulted in the release of 15 pounds of chlorine, which was contained and controlled.  There were no injuries and no offsite impacts.  The accident was fully investigated.  The investigation resulted in the replacement of certain equipment and re-evaluation of the annual maintenance program.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention\n\nThe Withlacoochee River WPCP complies with generally accepted measures for this business type, and with all state and federal regulations.  The facility has chlorine storage and feed systems within enclosed buildings.  Process area monitors are used to provide prompt notification of a chlorine release.  Written operating procedures are designed to limit the chance of an accidental release.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe Withlacoochee River WPCP employees will not respond to a release of chlorine.  The facility has a written policy (with training) to inform the Valdosta Fire Department through the 911 system.  The Valdosta Fire Department has arranged to respond to the facility emergencies involving chlorine.  The Valdosta Fire Department is equipped to handle a release to t"
