The objective is to minimize the impact to Advanced Materials' employees, the public and the environment. This objective is met by continuing to utilize general good operating procedures, providing appropriate training to all employees, and coordinating response activities, as necessary, with the local emergency response providers. Dow's management is committed to providing the resources necessary to implement this policy.\n\n\n\nFacility Description\n\n\n\nDow is located in Weeks Island, LA and operates primarily as a manufacturer of zinc sulfide, zinc selenide, and silicon carbide. Methytrichlorosilane (MTS) and Hydrogen Selenide (H2SE) are utilized at the facility in sufficient quantities that exceed the threshold subject to the RMP requirements as detailed at 40 CFR Part 68. Another chemical H2S which is regarded as being potentially harmful is also used at the facility, but does not exceed the threshold applicability.  These substances are handled and stored using the best manufacturing practices, including specially designed collectors, cylinders, or bulk tank with mitigation measures. \n\n\n\nEmergency Contact\n\nMark Cresanti, site leader, is the designated emergency contact. Specific contact information is listed in the RMP eSubmit Tool. \n\n\n\nSubstance Description \n\n\n\nHydrogen selenide (N 29.4803.81 - W 91.4847.57) is generated at Weeks Island at the gas plant. Substance exceeds the threshold due to storage capacity. Hydrogen selenide is stored in i"

There are 20 cylinders connected by manifold and interconnected to the furnace. Maximum capacity of the equipment cylinders is 12,000 lbs minus the inventory controls. Daily production levels are entered into a database and monitored for total inventory. The inventory does not exceed 10,000 pounds. Maximum amount in the process:  10,000 pounds. The maximum flow rate to three furnaces is 30lbs/hour.  H2Se is produced at DOW by bubbling hydrogen gas (H2) through molten selenium metal (Se). This batch process is accomplished in a high temperature, water cooled, pressurized stainless steel reactor. This heterogeneous reaction produces gaseous H2Se which is later condensed into cooled collectors.  The hydrogen is stored both as a liquid in a vertical storage tank\n\n\n\nMTS (N 29.480632 - W 91.484933) is a flammable, corrosive liquid, with a specific gravity of 1.28, and a vapor pressure of 150 torr at 25 C.  It is delivered to Dow via a tank truck and transferred into a large above ground storage tank onsite at our Weeks Island Production Facility.  Substance exceeds the regulatory threshold based on the storage capacity. From the large storage tank, the MTS is transferred to smaller stainless steel processing bubblers.  The transfer is made by differential pressure through stainless steel tubing.  The bubblers are used to vaporize the MTS for introduction into the high temperature vacuum furnace.  Argon and/or nitrogen are used as a carrier gases for the MTS, as a flow component, and as an inerting gas.  The argon and/or nitrogen are supplied from liquid storage tanks.  MTS is stored in a 73,500 pound storage tank. When offloading occurs the tank level provides an indication when 1200 gallons are met. The safety interlock system will only allow 4540 gallons. Once the allocated amount is contained in the storage tank, the substance is transferred via pipeli"

Maximum capacity of the storage tank is 73,500 lbs, but the site's allowable storage capacity is 55,000 lbs. \n\n\n\nConsequence Analysis\n\n\n\nThe accidental Release Prevention Program requires facilities to evaluate the impact of a release of the regulated chemicals under well-defined conditions. Two types of releases must be considered; first, a \"worst case scenario\" must be examined and secondly, and an alternate case scenario. The model represents the worst case failure of the H2Se cylinders and an alternate case for the MTS tank and H2Se pipe transfer leak. \n\n\n\nThe modeling for both case scenarios was completed using EPA's RMP Comp under rural conditions. Based on a further review, an investigation proved that the combination of vegetation and tree shrubs within close proximity would be better modeled to benefit the community and environment under the rural condition. \n\n\n\nThe toxic worst case scenario consequence analysis performed for H2Se indicated if there's a rupture failure of the entire (40) cylinder interconnected manifold than a release of 2400 pounds could potential impact residence, schools, recreational parks, and an industrial business before dissipating at the endpoint of 18 miles. The mitigation measure for this scenario is the enclosed location of the cylinders. \n\n\n\nThe toxic alternative case scenario consequence analysis performed for H2Se indicated if there's a pipe leak at the discharge of the manifold release rate of 31.2 pounds/minute for 10 minutes could potential impact an industrial business before dissipating at the endpoint of 1.5 miles.

Therefore, the incidents are listed under the accident history and the quantity released was below 0.000001 pounds. \n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\n\nDow personnel are trained in emergency response and capable of responding 24 hours each day and seven days per week. These personnel receive annual training on emergency procedures and hazardous work operations (HAZWOPER) per OSHA related requirements. .\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nDow completes a thorough review of the potential impact of all chemicals that are considered for use at the facility. This includes compounds that are not specifically addressed under the RMP regulation. Furthermore a review is conducted on a routine basis to ensure that each process that employs hazardous chemicals are thoroughly examined.\n\n\n\nThe facility is governed by a set of OSHA and USEPA regulations that require planning and facility activities intended to prevent a release of hazardous material, or if a release inadvertently occurs, to minimize the consequences of a release to the employees of the facility, the public and the environment.
