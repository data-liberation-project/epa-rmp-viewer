      "SummaryText": "Foremost Farms USA doing business as Golden Guernsey Dairy stores up to 15,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia at the dairy plant located at 2101 Delafield Street, Waukesha, Wisconsin.  Ammonia is used as a refrigerant at the dairy facility.  The quantity stored exceeds the 10,000 pound TQ for ammonia, and is therefore regulated under 40 CFR Part 68.  Foremost Farms contracted Northern Environmental to prepare a Risk Management Program for ammonia at the facility.  The Risk Management Program consists of five elements:  the management system, hazard assessment, prevention program, emergency response, and the risk management plan (RMP) submittal.\n\nThe Foremost Farms-Waukesha facility lists Mr. Eric Van Den Heuvel, Operations Manager, as having overall responsibility for implementation of the risk management program.  Facility managers and supervisors assist the operations manager as delegated.\n\nThe hazard assessment included an off-site consequence analysis (OCA) and a summary of the 5-year accident history.  The OCA\u00bfs worst-case release scenario was the loss of 14,607 pounds of ammonia from the refrigeration system.  The OCA\u00bfs selected alternative release scenario was a release of 4,200 pounds of ammonia in 15 minutes.  There have not been any accidents within the last five years that resulted in deaths, injuries, property damage, or environmental damage. \n\nBecause ammonia is also regulated under the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard (29 CFR 1910.119), the prevention program elements under Program 3 of 40 CFR Part 68 apply.  These elements are safety information, process hazard analysis, operating procedures, training, mechanical integrity, management of change, pre-startup review, compliance audits, Incident investigation, employee participation, hot work permit, and contractors.  These elements are being implemented at the facility under the existing PSM program.  The facility cordinates with local emergency"
