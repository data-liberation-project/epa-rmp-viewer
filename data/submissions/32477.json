Raw water is processed and disinfected with  chlorine in the treatment process. The Water Treatment Plant maintains a maximum inventory of 12,000 pounds of chlorine in one-ton containers, which is above the threshold level and is therefore subject to the requirements of the Risk Management Program.\n\nChlorine, a chemical required by regulation to be used in the disinfection process, has been in use at the Water Treatment Plant since operation began.  No accidental releases of chlorine meeting the requirements of the five year accident history have occurred at the Plant.\n\nPrevention Program\n\nThe Water Treatment Plant is subject to Prevention Program 2 of the Risk Management Program.  In accordance with the requirements of Program 2, the Water Treatment Plant maintains specifications for the equipment associated with the chlorine feed system and has documented the codes and standards adhered to in designing, constructing, and operating the system.  The safe operating ranges for the chlorine system are documented, and it is operated within these safe ranges.\n\nAn updated hazard review was conducted on 6/07/2004 for the chlorine system and identified action items are expected to be completed by 12/31/2004.  When a major process change is made to the system, there are procedures in place to conduct a hazard review.  Otherwise, a hazard review is conducted every five years.\n\nWritten procedures for the operation and maintenance of the chlorine system are also in place at the Water Treatment Plant.  Procedures are reviewed and updated periodically by Plant personnel and whenever a major process change occurs. Additional safety equipment has been added to the operating system since the original filing of the Risk Management Plan.\n\nWater Treatment Plant operators receive training in the operation of the chl"

Additional safety equipment has been added and operators will receive training on the new operating procedures in 2004. Refresher training will be given at least every three years, or more often as necessary.  Only qualified operators operate the chlorine system.\n\nA team of Plant personnel conducts a compliance audit of the facility operations and procedures once every three years and whenever a major process modification is made.  A compliance audit checklist has been developed based on American Water Works Association recommendations. An audit was performed in June 2004 as part of the RMP renewal. A system to correct any deficiency discovered during the compliance audit is in place.\n\nIn the event of an accidental release, or a situation that could lead to an accidental release, there are procedures in place to investigate such incidents, develop findings and recommendations for corrective action, and implement the recommendations.\n\nFacility personnel are trained to notify emergency personnel in the event of a significant chlorine leak.  In the event a chlorine release requiring the assistance of offsite emergency response personnel occurs, the City of Cleburne Fire Department is responsible for responding to the accident, coordinating the emergency response effort, and notifying potentially affected areas in the surrounding community."
