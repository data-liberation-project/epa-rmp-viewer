      "SummaryText": "MATHESON TRI-GAS, INC. - NEW JOHNSONVILLE, TN BRANCH\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nThis Matheson Tri-Gas, Inc. facility transfills industrial grade hydrogen sulfide, a liquified gas, into compressed gas cylinders of varying sizes.  The source material gas is delivered by tanker and stored in two on-site tanks each with a capacity of approximately 35,000 lbs. The finished product cylinder capacities vary from 1,055 lbs. to less than 1 pound of gas.  The facility also stores arsine in cyclinders with capacities of 45 pounds  to less than 1 pound of gas.\n\nThe amount of hydrogen sulfide used in the filling process and the amount of arsine stored on site qualifies these processes for inclusion in the RMP program at the Program 3 level. \n\nWe believe a large gas release from this facility is extremely unlikely.  This facility has the equipment, the procedures and the training to ensure that a gas release impacting off-site areas will not occur.  They are described in the Prevention Program section of this Executive Summary.     \n\nDESCRIPTION OF WORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE CASE SCENARIOS\n\nWorst-Case Scenario\n\nIn compliance with the USEPA definition of a worst-case scenario, the loss of the entire contents of the largest container over a period of ten minutes was modeled using RMPComp.  Such a release is extremely unlikely since 1) it assumes catastrophic failure of a tank that is built to withstand pressures and temperatures well above normal operating conditions; 2) it assumes the simultaneous failure of all safeguards; and 3) no allowance is made for the presence and use of active mitigation systems and procedures.  Consequently this should not be considered a credible release situation. \n\nThe worst-case release scenario at this location for hydrogen sulfide assumes the loss of 35,000 lbs. of gas in ten minutes, resulting in a theoretical off-site impact of 11.0 miles.  \n\nAlternative case scenarios\n\nThe alternative release scenario for hydrogen sulfide is a break or rupture in the filling "

      "SummaryText": "line.  Releases are most likely to occur during the filling process, and the most likely weak point in the filling process is the line or pipe used to convey the gas from the tank to the product cylinder.\n\nAlternative release scenarios were modeled without considering any available mitigating equipment such as the scrubber.\n\nThe alternative case scenario for hydrogen sulfide filling assumes the loss of 1200 lbs. of gas over 60 minutes, resulting in a theoretical off-site impact of 0.3 mile.                                                                  \n\nThe alternative release scenario for arsine is a failure of the cylinder valve.  Releases in storage are most likely to occur at the cylinder valve.  A release scenario with off-site consequences would involve significant damage or shearing of the cylinder valve.  This scenario is unlikely because cylinders in storage are typically outfitted with a metal cap to protect the valve from damage.\n\nAlternative release scenarios were modeled without considering any available mitigating equipment such as the scrubber.\n\nThe alternative case scenario for arsine storage assumes the loss of 45 lbs. of gas over 8 minutes, resulting in a theoretical off-site impact of 0.6 mile.  \n      \n      \nACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no accidents in the last five years at this site involving RMP regulated processes. \n\nPREVENTION PROGRAM and EMERGENCY RESPONSE\n\nThere are numerous safeguards at this facility.  First and foremost is the construction of the tanks themselves. The National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) Codes and the Compressed Gas Association (CGA) guidelines mandate the way in which these tanks are constructed and used. The tanks are designed to withstand extremes of operation and overpressure conditions that make either catastrophic failure or routine leaks extremely unlikely.  \n\nThis facility is also equipped with mitigation equipment if a leak should occur.  There are scrubbers to capture emissions from failed, dam"

      "SummaryText": "aged or leaking equipment.   Monitors and shutoffs are also present. \n\nLast but not least there are procedures in place at this facility to ensure leaks do not occur, or to mitigate a leak if it does occur.  The tank, tank area, lines, valves,  pumps, and storage areas are routinely inspected. There are trained, experienced operators who have the required knowledge, skills and abilities to safely carry out their responsibilities who are able to assess and resolve possible problems before they result in a release.  The operators average over 4-10 years of experience at this facility on these processes.\n\nThe Emergency Response Plan at this facility includes notification of local agencies and medical providers.  Employees have been trained and drilled in emergency response.  There is an Emergency Response Team on site that has been trained in accordance with OSHA 29 CFR 1910.120 (Q)(6)(iii).  They have access to the necessary equipment and training to quickly respond to an emergency release.   \n\nPLANNED UPGRADES\n\nThe facility is currently involved in multiple upgrades related to both processes.  These upgrades include expansion of fire mitigation, chemical emission mitigation, and chemical detection systems, dock expansions, and infrastructure improvements."
