The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendation(s) to prevent a reoccurrence and forwards these results to the business management team for resolution.\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, Enterprise periodically conducts an audit of the program to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented. Compliance audits are conducted at least every three years. Both hourly and staff personnel participate as audit team members. The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to operations or facility management for resolution. The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.\n\nChemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe processes at the Pascagoula Gas Plant have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.

The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe Pascagoula Gas Plant has well established practices and procedures for maintaining process equipment. The basic aspects of this program include (1) training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting equipment deficiencies, when identified and (5) applying quality assurance measures. In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.\n\nSafe Work Practices\n\nThe Pascagoula Gas Plant has safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety. Examples of these include: (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous substances before process piping and equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e. hot work) and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space. These procedures, along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely\n\nManagement of Change\n\nThe Pascagoula Gas Plant uses Enterprise software-based change approval system to manage change to all covered processes.

This information includes materials of construction, design pressure ratings, temperature ratings and electrical rating of equipment.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nEnterprise primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) and Checklist method analysis technique to perform these evaluations. The analyses are conducted using a team of Enterprise staff which has operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes recommendations for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution. Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team. This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention. All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nAs part of Enterprise Process Hazard Analysis program, the facility will periodically update and revalidate the hazard analysis results.\n\nOperating"
