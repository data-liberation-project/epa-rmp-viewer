The Emergency Action Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of this PSM/RMP document.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n  1.)  To save lives.\n  2.)  To minimize and avoid injuries.\n  3.)  To protect the environment.\n  4.)  To minimize property damage.\n\nPatterson Frozen Foods, Inc. maintains a safety committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate facility changes.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe regulated substance of concern at Patterson Frozen Foods, Inc. is ammonia which is used in four interconnected refrigeration systems.  The areas that use ammonia include the  Warehouse System, Warehouse #7 System, Main (engine room) System, and East Complex System.\n\nAmmonia is use in one process as a refrigerant.  The maximum intended inventory at Patterson Frozen Food, Inc. is 93,156 pounds. \n\nWarehouse System\n\nThe Warehouse System provides refrigeration for cold storage rooms and various process equipment.  High pressure warm liquid ammonia is fed through an intercooler serpentine coil to sub-cool the high pressure liquid ammonia.  Sub-cooled liquid ammonia is then fed to various vessels and/or evaporators: Warehouse #5 liquid coolers, Warehouse #6 liquid coolers, Warehouse #6 accumulators, Warehouse #4 accumulator, cold storage rooms evaporators, 36? room evaporators, 36? room chiller, bean cooler, repack "

It \"traps\" excess liquid coming back from the evaporators through the suction line preventing any liquid from entering the booster compressors.  When the ammonia level in the slop tank reaches the high limit float switch, the IT pump comes \"on\" and pumps liquid ammonia into the \"dump system\" or liquid transfer vessel that is located directly above the high pressure receiver.  When the vessel is approximately 3/4 full the IT pump stops the three way valve to close the low side port & opens the hot gas port pressurizing the vessel until pressure equalizes with the pressure in the high pressure receiver then liquid ammonia drops (by gravity) into the high pressure receiver.  In the refrigeration system the expansion device reduces the high pressure refrigerant to the accumulators and or evaporator's low pressure.\n\nThe liquid cooler for Warehouse #5 cools the sub-cooled refrigerant to a lower temperature and then is fed to the Warehouse #5 coils.  The liquid cooler at Warehouse #6 provides the same function as the cooler at Warehouse #5 but also feeds liquid to two (2) accumulators which supply \"pumped\" liquid to four (4) evaporator fan units.  The low pressure vapor from all low side loads is then drawn back to the low pressure receiver. or slop tank by the booster compressors in the engine room.  This vapor is compressed to a higher pressure and discharged by the boosters to the intercooler.  Refrigerant vapor in the intercooler is drawn by the high stage screen compressors and compresses to a higher pressure and temperature so that the heat of vaporization and compression can be rejected and the vapor or gas can be condensed back into liquid by the condenser.\n\nAs an option the warehouse engine room can also provide refrigeration to Warehouses #2 and #3 in the main building.\n\nWareh"

High pressure liquid ammonia is transferred through an intercooler to lower the temperature of the high pressure liquid.  High pressure liquid is also transferred from the receiver to evaporators 9 through 16.  Subcooled liquid is transferred from the intercooler to the low pressure receiver, or accumulator, where the pressure (temperature) of the liquid is reduced.  The resulting low pressure liquid is pumped to evaporators 1 through 8.  The vapor return from these evaporators is cycled back to the accumulator.  Booster compressors remove the refrigerant vapor from the accumulator and compress it to high pressure vapor.  The compressed vapor from the booster compressors and vapor return from evaporators 9 through 16 are transferred to the intercooler, where refrigerant vapor is removed by the high stage compressors.  Compressed vapor from the booster and high stage compressors is discharged through oil separator vessels to dissociate the oil build-up in the compressed vapor.  High pressure vapor discharged from the high stage compressors is condensed by a condenser and transferred back to the receiver.\n\nWarehouse #7 is comprised of one cold storage room and a dock area which house evaporators 1 through 8 and 9 through 16, respectively.  Unlike evaporators 1 through 8 which receive low pressure liquid from the accumulator, evaporators 9 through 16 receive high pressure liquid from the receiver, which enables products to be cooled at warmer temperatures.\n\nMain Engine Room System\n\nThe Main (engine room) system uses ammonia in various process equipment and in Warehouses 1, 2, and 3.

The Main Enginer Room receiver is the largest vessel in the system with a maximum capapcity of 33,266 pounds of ammonia.  This vessel is located inside; therefore, the building was incoprorated as a mitigation measure resulting in a release rate to the outside air of 1830 pounds per minute.  The most pessimistic meteorological conditions were used: 1.5 meters/second wind speed, and F stability.  Exhibit 4-4 from the EPA's RMP Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration Facilities was used to determine the distance to the toxic endpoint of 200 ppm for rural topography.  This release reaches off-site and may affect population receptors.  No Environmental receptors were affected by the potential release scenario.\n\nAlternative Release Result Summary - Ammonia\n\nScenario Description: A release of ammonia from resulting from a 1/4 inch diameter hole in a pipe.

This release reaches off-site and may affect population receptors.  No Environmental receptors were affected by the potential release scenario.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe Patterson Frozen Foods, Inc. facility including the  ammonia refrigeration system was designed and constructed in accordance with the Uniform Mechanical Code which specifically outlines requirements for the safe operation of ammonia refrigeration systems.  These safety features include  ammonia sensors and automatic shut down buttons both located throughout the facility.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nIt was noted during the chlorine PHA study and ammonia PHA revalidation study that four accidental ammonia have occurred at the facility within the past five years.\n\n1) In December 1995, a thermal valve failed to release approximately 346 pounds of liquid ammonia in the closed warehouse #2.  The local Fire Department responded and the leak was stopped by isolating the line.  No injuries were reported.\n\n2) In January 1996, a pressure relief valve failed and released approximately 166 pounds of vapor ammonia to off-site.  Some fumes drifted down wind and was noticed about one block away.  The local Fire Department responded, the facility was evacuated, and the leak was stopped by isolating the line.  No injuries were reported.\n\n3) In February 1996, over 100 pounds of saturated vapor ammonia were release in the main plant engine room.  Nuts on a hydraulic pump were stripped down, creating a crack in the bottom of the pump.  The local Fire Department was called to notify the nearby school.  The facility was evacuated and the leak was stopped by isolating the line.  One"

The stack fell and broke an ammonia liquid line connection.  Approximately 100 pounds of ammonia was released.  The facility personnel was evacuated and the leak was stopped by isolating the line.  No injuries were reported.\n\nThe causes of the releases, the facility's subsequent actions, and the mitigation measures that resulted from these five incidents were discussed as part of the HAZOP study.  \n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe Patterson Frozen Foods, Inc. has an emergency action plan in effect at the facility.
