The raw materials and process chemicals utilized by the plant are delivered via truck and rail from external sources.  Access to the site by vendors, employees and visitors is controlled by fencing and security checkpoints.  One of the chemicals utilized in the corn milling process at the Eddyville facility is regulated under 40 CFR Part 68.  The Process department stores and maintains sulfur dioxide (SO2), a chemical that is present at or above threshold amounts for regulated substances. This department contains the only processes at the facility that is subject to the above regulation, which addresses the potential off-site hazards of accidental releases.  \n\nThe EPA Risk Management Regulation identifies three levels of requirements for industrial processes.  Program 1 can be applied to any process which has not had a \"significant\" release of a regulated substance over the five year period prior to the June 1999 compliance date and for which the worst-case release does not affect \"public receptors\" (e.g., residences, parks and recreation areas, commercial/industrial facility, hospitals).  Program 2 applies to any process that is ineligible for Program 1 and is not subject to Program 3.  Program 3 applies to all processes, such as those present at the Cargill Corn Milling Division facility, that are subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management Standard (PSM). The Cargill Accident Prevention Program elements are adopted directly from the compliance program for the PSM standard, consistent with the Level 3 RMP Program requirements for this Cargill facility under 40 CFR Part 68.

The first step in the corn milling process involves steeping the corn kernels in water tanks, into which vaporized SO2 is injected. The SO2 and water form a dilute solution of sulfurous acid that helps to soften the kernel, breakdown proteins and remove soluble constituents. The steeped corn then travels through degerminating mills and separation processes designed to remove the germ and separate out the starch.  The starch slurry is then rinsed in water into which additional vaporized SO2 is injected.  Approximately 80% of this starch slurry is utilized in the production of corn syrup, sugar and ethanol.  \n\nThe Process department is responsible for the storage and transfer of sulfur dioxide (SO2) that is utilized in the corn milling process.  The SO2 is stored in an exterior storage tank as a pure liquefied gas at ambient temperatures.  The maximum capacity of the tank is 25,400 gallons.  A passive interlock device prevents filling to greater than 21,590 gallons (approximately 265,000lbs). Access to the loading area is limited by chain link fence and secured by locks.  \n\n\n3.0  HAZARD ASSESSMENT\n\n\nFor the purposes of developing and maintaining adequate Risk Management Plans, the EPA has defined in its governing rules and guidance a series of modeling methods and assumptions which are to be used as administrative guides for planning purposes.  In order to standardize and simplify the many factors that can potentially occur in an accidental release situation, some of these assumptions may not take into account the available preventive measures or mitigation methods that could diminish or even eliminate the implied risks that are suggested by \"worst-case\" analyses. For that reason, both the results for the standardized \"worst-case\" defined by the EPA methods and an alter"

The sections of the Risk Management Plan which discuss both worst-case and alternative cases are meant to provide the data necessary to develop and evaluate possible improvements in the overall safety programs of the Cargill RMP program. \n\n3.1 Worst-Case Release Assessment\n\n3.1.1 Worst-Case Release Assumptions\n\nThe worst-case release scenario, as defined by 40 CFR Part 68, is a sudden release of the maximum amount of a stored regulated substance from a single vessel, regardless of whether several vessels are interconnected.  For toxic gases such as SO2 that are stored at ambient temperatures it is assumed that the release occurs over a 10-minute period.  The release with the most extensive zone of influence, defined as the distance to specified \"toxic endpoints\", is considered the worst-case release for each facility. Only passive mitigation (e.g., dikes, enclosures) and administrative controls may be accounted for in the evaluation.\n\nEPA has established \"toxic endpoints\" for regulated chemicals based on the American Industrial Hygiene Association (ACGIH) Emergency Response Planning Guideline, Level 2 (ERPG-2), which protects individuals from health-threatening or escape-impairing injury.  The ERPG-2 is defined as:\n\n\"the maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to 1 hr without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms which could impair an individual's ability to take protective action.\"\n\nGiven that the worst-case is a 10-minute release duration with a 10-minute concentration averaging time, the actual hazard zone is typically overestimated by the ERPG-2. Within such a time period there are a number of emergency measures that can reduce or eliminate exposures to levels this high fo"

Since, as indicated below, the resulting planning zone predicted for the \"worst-case\" SO2 toxic release potentially affects public receptors, regulated processes at the Cargill Corn Milling Division facility are subject to Program 3 requirements.  \n\nEPA's Risk Management Program Guidance for Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCAG, EPA 550-B-99-009) provides simplified methods to estimate endpoint distances.  Alternatively, as noted in EPA's General Guidance for Risk Management Programs (EPA 550-B-98-008), more complex models may be applied.  EPA's Guidance on the Application of Refined Dispersion Models for Hazardous/Toxic Air Release (EPA-454/R-93-002) identifies a number of refined dispersion models that are available for off-site hazard assessment applications for risk management programs.  Sulfur dioxide has a molecular weight that is substantially greater than the ambient air. Therefore, concentrated plumes of this substance resulting from accidental releases often display heavy-gas behavior.  In such cases, near-field dispersion is dominated by gravitational slumping of the plume and entrainment of air at the plume-air interface.  The Dense Gas DISpersion (DEGADIS) Model (Version 2.1) was developed by the U.S. Coast Guard and the Gas Research Institute to model dense gas releases and its use has been approved by the U.S. EPA.  The model is used to predict the dispersion of dense gases from ground level releases over flat, level terrain.  For these reasons, DEGADIS was used to model the worst-case release scenario.\n\nThe 1999 Revised OCAG provides a basic approach to estimating endpoint distances based on an ambient temperature of 77?F.  However, the RMP rule requires that if dispersion techniques other than the OCAG are applied, the maximum daily temperature over the last three years be used.

The surface roughness affects the amount of dispersion that occurs within a released plume and influences the distance to toxic endpoint. The surface roughness used in determining the distance to \"toxic endpoint\" should be characteristic of the transport path of the plume from the release point to the endpoint distance.  'Urban' surface roughness indicates areas where there are many obstacles, such as industrial buildings or trees.  'Rural' indicates that there are no buildings in the immediate vicinity of a facility and that the terrain is generally flat and unobstructed. \n\nIn the immediate vicinity of the Cargill Corn Milling facility, the aerodynamic surface roughness is clearly 'urban' in nature, whereas at greater distances, the surface roughness is 'rural'.  In order to report the most conservative 'distance to toxic endpoint' estimates in the Risk Management Plan, Cargill has elected to model the release assuming a \"rural\" surface roughness.  A rural surface roughness value of 10 cm, which is consistent with the land use surrounding the facility, was utilized in the DEGADIS model.\n\nIn accordance with 40 CFR Part 68, the worst-case modeling is conducted assuming a very stable atmosphere with limited dispersion (F stability and 1.5 m/sec wind speed).  Analysis of three years of meteorological data from the National Weather Service at Des Moines, Iowa indicates that these dispersion conditions occur less than 5% of the time (or about 1.2 hours per day, on average).  The most predominant directions of transport are to the north and northwest. \n\n3.1.2 Worst-Case Release Characterization\n\nThe 40 CFR, Part 68 prescribed worst-case scenario for the Eddyville facility consists of a 10-minute gaseous ground-level "

The modeling results indicated that the worst-case SO2 release would result in a distance to \"toxic endpoint\" extending well off-site and encompassing a sizable resident population, based on the 1990 Federal Census, and estimated by applying EPA's LandView III program.  Public receptors were identified using 1:24,000 scale U.S.G.S maps, supplemented with comprehensive maps of the local Eddyville area (Rand McNally, 1990, and DeLorme Street Atlas USA, Version 5).   The potential worst-case hazard zone includes schools, hospitals, public recreation areas, and industrial/commercial areas. Several environmental receptors (defined as National or State parks, forests, officially designated wildlife sanctuaries, preserves, refuges, and federal wilderness areas) are also located within the worst-case impact zone. \n\nCargill notes that it is impossible to release 265,000 lbs of SO2 to the air in 10 minutes because the amount of heat energy required to so rapidly vaporize the liquid SO2 would not be available.  If the storage tank were to breach, liquid SO2 would spill to the ground in a boiling pool.  If a hole were to form in the vapor space of the storage tank, the flashing vapor in the tank would cause the tank to auto-refrigerate, thereby gradually reducing the release rate with time.  However, Cargill evaluated this 10-minute release to comply with the noted regulation.\n\n3.2 Alternative Release Assessment\n\nAlternative releases are intended to represent release scenarios that have a greater likelihood of occurrence than a worst-case release.

Each scenario was evaluated and the scenarios most likely to occur and to result in off-site impacts were selected for modeling. In order to determine the most conservative off-site consequence estimates, Cargill has chosen to include in the Risk Management Plan the alternative release scenario that resulted in the greatest \"toxic endpoint\" distance.\n\nIn accordance with the RMP rule, alternative releases are modeled under typical (rather than worst-case) dispersion conditions.  The EPA OCAG default dispersion conditions are neutral atmosphere, (D stability and 3 m/sec wind speed). A review of climatological data for Des Moines, IA, confirmed that these conditions are typical of the area and therefore are suitable for the evaluation of alternative releases. Unlike the worst-case release (for which an instantaneous spill or 10-minute ground-level gas release is assumed), alternative scenarios can account for the actual release configuration as well as both active and passive mitigation.\n\nAlternative dispersion modeling was conducted using EPA's OCAG.  In order to report the most conservative \"distance to toxic endpoint\" estimates, only the modeling results based on 'rural' surface conditions are included in the Risk Management Plan.  However, it should be noted that, under actual conditions, plume dispersion would be enhanced by the 'urban' type surfaces near the facility, and result in shorter distances to \"toxic endpoint\".

It is conservatively assumed that the sulfur dioxide would then be dispersed as a heavy gas and the excess flow valve on the railcar would not engage.  Cargill has estimated that it would take an operator approximately 30 minutes to respond and shutdown the flow of SO2, resulting in a total release of 48,000 lbs.  This alternative SO2 release scenario is expected to be more representative of the maximum anticipated release at the facility than the \"worst-case\".  \n\n\nThe OCAG indicates that under 'rural' conditions, the distance to \"toxic endpoint\" would extend off-site in the vicinity of the facility.
