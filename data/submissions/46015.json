The Facility Policy\n\n    MFA Incorporated and the employees of the MFA Agri Service in Mexico are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Little Dixie Fire Department, and other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information\n\n    The primary activity at the facility is the receiving, storage and distribution of bulk dry and liquid fertilizer and anhydrous ammonia for direct application as crop nutrients.  The facility also handles pesticides, grain, feed, and farm supply products.\n\n    This plan does include predictive filing, as railroad tank cars may be onsite. The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia stored at any one time would be 931,925 pounds.  The facility has (1) 30,000-gallon storage tank, (1) 12,000-gallon storage tank, and the largest tank onsite would be a railroad tank car containing approximately 162,563 pounds.  There may be occasions where multiple railroad tank cars would be located at the facility.  The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a railroad tank car holding approximately 162,563 pounds.  The facility also has (54) 1,000-gallon nurse tanks, (5) 560-gallon applicator tanks, and (1) 400-gallon applicator tanks for product distribution.\n\n3. The Accidental Release Prevention Program.\n\n    The facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1, published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., the Missouri Anhydrous Ammonia Law, and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".
