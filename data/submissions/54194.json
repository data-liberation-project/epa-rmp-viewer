This filtration plant is owned by Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority (PRASA) which is a Government Agency.\nPRASA has developed the RMP following the Program # 3 for the Management and Prevention of Risks associated with the storage and handling of the toxic substance used as for water disinfection: Chlorine. The RMP was prepared in compliance with EPA 40 CFR Part 68. The prevention program was prepared in accordance with OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation as established in 29 CFR Part 1910.119.\n\nAccidental Release:\n\nIt is PRASA policy to comply with EPA and OSHA Federal and Puerto Rican applicable requirements. Chlorine is a toxic substance regulated by EPA, for that reason Humacao Filtration Plant has undergone some engineering controls.  Changes have been put in place to improve sefety and as a part of the Prevention Plan implanted to protect the wellness of workers, employees, Contractors, visitors and immediately surrounding areas and inhabitants.\n\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated Substance handled.\n\nHumacao Filtration Plant is located close to the area where the plant supplies the potable water. The Chlorine is used as a disinfectant to destroy the microorganism that could cause illness in humans.\nThe Chlorine is delivered from the PRASA Storage and Distributiong Center, Puerto Nuevo to the plant in 1 ton containers. Humacao Filtration Plant may has a  maximum storage capacity of 12,000 pounds distributed in six (6) containers. The containers are connected to chlorinators from which the chlorine flows to the ejectors and the chlorine solution flow to two disinfection point. \n\nWorst Case Scenario:\n\nThe Worst Case Scenario was determined as indicated in the EPA Wastewater Treatment Plant, as per Appendix F, Supplemental Risk Management Program Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants. This guidance considers the release o"

No known environmental receptors (state parks, or official designated wildlife preserves) are located within this radio area. The ALOHA Modeling Dispertion Program was used to simulate the gas dispersion. \n\nAlternative Case Scenario:\n\nThe more realistic scenario was also simulated as per EPA Wastewater Treatment Plants parameters, as a release of the total content of a 2000 lbs container, but throughout a pipe leak. In the alternative case the end point distance is specified as 0.1 miles and 529 public receptors were identified over the most recent map. Also no known Environmental receptors are located within this radio area.\n\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention Program \n\nPRASA is actually close to implement a Prevention Plan to ensure the maintenance and mechanical integrity of the facilities which will improve significantly the safety scope of the current prevention plans. Different Standard Operational Procedures (SOP) are already in place to comply the OSHA and PROSHO requirements in order to keep all the involved parties aware of the hazardous and risk related to the Chlorine. List of all SOP are indicated in the PSM report and are located in the plant.\n\nEmergency Response Program:\n\nPRASA has various SOPs to manage emergency programs associated to a release of the Chemical and also related to the Emergency actions to be taken before and after hurricanes and other atmospherics events.                                                        \nFiv"

      "SummaryText": "e years Accident History:\nNo mayor release of chlorine in excess of 10 lbs has been reported during the last five years. \n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\nPRASA has already implemented in Humacao Filtration Plant, a vacuum operated system to improve the control of the process and the safety of the Chlorine handling and storage. It is still needed to reinforced administrative activities related to Containers handling and transportation,  preventive maintenance and audits. Recommendations were given on that regard on last PHA dated March 11, 2009."
