The facility is managed and operated by Onondaga Renewables LLC. Onondaga Renewables LLC is a Renewable EWG facility in Syracuse, New York that is subject to U.S. EPA regulations governing Accidental Release Prevention (ARP) Requirements: Risk Management Programs under Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act (40 CFR Part 68).  This Risk Management Plan (RMP) has been developed in accordance with the requirements specified under 40 CFR Part 68, Subpart G. This RMP certifies that ORLLC has instituted a Risk Management Program at the Syracuse, New York facility that is in compliance with U.S. EPA ARP requirements. \nThe RMP includes an Executive Summary and Data Elements following the format published by U.S. EPA.  In addition to identifying the applicable corporate policies and risk management systems, identifies a set of worst case and alternative release scenarios, the potential off-site consequences of those releases, and the facility's five-year accidental release history.  This RMP certifies that prevention and emergency response programs are in place so as to minimize risks to workers and the potentially affected public.\n\n 2.0  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION POLICIES\n2.1 RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES\nIt is the policy of ORLLC management to implement the requirements of the Risk Management Program (RMP) in accordance with the USEPA regulations under 40 CFR Part 68. The objective of this program is to minimize the risk of a release of a hazardous material and, if a release were to occur, to minimize the potential impact to ORLLC employees, the public and the environment.  \nThis objective will be accomplished by utilizing good operating procedures, providing appropriate training to all employees, and coordinating response activities, as necessary, with the local emergency response providers.

Further, the ORLLC management recognizes that it has a duty to protect its employees and neighbors from the effects of all dangerous chemicals.\n2.2 RISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM\nThe ORLLC facility has developed a management system to implement and maintain compliance with the ARP Program and related chemical safety and emergency response programs.  At the ORLLC facility, the Plant Manager has primary responsibility for implementing and ensuring compliance with the ARP Program. Other individual employees, including the Operations Manager, will assist the Plant Manager with various aspects of the program as required.\n\n 3.0  PROCESSES AND SUBSTANCES SUBJECT TO 40 CFR 68\n3.1 FACILITY OVERVIEW\nThe ORLLC facility is a Renewable EWG facility, which produces electric power for sale to the system. The ORLLC facility is a biomass facility undergoing final design/engineering. It is expected that the ammonia storage system will remain unchanged.\nThe redesigned facility emissions of nitrogen oxides will be controlled with  Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR). SCR is a process which involves the post-combustion removal of nitrogen oxides from the combustion flue gas with a catalytic reactor. In the SCR process, aqueous ammonia, which is injected into the boiler exhaust gas stream, reacts with the nitrogen oxides and oxygen in the exhaust gas stream to form nitrogen and water.\nIt is this aqueous ammonia (CAS No. 7664-41-7) which is a regulated substance under 40 CFR 68 and present at the site in amounts greater than the threshold quantity.\n3.2 PROCESS DESCRIPTION\nAmmonia is present at the facility in the form of an aqueous solution in concentrations ranging up to 30 percent. The aqueous ammonia is delivered to the site via tank truck and stored in an above ground tank with a maximum capacity of 18,000 gallons (40,554 pounds). The tank is surrounded by a dike of sufficient volume to completely contain and spill from the storage tank. A piping system (both above and be"

Prior to injection into the boiler exhaust gas stream, the aqueous ammonia is vaporized and injected as a gas. \n3.3 PROGRAM LEVEL IDENTIFICATION\nThe EPA Risk Management Regulation identifies three levels of requirements defined as programs.  EPA recognizes that some regulated processes would not pose an off-site hazard in the event of an accidental release.  Such processes are classified as Program 1.  Program 1 is applicable to any process for which it can be demonstrated that the public would not be adversely affected by a release. Thus, to qualify for Program 1, a facility with a regulated toxic chemical needs to meet two criteria.  \nno release over the most recent 5-year period has resulted in off-site injury or environmental damage; and \ndispersion modeling demonstrates that a worst-case release (as defined by the regulation) will not result in concentrations at public receptors that exceed the toxic endpoint.\nThe ORLLC facility has not had an accident or release involving the aqueous ammonia during the history of the facility. However, the worst-case release, as defined by the regulation, results in concentrations at public receptors just beyond the facility fenceline that exceed the toxic endpoint. Therefore, the aqueous ammonia process is not eligible for Program 1.\nProgram 2 and 3 are applicable to processes that do not qualify for Program 1. Program 3 applies to processes that are subject to Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management Standard (PSM) or listed among nine North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) codes. All other processes are subject to Program 2. The aqueous ammonia process is not subject to the OSHA PSM standard, therefore the process is subject to Program 2.\n\n 4.0  HAZARD ASSESSMENT\nFor the purposes of developing and maintaining adequate Risk Management Plans, the EPA has defined in its governing rules and guidance a series of model"

In order to standardize and simplify the many factors that can potentially occur in an accidental release situation, some of these assumptions may not take into account the available preventive measures or mitigation methods that could diminish or even eliminate the implied risks that are suggested by \"worst-case\" analyses. For that reason, the standardized \"worse-cases\" defined by EPA and an alternative case which is believed by the facility to more realistically represent situations that may possibly, but rarely, occur within the lifetime of the facility, have been modeled. In accordance with changes to the Risk Management Plan requirements promulgated in April 2004, specific information about the off-site consequence assessment is provided only in the Data Elements of the Risk Management Plan.\n4.1 WORST-CASE\nThe worst-case release scenario, as defined by 40 CFR Part 68, is a sudden release of the maximum amount of a stored regulated substance from the largest single vessel.  The EPA's Risk Management Program Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants (EPA 1998) was utilized to determine distance to the toxic endpoint for the worst-case release. \n4.2 ALTERNATIVE RELEASES OF TOXIC SUBSTANCES\nAlternative releases are intended to represent release scenarios that have a greater likelihood of occurrence than a worst-case release.   In accordance with the RMP rule, alternative releases are modeled under typical (rather than worst-case) dispersion conditions. Unlike the worst-case release, alternative scenarios can account for the actual release configuration, and account for both active and passive mitigation.\nThe ORLLC facility performed a thorough review of the aqueous ammonia process utilizing engineering plans, operational experience, and maintenance records, in order to identify potential alternative release scenarios. Each identified alternative release scenario was eva"

Based on this analysis, a representative alternative release was modeled and included in the Data Elements. \n5.0  ACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\nThe elements of the Program 2 Prevention Program are safety information, hazard review, operating procedures, training, maintenance, incident investigation, and compliance audits. Each is discussed briefly below.\n5.1 SAFETY INFORMATION\nThe facility keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters, specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.\n5.2 HAZARD REVIEW\nThe facility used the What-If/Checklist analysis technique to perform the evaluation of the regulated systems. The analyses were conducted using a team of people who have operation and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identified and evaluated hazards of the process, accident prevention and mitigation measures, and made suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believed such measures were necessary. The recommendations from the team will be tracked to completion.\n5.3 OPERATING PROCEDURES\nThe facility maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as: unit startup, operations, shutdown, and loading. These procedures form the basis of the operator training and are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate. \n1.1. TRAINING\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the facility has a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating the affected process. A combination of classroom and on-the-job training and observation is used to ensure the person has developed the necessary skills.  All operators receive refresher training each three yea"

MAINTENANCE\nThe facility has an established maintenance program for maintaining the mechanical integrity of the process equipment. This program includes daily visual inspection of all equipment. All mechanical equipment are maintained per the manufacturer's recommended maintenance schedules. \n1.3. INCIDENT INVESTIGATION\nThe facility has in place an incident investigation procedure for the complete investigation of all incidents at the facility. These procedures include not only the RMP affected substance, aqueous ammonia, but all environmental incidents at the facility. The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to plant management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are completed.\n1.4. COMPLIANCE AUDITS\nCompliance audits for the accidental release prevention program elements are conducted every three years. The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to plant management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented in an audit report.\nThe most recent of the triennial audits was performed 10/22/01. A system safety audit was performed by Aquila Safety on 08/21/03.\n              \n 6.0  FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nIn conjunction with the ORLLC facility's existing emergency response and incident investigation procedures, there is a standard management practice that requires immediate internal reporting of unusual events, including those in which any abnormal emission of regulated chemicals is observed or suspected. The incident information is reviewed by supervisory staff and a determination is made as to w"

If so, the appropriate authorities are promptly notified. \nDuring the past 5 years there has been no accident involving aqueous ammonia that qualifies for reporting under 40 CFR Part 68.\n\n 7.0  EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nThe ORLLC facility has coordinated potential emergency response activities with the Onondaga County LEPC. Procedures are in place to ensure that the LEPC is prepared to respond to an emergency at the facility. An emergency action plan is in place to ensure that the LEPC is notified promptly in the event of an emergency and to ensure the safety of the employees. \nFacility personnel are not expected to \"respond\" to an emergency as defined by the OSHA HAZWPOPER Standard. Facility personnel are expected to perform incidental response activities to minimize incidental or minor releases.\n 8.0  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nThe ORLLC facility management recognizes that process safety is not only critical to facility operations but also for the safety of the employees and the community. The management system, which has been implemented at the facility, is designed to ensure that process safety is implemented on an ongoing, daily basis. \nAs a result of the process hazards analysis, additional maintenance procedures were identified to improve the effectiveness of the existing mitigation system. These will be developed and implemented in an expeditious manner."
