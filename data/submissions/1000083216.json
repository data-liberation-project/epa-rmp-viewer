Employee(s) working at the site make routine observations prior to and during any operations related to the anhydrous tanks. In so doing, they are able to detect problems before they arise. This routine inspection identifies any external portion of the system which my be under stress or about to fail. Repairs can be made before they become problematic. Employee(s) are annually trained to recognize hazards associated with handling anhydrous ammonia. In addition to annual training for employee(s) who have been on the job for a number of years, the company conducts training for new hires. This training includes classroom instruction, on-site training, and follow-up observation to determine the comprehension and understanding of the new hire. FInally, the company routinely invites local fire department personnel to visit the site. In the event that the local fire department requests assistance in training its employees on anhydrous ammonia, the company cooperates fully in their endeavors.",

If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to immediately notify the Mediapolis City Fire Department (via 911 call) and request that it respond to the emergency. Incidental to the notification to the fire department, a call to the Des Moines County, IA LEPC will be made.\n\n\n\nWhile we have planned for an emergency, it is acknowledged that a real emergency will be unexpected and may very much different and cannot be ensured to duplicate what may have been planned. In reality, the situation that develops may not happen in the manner in which it has been planned. In that event, what may have been planned will service only as a guideline to follow.\n\n\n\nThe Emergency Action Plan for this site describes certain procedures that are intended to minimize the hazards associated with human health and the environment from fires, explosions, the sudden and unexpected release of chemicals (i.e. Anhydrous Ammonia), tornadoes, bomb threats, or other accident or acts of God which might occur on our premises.\n\n\n\nThe primary emergency coordinator for the River Valley Cooperative site is Doug Hollingsworth.

      "SummaryText": " is an anhydrous ammonia distribution site. The anhydrous ammonia that is stored at this site is distributed to agricultural crop producers in the surrounding area who utilize the anhydrous ammonia for crop nutrient purposes.\n\n\n\nThe system consists of seasonal anhydrous ammonia nurse tanks. From time-to-time throughout the year numerous portable nurse tanks are present at this site. The anhydrous ammonia site is only operated on a seasonal basis (spring and fall). Full-time equivalent employee numbers were computed on this basis. At a maximum, the site operates a total of three (3) months (1/4 of the year). The FTEs at this site is two (2).\n\n\n\nTHE WORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASES:\n\n\n\nThe worst-case scenario at the site would be the largest nurse tank when filled to the greatest amount allowed (85% of capacity), resulting in the release of the total volume in a gaseous (hazardous ammonia vapor cloud) form. According to EPA's RMP*Comp Program, the distance to the endpoint is 1.5 miles.\n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario involves a vessel leak from a liquid valve. The resulting release, according to EPA's RMP*Comp Program, has a distance to endpoint of 0.3 miles.\n\n\n\nThe system is protected from major releases by internal excess flow valves, check valves and relief valves.\n\n\n\nSince the site is located in relatively close proximity to the Town of Mediapolis, provisions have been designed to notify all affected persons. An evacuation plan is in place.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS:\n\n\n\nThe site complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable State and local codes and regulations. The anhydrous ammonia system is designed, installed and maintained in accordance with ANSI Standard CGA-most current copy with amendments and State law.\n\n\n\nIn addition, the company has specific operating procedures in place intended to minimize the potential for an accidental (and potentially catastrophic) release of anh"
