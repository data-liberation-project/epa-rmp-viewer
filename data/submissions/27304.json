Planned Changes to Improve Safety\nSeveral developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program. The Great Lakes Chemical Newport Plant plans to continuously improve and update operating procedures, replace or maintain equipment to original specifications or design codes and develop and implement safety improvement capital projects.  These are some of the major steps we have taken to improve safety at our facility:  \n\nAn additional water monitor (cannon) was installed before startup of the DBB process in Building 21 This addition was determined during a table top drill performed before the startup of the process and affords improved control of bromine vapor in the event of a release.\n\nA water \"blanket\" is maintained in the secondary concrete dikes, which contain the bromine storage tanks. A bromine release will sink through the water layer and evaporation will be greatly minimized.\n\nThese changes have been implemented by 12/31/98.\n\nAs part of planning for any additional RMP regulated chemicals that are not currently stored at the Newport Plant, Great Lakes Chemical Corporation will conducted detailed examination of new processes to include passive mitigation structures and measures to minimize or stop releases. \n\n8.
