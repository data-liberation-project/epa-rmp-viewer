Facility Policy \n\nThe management and employees of The McGregor Company are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia through the use of proper equipment, regular inspections, maintenance and training of all persons that work with anhydrous ammonia.  Should an accidental release occur, this facility has worked with the local fire department and local emergency planning committee so they can plan for response to a release and minimize the impact of the release to employees, people in surrounding area and the environment.\n\n\n\n2.Facility Information\n\nThe primary activity at this facility is the storage, and handling of anhydrous ammonia & agricultural chemicals for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application to the soil as a crop production nutrient.\n\n\n\n3. Worst-Case Scenario/Alternative-Case Scenario\n\nWorst case and alternative case consequence analyses were completed for all covered processes.  The worst case scenario release assumed that all the contents in the largest single vessel were released.  Anhydrous ammonia release was modeled as if the ammonia tank was punctured on the side at the ground level and the resulting release being a ground level horizontal jet.\n\n\n\nAlternative (or more likely to occur) scenario assumes rupture of a transfer hose during a major loading or unloading operation.  Although this event is classified as an alternative scenario, even an accident of this type is unlikely to occur due to the safety equipment (excess flow devices, emergency shutoff valves, and check valves) and operating procedures that TMC uses to safeguard ammonia transfer operations.\n\n\n\n4.  Accidental Release Program\n\nThis facility complies with the various rules and regulations governing the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia including ANSI K61.1, OSH"

      "SummaryText": "A 29 CFR 1910.111 and regulations administered by our state agency.  Training is provided on safe anhydrous ammonia operations for employees.\n\n\n\n5.  Five-year Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia for the covered process at this facility in the past five years.\n\n\n\n6.  The Emergency Response Program\n\nThe facility has a written emergency plan in accordance with OSHA Standards 29 CFR 1910.38 and 29 CFR 1910.120.  Emergency planning and community right-to-know information is provided to the state emergency response commission, local emergency planning committee and local fire department as required by SARA Title III of EPCRA.\n\n\n\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at this facility.  Periodic inspections and evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe practices and operations.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
