It is Salinas River Cogeneration CompanyA?s policy to comply with all applicable governmental regulations.  Further, it is Salinas River Cogeneration CompanyA?s objective to be a responsible citizen of the community in all of its business activities.\n\nSalinas River Cogeneration Company emphasizes safe and environmentally sound operating practices and procedures through their employee training programs.  In addition to job specific training, operators and maintenance personnel receive training in fire prevention, fire control, accident prevention, safety, and first aid.  Additionally, an emergency action plan has been prepared for Salinas River Cogeneration Company and a chain of command to respond to emergencies has been established.\n\nSalinas River Cogeneration Company is independently audited to evaluate compliance with the Process Safety Management (PSM) standard and 40 CFR Part 68 (RMP regulations).  At least every three years, Salinas River Cogeneration Company audits these programs and any findings of noncompliance are documented and responded to and the deficiencies are corrected.\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances \n\nTexaco Yoakum Energy Company, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Texaco Producing Inc., formed a general partnership with the Anacapa Energy Company, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Edison Mission Energy Company, for the development of the cogeneration plant.  The partnership, named Salinas River Cogeneration Company, owns and operates the facility.  The plant began commercial operation in October, 1991.  \n\nThe Salinas River Cogeneration Company facility is located in Section 2, T32S/R10E, MDB&M in the sparsely populated San Ardo oil fields.\n\nCogenerati"

      "SummaryText": "on, in the case of the Salinas River project, is the simultaneous production of thermal energy and electrical energy from the combustion of a single fuel source.  Combustion of the fuel takes place in a gas turbine that is physically coupled to an electric generator.  Waste heat from the gas turbine's exhaust flows into a heat recovery steam generator (HRSG).  The HRSG extracts the heat from the exhaust gases and produces steam for thermally enhanced oil recovery.  Electricity is produced at the same time via the electric generator coupled to the combustion turbine.  \n\nAnhydrous ammonia is used at the Salinas River Cogeneration Company facility to create a reducing atmosphere in the selective catalytic reduction (SCR) process.  This reducing atmosphere in the flue gas helps convert nitrogen oxides to nitrogen and water as it passes through the catalytic reactor.  The operation of the SCR system substantially lowers the emissions of nitrogen oxides from the gas turbine.\n\nLiquid ammonia is stored in a 15,000 gallon (water capacity) storage tank.  The maximum intended inventory of the anhydrous ammonia storage tank is based on the American National Standard Institute's K61.1 safety requirements and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulations published in Section 1910.111 of 29 CFR (and Section 509 of Title 8, CCR).  These standards and regulations limit the maximum ammonia storage capacity of the tank to approximately 69,960 pounds.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nA PSM program, which meets the requirements of the general accidental release prevention program, has been developed at Salinas River Cogeneration Company to address the anhydrous ammonia system.  The PSM program includes the following chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\n- Written process safety information, including information pertaining to the hazards of ammonia, the technology of the process, and the equipment in the process"

The Executive Director has the overall responsibility for the development, implementation, and integration of the RMP elements.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nSalinas River Cogeneration Company has not had any accidental releases from the ammonia-based SCR system that have resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or kn"

However, an emergency response program does not need to be developed for the facility since Salinas River Cogeneration Company employees will not respond to accidental releases of ammonia, the facility is included in the community emergency response plan, and appropriate mechanisms are in place to notify emergency responders.\n\nPlanned Changes To Improve Safety\n\nThrough the accidental release prevention program, Salinas River Cogeneration Company regularly evaluates the need for any changes to improve safety.  Currently Salinas River Cogeneration Company does not have any additional changes planned to improve safety."
