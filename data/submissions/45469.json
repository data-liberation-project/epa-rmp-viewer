      "SummaryText": "GENERAL\n\nThe Lima Water Treatment Plant (WTP) is a municipally-owned and operated water purification facility in which Chlorine is used for disinfection.  The existing chlorination system utilizes gaseous chlorine and consists of eight one ton cylinder containers; four digitial scales; vacuum regulators on each cylinder; an automatic changeover valve; three 500 lb/day and two 1000 lb/day chlorinators; and a distribution manifold. The average chlorine usage is 560 lb/day.    \n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES  \n\nThe City of Lima WTP's approach to chemical safety focuses on training and safety awareness.  Plant operators are trained on operational and safety practices associated with chlorine and chlorine feed equipment. The training program utilizes presentations by current chlorinne suppliers as well as in house training. These programs are used to refresh operators' understanding and knowledge of the safe handling procedures and accident prevention procedures for chlorine.  The Lima WTP is a secure facility and only authorized plant personnel maintain and handle chlorine cantainers and feed equipment.           Because of the city's commitment to safety and implementation of safe procedures for the chlorine facilities, new policies, procedures and instructional programs have been developed in conjunction with the Risk Management Plan.  An updated Emergency  Response Plan has also been prepared. \n                                                                                                \nWORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nThe city of Lima receives chlorine in one ton cylinders.  The cylinders are currently stored inside, but do to the fact that a cylinder could have a release during the unloading process no passive mitigation was used. \n\nThe endpoint distance was determined by using EPA's RMP* Comp ? program.\n\nThe distance to the endpoint is 1.3 miles, assuming a full container release in 10 minutes.\n\nALTERNATE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nThe altern"

Apassive mitigation factor was used for the alternative release scenario.\n\nThe distance to the endpoint is0.1 mile with a release duration of 60 minutes.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICALSPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe Lima WTP complies with the OSHA Rules and Regulations with respect to the Accidental Release Prevetion Program.  Chemical specific prevention steps include compliance with all Ohio EPA requirements, Recommended Standards for Water Works, 1997 (Ten States Standards), Chlorine Institute Standards, Regulations Concerning Chlorination Equipment and Facilities for Public Water Supplies.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe Lima WTP has had no accidental releases of chlorine in the past five years. There have been no accidential chlorine releases in the known history of the plant which resulted in injury to off-site personnel or evacuations.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe key element of the Emergency Response Program is the written Emergency Response Plan on file at the WTP and at City offices located in City Hall.  The written Plan includes a Quick Reference Guide which allows an operator to immediately and positively act in the case of an observed or detected chlorine leak.  The Allen County Local Emergency Planning Committee is the overall coorinator of the emergency response services.  The City will remain its current approach to first contact the City of Lima Fire Department in case of emergency as part of the County's current program.  Additional notification procedures are also defined.\n\nThe Emergency Response Plan includes first aid procedures, medical management of chlorine exposure information, emergency response training and pre-emergency coordination guidelines.  A summary of emergency chlorine leak response procedures is also included.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES "
