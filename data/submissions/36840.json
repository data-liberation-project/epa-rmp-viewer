The Washington-East Washington Joint Authority's (WEWJA) accidental\nrelease prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates \ntechnologies, procedures, and management practices. All applicable \nprocedures of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Prevention \nProgram are adhered to.  The WEWJA emergency response policy involves the \npreparation of response plans which are tailored to each facility and to \nthe emergency response services available in the community, and is in \ncompliance with the EPA Emergency Response Program requirements.\n\nB.  The WEWJA Chlorination System has been installed to disinfect the \nflow in Chartiers Creek.  The chlorination station is located on Arden \nStation Road within the treatment plant.  The station includes a \nchlorination room, which contains liquid chlorine containers, a chlorinator, \nand various safety equipment.The building also includes an instrument room which contains a \nflow recorder, various electrical panels, and additional safety \nequipment.  The amount of chlorine handled is a one-ton container.  The chlorination station \nis normally unmanned.  Water Quality Techincian  and Maintenance personnel visit the \nfacility daily and respond to any trouble alarms which may occur. Recent automation (2004) has enhanced our response by adding additional sensors which set off alarms in our SCADA system to alert staff of problems.\n\n\nC.  The general WEWJA release prevention program is based on the \nfollowing key elements:\n\n* High level of training of the Water Quality Technicians\n\n* Preventive maintenance program\n\n* Use of state-of-the-art process and safety equipment\n\n* Use of accurate and effective operating procedures, written with the \nparticipation of the Water Quality Technicians\n\n* Performance of a hazard review of equipment and procedures\n\n* Implementation of an auditing and inspection program\n\nChemical-specific prevention steps include availability of \nself-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA), worn by"
