      "SummaryText": "Clariant LSM (America) Inc. is a multi-purpose batch chemical manufacturing facility located in Elgin, South Carolina. The facility is situated in the southern sector of approximately 200 acres of contiguous land. Surrounding property is rural/residential/farmland.  Clariant has a mature process safety management program in place, designed to minimize and control the potential risks presented by the processes at this site.  Management at the site and in the Clariant Corporation are committed to ensuring that the facility is operated in a safe manner, protecting the employees, environment and surrounding community.\n\nClariant utilizes 8 RMP regulated chemicals in quantities above the threshold; Allyl alcohol, bromine, chlorine, ethyl chloride, trichlorosilane, isoprene, and phosphorous trichloride. Allyl alcohol is stored on site in a maximum quantity of approximately 80,500 lbs, bromine is stored on site in a maximum quantity of approximately 141,000 lbs, chlorine is stored on site in a maximum quantity of approximately 50000 lbs, Ethyl chloride is stored on site in a maximum quantity of approximately 30,000 lbs, trichlorosilane is stored on site in a maximum quantity of approximately 30,000 lbs, Isoprene is stored on site in a maximum quantity of approximately 40,000 lbs, and phosphorous trichloride is stored on site in a maximum quantity of approximately 15,500 lbs.. For each of these chemicals measures have been taken to prevent and/or mitigate potential for accidental releases. Efforts for each chemical are detailed below.\n\nAllyl alcohol is used in several processes. A maximum on site quantity is approximately 80,500 lbs. For each of these processes the same bulk storage and transfer facilities are utilized. Allyl alcohol is stored in two diked 5000-gallon storage tanks. The storage tanks are equipped with level indicators, and vent to a regenerative thermal oxidizer. Overfill protection is provided by piping the tank vents to a knockout pot with level, temperatu"

These tanks are filled from tanker trucks which are staged on an adjacent concreted area surrounded by trenches. These trenches discharge to an in ground sump, equipped with a metal cover and vented to the regenerative thermal oxidizer through a detonation arrestor.\n\nIf a full tank truck or the unloading hose were to fail, the contents of the tank truck would spill on the unloading area. The spill would be contained by trenches that discharge into the in ground sump described above. The in ground sump has a volume of 54,000 gallons, and is pumped to a plant-wide wastewater collection system that feeds a biological treatment system owned by Clariant. The trenches are basically 18?? deep and 12?? wide. Sections of the trenches may be isolated in the event of a spill or leak.\n\nReactor systems for allyl alcohol service are all similar in design and use. Each reactor system consists of a stainless steel reactor, two stainless steel receivers, and associated stainless steel tanks and piping. Failure of a reactor or receiver will result in the released allyl alcohol being collected in the surrounding trenches.\n\nRecovered allyl alcohol is stored in several of the stainless steel storage tanks associated with the allyl alcohol process. These tanks contain from 480 lbs to 7432 lbs. This is considerably less then the 35,862 pounds in AA-1 and AA-2 storage tanks or the full tanker truck.\n\nBromine is also used in several processes at Clariant, and has a total storage capacity of approximately 141,000 lbs. All bromine storage tanks, receivers, and pumps are housed in two containment buildings. These vessels are also diked inside the containment buildings, and are equipped with deluge systems for the dikes in the event of a release. Both bromine buildings are vented to emergency scrubbers.

The scrubbers can be activated manually or automatically by bromine/chlorine located inside the containment buildings.\n\nBromine off-gasses from manufacturing processes are vented through acid absorbers and caustic scrubbers. Bromine is stored in three 5,000 gallon lead lined storage tanks designed with a pressure rating of 50 psig. Bromine is weighed on a batch basis for individual processes into three 500 gallon glass lined receivers. All bromine tanks and receivers are diked and housed in containment buildings.\n\nMeasures are in place to prevent accidental releases from the bromine tanks and receivers. All storage tanks and receivers are equipped with rupture discs and relief valves. A corrosion resistant rupture disc is installed just above the vessel shell. Above the rupture disc is a pressure relief valve. In the event that over-pressurization bursts the rupture disc, the relief valve would control the release by allowing the overpressure to relieve to the point of the relief valve only. This would minimize the amount of bromine released to the building. The rupture disc protects the relief valve from corrosion. A pressure indicator is installed between the rupture disc and relief valve for protection of rupture disc failure.\n\nBromine is received on site in tank trailers and off loaded into one of three storage tanks via pressure. The tank truck is parked inside the containment building while unloading. All connections are bolted flanges, and all transfer lines are teflon-lined steel construction. Material handler personnel are present during the entire unloading operation.\n\nChlorine is currently used in 3 processes at Clariant. It is received and used in 1 ton cylinders only. Cylinders are stored inside specially constructed containment buildings equipped with sensors for leak detection. Each chlorine building is equipped with an emergency scrubber capabl"

Piping outside the containment building is enclosed in corrosion resistant piping ductwork. The ductwork directs any piping leakage back to the containment building where sensors will detect the leak and activate the emergency scrubber(s). The ductwork is easily opened for inspection and repair.\n\nAs an administrative control, no more than one chlorine cylinder is open to the plant manifold at any one time. Chlorine addition is typically interlocked to batch reactor agitation and temperature alarms to prevent transfer when these parameters are out of spec.\n\nPhosphorus trichloride is used in 1 process at the Clariant facility. The maximum quantity of Phosphorus trichloride on site at any time is 15,500 pounds which is received and stored in drums inside of a containment building that is vented to a caustic scrubber in the event any material should be spilled. \n\nThe reactor system for phosphorus trichloride consists of 2 glass lined reactors that are both vented to a caustic scrubber. Failure of the reactors would result in the release of phosphorus trichloride and collection in the surrounding trenches.\n\nClariant has a well organized, highly trained emergency response group (fire brigade) which is the first line of defense in response to any release. Certified firefighters, hazmat responders and first responders are all a part of this group. Clariant also has coordinated agreements with the local LEPC, which consists of local and county fire departments, nearby industry response personnel, hospitals, law enforcement, and government personnel. Clariant is well prepared for response to any potential releases of materials detailed in this plan, and others.\n\nEthyl Chloride is currently used in only one process at this facility.

Isoprene is unloaded via dry-lock connections that ensure no isoprene is lost when connecting/disconnecting from the delivery iso-tanker. The storage iso-tanker is equipped with level indicators, load cells, and is vented through a detonation arrestor to the regenerative thermal oxidizer. Redundant temperature indicators are installed on the storage tanker that will audibly and visually alarm in the event a polymerization starts to occur in the tanker. The atmosphere of the tanker is inerted with nitrogen to prevent the formation of a flammable/reactive atmosphere as well as the release of isoprene to the environment.\n\nThe reactor system for isoprene consists of a glass lined receiver and a glass lined reactor. Failure of the reactor or receiver will result in the released isoprene being collected in the surrounding trenches.\n\nTrichlorosilane is used in 1 process at the site, with a maximum capacity of 30,000 lbs in 815 lb cylinders. \n\nVinyl chloride is used in 1 process at the Clariant LSM facility and is stored in 120 gallon cylinders at a maximum storage capacity of 10,000 lbs.
