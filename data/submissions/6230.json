During hot weather, the TDI temperature could reach the maximum ambient temperature of 100  0F.  The highest daily maximum ambient temperature of 107 0F was assumed in determining the toxic endpoint distance.  We also assumed that the entire contents of the railcar would be released as a liquid, form a pool that would spread to cover an area of approximately 80,000 ft2 with a depth of about 0.4 inches (1 cm), and evaporate to form a cloud that would disperse downwind.  Refined dispersion modeling predicts a toxic endpoint distance of 1530 ft. from the rail car. The toxic endpoint concentration for TDI is 0.98 ppm (0.007 mg/L).\n\nAlternate Release Scenarios.  Rupture of the transfer line from the railcar-unloading pump to the TDI storage tank would release TDI to the ground at the standard pump rate of 800 LB/min.  We assumed that the release would continue for 15 minutes. The resulting pool would spread to cover an area of approximately 4,620 ft2 with a depth of 0.4 inches with an evaporation rate of 0.059 lb/min. to form a cloud that would disperse downwind.

      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nAccidental release prevention and emergency response policies\n\nFoamex, L.P. in Santa Teresa, New Mexico, is a producer of flexible polyurethane foam. The process for producing polyurethane foam requires the use Toluene Diisocyanate (TDI). TDI is listed in the Clean Air Act 112 (r) list of regulated substances. Consequently, Foamex is subject to EPA's Risk Management Program Rule (RMPR). The same properties that give TDI commercial value are the characteristics that make it a hazardous material. Prior to RMPR, Foamex recognized the chemical and physical hazards involved with TDI and has observed safety precautions in its handling.  These precautions have been implemented to help limit exposure to the public, environment and our employees.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.\n\nWe are committed to the safety of our employees and the public, and to the preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  Effective implementation and monitoring of our accidental release prevention program helps us facilitate our Management System in the interest of reducing the possibility of accidental releases and proper mitigation in the event of an accidental release. \n\nDescription of the facility and the regulated substances handled\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is to produce flexible polyurethane foam, which is sold to other facilities, the automotive industry and the furniture bedding industry.  TDI is one of the reactants required to produce polyurethane foam.  TDI is received primarily by rail car and is stored in indoor storage tanks.  The maximum quantity of TDI stored in rail cars and in storage tanks at our plant is about 800,000 pounds.  The TDI is piped to a mix head where it is mixed with other reactants to produce a slab of polyurethane foam.  The foam is conveyed to cutting stations where it is cut to the size and shape specified by our custom"

      "SummaryText": "ers.\n\nTDI is the only substance handled at our plant that is regulated by EPA's RMPR.  TDI is a regulated substance because  it is listed on CAA 112 (r) and our process involves a quantity that exceeds the threshold quantity (TQ) of 10,000 pounds.\n\nOffsite consequence analysis of release scenarios\n\nAn offsite consequence analysis (OCA) was performed to estimate the potential for an accidental release to affect the public or the environment. The OCA consists of evaluating worst case release scenarios (WRSs) and alternative release scenarios (ARSs).  We do not expect a worst case release scenario to ever occur.  An ARS represents a release that might occur during the lifetime of a facility like ours.  ARSs help us to work with the local emergency planning committee (LEPC) to improve the community emergency response plan.\n\nThe main objective of performing the OCA is to determine the toxic endpoint distance (the distance from the release point to the point at which the concentration of TDI in air is equal to the toxic endpoint specified in the RMPR) at which certain effects might occur to the public because of an accidental release.  The following effects could occur at the endpoint distance:\n\nMost people at the endpoint distance of a TDI release would be able to walk away from the exposure without any long-term health consequences, although some short-term consequences (e.g., strong eye or throat irritation) are likely.  Some people who are particularly susceptible to the released substance could be incapacitated.\n\nWorst case release scenarios.  Catastrophic failure of a TDI rail car, having a capacity of 200,000 lbs. TDI, would be a worst case release for a toxic substance because a TDI rail car is the largest outdoor TDI container at the plant.  The TDI vendors limit the quantity of TDI loaded into a railcar to 192,000 lbs. maximum to allow space for thermal expansion during possible heating of the TDI.  TDI has a melting point of 55-56 0F.

Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties.  The emergency response program is updated when necessary, based on modifications made to plant processes or other facilities.  Personnel affected by changes in the program are informed and trained on those changes.\n\nThe overall emergency response program for the plant is coordinated with the LEPC.  This coordination includes participation in periodic meeting of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and other industry representatives.  The plant has around-the-clock communications capability with the appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations such as the fire department.  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.  The plant also conducts periodic emergency drills that involve the local Fire Department and emergency response organizations.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety\n\nWe strive to continuously improve the safety of our plant TDI process through periodic safety reviews and a program of soliciting safety suggestions from employees.  Our hazard review and incident investigation programs are especially designed to identify needed process safety improvements, some of which result in changes to the processes.  The following changes are currently planned for implementation:\n\n* Upgrade inspections and tests of selected equipment and instrumentation designed to prevent TDI releases\n* Revise operating procedures to resolve findings from the latest TDI process hazard review\n\nAlternate Emergency Contact: Tom Poquette, Chemist, Phone (505) 874-5517, 24 hour phone (915) 485-3371."
