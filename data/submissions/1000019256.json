Facility Information.\n\n        The primary activity at the facility is the distribution of products to farmers.  The fertilizer product, anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application as a nutrient for crop production.  Anhydrous ammonia is stored in tanks designed for this purpose.\n\n3.  The Worst-Case Release Scenario and the Alternate Release Scenario \n\nAn analysis of the potential off-site consequences of hypothetical worst-case and alternative-case accidental releases have been addressed in our Hazard Assessment and information is in our Risk Management Program.\n\n4.    Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n        The facility is in compliance with the provisions of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia\" and our state regulations covering anhydrous ammonia.  The OSHA standard is referenced in this RMP Registration Form; see Section 8.3 (b).\n\n5.      Five-Year Accident History.\n\n         There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, has there been any accidental releases resulting in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6.       Emergency Action Plan.\n\n          The facility has:\n\n   "

If a large release of anhydrous ammonia takes place at the facility, \n                   the required response action is to evacuate the area of the spill and \n                   call 911 and all applicable emergency response numbers listed in our\n                   Emergency Action Plan.\n\n7.       Planned Changes to Improve Safety.\n\n          Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the conditions at Golden Furrow Fertilizer, Inc.  There are no additional specific safety recommendations regarding storage or use of anhydrous ammonia for implementation at this time."
