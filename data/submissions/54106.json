      "SummaryText": "RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nLouis Dreyfus Commodities Grand Junction, LLC\n\nLouis Dreyfus Commodities Grand Junction, LLC (LCD-GJ) Ethanol Plant is a newly constructed facility.  LDC-GJ plans to begin operations at the ethanol plant in April 2009. Many of the reports and information have only recently been developed, and much of the training has been ongoing.  Given that LDC-GJ is a new facility, there have been periodic reviews and revisions to reports and information maintained at the facility to date.  \n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Response Policies:\n\nLDC-GJ has a commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated in the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel as well as considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility and its equipment.\n\nLDC-GJ\u00bfs policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, plant personnel will respond to contain the release as necessary. The two ethanol tanks, two final product tanks, and denaturant tank are all located in a large bermed Tank Farm containment area that is separated from the plant.  A release from one of these tanks would not migrate off-site and a fire could be quickly extinguished.  LDC-GJ has coordinated with the Grand Junction Fire Department for emergency response assistance.\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances:\n\nThe LDC-GJ Ethanol Plant is located near Grand Junction, Greene County, Iowa.\n\nThe facility operates 24 hours per day, 7 days per week for the purpose of manufacturing fuel grade ethanol from corn.  The regulated substance under the RMP program is Anhydrous Ammonia and Denaturant (natural gasoline), which is considered a flammable mixture.  The LDC-GJ Ethanol Plant has determined that the radius of impact from a worst-case release would be about 5.6 miles; due to the amount of ammonia stored"

      "SummaryText": "on site.  The maximu radius of impact for denaturant is about 0.7 miles.\n\nOff-site Consequence Analysis Results:\n\nThe worst-case scenario at the facility is the release of all 95,026 pounds of ammonia creating a toxic cloud.  This scenario is based on the release of all ammonia stored on site.  The worst-case vapor cloud endpoint is approximately 5.6 miles from the center of the plant.  Public receptors are located within this 5.6 mile radius.   For the flammable mixture the worst-case scenario at the facility is the release of 606,861 pounds of denaturant creating a vapor cloud explosion.  This scenario is based on a release from the entire denaturant tank.  The worst-case vapor cloud endpoint is approximately 0.7 miles from the center of the facility.  Public receptors are also located within the 0.7 mile radius.\n\nAlthough the LDC-GJ Ethanol Plant has numerous controls in place to prevent such a release and to manage potential consequences, no credit for administrative controls or passive mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating these scenarios.\n\nSince the facility qualifies as a Program 3 due to the close proximity of public receptors, A Program Safety Management program has to be completed for this facility.\n\nSince the facility qualifies as a Program 3, Alternative Release Scenarios (ARS) were required.  For the flammable mixture, the ARS is the release of 550,000 pounds of denaturant creating a vapor cloud explosion.  The ARS endpoint is approximately 0.6 miles from the center of the facility.  The ammonia ARS is the toxic release of 4,780 pounds per minute of ammonia.  The ARS endpoint is approximately 1.3 miles from the center of the facility.  There are public receptors within the these radiuses that would be affected by both alternative releases.\n\nFive Year Accident History:\n\nLDC-GJ has constructed a new ethanol facility and is subject to RMP upon delivery of substances onsite. There have been no accidents at this time.\n\nEmergency Response"

A intergrated Facility Response Plan and Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasure Plan will also be prepared and implemented in accordance with applicable regulatory standards and timeframes.\n\nLastly, the facility conducts employee training as part of facility activities.  LDC-GJ's corporate policy places the utmost importance on worker, public and environmental safety, which is reflected in the facility plans and training activities"
