The Fredericksburg Terminal Butane Blending System was constructed in accordance with the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA Code) #58 (2014 Edition) for Liquefied Petroleum Gas Storage, and it is the facility's policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state and local laws/codes.  If an emergency were to occur, it is the facility's policy to notify the Fredericksburg Fire Department as well as the Virginia Department of Emergency Management.  Medical emergencies will require notification of the local Emergency Medical Services. \n\n\n\nThe CPT Fredericksburg Terminal is a bulk petroleum storage and distribution facility that includes butane blending operations.  This Risk Management Plan (RMP) covers the butane blending system, including the associated piping and two (2) butane storage vessels. \n\n\n\nThe CPT Fredericksburg Terminal complies with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Accident Prevention Rules (40 CFR Part 68 Subpart D), the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29 CFR Part 1910.119) along with its fourteen (14) compliance elements, and all applicable state and local laws and regulations.  The butane blending system is designed, constructed, and maintained in accordance with NFPA #58 and the manufacturer.  This is a new system and as such has never had an accident involving the butane process which has resulted in deaths, injuries, property/environmental damage, evacuations or sheltering in place. \n\n\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving the CPT Fredericksburg Terminal butane blending system, it is the policy of the facility to initially contact the Fredericksburg Fire Department (Primary Responder) and request their assistance.
