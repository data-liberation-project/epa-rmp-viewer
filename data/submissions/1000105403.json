Each new employee is given a comprehensive orientation training program and a basic job specific training covering their job duties and responsibilities as they relate to both normal and abnormal operating conditions. Each employee must demonstrate the required skills to perform their job upon completion of training and must be certified and proficient in performing the duties of their assigned jobs.\n3.6 Contractor Safety:\nPCS developed a contractor program in accordance with 40 CFR 68.87 and 29 CFR 191.119. This program outlines the entrance requirements a contractor, sales person, visitor, consultant, vendor or service company must abide by in order to perform work at the facility. The Contractor program also details the PCS and contractor responsibilities for the training required for contractors working onsite and procedures for periodic evaluation of contractor safety performance.\n3.7 Pre-Start up Review:\nPCS conducts a pre-start up review prior to the introduction of any OSHA defined highly hazardous chemical and/or RMP regulated substance to ensure that new process facilities or modifications to original equipment, controls or safety interfaces of a covered process or covered system do not create a hazard to the facility personnel, civilian population surrounding the facility or the environment. The review is also intended to ensure that hazards identified in the PHA have been properly addressed by design or procedural changes.\n3.8 Mechanical Integrity: The mechanical integrity program establishes and implements the maintenance and inspection programs to ensure the mechanical integrity and reliability of fixed equipment, plant piping, rotating equipment, relief devices, instrumentation and ele"

The maintenance and inspection program includes, but may not be limited to, pressure vessels, non or low-pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping and piping components, pumps, pressure safety relief valves and vent systems and devices, emergency shutdown systems, controls (including monitoring devices and sensors, alarms, and interlocks). This program encompasses preventive and predictive maintenance of plant equipment, calibration and testing of instruments and electrical equipment, and routine inspections for plant equipment and piping.\n3.9 Hot Work Permits:\nThe Safety Work Permit System establishes the safest, most useable method of providing all personnel, with procedures to consistently apply when performing work at sites under the PCS\njurisdiction. The Safety Work Permit system is broken down into 8 types of permits. 1) Confined Space- Attendants Permit, 2) Confined Space Entry Permit, 3) General Safe Work Permit, 4) Line Breaking Permit, 5) Hot Work Permit, 6) Electrical Permit, 7) Excavation, 8) Vehicle Entry. The requirements of each of the permits can be found in the PCS Nitrogen Safety Manual section 11.0.\n3.10 Management of Change:\nThis process ensures that all modifications to equipment, procedures, raw materials and processing conditions other than \"replacement in kind\" are identified and are reviewed by qualified personnel prior to their implementation. Except in emergencies, such changes are approved in writing prior to their implementation. This review process ensures that additional risks are not introduced, all changes are documented, existing procedures are updated, new procedures are written as required, all process safety information is updated, and that all employees that are affected by the change are properly trained.\n3.11 Incident Investigation:\nThe objectives of the Incident Investigation management system are to: 1) Carefully analyze and document the root cause(s) of the more significant prob"

The Primary\nobjectives of EMPs are protection of life and elimination or reduction of harm to the public, employees, contractors, and the environment. Secondary objectives are continued production and delivery of products and services. Response and recovery actions must minimize damage done to facilities, equipment, and both delivery and communication systems. Training on, and maintenance of, the EMP includes, but is not limited to, the following: Training and preparation is performed for all applicable employees, Simulated drills are conducted on a regular basis,\nThe facility maintains an Emergency Response Team (ERT) consisting of certified emergency personnel. Critiques of drills and actual events are conducted. The emergency response team (ERT) participates in company sponsored events centered around improving ERT operations rodeo. The ERT is on site 24 hrs per day. The ERT trains a minimum of 8 hours each month. The ERT is trained in Hazardous Materials, Fire fighting, and Confined Space/High angle Rescue Participating in simulation drills with the community responders Maintaining an Off-Site Emergency Response Team for Transportation Emergencies If a release occurs, the following procedures, at a minimum, are implemented: Fire monitors provide a water spray to cool tanks and suppress vapors Fence line monitoring and computer modeling can be implemented using SAFER system Emergency Response Team can be"
