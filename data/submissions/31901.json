This Risk Management Plan (RMP) encompasses all the elements of the Risk Management Program.  Accidental release prevention, emergency response policies at the Chickasha WWTP emphasize safety, training, and maintenance.\n\nThe Chickasha WWTP is located in Chickasha, Oklahoma.  Chlorine is used to disinfect waste water and Sulfur Dioxide is used to remove Chlorine prior to discharge in the Washita River.  The Chickasha Facility treats an average of 2.5 million gallon per day and is designed to treat 6 MGD.  The facility will have the maximum of 8000 pounds of chlorine and 7200 pounds of Sulfur Dioxide on site at any one time.  The chlorine is stored in 1-ton cylinders, 2 in process and 2 in standby.  Sulfur Dioxide is stored in 1-ton cylinders and 150 pound cylinders.  Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide is drawn from the cylinders in a gaseous state.\n\nThe Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide cylinders and feed system are checked at least twice daily for leaks and feed rates.  The preventative maintenance program has numberous operator and maintenance checks to ensure full and proper operation.\n\nA worst-case scenario has been estimated, per EPA guidance, to provide the greatest distance in any direction to the established toxic endpoint.  The worst-case release quantitiy established by the regulations, is the greatest amount of chlorine held in a single cylinder.  Chickasha WWTP worst-case is 1-ton cylinder (2000 pounds).  In accordance with 40 CFR section 68.25, chlorine gas released at a rate of 200 pounds per minute with a ten (10) minute release.\n\nNo administrative controls or active mitigation measures were included for the worst-case release scenario.  Tables from the EP"

No release was recorded for the previous five years.\n\nSevern Trent has developed accidental release repsonse and prevention programs in the form of Risk Management Plans, Emergency Action Plans, training with local ememrgency responders, Operator training, Operator inspection of the Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide systems, and preventative maintenance programs.\n\nSevern Trent will conduct training with local ememrgency responders more frequently.  Operators will be trained and drills conducted as per the facility RMP."
