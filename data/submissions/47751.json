Description of Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Policies\nSYSCO Food Services of New Mexico, LLC recognizes management's responsibility in the protection of its employees, equipment, property, the community, and environment. The control of accidents has been and will continue to be a basic responsibility of all personnel in the company.\n\nTo accomplish Sysco Food Services of New Mexico,LLC  goal in controlling accidental losses, the facility has established a comprehensive Safety Program that not only includes government mandated safety programs, but also includes safety programs and activities that have been identified industry wide for the prevention of accidents. The objectives of Sysco Food Services of New Mexico Safety Program are to achieve maximum productivity, efficiency and safety performance.\n\nOne of the activities associated with Sysco Food Services of New Mexico Safety Program is the development and implementation of accidental release prevention and emergency response program. These programs are designed to comply with OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals, Title 29 Code of Federal Regulations 1910.119) and the EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) Regulation (Risk Management Programs for Accidental Release Prevention, Title 40 Code of Federal Regulations Part 68). Sysco Food Services of New Mexico Safety Manager is responsible for the management of the accidental release prevention and emergency response programs.\n\nThe purpose of the accidental release prevention and emergency response program is to prevent the release of ammonia and to minimize the consequences of ammonia releases. The accidental release prevention and emergency response program is also established for the prevention and response to fires, explosions, terrorist acts, and other types of incidents that may result in catastrophic accidents. As a whole these programs are designed to prevent accidental fatalities,"

Stationary Sources and Regulated Substances Handled\nThe facility operates a [NAICS#49312 (Refrigerated Warehousing and Storage Facility)] freezer warehouse at 601 Comanche Road N.E. Albuquerque New Mexico 87107.\n\nThe facility operates an (compound) ammonia refrigeration system, which provides cooling throughout the facility. Sysco Food Services of New Mexico's inventory in the refrigeration system is 19,200 pounds. Due to the volume of ammonia and with the remote possibility of a release of ammonia from the refrigeration system, which could pose a risk to offsite public receptors and have offsite impacts, our refrigeration system is subject to the Program Level 3 requirements of EPA's RMP.\n\nC. Summary of Worst-case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n1. Worst-Case\nThe worst-case release scenario at that facility involves the release of  4,400 pounds of ammonia over a 10-minute period. \n\nThe worst-case scenario is unlikely for the following reasoons:\n-Industry standards and quality controls were followed in the design and construction of the equipment in the ammonia refrigeration system.\n-Ammonia is not corrosive in this process.\n-Pressure safety relief valves limit the operating pressures in this receiver.\n-The facility utilizes a preventive maintenance program to maintain the on-going integrity of the vessel.\n-The facility has a training program that insures only qualified personnel operate the system.\n-The facility requires that all PSM elements as well as company maintenance policies to be followed.\n-The facility has coordinated its emergency response system with the local fire department, and trains with them at least once a year.\n\n2. Alternative Release Scenarios\nA. First Alternate Release Scenario\nThe release of 2000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia over a 10 minute period. \nThe alternate release scenarios are unlikely for the following reasons:\n-Sysco Food Services of New Mexico has policies to enforce only that"
