The Chemical Accident Prevention rule was issued and is administered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). This rule, \"Chemical Accident Prevention (CAP) Provisions\" (Part 68 of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR)), applies to a wide variety of facilities that handle, manufacture, store or use toxic and/or flammable substances.\n\nThe Global Erie Boulevard Terminal has the capacity to store up to 2.26 million pounds of LPG at their distribution facility located at 51 Erie Boulevard in Albany, New York. Global is required to address requirements of the CAP regulations because they exceed the 10,000 pound LPG threshold outside of internal fuel and/or retail sales.  The terminal is a wholesale distributor of LPG, and is not subject to the exemptions extended to propane facilities in accordance with the Chemical Safety Information, Site Security and Fuels Regulatory Relief Act of 2000.\n\nGlobal operates the Albany facility owned by the Canadian Pacific Railway, and provides wholesale LPG distribution to the local home heating, industrial, and commercial markets. The two regulated substances stored and distributed are propane and butane (both referred in this document as LPG). The LPG is brought into the Albany facility by railcar, offloaded into six (6) 105,000 gallon tanks in a subterranean mounded tank farm. A maximum of 85% of capacity is stored in these tanks that are connected by manifold fixed piping systems. \n\nGlobal is also subject to the Process Safety Management (PSM) standard under the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulation 29 CFR 1910.119. Global Erie Blvd. Terminal is a CAP Program 3 facility, and EPA CAP Program 3 requirements f"

Most of the documents that are part of the Risk Management Plan follow a standard format that includes the purpose, organization, responsibilities and authorities, as well as general step-by-step instructions.  \n\nMost procedures contain information on document control and filing.  Typically, documents are periodically revised through the procedures outlined in Section 9 - Management of Change.  \n\nEmployees are required to review relevant elements of the Risk Management Plan's policies and procedures.  The manual is available on-site for employee review.  Recommendations to improve this document's accuracy or effectiveness in assuring employee, visitor and contractor safety can be directed to the Terminal Manager.&#8195;\n\nThe goal of the Risk Management Plan is to prevent accidental releases of substances that can cause serious harm to the public and the environment from short-term exposures and to mitigate the severity of releases that do occur. The 1990 Amendments to the Clean Air Act (CAA) required EPA to issue a rule specifying the type of actions to be taken by facilities to prevent accidental releases of hazardous chemicals into the atmosphere and to reduce their potential impact on the public and the environment. \n\nThe phrase \"Risk Management Plan\" refers to this document as well as the registration information submitted to EPA.  In general, the EPA CAP regulations require covered facilities to develop and implement a Risk Management Plan and maintain documentation required by the plan on site.  The Risk Management Plan includes an analysis of the potential offsite consequences of an accidental release, a five-year accident history, a release prevention program and an emergency response program.\n\nCovered facilities also must su"

Covered facilities are also required to re-submit their Risk Management Plans every five years.  The RMP Submit provides an electronic summary of the facility's Risk Management Plan.\n\nCovered facilities also must continue to implement the management practices documented in this plan and update their plans periodically or when processes change, as required by the rule.\n\n\n\n1.1.1    Management System\n\nThe implementation and management responsibilities for the Plan must be clearly defined.  This section discusses various duties that must be addressed in order to fulfill the intent of the Plan.  This section also describes the employee responsibilities associated with each duty.  \n\n\n\n1.1.2    Hazard Assessment\n\nA component of the Risk Management Plan is the assessment of impacts associated with the accidental release of regulated substances.  This section evaluates both the worst-case release as well as alternative releases that are specific to the site.\n\nThe analysis focused on the impact to neighboring areas called receptors.  Receptors include residences, schools, parks, prisons, commercial buildings, etc.  Graphic as well as tabulated exhibits help to define the impact of accidental releases.\n\nBased on guidelines provided by EPA in the 2009 RMP Submit Instruction Manual, release scenario information is not provided in this Executive Summary.\n\n&#8195;\n\n1.1.3    Process Safety Information\n\nProcess Safety Information (PSI) is a repository for information related to the safety of a process.  Three major subjects addressed in this section are:\n\n\n\n?    The hazards of the chemicals and the process (physical properties, toxicity and exposure limits, fire and explosion characteristics, reactivity data, thermal and chemical stability, corrosivity data).\n\n?

This information is used as a reference during Process Hazards Analyses.\n\nDocumentation is found primarily in the Safety Data Sheets (SDS), the Risk Management Plan and the Process Safety Information files.\n\nThe LPG distribution system (the \"covered process\") was designed in accordance with recognized engineering standards at the time of construction and will be incorporated, as appropriate, for any subsequent renovations to the system in accordance with Management of Change procedures.  Documentation regarding recognized engineering standards can be found in the terminal design documents and process safety information files.  The facility follows documented procedures for inspection and maintenance at the terminal as documented in the Operations and Maintenance Manual.\n\n\n\n1.1.4    Process Hazard Analysis\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA) is a systematic approach toward evaluating the safety of a process.  PHAs must address the hazards of a process, previous incidents having potential for serious consequences, engineering and administrative controls, facility siting, human factors and an evaluation of the range of exposures if controls fail.  If there is more than one process, a schedule for completing PHAs must be formulated and based on the extent of process hazards, the number of potentially affected employees, the age of the process and the operating history of the process.  PHAs must follow a standard methodology, such as a What If/Checklist Analysis and be performed by a cross-functional team with at least one person who is familiar with the process, at least once "
