PPG also follows the Responsible Care? Codes of Management Practice, including the Responsible Care? Community Awareness Code of Management Practice.  PPG?s own EH&S Requirements Documents, such as Emergency Response Planning & Follow-up and Addressing Community Concerns, require each manufacturing plant to have a pro-active community awareness and emergency response program to handle emergencies that might happen in that facility.  All of these activities form an integral part of PPG?s overall Environment, Health and Safety Policy, whose goal is to ?market, distribute and manufacture products globally in a responsible manner that protects employees, neighbors, customers and the environment.?\n\n\nRegulated substances handled.\n\nPPG Delaware is part of the Automotive Refinish Business Unit of PPG Industries Ohio, Inc.   PPG Delaware produces refinish coatings for automobiles, resins which are used to give coatings their protective qualities, and waterbased Uniprime? coatings used for corrosion resistance on automobiles. The facility stores acrylonitrile.   \n\n\nGeneral accidental release prevention program and chemical specific prevention steps.\n\nTrained personnel and environmental, health and safety measures are included in all phases of the PPG Delaware operation.  Detailed engineering and design standards are used.  These standards may include national codes and standards, quality assurance inspections, over pressure protection systems, flammable and toxic gas detectors, emergency shutdown systems, and fire water system and computer controls for the processes.  Employees at the facility receive job-appropriate training.  Training incl"

Additional systems are in place to review proposed changes and assure that any new training requirements are met.  Another system assures a detailed review for hazards in each operating unit on a prescribed frequency.  Training occurs on a regular basis, and procedures are reviewed annually.\n\nThe PPG Delaware facility has an array of maintenance and inspection programs that minimize the possibility of equipment or piping failures.  Periodic equipment inspections are performed to assure the equipment integrity.  Equipment inspections utilize procedures such as proof testing where safeguard systems are forced to function in a controlled manner.  This assures that the safeguards will function if they are ever needed.  Preventive and predictive maintenance programs are utilized and can include vibration monitoring, infrared images to detect differences in temperature, inspections by independent experts, inspections by insurance specialists and a root-cause analysis program. Maintenance personnel and supervisors are included in many of the training and testing programs that the operators utilize.  Additional training and procedures have been developed for activities that are specific to maintenance.  \n\nFive-year accident history.\n\nThere have been no releases in the past 5 years that resulted in an on-site or off-site impact.\n\n\nEmergency response program.\nPPG?s emergency response program includes an emergency response plan.  The plan includes procedures for responding to an acrylonitrile release, evacuating employees, notifying the local police and fire department, as well as the hospital, if needed.\n\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety.\n\nPPG is committed to the process of continuous improvement.  This commitment extends beyond production issues into the environmental and safety aspects of all operations. Changes i"
