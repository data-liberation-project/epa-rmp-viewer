A well-organized safety program provides a safe working environment and promotes increased efficiency at all levels. (IIPP)\n\nFACILITY: Domestic wells and booster sites are unmanned, but are checked weekly.  These sites are designed to disenfect ground water which is then distributed to our customers.  All domestic chlorine gas systems operate off a vacuum.  If a break occurs in the system, the vacuum will cease to draw chlorine and the leak will stop.  The typical domestic site will have two-150 lb. cylinders in an alarmed enclosure.  This enclosure is located within a chain linked fenced area or masonry brick fence.  These sites are monitored 24 hours a day from a centralized location for process leaks and for unauthorized entries.  The 150 lb. cylinders are located in a locked wooden building with air gaps to the top and bottom.  Each cylinder is double chained to a solid metal post for earthquake portection.\n\nACCIDENT HISTORY: No leaks to report in the last 5-years at any of our facilities other than minor leaks at the vacuum regulators that posed no danger to the public.\n\nWORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO:This facility used EPA's \"Risk Management Program Guidance for Water Treatment Plants (40 CFR Part 68)\" for performing offsite consequence analysis (OCA) for the worst-case leak scenario.  The worst-case leak scenario is described in the compliance quide as the largest container losing all of its contents in 10 minutes; this equates to a 15-lb. per minute leak from a 150-lb. chlorine gas cylinder. Using the tables in the guide this equates to distance of 7,082 feet rual setting from a leak sourc"

It has been determined that a more probable but not likely leak would occur from a bad connection or damage to the vacuum regulator allowing a leak to occur.  Using the guike this would result in a leak similar to that of a leak coming from a 1/16 inch diamete hole from the valve.  This would result in a 17.1 lb leak over a 60 minute duration.  This type of leak could reach as far as 561 feet from the leaking cylinders.\n\nALARMS: Each chlorineated domestic site has an entry alarm and a chlorine leak detector that has two alarms.  At 1.0 ppm the detectors will activate an alarm in Control at the Coachella Facility and also at the on-site alarm control panel with a warning light.  At 3.0 ppm and audible alarm is activated at the site. \n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE: When Control at Coachlla receives an alarm the Control Operator will call out the Chlorine Response Team.  Two Water Quality Operators, trained in emergency repair procedures, are on call 24/7. One water Quality Operator will pick up the other and respond to the location in a service truck that is equipped with 2 SCBA's, Emergency Repair Kit A, Class A & B response suits and a containment vessel approved to transport a leaking cylinder. Each Water Quality Opeator has attended a 24-hour Hazwoper training course on spill response as well as yearly hands-on training on emergency repairs.\n\nRESPONSE TO MAJOR LEAKS: For a major chlorine leak, the Team will notify the Control Operator to dispatch police and fire personnel to the scene to secure and evacuate the surrounding area if necessary, while the Team applies the Emergency Kit or preferably places the leaking cylinder into the containment vessel.\n\nTRAINING: Chlorine response perasonnel are scheduled quarterly to be trained in use of Emergency Repair Kits, use of the Chlo"

The district purchased a 150-lb training cylinder to practice emergency repairs.\n\nFUTURE PLANS: The district has already converted over 60 sites from gaseous chlorine to on-site generation or tablet feeders for disenfection of drinking water and plan to eventually eliminate gaseous chlorine all together. The process of conversion could take 5 years or more.  We have prioritized the sites to be changed out first to those that are located next to hospitals, schools, daycares, convalescent home and etc."
