Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Polices\n\nAmy's Kitchen, Inc.'s manufacturing sites comply with applicable federal, state and local regulations.  As with all Amy's Kitchen manufacturing locations, this food processing facility has a formal worker safety program.  All employees are informed of hazards in the workplace.  Employees who work with potentially hazardous substances receive proper training in the handling of those substances.  This facility has procedures in place to safely remove employees from areas in the unlikely event that a hazardous substance release were to occur, and to put in place emergency notification and response procedures.\n\n\n\n2.   Facility and Regulated Substances\n\nThis Amy's Kitchen, Inc. food processing facility is located at 221 Phil Meador Avenue, Pocatello, Idaho.  Frozen prepared foods are produced at this location.  Food ingredients are received, blended, mixed, cooked, baked, assembled, frozen and packaged.  The regulated substance at this facility, anhydrous ammonia, is used in a closed-loop refrigeration system for product cooling and freezing.   Ammonia is the most effective, energy efficient and environmentally safe chemical for keeping food at its proper temperature.\n\n\n\n3.   Worst-Case and Alternate-Case Release Scenarios\n\nPlease reference onsite data (Volume 1: Risk Management Plan) at Amy's Kitchen, Inc., Pocatello.\n\n\n\n4.   General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Ammonia Specific Prevention\n\nAll Amy's Kitchen, Inc. manufacturing locations comply with the OSHA Process Safety Management for Highly Hazardous Chemicals (PSM) standard relative to anhydrous ammonia. Therefore, this facility has programs to ensure proper operation and maintenance of the ammonia refrigeration system.  Further, refrigeration system operators have been trained"

The system includes ammonia detection devices, an emergency shutdown switch located outside the main mechanical room, high- and low-level switches in pressure vessels, and safety relief valves to avert serious system overpressure.  Periodic maintenance on the refrigeration system is ensured via the use of a computerized maintenance management system.  Annual physical system audits are performed by an external refrigeration contractor to ensure system integrity.\n\n\n\n5.   Five Year Accident History\n\nDuring the past five years this facility has had no significant accidental releases of ammonia.\n\n\n\n6.   Emergency Response Program\n\nThis food processing facility has procedures in place to respond to the release of a hazardous substance.  Employees are trained to evacuate their respective areas in accordance with OSHA 1910.38(a).  Specific employees are designated and further trained to respond to a release in accordance with OSHA 1910.120(q).  Coordination with the local fire department is initiated during an emergency situation. The local LEPC is Bannock County LEPC.\n\n\n\n7.  Planned Improvements \n\nThe facility is in the process of insulating the covered process piping and in the process is also improving the labeling on the piping being insulated.  \n\n"
