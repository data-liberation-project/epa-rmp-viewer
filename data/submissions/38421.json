Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\n\n\n\nWe at Springdale Water Utilities are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled:\n\n\n\nOur facility's primary activity is wastewater treatment for the City of Springdale, AR and outlying areas.  We have 2 regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances are Chlorine and Sulfur dioxide (anhydrous).  Chlorine is used for disinfecting wastewater.  This insures that the wastewater is safe to discharge into Spring Creek, a tributary of the Illinois River.  Sulfur dioxide (anhydrous) is used for dechlorinating wastewater.  This binds up the remaining chlorine, making the facility's discharge safe for fish and other living organisms in the creek.\n\n\n\nThe maximum inventory of Chlorine at our facility is 12,000 lb. And Sulfur dioxide (anhydrous) is also present at our facility in a maximum quantity of 12,000 lb..  No more than six (one ton) cylinders of each chemical is present on the site at any given time.\n\n\n\n3. The Worst Case Release Scenarios and the Alternative Release Scenarios, including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario:\n\n\n\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis (OCA) for our facility, we have used the EPA's RMP*Comp (tm) software.  The OCAs for the worst-case and alternative release scenarios are not included in this executive summary, because of security concerns.  The scenarios have not changed sin"

The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:\n\n\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1967 Edition.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nSpringdale Water Utilities maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is through regular in-house reviews, along with updates as provided from numerous sources including the Chlorine Institute, the US Environmental Protection Agency, the American Waterworks Association, the Water Environment Federation, and the Arkansas Department of Labor.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of no less than once every three years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  The most recent PHA/update was performed in June, 2004, just prior to the five-year update of Springdale Water Utilities' RMP submission.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nFor the purpose of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Springdale Water Utilities maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, and normal shutdown.  The information is regularly reviewed and "

Refresher training is provided at least annually and more frequently as needed.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nSpringdale Water Utilities carries out frequent, routine maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change\n\nWritten procedures are in place at Springdale Water Utilities to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  The most recent review of maintenance procedures was performed in June, 2004, just prior to the five-year update of Springdale Water Utilities' RMP submission.  No revisions were required at that time.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and provided training to deal with the modification.\n\n\n\nPre-startup Reviews\n\nPre-startup safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at Springdale Water Utilities.  The most recent review of current processes was performed in June, 2004.  No revisions were required at that time.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for"

The most recent compliance audit was conducted in June, 2004.  These audits will be carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits will be undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nSpringdale Water Utilities will promptly investigate any incident that results in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations, should a release occur, would be undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports will be retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nSpringdale Water Utilities truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses in particular.\n\n\n\nContractors\n\nOn occasion, our company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out.  Springdale Water Utilities has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related to the contractor's work and the processes.  Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\n\n\n\n5.

More specifically, there has not been a single accidental release with offsite consequences since 1978, when the first regulated substance, Chlorine, was first brought on site.\n\n\n\n6. Emergency Response Plan:\n\n\n\nSpringdale Water Utilities has a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident inspection of affected areas for corrosion.\n\n\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.\n\n\n\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\n\n\nSeveral developments and findings resulted from the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program.  Continuing to review and upgrade employee training programs as needed, and working with the local Haz-Mat team and the Washington and Benton County LEPCs on emergency planning for our facility are some of the major steps taken to improve safety at our facility.  These changes were implemented in August, 1999, and are ongoing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
