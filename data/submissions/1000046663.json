Describe Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Policies\n\n\n\nFairmont Foods has established a workplace safety program to assist in providing a safe and healthful work environment for employees, customers, and visitors.  This program is a top priority for Fairmont Foods.  Its success depends on the alertness and personal commitment of all.\n\n\n\nFairmont Foods provides information to employees about workplace safety and health issues through regular internal communication channels such as employee meetings, bulletin board postings, memos, or other written communications.  A safety advisory group has been established to assist in these activities and to facilitate effective communication between employees and management about workplace safety and health issues.\n\n\n\nEach employee is expected to obey the safety rules and to exercise caution in all work activities.  Employees must immediately report any unsafe condition to the appropriate supervisor.  Employees who violate safety standards, who cause dangerous or hazardous situations, or who fail to report or, where appropriate, remedy such situations, may be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Policies are designed to comply with OSHAs Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals, 29 CFR 1910.119) and EPAs Risk Management Program (RM program) regulation (Risk Management Programs for Chemical Accidental Release Prevention, 40 CFR Part 68). \n\n\n\nThe purpose of the accidental release prevention and emergency action program is to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents.  Overall, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.\n\n\n\nB. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances "

      "SummaryText": "Handled\n\n\n\nThis facility operates an ammonia refrigeration system to provide cooling and freezing capabilities for food products.  The amount of anhydrous ammonia (CAS #7662-41-7) contained in this system is in excess of 10,000 pounds. Since ammonia releases from the system could pose a risk of offsite public impact and is regulated under the OSHA PSM standard (29 CFR 1910.119), the system is subject to the Program 3 requirements of the EPAs RM program.\n\n\n\nThe closed loop ammonia refrigeration system at the facility provides (3) major suction pressures (temperatures) for use in the preservation and process freezing of perishable food products.  Through the use of two-stage compression the refrigeration system provides refrigerant temperatures of -1F. To 50F and  -28F to -45F.The higher pressure portions of the system include the condenser, located on the roof, along with refrigerant vent lines where any leaks can dissipate to the air, joining ammonia produced by lightning where it can be consumed as it goes through a natural biodegrading process.  Normal safeties include: high pressure cut-outs, relief valves, and ventilating systems for machine room areas.\n\n\n\nC.  Description of the Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nFairmont Foods has developed one written program that covers both ammonia processes.  The prevention program (OSHA Process Safety Management CFR 1910.119) consists of the following elements:\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nTraining\n\nContractors\n\nPre-startup Safety Review\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nHot Work Permit\n\nManagement of Change\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nCompliance Audits\n\n\n\nD. Five-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThere have been no reportable incidents in the past five years.\n\n\n\nE. Description of the Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\nThis facility will call in local emergency personnel in the event of a significant ammonia release.  The facility is included in the community Emergency Respo"
