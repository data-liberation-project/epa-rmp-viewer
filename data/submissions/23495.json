      "SummaryText": "Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe City of Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP) accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices.  All applicable procedures of the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Prevention Program are adhered to.  The LADWP emergency response policy involves the preparation of response plans that are tailored to each facility and to the emergency response services available in the community, and is in compliance with the State and Federal Emergency Response Program requirements.                               \n\nGeneral Description of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\nScattergood Generating Station (SGS) is located at 12700 Vista Del Mar in Playa Del Rey, California 90293.  The facility is bounded to the west by the Pacific Ocean; to the east by a residential neighborhood of single-family dwellings, which are approximately 1,400 feet east of the aqueous ammonia storage area; to the south by Grand Avenue, beyond which is the Chevron El Segundo Refinery; and to the north by the Hyperion Wastewater Treatment Plant.  The SGS is a generating facility designed to generate and supply electric power to the LADWP's system.  SGS consists of two 179-MW units and a 460-MW unit that have the capacity to operate 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.  The 56-acre SGS was constructed in approximately 1960.  SGS has a gate that is provided with a surveillance camera and is manned with a security guard 24 hours per day.\n\nAqueous Ammonia Process Description:\n\nLADWP is installing selective catalytic reduction (SCR) systems to reduce nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions on the three existing utility boilers at the SGS.  The  project  includes the installation of three 33,000-gallon steel aboveground storage tanks.  Each tank is constructed within a secondary containment a"

The containment area is designed to hold the contents of each tank as well as account for a 25-year flood scenario.  The aqueous ammonia will be delivered to the site via a 5,000-gallon tanker.  The boilers are equipped with  identical SCR units to control NOx emissions, a combustion by product that is a precursor to ozone formation.    Ammonia is diluted with air and injected into the gas stream through nozzles.  The amount of ammonia introduced into the system varies based on NOx reduction requirements.  The use of aqueous ammonia requires the vaporization of the ammonia solution.  Vaporization of the ammonia and water is done prior to injection of the ammonia into the flue gas stream and an injection grid ensures proper distribution of the ammonia in the flue gas flow.  The mixture of ammonia and flue gas then passes into the catalytic reactor.  In the presence of a catalyst housed in the SCR, ammonia (NH3) gas, a reducing agent reacts with NOx to form nitrogen gas (N2) and water vapor (H2O).  \n\nAqueous Ammonia Handling and Storage\n\nThe aqueous ammonia handling and storage systems supplies ammonia solution to the NOx emission control catalyst in the SCR.  Ammonia solution is used instead of anhydrous ammonia because the latter has some serious inherent safety hazards requiring significant precautions and safety equipment in handling and storing.  The risks and safety related costs of anhydrous ammonia are found to outweigh the higher costs for transportation and storage of ammonia solution.\n\nAmmonia solution at 29% concentration (29% ammonia and 71% water) is stored in three 33,000 gallon aboveground tanks.  The maximum inventory is 28,000 gallons per tank (85% fill capacity).  The tanks are 40 feet long and 12 feet in diameter.  One storage tank is located within a secondary containment area that is 26 feet wide by 65 feet lon"

Two 5-gallon-per-minute (gpm) pumps, each fully redundant, dispense ammonia solution to the emission control equipment.  Other safety equipment associated with these tanks are: pressure/vacuum relief valves, temperature and pressure gauges, pressure and liquid level alarms, two ammonia vapor scrubbers, quick fill connections, vapor recovery and associated piping, ten strategically-located ammonia vapor detectors, and four emergency eyewash/shower stations.  Ammonia solution is delivered by truck into the storage tanks through a quick fill connection, located behind the secondary containment walls.  The truck parks within a sloped area, that drains to a bermed containment area. The solution unloading to the storage tanks is done through a quick fill connection.  A truck-mounted vapor recovery system is connected to the tank vapor recovery system during the unloading.  The storage tanks are equipped with pressure and vacuum relief valves and the tanks are maintained at ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure.\n\nThe tanks are located under a roof structure that provides protection from direct exposure to the sun and the rain.  The loading operator is provided with a readily accessible water supply to wash spills quickly.  All spills will be collected and disposed according to local, state and federal waste disposal requirements.  Flashing lights and audible alarms at the tanks and in the main control room are activated when the ammonia gas monitors detect the gas concentration above 20 parts per million in the surrounding area.\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results\n\nThe OCA is conducted in accordance with the latest RMP OCA guidance document that has been developed by the USEPA in conjunction with the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).

However, the maximum intended inventory is 28,000 gallons per tank (85% fill capacity). The entire volume of the solution is contained within the secondary containment system and has a maximum surface area for evaporation of 1690 square feet (largest secondary containment area).  The regulatory default meteorological parameters, including wind stability F, wind speed 1.5 m/s, ambient air temperature of 77F and a release temperature of 110F (maximum daily temperature at the nearest monitoring station), 50% average humidity and urban surroundings, were used.  The toxic endpoint distance for the worst-case release listed in the OCA guidance document (Reference Table 10) is 0.2 miles from the ammonia storage area.  The potentially public and environmental receptors affected within this distance includes 0.003 square miles of residential housing located about 1,055 feet northeast, and a state park (public beach) located about 800 feet west of the ammonia storage area.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario\n\nThe alternative release scenario involves the spill of the ammonia solution as a result of the rupture of a two-inch diameter, 100 feet long flexible transfer hose during the bulk transferring of the solution from a tanker truck to the storage tanks.  The transfer pump is manually shut off within 15 seconds after the hose rupture.  The volume of spilled solution is estimated to be 41 gallons, which spills onto the paved ground that slopes into a  bermed area.  The regulatory default meteorological conditions used were: wind stability D, wind speed 3.0 m/s, ambient air temperature of 77F and a "
