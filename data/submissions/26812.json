Corporate Prevention and Emergency Response Approach\n\nThe JEA Northside Generating Station (NGS) is located at 4377 Heckscher Drive, Jacksonville, Duval County, Florida.   The NGS facility is one of three electrical generating stations located throughout the city that is part of the JEA Power Business Unit.  JEA is committed to operating this facility and other JEA systems and facilities in a manner that is protective of the health and safety of JEA and Contractor employees, the public and the environment.  In addition, JEA is committed to operating this and other JEA facilities in full compliance with all applicable Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulatory requirements. \n\nTo ensure that the RMP-covered System is operated in a safe manner and in compliance with applicable EPA regulations relevant to accidental release prevention, JEA has developed this RMP plan.  Among the important components of this RMP plan are JEA's system of policies and procedures for operation and maintenance of the facility, and JEA's Emergency Response Plan (ERP) for the Facility. \n\n2. Description of Stationary Source\n\nThe JEA NGS facility operates two systems that contain aqueous ammonia (concentration greater than 20%)- the West Tank System and the East Tank System.  The West Tank System is the only RMP-covered process at NGS containing over the 20,000- pound threshold amount of aqueous ammonia.    Aqueous ammonia is stored in a single tank containing 40,000-gallon or 296,000 pounds of the solution of which 30% is aqueous ammonia.  The aboveground aqueous ammonia storage tank is completely surrounded by a concrete containment dike.  \n\nThe electric generating Units 1 and 2 at NGS's Repowering Project are equipped with an aqueous ammonia injection system designed to reduce nitrogen oxide (NOx) emission to acceptable limits.  This system is referred to as the West Tank System.  T"

      "SummaryText": "he ammonia is injected into the process at the hot cyclone inlets of each boiler to reduce NOx emission.  \n\n3. Description of the Worst Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nThe Worst Case release scenario is the total loss of the whole storage tank considering the passive mitigation of the concrete containment or dike, releasing ammonia gas evaporating from a pool at a vapor release rate of 30.2 lbs/min over a ten- minute period.  Under worst case weather conditions, the ammonia gas could travel 0.10 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public or environment (reaching a concentration less than .14 mg/L) using the OCA Guidance Look-up Table Method.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for the West Tank Ammonia System Process is characterized by a pipe break that also occurs in the dike due to worker/human error, external impact, or corrosion.  For this scenario, the release rate was determined to be 37.8 lbs/min.  Under normally expected weather conditions with passive and active mitigation in the form of response time by employees, the ammonia gas could travel 0.10 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public or environment (reaching a concentration less than .14 mg/L) using the OCA Guidance Look-up Table Method.\n\n4. Prevention Program\n\nThe Prevention Program 2 contains the following elements: a Process Hazard Review of the process, the collection and documentation of Process Safety Information, a Preventative Maintenance Program, written Operating Procedures, a Compliance Audits program, Safety Training for operations and maintenance personnel, and an Incident Investigation procedure. This Prevention Program will ensure continued safe operation and prompt correction of deficiencies.  The Prevention Program receives full support of plant management and involvement of employees at all levels. \n\n5. Accident History\n\nThe NGS facility has had one accidental release of ammonia in the past five years, however this was"

      "SummaryText": " from the East Tank Ammonia System that is not covered by RMP.  Since this release involved ammonia and four employees onsite were injured, JEA included details about this release in the facility's accident history.\n\n6. Emergency Response Program\n\nThe NGS has an Emergency Action Plan in place.  The program complies with 29 CFR 1910.38.  The current plan has been coordinated with the City of Jacksonville Fire and rescue Department (JFRD) and the Hazardous Materials Response Team, and the Regional Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  Notification is made locally by radio or dialing 911, and by notifying Florida State Warning Point at (800) 320-0519 or (904) 413-9911.  JEA recently revised the facility's plan on 6/02/02.  The JFRD is presently responsible for determining when evacuation of off-site areas is necessary and for public notification.\n\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThis plan incorporated a number of modifications to NGS procedures designed to improve employee safety awareness, enhance safe operation and maintenance of the aqueous ammonia system, reduce the potential for accidental release to occur, and increase the speed and effectiveness of the NCS response should a release to occur."
