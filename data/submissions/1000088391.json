      "SummaryText": "Hargesheimer Water Treatment Plant\n\nRisk Management Plan\n\nExecutive Summary\n\n\n\nThe City of Abilene (City) operates the Hargesheimer Water Treatment Plant (Hargesheimer or WTP) which is located 1594 Highway 83/84 in Taylor County, Texas. Hargesheimer provides potable water to the City of Abilene (City), as well as to wholesale customers supplied through neighboring communities and water supply corporations. Chlorine gas is used in the disinfection process at Hargesheimer. Up to 16,000 pounds of chlorine may be stored at Hargesheimer. Because the stored quantity of chlorine onsite exceeds the threshold quantity for chlorine (?68.130; Table 1), the City developed this Risk Management Plan (RMP). Hargesheimer is subject to Program 2 RMP requirements (?68.12(c)). A Management System overseen by the City's Director of Water Utilities (Director) is implemented to ensure that the RMP and associated Prevention Program are implemented correctly and maintained up-to-date. The City's accidental release prevention and emergency response policies include commitments to safety and to implementation of safe procedures to ensure accidental releases of chlorine gas are prevented.\n\n\n\nThe accidental release prevention program (Prevention Program) includes required elements of 40 CFR Part 68 such as safety information, hazard review, operating procedures, training, maintenance, compliance audits, and incident investigation. Detailed documentation of each element of the Prevention Program is contained within the text of the RMP. Operator training is key to the effectiveness of the Prevention Program. The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) licensing program for water operators is used as a training tool, along with site-specific RMP training. TCEQ licensing testing and on-site observation and demonstration are used to evaluate comprehension of all training materials. Written operating procedures are used in conjunction with on-the-job training to ensure that certified Water "

      "SummaryText": "Treatment Plant (WTP) operators are proficient in performing their duties before being allowed to work with chlorine storage and feed systems. Certified WTP operators conduct daily inspections and any problems with the chlorine systems are corrected and documented. In addition, the certified WTP operators ensure that the equipment used in the disinfection process is maintained according to the manufacturers' recommendations (?68.56(a)). Because of these efforts, the WTP has not had a chlorine release that resulted in an injury, either on-site or off-site, within the previous five (5) years (?68.42(a)). As part of the Prevention Program, the City will periodically perform compliance audits, hazard reviews, and incident investigations, according to a predetermined schedule described in the RMP and as needs dictate. These compliance audits and hazard reviews document any planned changes to improve safety (?68.50 & ?68.58).\n\n\n\nHargesheimer complies with the emergency response regulations per Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) 29 CFR ?1910.38, as well as with applicable standards set forth by the Chlorine Institute and the Texas Administrative Code. Hargesheimer is a non-responding facility for emergency response. Hargesheimer is located outside the city limits in Taylor County.  The City's Office of Emergency Management in conjunction with the Taylor County Emergency Management maintains a community-wide emergency response plan (ERP) which includes Hargesheimer.  WTP operators are trained to dial 9-1-1 in the event of a release from Hargesheimer.  The first responder via 9-1-1 dispatch is the Buffalo Gap Volunteer Fire Department (BGVFD); however, the City's Fire Department is the Haz Mat responder for the surrounding 19 county area and coordinates with the BGVFD on emergency response accordingly.  BGVFD primarily handles the evacuation of surrounding residents when required (?68.90(b)). Coordination activities are conducted in accordance with ?68.93 w"
