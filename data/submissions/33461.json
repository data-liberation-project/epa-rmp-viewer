Describe Accidental Release and Emergency Response Policies.\n\nSchepps Dairy's management recognizes it's responsibility in protecting the environment, employees, equipment, property, and the community.  The health and safety of all personnel and the protection of the environment are very important.  The control of accidents is and will continue to be a basic responsibility of all personnel in the facility.\n\nThe company has a Plant Safety Program whose objective is to achieve maximum efficiency and safety performance.\n\nSchepps Dairy has developed and implemented a Process Safety Management and Risk Management Program in compliance with OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals, 29 CFR 1910.119) and EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation (Risk Management Programs for Chemicals Accidental Release Prevention, 40 CFR Part 68).  Emergency action plans have been reviewed as well as part of a comprehensive management commitment to safety and preventing an accidental release of ammonia.  The Plant manager is responsible for the management of these accidental release, prevention and emergency action programs.   \n\nB.  Describe your Facility and the Requlated Substance Handled.\n\nSchepps Dairy operates a production facility where fluid milk, and juice products are processed, packaged, and distributed.  The facility is located at the corner of Dolphin Rd. and Haskell Ave. The address of this facility is 3114 S. Haskell Ave. Dallas Texas.  This facility uses anhydrous ammonia (CAS # 7664-41-7) as the refrigerant in it's stationary refrigeration system.  The maximum intended quanitity of anhydrous ammonia at this facility is 85,000 pounds.\n\nThis stationary refrigeration system is a closed loop system where liquid ammonia is piped to equipment and controled to provide the desired refrigeration affect.  The liquid is converted to gaseous ammonia during this process.  The gaseous ammonia is piped to the compres"

There is no consumption or loss of ammonia during this process making it a closed loop system. \n\nC.  Summary of Worst Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nThe worst case release scenario at the facility would involve the failure of the high pressure reciever, resulting in a release of 52,000 pounds of ammonia over a ten minute peroid. This quantity includes all the ammonia in the receiver, cooling towers and thermosyphon systems and associated lines. The maximum level in the receiver is limited to 80% and would only occur during a system pumpdown.  The worst case scenario could affect an area up to 1.2 miles around the facility before being dispersed enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public.\n\nThe alternative release scenario at the facility would involve the faliure of a pipe supplying ammonia to the cooling jacket on a product storage tank, resulting in the release of 900 pounds of ammonia over the period of 60 minutes.  This release scenario would include the ammonia in the cooling jacket and associated vessel, valves, and lines.  The release scenario could affect an area up to 0.1 mile around the facility before being dispersed enough to pose no hazard to the public. \n\nBoth release scenarios although possible are unlikly due to the design and maintenance of the facility and the positive affects of the PSM/RMP programs on the overall condition of the refrigeration system, training, and operating procedures.\n \nD.  Description of the accidental release prevention program.\n\n1.  Employee Participation:  All refrigeration maintenance employees, Maintenance Management, and Plant safety manager participated in the Process Safety Management Team (PSM).  The PSM team developed the Standard Operating Procedures (SOP's), training requirements, and Process Hazard Analysis (PHA), and other elements of the PSM program. \n"

Process Safety Imformation:  Piping and Instrumentation Diagrams (P&ID) have been developed where all major components of the ammonia refrigeration system and all piping have been assigned a number.  Information has been gathered to enable employees to identify and understand the potential hazards of the system.  The written information includes the Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) for anhydrous ammonia.\n\n3.  Process Hazard Analysis:  A formal sudy of the ammonia refrigeration system with management, safety, and maintenance personnel was conducted using the What-If Check List method to evaluate the potential hazards of the system. \n\n4.  Operating Procedures:  Written standard operating procedures have been developed for the ammonia refrigeration system that describe the steps to be taken to ensure safe operation of the system.\n\n5.  Training:  All ammonia refrigeration maintenance employees are requied to complete an in house training program using on the job training and demonstration of knowledge to ensure they are trained on all aspects of the system and the duties which they are required to perform to ensure safe operation of the system. \n\n6.  Contractors:  Contractors are screened and evaluated prior to the award of any contract for work on or near the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\n7.  Pre-Startup Review:  Pre Startup Checklist / Review includes P&ID updates, training requirements, review of operating procedures, PHA review, amd verification that construction has been accomplished according to design specifications. \n\n8.  Mechanical Integrity:  Daily log sheets, Preventative maintence work orders, Vibration analysis, Oil analysis, and Annual inspections are all part of the mechanical integrity program. \n\n9.  Hot Work Permits:  All HOT work on or near the system requires a signed Hot Work Permit prior to work.\n\n10.

Emergency Planning and response:  Schepps Dairy is utilizing The City of Dallas Fire Department as the first responders and has contracted with a third party contractor for emergency response.  In addition Schepps Dairy has developed an Emergency action Plan for all conceivable emergencies.\n\n13.  Compliance Audits:  Audits are conducted every three years to ascertain whether or not the program is in place and working properly.\n\nE.  Five-Year Accident History\n\nNo ammonia related incidents were identified for this facility in the past five years.\n\nF.  Emergency Response Plan\n\nSchepps Dairy is using The City of Dallas Fire Department as the Hazmat first responder to an incindent, and has contracted a third party contractor to provide emergency response in the event of an uncontrolled release.  Schepps Dairy has an Emergency Action plan in place, which describes how the facility will respond to an ammonia release and other emergencies.  The plan includes First Aid procedures, Emergency Medical Treatment procedures, Evacuation plans, Notification / Communication and Re-entry procedures, and Training and Drill programs.\n\nG.  Description of plans to improve safety\n\nSchepps Dairy is installing an Ammonia leak detector system for the facility.  The system will sense and display an ammonia leak from 0 to 800 PPM (parts per million). This system will report the results to a central panel in the maintenance shop, display the remote PPM, and sound alarms as the PPM rises.  These ammonia detectors and central panel will be tied into exhaust fans, alarms, and shut down systems as the facility is modernized."
