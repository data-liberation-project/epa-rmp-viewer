Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nThe Tip Top Poultry, Rockmart Facility, recognizes management's responsibility in protecting its employees, the public, the environment, equipment, and property.  The safety and health of all personnel are of primary importance.  The control of accidents has been and will continue to be a basic responsibility of all personnel in the Rockmart facility.\n\n\n\nTo accomplish the company's goal in preventing accidents, the facility has established a Plant Safety Program.  The objectives of the Plant Safety Program are to: maximize safety performance, eliminate human suffering resulting from injuries and accidents and reduce losses associated with damage of property.\n\n\n\nOne of the activities associated with the Plant Safety Program has been the development and implementation of accidental release prevention and emergency response programs which are designed to comply with OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals, 29 CFR 1910.119), and EPA's Risk Management Program (RM program) regulation (Risk Management Programs for Chemical Accidental Release Prevention, 40 CFR Part 68).  The Facility Manager is responsible for implementation of the Risk Management Program.\n\n\n\nThe purpose of the accidental release prevention and emergency response programs is to prevent the occurrence and minimize the consequences of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents.  Overall, these programs help prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses, environmental impacts and physical property damage.\n\n\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs help prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices which govern individual processes, activities, and/or equipment.  These rules are detailed and improved as necessary.  They are also communicated to an"

Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nThe Tip Top Poultry, Rockmart, GA facility is a chicken processing facility which receives processed chickens and prepares them for distribution via cutting and cooking, packaging, and then freezing them.  The facility operates two separate ammonia refrigeration systems to provide cooling and freezing capabilities for processing and storage areas.  The amount of anhydrous ammonia (CAS #7662-41-7) contained in the combined systems is in excess of 10,000 pounds.  The inventory in the Engine Room 1 system is approximately 14,700 pounds. The inventory in the Engine Room 2 system is approximately 9,300 pounds giving a combined total of 24,000 lbs.\n\n  \n\nThe Engine Room 1 system is a High/Intermediate pressure system used to cool processes and workspaces throughout the facility.  The Engine Room 2 system is a Intermediate/Low pressure system used to cool docks and storage areas and provide refrigeration for Freezers operating down to -30 deg. F.\n\n\n\nAn ammonia release from the system poses a risk of offsite public and/or environmental injury or impact.  The system is regulated under the OSHA PSM standard (29 CFR 1910.119).  The system is subject to the Program 3 requirements of the EPA's RMP (40 CFR Part 68) program.\n\n\n\nC. Summary of Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\n\n\nThe worst-case release scenario at the facility for the ammonia refrigeration process involves the release of 16,669 pounds of ammonia over a 10 minute period due to the failure of the high pressure receiver (V-1) in the Engine Room 1 system when the entire system volume is pumped down to the V-1 and the co"

This distance has been calculated based on the RMP Comp method provided in EPA's Risk Management Program (40 CFR 68) Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration.\n\n\n\nThe worst-case release scenario is unlikely for the following reasons:\n\n\n\n- The worst-case weather conditions which were used for this scenario are not typical and industry standards were followed for the manufacture and quality control of the receiver.  \n\n- The receiver is located in a low traffic area within the engine room which minimizes the possibility of loss of containment due to vehicular impact (e.g., from forklifts etc.)\n\n- Ammonia is not corrosive in this service and the vessel is relatively new.\n\n- Pressure safety valves limit operating pressure in the receiver.\n\n- The facility has a preventive maintenance program in place to maintain the on-going integrity of vessels.\n\n- The facility has a training program designed to ensure that the system is operated by qualified personnel\n\n- The facility emergency response procedures enable trained personnel to monitor levels and isolate any potential releases remotely using the control system or from a point a safe distance away from the release. \n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario for ammonia at the Rockmart, GA facility involves the release of ammonia through a defective pressure safety valve, which lifts to relieve high system pressure but fails to reseat properly (PSV) at a rate of 70 lbs/min.  Under alternative release weather conditions, the toxic endpoint is calculated by RMP Comp at .2 miles.
