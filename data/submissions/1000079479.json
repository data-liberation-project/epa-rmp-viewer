As part of this commitment, WestRock has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility.  One component of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks involved with using hazardous substances at WestRock and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit an executive summary in the risk management plan (RMPlan) describing the risk management program at WestRock.  This document is intended to satisfy the executive summary requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at WestRock.\r\n\r\nThe risk management program at WestRock consists of three elements:\r\n\r\n1. a hazard assessment designed to help us understand (a) the potential offsite consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and (b) accidents that have occurred during the last five years associated with the substances regulated by the RMP rule (regulated substances) - see topics 1.3 and 1.5\r\n2. a prevention program to help maintain and safely operate processes containing significant quantities of substances regulated by the RMP rule - see topic 1.4\r\n3. an emergency response program to help respond to accidental releases of regulated substances from processes covered by the RMP rule - see topic 1.6\r\n\r\nInformation further describing these elements is provided in this executive summary.\r\n\r\nAlthough the risk management program at WestRock helps ensure that our facility is maintained and operated in a safe manner, it is only one component of the safety program.

Response activities have also been discussed with the LEPC.\r\n\r\n1.2 WestRock and the Regulated Substances We Use\r\nWestRock is an integrated pulp and paperboard mill primarily involved in the manufacture of bleached pulp and related finished paperboard products.  As part of this manufacturing process, WestRock handles one regulated substance in sufficient quantities to be covered by the RMP rule, as shown in the following list of RMP-covered processes at WestRock.\r\n\r\nProcess Regulated Substance(s)\r\nChlorine Dioxide System, Chlorine dioxide\r\n\r\n1.3 Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-specific Prevention Steps\r\nWestRock has always believed that safety is the highest priority.  Beginning in 1992, the mill formalized this belief into a prevention program that complies with the OSHA process safety management (PSM) prevention program.  For WestRock, the prevention program requirements for EPA's RMP rule are nearly identical to the PSM rule.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of WestRock's prevention program that address the RMP rule prevention program requirements. \r\n\r\n1.3.1 WestRock's Prevention Program\r\nThe WestRock accident prevention program, consists of the following 12 elements:\r\n\r\n1.

These documents address (1) process chemical information of the hazardous substances we handle, (2) process technology information, and (3) equipment information for our equipment.  WestRock ensures that this process safety information is available to all our employees.\r\n\r\n2. Process Hazard Analysis.  WestRock performs and periodically updates process hazard analyses (PHAs) of our covered processes to help identify process hazards and generate recommendations that might improve the safe operation of the process.  A team consisting of personnel with engineering and process operating experience and a leader with PHA experience is assembled to analyze the hazards of our processes.  The team painstakingly addresses the potential hazards associated with each piece of equipment, down to the smallest pipe, that carries hazardous material. The PHA team then prepares a written report describing the results of the analysis, including a list of recommendations.  Responsibility to resolve the recommendations is assigned to unit personnel and, when appropriate, changes to enhance the safety of the process are implemented.  PHAs are revisited every five years to ensure they are current.\r\n\r\n3. Operating Procedures.  WestRock's process engineers, operators, and supervisors work together to develop and maintain operating procedures to define how tasks related to process operations should be safely performed.  The operating procedures are used to train employees and serve as reference guides for appropriate actions to take during both normal operations and process upsets.  Operating procedures include:\r\n\u00b7 steps for safely conducting activities\r\n\u00b7 applicable process safety information, such as safe operating limits and consequences of process deviations\r\n\u00b7 safety and health considerations, such as chemical hazards, personal protective equipment requirements, and actions to take if exposure to a hazardous substance oc"

Our training program includes both initial and refresher training that covers (1) a general overview of the process, (2) the properties and hazards of the substances in the process, and (3) a detailed review of the process operating procedures and safe work practices.  Oral reviews and written tests are used to verify that an employee understands the training material before the employee can begin or resume work in the process.\r\n\r\n5. Mechanical Integrity.  WestRock maintains mechanical process equipment to help prevent equipment failures that could endanger workers, the public, or the environment.  Our mechanical integrity program includes (1) an inspection,testing, and preventative maintenance plan to help identify equipment deterioration and damage before the equipment fails and (2) a quality assurance program to help ensure that new and replacement equipment meet the strict design standards required for service in our processes.\r\n\r\n6. Management of Change.  We evaluate and specifically approve all proposed changes to chemicals, equipment, and procedures to help ensure that the change does not negatively affect safe operations. All changes other than replacement-in-kind (e.g., replacing a valve with an identical valve) must be confirmed through the full management of change program.  This helps ensure that inadvertent consequences of process changes are prevented, safety consequences of changes are addressed, affected process safety information and procedures are updated, and affected employees are notified of the changes.\r\n\r\n7. Pre-startup Review.  WestRock recognizes that new or newly modified processes are historically more likely to be involved in accidental releases.  Therefore, we perform safety reviews of new or modified processes before placing them into service to help ensure their safe operation.

Compliance Audit.  One of the cornerstones of an effective prevention program is a regular, thorough assessment.  We audit our covered processes every three years to be certain our prevention program is effectively addressing the safety issues of WestRock operations.  We assemble an audit team that includes personnel knowledgeable in the PSM and RMP rules and in our process designs, and this team evaluates whether the prevention program satisfies the requirements of these two rules and whether it is sufficient to help ensure safe operation of the process.  The results of the audit are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate enhancements to the prevention program are implemented.\r\n\r\n9. Incident Investigation.  WestRock investigates all incidents that could reasonably have resulted in a serious injury to personnel, the public, or the environment so that similar accidents can be prevented in the future.  We train our employees to identify and report any incident requiring investigation.  An investigation team is assembled, and the investigation is initiated within 48 hours of the incident. The results of the investigation are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate process improvements are implemented.\r\n\r\n10. Employee Participation.

We require that the Contractor Supervisors train each of their employees who will work at the facility before that worker begins work at our facility.  WestRock periodically reviews contractors' training documents and work performance to help ensure that safe practices are followed. \r\n\r\n1.3.2 Chemical-specific Prevention Steps\r\nIn addition to the required prevention program elements, WestRock has implemented safety features specific to the hazardous substances used at our facility.  The following paragraphs describe some of these safety features.\r\nChlorine Dioxide.  Chlorine dioxide is produced at the WestRock facility and stored in a mixture that is 99% water and 1% chlorine dioxide.  This avoids the necessity of transporting large quantities of the solution, and storing this substance as a solution helps to reduce the consequences of a release.  Any release of chlorine dioxide that does occur will quickly wash into the process sewer, whe"

The recorded accidental releases resulted in exposing employees to a toxic vapor.  No long-term impairment has resulted.  The number of accidental releases has generally decreased over the years.   \r\n\r\nYear - Number of Reported Accidents - Substance Released - Consequences\r\n2014 - None\r\n2015 - None\r\n2016 - None\r\n2017 - None\r\n2018 - None\r\n2019 - None\r\n\r\n1.5 Emergency Response Programs\r\nWestRock has established a written emergency response program to help safely respond to accidental releases of hazardous substances.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for:\r\n\u00b7 informing the LEPC about accidental releases that could reasonably result in offsite consequences\r\n\u00b7 providing proper first aid and emergency medical treatment for accidental human exposure to hazardous substances\r\n\u00b7 controlling and containing accidental releases of hazardous substances, including the use of emergency response equipment\r\n\u00b7 inspecting and maintaining emergency response equipment\r\n\u00b7 reviewing and updating the emergency response plan\r\n\r\nAt WestRock maintenance teams are trained to respond to emergency situations and the Maintenance Superintendent or his designee is in charge of coordinating emergency actions.  All WestRock personnel are trained in evacuation procedures.  The Director of Technical and Environmental Services or his designee is responsible for apprising the Marengo County LEPC of the emergency situation, and the LEPC is responsible for notifying the public, if necessary.\r\n\r\nThe written emergency response plan complies with other federal contingency plan regulations (e.g., the OSHA regulations 29 CFR 1910.38(a), 29 CFR 1910.120(a)), and a copy of the plan has been provided to the LEPC and the fire department. WestRock maintains a regular dialogue wit"
