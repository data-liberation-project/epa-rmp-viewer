The Emergency Response Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the PSM document.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n1.) To save lives.\n2.) To minimize and avoid injuries.\n3.) To protect the environment.\n4.) To minimize property damage.\n\nThe Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation assembly areas, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe Vons Company, Inc., Jerseymaid Milk Products facility was designed and constructed in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations.  The facility is located at 3361 South Boxford Avenue, Commerce, CA 90040.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system uses 40,000 pounds of ammonia within a closed system for the purpose of manufacturing milk products.  The system cycles ammonia through various physical states in order to provide refrigeration for the production of milk products and storing food products.\n\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY\n\nWorst Case Release Result Summary\nScenario Description: Release of the maximum quantity of ammonia that can be stored in a vessel - 26,940 pounds in 10 minutes.  The release rate was calculated to be 2,694 pounds per minute.  The most pessimistic meteorological conditions were used: 1.5 meters/second wind speed, and F stability.  The reference table, Exhibit 4-4, from the EPA's Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration was used to determine the distance to the toxic endpoint of 200 ppm for a release of 3,000 pounds per minute.  This release reaches offsite and may affect public receptors.  No environmen"

The release rate of ammonia due to the pressure of the tank is 134 pounds per minute.  The meteorological conditions used were 3 meters per second wind speed, and D stability. The reference table, Exhibit 4-5, from the EPA's Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration was used to determine the distance to the toxic endpoint of 200 ppm for a release of 150 pounds per minute.  This release reaches offsite and may affect public receptors.  No environmental receptors were affected by this potential release.\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nVons Company, Inc., Jerseymaid Milk Products had prepared and implemented a PSM program in 1995.  This included conducting an initial PHA to examine potential release scenarios and identify measures to reduce the consequences and/or likelyhood of such events.  The PSM prevention programs included developing written operating and maintenance procedures as well as other policies and programs to manage the handling of ammonia at the facility (Management of Change, Incident Investigation, Employee Training, and Participation, etc.) \nThe mechanical rooms are equipped with ammonia sensors which are tied to audible and visual alarms inside the maintenance room and throughout the facility.  The facility is equipped with emergency shut off buttons located in the main office, outside the maintenance room, and outside the Ice Cream plant.  Spill containment kits are located throughout the facility.  The facility is also equipped with a sprinkler system.\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere is no accident history at this facility within the past five years (June 1994 to June 1999).\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nVons Company, Inc., Jerseymaid Milk Products has an emergency response plan in the Business Plan for the facil"

Supervisors will contact employees in their department to shut off equipment and evacuate to the designated meeting areas.  The public address system and blow horns will be used in the event that individual contact can not be made.  Plant management will call 911 in order to reach the Los Angeles County Fire Department HazMat team who will respond to the ammonia release.  All employees are trained annually in the emergency evacuation/response plan.\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nRecommendations made during the initial Process Hazard Analysis on May 24, 1995 provided mitigation measures to improve safety at the Vons Company, Inc., Jerseymaid Milk Products facility.  Vons Company, Inc., Jerseymaid Milk Products has implemented these recommendations and have deemed them complete.  This was verified during the Process Hazard Analysis Revalidation session on June 2, 1999.  Vons Company, Inc., Jerseymaid Milk Products has reviewed the following sections of their PSM program and updated them for compliance with the RMP: operating procedures, mechanical integrity, emergency response plan (updating phone list), training, and process safety information.    In addition, the following policies have been prepared in order to comply with the RMP: Recordkeeping and Updates, Management Programs, and Certification.  Finally, additional technical studies (Seismic Assessment, External Events, and a Hazard Assessment) have been prepared to further examine potential causes and consequences associated with a release of ammonia from the refrigeration system.  \n\nThe facility has worked to address safety issues as they arise in a continued effort to ensure a safe work environment.  The management at Vons Company, Inc., Jerseymaid Milk Products is planning to continue with this program as follows:\n\n1.
