The City developed and implemented the City's Process Safety Management/ Risk Management Prevention \nProgram that provides a systematic approach to employee involvement, safety awareness and program assessment.\n\nPlant Description:\nThe City of Oxnard Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) is located at 6001 S. Perkins Road, Oxnard, California.   The facility provides secondary treatment for \nwastewater from the Cities of Oxnard, Port Hueneme and other unincorporated areas.  The WWTP is managed, operated and maintained by approximately 75 staff.\n\nThe WWTP utilizes several acutely hazardous materials within the treatment process.  Chlorine and sulfur dioxide have been identified as acutely hazardous chemicals. \nThe facility has inventory capabilities to store 24,000 pounds (12 one-ton containers) of chlorine and 12,000 pounds (6 one-ton containers) of sulfur dioxide. At \npresent, the facility is used as stand-by disinfection only! The facility has converted to liquid sodium hypochlorite and sodium bisulfite.\n\nProgram Compliance:\nThe Risk Management Prevention and Process Safety Management Programs have been developed and implemented.  The Risk Management Prevention is fulfillment \nof 40 CFR PART 68.  The Process Safety Management Program is in fulfillment of the Occupational Health and Safety Administration's (OSHA) 1910.119, as well as \nCal/OSHA's California Code of Regulations, Title 8, Section 5189, Process Safety Management of Acutely Hazardous Materials. \n\nSafety Elements:\nThe City has maintained a comprehensive program since 1975 and has implemented additional health and safety programs as regulations and prevention programs were \nintroduced.  The City received the Large Plant of the Year -1997  for the State of California by t"

The award \nrecognizes facilities with excellent operation/maintenance performance, proactive health and safety programs and the commitment and resources to implement such \nprograms.\n\nThe facility has a full-time Safety Officer and a Safety Committee that is comprised of supervisory, administrative, operational and maintenance personnel. The \nCommittee has spear-headed several risk reduction projects over the past several years 1999 including:\n* Emergency Response Program\n* Installation of Wind Socks to assist Emergency Responders\n* Installation of remote pneumatic chemical shut-off valves\n* De-commissioning of the Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide Bulk Tanks\n* Conversion to liquid Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide in lieu of gaseous acutely hazardous materials\n\nSafety elements can be defined as either administrative or engineering controls.  Administrative elements include; 1) procedural requirements, 2) training, 3) operator \ncertification, and 4) City's policy and commitment of resources.  Engineering elements include physical modifications or facilities to 1) detect, 2) contain, 3) treat, 4) \nwarn, or 5) eliminate a potential incident.\n\nRecent Conversion to Liquid Chemicals 2001-2002:\n\nAs part of the risk reduction effort, the City implemented a Conversion to Liquid Chemical in 2001-2002.  The project allowed the City to remove the gaseous chlorine \nand sulfur dioxide from service.  The existing gaseous facilities were upgraded with a state-of-the-art chlorine gas scrubber and new integrated gas monitoring \nequipment.  The project was awarded Large Engineering Project of the Year by the California Engineering and Land Surveyors (CELSOC) - 2003 CY.\n\n\nAccident History:\n\nThe City has maintained a clean record of accidental releases of acutely hazardous materials and reports no incidents.  The City does maintain a comprehensive Incident \nInvestigation and Emergency Response Programs in the event of an occurrence.  Ongoing Emerg"

The audits were to evaluate the \nadequacy of the PSM and RMP programs and provide recommendations of improvements.  The major recommendation to improve the overall safety of the facility was \nto review the site security issue.  The Safety Committee is reviewing the situation and a plan of action is pending.\n\nRisk Reduction Initiatives:\n\nConsistent with the City historical pro-active track record, several risk reduction programs are in progress. First, authorization has been granted by the City of Oxnard \nCouncil to change from gaseous chlorine/sulfur dioxide to liquid bleach/sodium bisulfite as the primary treatment chemicals.  Switching to liquid, the potential risk \nof a gaseous release will be eliminated.  A reduced amount of stand-by chlorine and sulfur dioxide will be maintained in the event of liquid chemical shipment \ncurtailment. Second, the existing chlorine /sulfur dioxide systems were converted to vacuum systems thus reducing the potential."
