If such a release were to occur, emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  Our site specific Emergency Action Plan includes steps and sequence of steps to be taken including appropriate contacts to make. We are contracted with a third party chemical incident mitigation company to assist us should any release escape into the environment as necessary. We are also coordinated with the local fire department and local customer plant safety personnel which provide additional emergency response expertise.\n\n\n\n2.  The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nOur facility's primary activities are comprised of the receipt, storage and shipment of hazardous materials in DOT approved packaged form for our customer.  These specific chemicals are used in the agricultural industry.  Currently we have product that contains isopropylamine as part of a mixture.  The product is stored in portable containers as finished product.\n\n\n\n3.  The General Accident Release Prevention Program\n\nOur facility has developed and implemented a prevention program to prevent any accidental releases.  This program incorporates the following elements:  Safety examination, hazard review, operating procedures, training, maintenance and compliance audits.\n\n\n\n4.

Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nInternal safety audits are completed annually. Any items needing corrective actions are documented and the corrective actions are put in place by the Operations Manager. Confirmation of the corrective actions being put in place is done by the Director of Operations. The most recent audit at this facility identified insufficient information on a satellite accumulation drum and a door was found to be unlocked. Both were corrected immediately."
