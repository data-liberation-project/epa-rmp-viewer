We are contracted with a third party chemical incident mitigation company to assist us should any release escape into the environment as necessary. We are also coordinated with the local fire department and local customer plant safety personnel which provide additional emergency response expertise.\r\n\r\n2.  The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\r\nOur facility's primary activities are comprised of the receipt, storage and shipment of hazardous materials in DOT approved packaged form for our customer.
