The resources invested in the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances demonstrate this commitment.  The Malvern Water Works Wastewater Treatment Plant implements reasonable controls, such as training of personnel and the safe design, installation, operation and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to make every effort to prevent the release of hazardous substances but in the event of a release, our trained personnel and local emergency response agencies will respond to control and contain the release in a manner that will be safe for workers and will help prevent injuries to the public or the environment.\n\n\n2.0\tDescription of the Malvern Water Works Wastewater Treatment Plant and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Malvern Water Works Wastewater Treatment Plant is located within the city limits of Malvern, Arkansas, a city with a population of over 10,000 residents.  The facility is capable of treating 1 to 6 million gallons of wastewater per day.  The Malvern Water Works Wastewater Treatment Plant handles two substances regulated by the Risk Management Plan Rule (RMP Rule) in quantities above the Threshold Quantity.  These substances are:\n\n\u00bf\tChlorine - stored in 1 ton cylinders and used for disinfection of the wastewater prior to release into the receiving stream.\n\u00bf\tSulfur dioxide (anhydrous) - stored in 1 ton cylinders and used to remove the chlorine from the treated wastewater before release into the receiving stream\n\n\n3.0\tHazar"

      "SummaryText": "d Assessment\n \nThe RMP Rule requires The Malvern Water Works Wastewater Treatment Plant to perform a Hazard Assessment of the regulated substances stored and used in the covered processes at the facility.  This Hazard Assessment includes an offsite consequence analysis for the following scenarios:\n \n\u00bf\tOne worst-case and one alternative release scenario for the toxic substance chlorine for the chlorination process unit at the facility.\n\u00bf\tOne worst-case and one alternative release scenario for the toxic substance sulfur dioxide for the sulfonation process unit at the facility.\n\nThe following information summarizes these offsite consequence analyses.\n\n3.1\tChlorination Process\n\nThe worst-case scenario for toxic substances is the failure of a 1 ton cylinder of liquid chlorine.  The toxic cloud formed by the evaporating chlorine would reach off-site endpoints and public receptors.\nThe alternative release scenario for chlorine is a cylinder valve sticking in the open position allowing a sixty minute release of chlorine gas.  The toxic cloud formed by the escaping gas would reach offsite endpoints and public receptors.\n\n3.2\tSulfonation Process\n\nThe worst-case scenario for toxic substances is the failure of a 1 ton cylinder of liquid sulfur dioxide.  The toxic cloud formed by the evaporating sulfur dioxide would reach off-site endpoints and public receptors.\nThe alternative release scenario for sulfur dioxide is a cylinder valve sticking in the open position allowing a sixty minute release of sulfur dioxide gas.  The toxic cloud formed by the escaping gas would reach offsite endpoints and public receptors.\n\n\n4.0\tAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe RMP Rule requires that a prevention program be established for the Malvern Water Works Wastewater Treatment Plant chlorination and sulfonation processes.  The following details the prevention program elements at the City of Benton Wastewater Treatment Plant that apply to these processes"

      "SummaryText": ".\n\n4.1\tSafety Information\n\nThe Malvern Water Works Wastewater Treatment Plant maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to help ensure safe operation of the Malvern Water Works Wastewater Treatment Plant processes.  Material safety data sheets (MSDSs) document the physical and chemical properties of hazardous substances handled at the Malvern Water Works Wastewater Treatment Plant, including the chlorine and sulfur dioxide in the covered processes.  The engineering design documents include the operating parameters, the design basis and configuration of the equipment in each covered process, and references to applicable codes and standards.\n\n \n4.2\tHazard Review\n\nThe Malvern Water works Wastewater Treatment Plant performs and periodically updates hazard reviews of the covered processes to help identify and control process hazards.  Checklists are used to guide the hazard review.  These checklists include items to help ensure the Malvern Water Works Wastewater Treatment Plant operates and maintains the equipment in a manner consistent with the applicable design specifications, codes, standards, and regulations.\n\n4.3\tOperating Procedures\n\nThe Malvern Water Works Wastewater Treatment Plant develops and maintains operating procedures to define how tasks related to process operations should be performed.  The operating procedures are used to:\n\n1.\ttrain employees and contractors, and\n2.\tserve as reference guides for appropriate actions to take during both normal and abnormal process conditions.\n\n4.4\tTraining\n\nThe Malvern Water Works Wastewater Treatment Plant trains personnel in the operating procedures to help ensure safe and effective performance of their assigned tasks. A record of all training is maintained to help ensure new and refresher training is provided on a timely basis.\n\n4.5\tMaintenance\n\nThe Malvern Water Works Wastewater Treatment Plant properly maintains the equipment in our processes.

A compliance audit report is prepared after each audit, and any deficiencies noted by the audit are corrected in a timely manner.\n\n \n4.7\tIncident Investigations\n\nThe Malvern Water Works Wastewater Treatment Plant investigates all incidents that could reasonably have resulted in a serious injury to personnel, the public, or the environment.  The City of Benton Wastewater Treatment Plant trains employees to identify and report any and all incidents requiring investigation.  An investigation team is assembled and the investigation is initiated within 48 hours of the incident.  The results of the investigation are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate process enhancements are implemented.\n\n4.8\tChemical-specific Prevention Steps - Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide\n\nIndustry standards are followed at the Malvern Water Works Wastewater Treatment Plant to help ensure safe handling of chlorine and sulfur dioxide.  The vendor supplies chlorine and sulfur dioxide via a Department of Transportation (DOT) approved truck and in DOT approved 1 ton cylinders.  The process equipment is designed and constructed with state-of-the-art materials and technology utilizing the standards and guidelines of the Chlorine Institute, Compressed Gas Association, American Water Works Association, ASME, ANSI, and other applicable codes.  Workers who perform operations involving chlorine receive training emphasizing safe handling procedures according to the guidelines required by the Malvern Wat"
