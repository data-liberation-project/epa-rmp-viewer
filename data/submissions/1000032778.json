The Company endeavors to execute this policy through the daily implementation of its Safety Programs.  Company safety program includes, but is not limited to a comprehensive Process Safety Management Program (PSM). The PSM Program is an integrated, holistic approach to the safe operation of processes using Regulated Substances.  The PSM Program is specifically designed and intended to prevent accidental releases, and to deal safely with emergencies if and when they do happen.  It is the primary goal of WPS/Commercial to protect its employees, visitors and neighbors from harm due to Company operations.  \n\n\n\nThe Company recognizes the need to be prepared to respond safely to accidental releases that could occur should established prevention programs fail. WPS/Commercial policy includes development, maintenance and implementation of its Emergency Action Plan, and to train its employees in notification and evacuation procedures. WPS policy includes maintaining appropriate emergency capabilities and to deal with emergencies safely if and when they do happen.  Key WPS employees attend 1910.120 (q) emergency training.  WPS maintains ammonia emergency equipment and a relationship with the Oxnard Fire/CUPA has been established.  Emergency pre-"

The company strives to execute its emergency response policies through skilled employees that are provided with adequate and appropriate equipment and training.\n\n\n\n1.2  General Description of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nWPS/Commercial was remodeled and expanded in 2002-2003; and provides for the cooling and short-term refrigerated storage of fresh fruits and vegetables (primarily fresh berries). The facility went into operation early in April, 2003.  This is a 5-year update (2013) of the Risk Management Plan (RMP) as required by Federal and State Accidental Release Prevention (Fed/ARP and Cal/ARP) RMP Rules.  The name of the facility changed in this update cycle (there was no ownership change).   \n\n\n\nThe facility is located in an industrial area of Oxnard.  Anhydrous Ammonia CAS # 7664-41-7 is used as the refrigerant in the main refrigeration system.  This is a direct, mechanical refrigeration system which was installed according to the codes and standards locally adopted in 2002-2003.  The facility maintains the necessary operating permits from the City of Oxnard and City of Oxnard Fire/CUPA.  \n\n\n\nA portion of the refrigeration equipment is portable and is moved on & off-site according to seasonal produce markets.  The inter-connected piping between the portable components is permanently mounted.  Some vessels and evaporators within the refrigerated space are permanently mounted, and some refrigerating equipment is portable.\n\n   \n\n1.3 General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nWPS is the company that operates and maintains the ammonia refrigeration equipment.  WPS has developed comprehensive written procedures for the operation and maintenance of ammonia-handling equipment, including the steps to be taken in the"

      "SummaryText": " event of a release or threatened release.  The written procedures include necessary safety precautions for Plant operation, from installation and start-up to daily operation, to disassembly and moving of portable equipment.  As equipment maintenance needs are determined, the need is expressed at workload meetings conducted by the WPS Area Manager.  The specific repair task or upgrade for the expressed need is decided by the WPS Area Manager and entered into a computerized service call system. Tasks are tracked through this system.  Through this regular routine of inspect, discuss, assign and confirmation of completion, WPS/Commercial Cooler has reduced equipment operational problems and also reduced release potentials.\n\n\n\nWPS actively encourages its ammonia technicians to seek Certification through the Refrigerating Engineers and Technicians Association (RETA).    \n\n\n\nAs noted above a comprehensive Process Safety Management (PSM) Program has been established.  In California the program is in accordance with CCR 8, 5189.  The PSM Program is specifically intended to promote the safe operation of ammonia-handling equipment and processes.  \n\n\n\nChemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nIt has become apparent in the industry that a mishap while draining oil from the system is one of the most common incidents to occur, so special self-closing valves were installed as a permissive for oil drain flow.  If a release were to develop during the oil-draining task, the mechanic simply releases the handle of the self-closing valve and flow is terminated.  The facility has installed these types of valves at the oil drain points.\n\n\n\nOther Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:\n\n?    Fencing and gates to limit access by potential \"wrong-do-ers\".\n\n?    Monitoring system monitors process parameters 24/7/365.  The alarm system is continuously monitored via a third party security company.\n\n?    The facility is equipped with a Closed-Circuit TV (CCTV) System.    \n\n?

Staff is trained for hazard communication (discovery and communicating) for un-authorized personnel, suspicious activity, fires, releases or other hazardous/suspicious condition.   \n\n?    Staff is trained in the fire and accident prevention benefits of good housekeeping.  The general appearance of the facility is maintained on a day-to-day basis.\n\n?    The refrigeration system is equipped with an ammonia-water diffusion system.  Pressure Relief Valves (PRVs) are piped into this system to prevent a release to atmosphere in the event of a PRV operating.\n\n?    Technicians can access system controls remotely\n\n?    A strong relationship exists with the Oxnard Fire/CUPA.  WPS/Commercial worked closely with the CUPA in the planning and execution of the Plant and the refrigeration system, and an Oxnard Fire/CUPA Representative participated in the most recent Process Hazard Analysis (PHA).\n\n\n\n1.4 Five-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThere have been no qualified accidents.  There is no data to report.\n\n\n\n1.5 The Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\nThe Emergency Response Program is divided into two elements, as only properly trained and qualified personnel are authorized to respond to emergencies.  Personnel that are not involved in the actual cooling process are trained to notify and evacuate.  Only personnel trained to 29 CFR 1910.120(q) standards and the Oxnard Fire/CUPA would respond to an actual release. Written ammonia emergency action procedures are detailed in the WPS/Commercial \"Thirty Minute Plan\".  Available emergency equipment is listed in the facility's Calif. Hazardous Material Business Plan (HMBP), which also details procedures for non-responding personnel.  Each of these Plans are maintained on-site and updated on a regular basis.  The HMBP is filed with the Oxnard Fire/CUPA.  \n\n  \n\n1.6   Planned changes to improve safety\n\n\n\nThe primary mechanisms to identify and plan safety improvements include (but are not limited to):\n\n?
