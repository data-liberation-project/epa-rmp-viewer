Request Foods complies with all OSHA, MIOSHA, DEQ and EPA regulations that pertain to the frozen food industry, employee's safety and health, as well as the community's safety and health. Chemical safety is just one of the elements of the Request Foods safety program that it takes very seriously and vows to implement any, and all, safety related procedures as a means to comply with regulations and to ensure the safety of its employees and surrounding environment.\n\nSpecifically, Request Foods complies with the OSHA PSM standard (Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals (29 CFR 1910.119)) and utilizes the majority of the elements of the PSM program as the company's general accidental release prevention program detailing and outlining specific steps in the prevention of Ammonia spills. As a result of Request Foods' compliance with the OSHA PSM standard, specifically the Process Hazards Analysis element of the program, Request Foods has been able to identify specific areas surrounding the Ammonia system that may require greater attention. This has come in the form of requiring more stringent documentation of process equipment maintenance and preventative maintenance steps, bringing to the attention of contractors working on the system the required safety procedures, and emphasizing a greater breadth of awareness amongst the entire Request Foods employee population and training topics for the affected employees with their job responsibilities most closely associated with the Ammonia refrigeration system.\n\n\n\nShould there be a release of Ammonia from the Request Foods facility, estimates have been made with the assistance of the Holland Township Planning Office regarding the amount of offsite impact (human) there may be immediately around the facility given specific distances for worst-case release scenario and an alternativ"

Local emergency responders such as the Ottawa County Sheriff Department and Holland Township Fire Departments are first on the list of responders.\n\n\n\n\nDuring an emergency response the Ottawa County Sheriff Department will provide site security at the street entrances.

Given the models equations, an endpoint, or vulnerability zone was calculated to be 1.50 miles in all directions from the center of the facility.

Request Foods consistently employs 560 full time individuals on an annual basis in addition to utilizing a large temporary force during busier production seasons.\n\nRequest Foods is a privately held, for profit, organization with the primary objective of producing high quality convenience frozen food entrees (mainly pasta and chicken based products) as well as side dishes for a large spectrum of nationally known companies. The majority of its products are sold in both the retail and institutional market places. Due to the frozen nature of the food products that are produced, Request Foods utilizes a series of coolers, spiral freezers and storage freezers to maintain the integrity of its products and raw materials. The agent/chemical that is used at the facility to perform the cooling and freezing of the environment and products is Anhydrous Ammonia. Anhydrous Ammonia is a substance regulated by the government. The current maximum inventory of Anhydrous Ammonia at the Request Foods Greenly plant is 84,400 pounds. The majority of this inventory is considered in process cycling through the refrigeration equipment (compressors, evaporators, condensers, pumps, etc.). There are 50 pieces of refrigeration equipment within the Ammonia system at Request Foods. Presently, there is one large receiver located in the Engine room on the Nortwest corner of the building. There are also, four smaller receivers located within the facility in the engine rooms.\n\nAt Request Foods, management has taken every step necessary to provide a safe work environment for its team members and has been actively involved with the local Holland Township Fire Department and Ottawa County Lo"

With this oversight, the continued safe operation of the refrigeration system will continue at an even more heightened level. It should also be noted that recently an outside alarm/security company has begin monitoring the Request Foods Ammonia alarms. Through the evaluation of the Process Hazardous Analysis element of the PSM program, a number of procedural changes, in addition to administrative modifications, may happen resulting in a positive effect on the safety of the Ammonia refrigeration system at Request Foods."
