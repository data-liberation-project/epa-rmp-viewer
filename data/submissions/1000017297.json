      "SummaryText": "INTRODUCTION\n\nAt Emery Oleochemicals LLC Cincinnati, Ohio manufacturing plant, protection of employees, the public and the environment is considered to be the most important responsibility.  A key element of the plant's protection program is the development and implementation of plans to prevent accidental chemical releases.  In addition, if an accidental release should occur, plant personnel are prepared to respond in an organized and effective manner.  \n\nThe plant's accident prevention and emergency response programs have been developed in accordance with federal and state regulations, industry standards, and guidance from local emergency response organizations.\n\nThe plant's Risk Management Program (RMP) plan was prepared to comply with federal regulatory requirements regarding the prevention of accidental chemical releases (40 CFR 68, Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions).  The purpose of the regulation is to reduce the potential for an accidental chemical release and strengthen emergency response planning at the facility and within the community.  The RMP plan describes the incidents that would have the most catastrophic effects (the \"worst-case release scenarios\") and several scenarios of lesser magnitude (\"alternative release scenarios\"). Although it is technically infeasible for the worst-case release scenarios described in this plan to occur, the information is provided to support conservative emergency response planning.  In this way, the community is well prepared to respond to incidents of lesser magnitude, which are more likely to occur.\n\nAreas that could be impacted by an accidental chemical release were identified using RMP*Comp (Ver 1.07), which was developed by U. S. EPA for accidental chemical release modeling.\n\nEMERY OLEOCHEMICALS LLC\n\nCognis Corporation carved out the Fatty Acid, Glycerine, Ozone Acids and Plastics Technology Businesses creating Cognis Oleochemicals LLC in January 2006.

Senior management is responsible for release prevention and response programs, and considerable time and resources have been invested in this effort.  \n\nThe plant has detailed procedures to ensure that safety is considered in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of each process.  Plant personnel receive regular safety training, and employee input is solicited on every aspect of safety performance improvement.  Failure to follow safety policies is grounds for dismissal.\n\nIf a release were to occur, trained personnel would control and contain the release.  The standard procedure is to technically evaluate each situation, identify potential on-site and off-site impacts, evacuate or shelter employees as necessary, contain the release and contact the local fire department to control the release and minimize its consequences.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF STATIONARY SOURCE \n\nThe Emery Oleochemicals LLC Cincinnati, Ohio plant is a chemical manufacturing facility located at 4900 Este Avenue.  A variety of processes are operated at the plant to produce products derived from animal fat or vegetable oil.  The plant, originally constructed in 1885, is situated on 40 acres of land. Part of the plant is located in the City of Cincinnati and part is located in the City of St. Bernard.  The two parts are separated by the Mill Creek, a tributary of the Ohio River.  Fatty Acids, Glycerine and Ozone Acids are the major products produced at the Cincinnati plant. \n\nThe plant is subject to numerous environmental, health and safety regulations and is regularly inspected by agency representatives.

Ammonia, which is regulated as toxic substance, is used as a refrigerant in the Solvent Separation process.  Hydrogen, which is regulated as a flammable substance, is used as a process ingredient in the Hydrogenation processes that are part of the Stearic Acid manufacturing operations.  All of these processes have been assigned to RMP Program Level 3.\n\nNOTE:  The reporting of this Hydrogen system is a duplicate reporting. The system has also been reported by Air Products, Inc. (EPA ID # 1000 0001 8358) and Cognis Corporation. The system is completely owned, operated and maintained by Air Products but is located on property owned by Cognis Corporation and within the fence line of a Cognis operating facility. The Hydrogen stored within the system is supplied to the Emery Oleochemicals LLC facility. The dual reporting is by mutual consent of all three companies.\n\nOFFS"

      "SummaryText": "ITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS \n\nFollowing U. S. EPA guidance, an offsite consequence analysis (OCA) was performed to determine the potential for an accidental release of a regulated substance to affect the public or the environment.  The OCA included both worst-case release scenarios (WCSs) and alternative release scenarios (ARSs).  Considering the design of the regulated processes and the plant's accident prevention programs, it is virtually impossible for the WCSs to occur.  Although it is highly unlikely that the ARSs would ever occur, the ARSs represent release scenarios that are at least somewhat feasible. \n\nThe main objective of the OCA was to determine the furthest distance (called the endpoint distance) at which certain conditions might exist as a result of an accidental chemical release.  Most people at the endpoint distance would be able to walk away from the exposure without any long-term health consequences, although some short-term consequences are possible.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe Cincinnati plant has an good accident prevention record.  The RMP regulations require companies to report all significant releases from regulated processes that occurred during the past five years.  The plant has had one incident in the last five years that resulted in an employee injury.  On 6/8/09 at 11:48 pm, a release of hydrogen from a liquid collection pot prior to the hydrogen recirculation compressor ignited, and the operator received 2nd degree burns.  Plant personnel are available to answer any related questions.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the Cincinnati plant.  Since processes at the plant that are regulated under the RMP regulations are also subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\nEmployee"

Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the facility accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the plant and addresses each accident prevention program element.  In addition, the facility has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and employee safety issues.  These initiatives include forming teams to promote both process and personal safety.  The teams typically have members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering and plant management.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe Cincinnati plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Specific departments within the plant are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.  A table summarizing the reference documents, and their location is readily available as part of the written employee participation plan to help employees locate any necessary process safety information.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets.

The plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\nThe plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  The information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nThe plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within the program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe plant primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. The team identifies and evaluates the hazards associated with a process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution.

These periodic reviews are conducted at least once every five years, and they will continue to be conducted at this frequency until the process is decommissioned.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as unit startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, normal shutdown, and initial startup of a new process.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  They are reviewed periodically and certified annually as current and accurate. The procedures are maintained current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the Management of Change (MOC) process. In addition, the operating procedures provide guidance on how to respond should an upset situation occur, such as an electrical outage or process alarm.

The accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all RMP-covered processes at the facility.  Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accidental scenarios that could be caused by equipment failure or human error.\n\nIn addition to the accident prevention program activities, the Cincinnati plant has safety features on many units to help detect, contain/control, and reduce the consequences of a release.  The following types of safety features are used in various processes:\n\nRelease Detection\n\n\u00c2\u00b7 Chemical detectors with alarms,\n\nRelease Containment/Control\n\n\u00c2\u00b7 Scrubbers to neutralize or cool process vent streams prior to release to the environment,\n\u00c2\u00b7 Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual and automated),\n\u00c2\u00b7 Automated shutdown systems to a process if an upset condition occurs (e.g., high level, high temperature),\n\u00c2\u00b7 Curbing or diking to contain liquid releases,\n\u00c2\u00b7 Redundant equipment and instrumentation,\n\u00c2\u00b7 Emergency backup power supply for critical controls,\n\u00c2\u00b7 Special classified electrical equipment in areas where flammable chemicals are used,\n\nRelease Mitigation\n\n\u00c2\u00b7 Fire suppression and extinguishing systems,\n\u00c2\u00b7 Trained emergency response personnel,\n\u00c2\u00b7 Personal protective equipment (e.g., protective clothing, self-contained breathing apparatus), and\n\u00c2\u00b7 Blast-resistant buildings to help protect control systems and personnel.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\n\nThe Cincinnati plant maintains a written emergency response program, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.

The procedures address all aspects of emergency response; including proper first-aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies if a release occurs, and post-incident cleanup and decontamination.  In addition, the plant has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the proper use of that equipment.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties. The emergency response program is updated when necessary based upon modifications made to the plant processes or other plant facilities.\n\nThe overall emergency response program for the Cincinnati plant is coordinated with the Hamilton County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) as well as the Cincinnati and St. Bernard fire departments and other area businesses.  The plant has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department).  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.  In addition to periodic LEPC meetings, the plant conducts periodic emergency drills that involve the LEPC and emergency response organizations, and the plant provides refresher training to local emergency responders regarding the hazards of regulated substances in the plant.\n\nADDITIONAL EMERGENCY CONTACTS (supplement to Section 1.8)\n\nEmery Oleochemicals LLC, Cincinnati plant has a total of eight (8) Shift Supervisors that, while they are on duty, have the responsibility of being the Emergency Contact.
