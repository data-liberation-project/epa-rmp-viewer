This is demonstrated through our prevention program which covers areas such as operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with regulated substances.  Valero Renewables carries a written emergency response action plan to assist with accidental releases of hazardous materials. \n\n\n\nProcesses and Regulated Substances\n\nValero Renewables operates an ethanol fuel production plant located in Fort Dodge, Iowa.  The facility produces fuel grade ethanol from corn.  The facility produces by-products known as dry and wet distillers' grain with solubles, which is used as a livestock feed as well as bio-oil which is used in the manufacture of biodiesel.  The fuel ethanol production process requires use of a denaturant (natural gasoline) which may contain the following RMP regulated substances:  pentane, isopentane, neopentane (2,2-diemethylpropane), and butane.  Because of the variation in petroleum products like natural gasoline, the composition of regulated substances was determined by using the highest upper bound of each regulated substance reported on suppliers Material Safety Data Sheets and normalized to 100%.  This is a very conservative estimate.  The maximum amount of natural gasoline on-site is estimated to be 1,133,598 pounds.  The maximum amount of each regulated substance on site in the natural gasoline is estimated at 76,854 pounds of butane, 336,237 pounds of 2,2-dimethylpropane, 336,237 pounds of isopentane and 384,270 pounds of pentane.  The natural gasoline is stored in an above ground tank as a liquid and is added to the ethanol to make the ethanol unfit for human consumption.  Anhydrous ammonia is also stored on-site and used in the ethanol production process for pH control.  The maximum anhydrous ammonia store"

Written procedures are in place at Valero Renewables to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel, or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are notified and trained as needed.  Our facility also maintains written operating procedures of covered processes.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as emergency and normal operations, shutdown and start-up after a turnaround.  Valero Renewables has a comprehensive training program in place which covers many topics, such as Emergency Response, Hazard Communication, Chemical Safety, and Personal Protective Equipment (PPE).  The facility has a  Mechanical Integrity program for performing maintenance checks and inspections on process equipment to ensure proper operations.\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nValero Renewable Fuels has had one accident in the last five years.  On April 30, 2009, a release of approximately 29 pounds of anhydrous ammonia occurred which resulted in on e employee receiving medical treatment beyond first aid.  The release occurred during the offloading operations of an ammonia delivery truck.  A vent hose which is used to drain the transfer hose was submerged in a container of water.  The vent hose came loose and released anhydrous ammonia.  An employee in the area was sprayed on his lower leg with ammonia.  No burns were sustained.  The employee felt nauseas and was taken to the clinic were breathing treatments were administered.  The release was reported to the Iowa Department of Natural Resources.  No emergency response was required.  No property damage or environmental damage occurred fr"

Corrective actions included a change to the design of the container used for bleeding off transfer hoses, a more thorough checklist for preparation and performing anhydrous ammonia offloading, restriction of employees from the area during the offloading and bleeding process,  and detailed training for all operators on the anhydrous ammonia system and offloading procedure.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response\n\nValero Renewables maintains a written emergency response action plan.  The purpose of the plan is to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The plan addresses aspects of emergency response including evacuation plans, accounting for personnel after an evacuation and notification of local emergency response agencies if a release occurs.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties.  We work with the local fire departments and emergency responders to ensure the proper execution of our plan.  The emergency response action plan is updates as necessary based on modifications made to facility processes.\n\n\n\nCommitment to Improved Safety\n\nThe Valero Renewables facility has been constructed and is operated to meet existing process safety requirements.  Valero Renewables will continue to evaluate and implement changes as necessary to improve safety at the facility.\n\n"
