The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\r\nBCO-Plaq was contains 4 different process units previously part of Dow-LAO. Of the 4 process units, only 2 units are RMP covered processes: Chlorine  and Solvents/EDC.  There are only 4 regulated substances present at the facility that are above the threshold limits: Chloroform [Methane, trichloro-], Chlorine, Hydrogen chloride (anhydrous) [Hydrochloric acid] and Methyl chloride [Methane, chloro-]. \r\n\r\nAnhydrous hydrogen chloride is produced at BCO-Plaq to be used internally to make aqueous hydrogen chloride or to be sold to customers to make silicones, some of which form computer chips. Inhalation can cause coughing, choking, inflammation and ulceration of the respiratory tract.\r\n\r\nChlorine is a reactive element found naturally in sodium chloride (table salt). It is used to purify 98% of our nation's drinking water, is in 85% of all medicines, is used in hospital sanitation.  It is a product of the Chlorine Unit and is the basic building block in the production of many of Solvent/EDC's products as well as other costumers. Some of these consumer products are laundry bleach, garden and lawn herbicides, vinyl siding for homes, and PVC piping and fittings. Chlorine is a greenish yellow gas with a strong, irritating odor. The vapor can be irritating to the eyes, nose and throat. High concentrations could cause more serious problems.\r\n\r\n3.

On October 5, 2015, BCO-Plaq became a subsidiary of Olin Corporation.  All 4 units were previously included in DOW-LAO Site RMP.\r\n\r\nThe updates in this submission include the addition of Chlorine releases in January 2018, April 2022, and May 2022; correcting the quantity onsite for Chlorine, Chloroform, and Methyl chloride; and adding incident descriptions in the executive summary for the 3 most recent incidents that were added to the plan.
