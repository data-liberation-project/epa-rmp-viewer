The Worst-Case Release Scenerio and the Alternative Release Scenerio\n\n            a.  The Worst-Case release scenerio would be the release of the total contents of the storage\n    tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.   The maximum quantity released would be 126000#  which\n    represents the Total volume of the storage tank at 85 percent of capacity as limited by design\n    standards.
