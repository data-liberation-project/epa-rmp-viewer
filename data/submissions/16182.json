Our facility is located in the industrial park and is 67,000 square feet of warehouse space.  The warehouse is used for cold storage for the food industry.  We utilize ammonia (anhydrous) for the refrigeration system.\n\nOur system is a closed loop system containing all liquid ammonia throughout the facility.  In the event of a release the system can be pumped directly to the holding tanks on site.   If ammonia is released in the plant then high velocity fans is used to evacuate the ammonia outside.\n\nMidwest Cold Storage LLC, has personnel trained on site to the level of First Responders Operational Awareness Level as outlined in 29 CFR 1910.120 (e)(q).\n\nShould there be a case where there has been a release of ammonia, the plant engineer would isolate the release and notify our outside emergency contractor to report to our facility to mitigate the release.  Our outside contractor is Environmental Technology and Services of Kansas City, Missouri.\n\nThe worst case scenario that could occur within the facility would be from a result of Major Fire or Natural Disaster causing the release of all 9,000 pounds of ammonia.  In this scenario our facility operators would isolate the release and notify outside contractor.\n\nThe most likely scenario for our facility would be from the result of equipment failure, thus causing a release of <100 pounds of ammonia.  In this case our facility operators would then isolate the release and make the necessary repairs to the system.  The plant engineer would then notify supervisor of the release to make proper notifications needed depending on the size of the release.\n\nMidwest Cold Storage LLC, is always looking for ways to improve the safety for our employeed and the community in the handling of ammonia within this facility.
