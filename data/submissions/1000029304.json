ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY POLICIES\nMMPA and the FEP managers recognize their responsibility in protecting its operators, equipment, property, and the environment against the hazards of an unintentional ammonia release. The safety and health of all operators and the public is very important. The control of accidents has been and will continue to be a basic responsibility of all personnel in the facility. This RMP program assigns and documents the specific responsibilities for developing and implementing the EPA RMP standards into its safety program.  MMPA and the FEP managers believe that operator participation is the key to a successful program.   The FEP Emergency Response Program has been developed with the complete cooperation and support of the Faribault Fire Department. All FEP site personnel have received documented emergency response training.\n\nII. STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\nFEP utilizes an SCR Process for nitrogen oxide (NOx) removal. The aqueous ammonia storage and use system is a necessity for the generation of electric energy. The ammonia storage tank system contains no more than 18,450 Gallons of aqueous ammonia.  The approximate external tank dimensions are 9A? x 36A?.  It is estimated that maximum aqueous ammonia usage rates will remain at or below 95 gallons per hour at 50 psig.   Aqueous ammonia is currently the only Part 68 regulated substance that is maintained in quantities above the threshold quantity triggering RMP applicability.\n\nIII. SUMMARY OF WORST CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\nPlease refer to onsite documentation for Offsite Consequence data [See Section 4].\n\nIV. GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\nMMPA and the FEP operators comply with all relevant safety standards that apply to the inventory of 25 percent aqueous ammonia.  Section 6, Prevention Program of the RMP identifies the present elements being implemented by MMPA and the FEP op"

Since that time there have been no accidental releases of ammonia or close calls at this site.\n\nVI. EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\nThe FEP facility has procedures in place to respond to the release of a hazardous substance. Operators are trained to evacuate their respective areas in accordance with OSHA 1910.38(a). Coordination with the local volunteer fire department is initiated during an emergency situation. The Rice County LEPC has been notified regarding the FEP emergency action plan and of the potential nature of an aqueous ammonia release.  A copy of the facility Emergency Response Plan is readily available on site.\n\nVII. PLANNED CHANGES FOR SAFETY IMPROVEMENT \nMMPA and the FEP operators are committed to continuous improvement of the safety programs for its operators and the public, in general.   MMPA and the FEP operators will evaluate the safety programs, including the passive and active mitigation systems associated with the ammonia storage and use systems in the light of any release or potential incidents, protection systems in place at other facilities, and industry practices on a regular basis.\n\n\n"
