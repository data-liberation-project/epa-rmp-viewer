The Lakeland Division of Carpenter Co. utilizes and Integrated Contingency Plan (ICP) to manage the emergency response activities at the facility.  The implementation of the ICP at the facility is directly related to the degree of training given to the Carpenter Co. employees in regard to chemical releases and emergencies, fire evacuation and preparation for response to the effect of natural disasters.  The Lakeland Division\u00bfs attention to Accidental Release Prevention is evidenced by the facility\u00bfs having only one significant release of toluene diisocyanate during the previous fire years.  This release was completely contained within the building and resulted n no off-site impact.\n\n2.\tFACILITY DESCRIPTION & REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nThe Carpenter Co., Lakeland Division, is located at 5150 Frontage Road South in Lakeland, Florida.  The area around the facility is comprised of other industrial plants.  The Carpenter Co., Lakeland Division, employs approximately 100 full time employees.  The facility manufactures polyurethane foam products for use in carpet cushioning, bedding and furniture applications.  The polyurethane foam manufacturing process utilizes toluene diisocyanate (TDI) [unspecific isomers], CAS# 2647-62-5, in the respective process.  The Carpenter Co., Lakeland facility has a total TDI storage capacity of approximately 556,528 pounds.  The facility maintains one railcar with approximately 185,000 pounds, one internal TDI storage tank with a capacity of 312,516 pounds, one internal TDI prepolymer mixing tank with a capacity of 91,550 pounds, and one TDI prepolymer day tank with a capacity of 31,518 pounds.

      "SummaryText": "railcar unloading station. The unloading station has stationary drip pans installed to minimize incidental releases.\n\n3.\tWORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nThe Carpenter Co., Lakeland Division, utilized the modified Gaussian plume model presented in the EPA Off-Site Consequence Analysis (OCA) for the determination of off-site impact.  The Worst Case Scenario consists of the catastrophic loss of one railcar of TDI, approximately 1850,000 pounds at a temperature of 49.0C onto an uncontained area.  The TDI pool area is calculated to be approximately 76,000 square feet.  The resulting toxic endpoint is calculated to be 1261 feet or 0.24 miles.  Within the area delineated by the endpoint distance there are no residential receptors, however 7 industrial businesses would be impacted.\n\n4.\tALTERNATIVE CASE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nThe alternate release scenario is based on the failure of a transfer hose that results in the loss of its contents.  The volume of TDI present in the hose is calculated to be 100 pounds of liquid which would be lost on to the ballast rock present at the railcar unloading dock.  The pool area is resulting from this spill would equal 40 square feet with an estimated endpoint distance of 41 feet or <0.01 miles.  Based on the calculated endpoint distance a release of this magnitude would not impact any off-site residential or industrial receptors.\n\n5.\tGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM & CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe Carpenter Co. has implemented the RMP Program Level 2 Prevention Program, as described in the RMP regulations, at the facility which include the following elements:  TDI Safety Information, Health Guidelines & Material Safety Data Sheets, Hazard  Review utilizing \u00bfWhat if Checklists\u00bf, Standard Operating Procedures (TDI Unloading, Transfer Pump Operating and Shutdown, Recirculation Pump Operating & Shutdown, metering Pump Operating & Shutdown, and Pourline Operating Procedures), Employee training, Preventive Maintenance Plan, RMP Co"

FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nOver the previous five years the Carpenter Co., Lakeland Division, has had only one significant incident involving toluene diisocyanate (unspecified isomers).  This incident involved the failure of a prepolymer tank that resulted in the release of prepolymer (42% TDI) inside the building.  The release did not impact people or the environment beyond the property line.  \n\n7.\tEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe Carpenter Co., Lakeland Division, utilizes an Integrated Contingency Plan (ICP) to outline the emergency response activities for each class of incident that may occur at the facility.  The facility has made all required notifications to the Polk County LEPC regarding the types of materials stored at the facility and their volumes.  Carpenter Co. has an Emergency Response Service Agreement with American Compliance Technologies to provide remediation services in the event of a TDI release should occur.  Carpenter Co. maintains a trained HazMat response team capable of actively controlling a release of TDI.  All Carpenter Co. operations and support personnel have received training in TDI hazard recognition and awareness as well as a thorough review of MSDS sheets.  The facility conducts emergency response drills on a regular basis.\n\n8.  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe Carpenter Co., Lakeland Division, operates with an attention to employee awareness and emphasizes ongoing training of all personnel.  Additional employees receive 24 hour HazMat responder training.  A TDI unloading checklist has been implemented to ensure equipment is in satisfactory condition prior to use."
