The South District WWTP takes safely obligations in storing and using chlorine as seriously as it takes care in treating wastewater.\n\nThe South District WWTP chlorine handling process is subject to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program Rule and is a Program 3 process.  This regulation requires submission of a Risk Management Plan (RPM).  The South District WWTP also produces digester gas and stores it for on-site use as fuel.  The maximum quantity of digester gas stores at a given time exceeds the RMP threshold quantity, however the digester gas process qualifies as a RPM Program 1 process.\n\nAn integral part of the RMP is a summary of policies and procedures followed to safely operate the facility, including a description of the possible consequences in case on an accident and the actions, which will be taken, by the facility in an event of an emergency.\n\nThe following information is specifically required in the RMP Executive Summary:\n\n - Accidental Release and emergency response policies.\n\n - General facility and regulated substances information\n\n - Summary of the accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps.\n\n - Five-year accident history summary.\n\n - Emergency response program summary.\n\n - Planned changes to improve safety.\n\nThe above information for the South District WWTP chlorination system and the digester gas system, a required, is provided below. \n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies.\n\nThe MDWASD accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates proven technology, trains staff in ope"

The South District WWTP is located within the 10-mile radius evacuation zone of the Turkey Point Nuclear Power Plant.  The facility currently stores and uses chlorine, a regulated toxic substance under the EPA rule.  Chlorine is delivered in one-ton containers to the South District WWTP chlorine building.  The chlorine building is divided into a covered chlorine storage area and a chlorination room.  The one-ton containers contain liquid chlorine under pressure.  The chlorine building is equipped to store up to 20 (containers) tons of chlorine.

Downstream of the manifold system there is pneumatically actuated automatic shut-off valve.  The valve will also close automatically (or manually) when the chlorine sensor senses a leak.  The liquid chlorine flows through the automatic shut-valve to the evaporators.  At the evaporators the liquid chlorine is heated and converted into chlorine gas.  The gas then flows form the evaporator through the temperature actuated control valve and the vacuum regulator to the chlorinator.  The chlorinators are used to control the feed rate of the chlorine gas.  The chlorinators are equipped with a gas rotameter and a v-notched orifice for controlling the feed rate.  Injection of the chlorine into the plant water produces the concentrated solution that flows through piping to various injections points in the treatment process. \n\nThe South District WWTP is also provided with a number of safety features to protect the employees and the surrounding community.  The two important safety features are (1) automatic shut-off valves and (2)chlorine leak detection and alarm system.  The automatic shut-off valves are located immediately downstream of the chlorine containers.  Therefore, if a leak occurs anywhere in the system the chlorine source can be isolated and the flow of chlorine can be stopped.  The automatic shutoff valves are operated either automatically due to the detection of chlorine leak by the chlorine sensors or manually by pushing a switch.  Emergency shutoff switches are located inside the chlorine storage room and in the chlorinator room.\n\nThe leak detection system consists of chlorine gas sensors located in both the chlorinator room and the storage area.

Information found during the investigation is reviewed by affected staff and added or used to revise operating and maintenance procedures.\n\nFive-year accident history summary\n\nOn August 22, 2001 the South District WWTP experienced a chlorine release of 10-15 pounds.  The release was contained on site and resulted in one employee inhaling enough vapor to warrant a visit to the emergency room.  He was released from the hospital at 6 PM on the same day.  The release was caused by a breach in the evaporator vessel, after the investigation by our forces and the chlorine equipment vendor, it was determined the failure was caused by the introduction of water into the system.  This situation has been corrected through a preventative maintenance schedule that involves the tear down and inspection of the evaporator vessels on a annual basis.  The preventive maintenance has been performed as required and no indication of degradation has been noted.\n\nEmergency Response Program Summary\n\nThe South District WWTP is a first responder, plant employees respond to chlorine or digester gas accidental releases.
