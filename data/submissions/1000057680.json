LS Power operates as an electric power generation facility.  To reduce the emissions NOX from the combustion turbines, LS Power uses a 29% aqueous ammonia solution as the reductant for the selective catalytic reduction (SCR)system.  The facility has a maximum storage capacity of 33,260 gallons within 2 identical, cross connected vessels. \r\nThe regulated substance at the University Park facility, covered by 40 CFR Part 68, is 29% aqueous ammonia. The facility utilizes aquaeous ammonia as integral part of its Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) system, which consists of two storage vessels, piping and atomizing units at each ammoinia skid in order to maintain NOx emissions below CAAP Permit limits. The total system capacity of aqueous ammonia on-site is 73,000 pounds.\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\r\n\r\nAs a concerned member of the community, the company takes its role as a responsible corporate citizen very seriously. All LS Power facilities are operated to protect employees, contractors, and the public from injury and illness, and to minimize environmental impact.
