After bulk liquid separation, moisture content is further reduced by means of glycol dehydration.  Following glycol dehydration the gas stream is sent to a refrigeration skid to recover Natural Gas Liquids (NGLs).  Flowrate above the capacity of the refrigeration skid is bypassed and later mixed with treated gas.   Any liquids that are removed from the natural gas stream through a cold separator go to the NGL storage (bullet) tank and are later transported offsite via tanker trucks.  Gas leaving the refrigeration skid is metered and goes to pipeline for sales. Liquid flash from the bullet tank is taken to flare.  \r\n\r\nThe Gheens Refrigeration Facility was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances were present in the process and if they exceeded threshold quantity. All equipment and vessels are considered to be connected and/or co-located; consequently, for the purposes of the ARP Program, all equipment and vessels can be considered as part of a single process. The identification of even a single vessel exceeding threshold quantity of a regulated flammable or toxic substance would subject a process to threshold determination for offsite consequence analysis.\r\n\r\nSamson (original operator)identified one flammable liquid mixture and zero regulated toxic substances.

      "SummaryText": "ification of this exceedance indicated that the Gheens Refrigeration Facility is a covered process with a regulated substance subject to offsite consequence analysis.\r\n\r\nThis facility processes Natural Gas Liquids (NGLs) which are stored in one (1) 18,000 gallon pressurized bullet tank (91,710 lbs). The facility is subject to RMP requirements since it is a natural gas processing plant producing NGLs and contains threshold quantities of regulated substances as indicated in the following table:\r\n\r\nNatural Gas\r\n  Regulated Quantity Percent\r\n           Substance (lbs)     (>1%)\r\nEthane\t        10,000\t       4.177\t\r\nPropane\t        10,000\t      10.234\t\r\ni-Butane\t10,000\t       8.8525\t\r\nn-Butane\t10,000\t      13.291\t\r\ni-Pentane\t10,000\t      11.419\t\r\nn-Pentane\t10,000\t       8.925\t\r\nMethane         10,000         2.6726\r\n\r\nOnsite lbs = (total gallons) x (lbs/gallons)\r\nNGL lbs = 18,000 x 5.095 = 91,710 lbs  (Note: there is only one vessel onsite so the quantity refers to the quantity in the single largest vessel).\r\n\r\nSince this facility is a Program 1, a documented prevention program is NOT required.\r\n\r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nThe facility has not experienced any accidental releases that meet the criteria for an accidental release as discussed in 40 CFR 68.42 within the past five years.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY PLANNING AND RESPONSE\r\n\r\nSince this facility is a Program 1, emergency response activities have been coordinated with the Lockport Volunteer fire department as required in 40 CFR 68.12(b)(3). Further, emergency response procedures have been developed and are contained in this RMP and these procedures will be implemented in the event of an accidental release or the threat of such a release. Copies of this facility Emergency Response Plan are kept with operating personnel at the corporate office. Employees will respond to accidental releases of regulated substances and, if safe to do so, attempt to stop the source of the leak."
