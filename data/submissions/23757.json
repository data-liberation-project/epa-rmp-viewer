This facility treats the City's drinking water using Chlorine, a chemical covered by the EPA's Accidental Release Prevention and Risk Management Program.\n\nChlorine is delivered to and stored at the facility in high-pressure cylinders that contain up to 2,000 pounds of liquefied Chlorine each when they are full.  The Water Treatment Plant stores five containers (referred to as one-ton containers).  The capacity of a ton container of Chlorine is 2,000 pounds.  The tare weight of a ton container ranges from 1300 to 1650 pounds.  The gross weight of a ton container is 3300 to 3650 pounds.  Therefore, the maximum intended inventory for Chlorine handled or stored on-site is approximately 10,000 pounds.  \n\nThe facility's worst-case release scenario, as required by EPA, involves a sudden release of the entire contents of one full chlorine storage container over a time span of ten minutes.  The release would be mitigated (slowed down) by the fact that the chlorine would be released into the process building.  Based on the worst-case release scenario and using the Areal Locations of Hazardous Atmospheres air dispersion modeling program, the distance to endpoint, or the maximum threat zone for the Chlorine concentration level of concern is estimated at 1.4 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario, one that would be more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario, involves a leak through the valve opening in the container.  The release rate would be slower than the worst-case scenario, and the offsite impact area would be smaller.  Based on the worst-case release scenario and using the Areal Locations of Hazardous Atmospheres air dispersion modeling program, the distance to endpoint, or the maximum threat zone for the Chlorine concentration level of concern is estimated at 1.1 miles.\n\nThis facility is s"
