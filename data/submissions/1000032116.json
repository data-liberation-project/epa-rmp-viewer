This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\n\r\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Indian Creek Gas Plant has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in facility operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted on an as needed basis.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\r\n\r\nContractors\r\n\r\nThe Indian Creek Gas Plant uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.

HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\r\n\r\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.

All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\r\n\r\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the Indian Creek Gas Plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.

This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Crestwood Panhandle Pipeline LLC's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release. \r\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nCrestwood Panhandle Pipeline LLC owns and operates the Indian Creek Gas Plant (ICGP) in Roberts County, Texas. The facility address is 2275 Farm Road 283, Pampa, TX 79065.\r\n\r\nNatural gas is gathered from wells in the surrounding fields and sent to Indian Creek Gas Plant for processing prior to being sold for domestic consumption. This gas contains impurities in the form of water. This impurity must be brought into specification before residue companies will purchase this gas. Indian Creek Gas Plant inlet gas contains enough natural gas liquids that extraction is desirable.\r\n\r\nOne cryogenic plant is in place to remove liquids prior to sales of residue gas. This plant is capable of handling 36 MMSCFD with room for expansion.\r\n\r\nGas flow into this facility is at low pressure; approximately 260 psig. Processing and sales line pressures range from 900 to 990 psig; therefore inlet and residue gas requires boost compression. Indian Creek Gas Plant has seven (Two Low Pressure [50 psig] Inlet and five High Pressure [275 psig] Inlet/Residue) gas fired engine driven compression units that boost gas pressure up to processing pressure. Gas is treated in molecular sieve beds to remove any water that may be entrained in the gas. Cryogenic processing at very low temperatures removes v"

The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.

The program consists of procedures for responding to the release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  In addition, the facility has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties.  The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to facility processes.  The emergency response program changes are administered through the Management of Change (MOC) process,"
