The Risk Management Program and RMP meet and address the requirements of Title 40 Code of Federal Regulations Part 68.\n\nThis Executive Summary briefly describes the following elements:\n\n?    The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the stationary source;\n\n?    The stationary source and regulated substances handled; \n\n?    The general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps; \n\n?    The five-year accident history; \n\n?    The emergency response program; and\n\n?    Planned changes to improve safety.\n\n\n\nTo address concerns of an accidental release prevention and emergency response key plant and field personnel are trained in ammonia emergency response procedures and use of appropriate protective equipment.  Refresher training and emergency response drills are conducted on a periodic basis to ensure personnel are equipped, trained, prepared, and practiced in responding to ammonia emergencies.  \n\n \n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nAmick Farms recognizes management's responsibility in protecting the public, its employees, the environment, equipment and property.  The safety and health of all personnel are very important.  The control of accidents has been and will continue to be a basic responsibility of all personnel in the Hurlock, Maryland facility.\n\n\n\nTo accomplish the company's goal in controlling accidental losses, the facility has established a Plant Safety Program.  The objectives of the Plant Safety Program are to: maximize safety performance, eliminate human suffering and the economic burden resulting from injuries and accidents and reduce losses associated with damage of property.\n\n\n\nOne of the activities associated with the Plant Safety Program has been the development and implementat"

Overall, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses, environmental impact and avoid physical property damage.\n\n\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs help prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices which govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment.  These rules are detailed and improved a necessary.  They are also communicated to and accepted by all employees at the facility.\n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nThe Amick Farms Hurlock facility manufactures poultry products.  It operates an ammonia refrigeration system to provide cooling and freezing capabilities.  Since an ammonia release from the system could pose a risk of offsite public and/or environmental impact and the system regulated under the OSHA PSM standard (29 CFR 1910.119), the system is subject to the Program 3 requirements of the EPA's RM program.\n\n\n\nDescription of the Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nThe prevention program consists of the following elements:\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation: This program involves the employees in establishing and implementing the program.  Employees are also to be involved when a process hazard analysis is conducted.  The program also ensures that all employees have complete access to the program.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Inf"

The written information includes the ammonia MSDS and a description of the design of the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA): Formal studies using the What-If/Checklist Technique have been conducted to examine the system and identify potential hazards.  Any recommendations from the PHA are resolved to improve facility safety.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures: Written, detailed procedures have been developed which describe the steps which should be followed to safely operate the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\n\n\nTraining: A training program has been developed which ensures that employees are trained on all aspects of the system and on the duties which they should perform to ensure the safe operation of the ammonia.\n\n\n\nContractors: All contractors are screened and evaluated before they perform work on or near the ammonia refrigeration system.  The contractors are also periodically evaluated to ensure that they perform work by following safe work practices. \n\n\n\nPre-Startup Safety Review: A pre-startup safety review is required for all new ammonia projects to verify that all safety programs are in place, training has been performed, and construction has been completed according to design standards before the project is put into use.  A pre-startup safety review is also performed when the process safety information related to the system changes significantly.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity: This program ensures that the ammonia refrigeration systems are built and maintained using preventive maintenance procedures to minimize unexpected breakdowns or failures.\n\n\n\nHot Work Permit: These procedures ensure that a signed permit is obtained prior to any cutting, welding, or burning.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change: Procedures are designed to ensure that all changes made to the ammonia refrigeration system are properly reviewed.\n\n\n\nInci"
