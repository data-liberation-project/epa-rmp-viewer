      "SummaryText": "The Fayette County Water System Risk Management Plan (RMP) for Safe Chlorine Handling involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices to monitor potential chlorine hazards and reduce the risk of accidental chlorine releases. All applicable procedures of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Prevention Program are addressed in the plan, which seeks to provide for employee safety, public health and response agency interaction.\n\nThe Crosstown Water Treatment Plant (WTP) uses chlorine to disinfect surface water from Lake Peachtree, Lake Horton, and Lake McIntosh. The plant can process up to 13,500,000 gallons per day and is at 3500 TDK Boulevard in Peachtree City, Georgia. The Water System provides drinking water to residents in Fayette County, Peachtree City, Tyrone, Woolsey, Fayetteville and Brooks. Industrial users are primarily concentrated in the Peachtree City industrial area.\n\nChlorine is stored at the Filtration Building and injected at two locations - just prior to the filters to control biological growth in the filters and again after the filters to provide a biologically safe product. The chlorination process includes chlorine gas stored as a liquid under pressure in chlorine containers, chlorination equipment, an instrument room, electrical equipment, and process specific safety equipment. The facility is manned twenty-four hours a day.\n \nThere has not been an incident that resulted in either on-site or off-site injury, evacuation, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage at the facility.  \n\nThe Fayette County Water System's Risk Management Program includes the following key elements to mitigate the effects of potential chlorine release hazards:\n\u00bf\tOperator Training\n\u00bf\tPreventive maintenance program\n\u00bf\tProcess specific safety equipment\n\u00bf\tSafe and effective standard operating procedures\n\u00bf\tHazard review of equipment and procedures\n\u00bf\tInspection program\n\nFurther, the Water System safety pr"

The Fayette County Emergency Management Agency coordinated developed of the Fayette County High Risk Evacuation Plan to ensure that the community has a strategy for responding to and mitigating the threat posed by a release. In addition, the 2020 Fayette County Hazard Mitigation Plan includes the Fayette County water treatment plants."
