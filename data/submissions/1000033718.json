      "SummaryText": "Greenleaf CO2 Solutions, LLC (Greenleaf) will operate a CO2 plant in Hiwannee Oil Field in Wayne County, Mississippi.  Sour gas enters the plant and is processed through the plant's amine system. The facility is responsible for natural gas sweetening, dehydrating, and separation of natural gas liquids from the residue and compression. Schematics of processes in the plant are continuously updated and provided by Greenleaf. Propane, ethane, butane, iso-butane, and methane are components of the sour gas feed and they are flammable gases. Pentanes, a group of flammable liquids, are also a part of the sour gas feed. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) requires a Risk Management Plan be completed if the amount of flammable gases, such as propane, ethane, butane, iso-butane, and methane, exceeds 10,000 pounds at any given time, and also if the amount of flammable liquids, such as pentanes, exceeds 10,000 pounds at any given time. It was determined that propane, ethane, butane, iso-butane, and pentanes exceeded the EPA threshold value; therefore, a RMP summarizing risks associated with each flammable compound was necessary. Methane was not calculated to exceed 10,000 pounds(its EPA-defined threshold value) at any given time. Hydrogen sulfide is also a component of the sour gas feed and is listed in the EPA List of Regulated Chemicals and Threshold Quantities for Accidental Release Protection; however, hydrogen sulfide was calculated to be stored at less than 10,000 pounds (its threshold value), so an RMP for hydrogen sulfide was not necessary. A summary of the maximum inventory of each compound is provided in the Process Safety Information Binder. Based on the maximum quantity of propane, ethane, butane, isobutane, and pentanes stored on-site, the CO2 plant system run by Greenleaf at Hiwannee Oil Field is subject to the RMP Program 3 Prevention requirements under 40 CFR Section 68."
