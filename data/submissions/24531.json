Executive Summary\n\nThe Potlatch Corporation is committed to operating in a manner that is safe for Potlatch employees, the public, and the environment.  As part of this commitment, the Idaho Pulp and Paper facility in Lewiston, Idaho, has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at its facility.  One component of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the Lewiston Mill and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency\u00bfs (EPA\u00bfs) regulation 40 CFR Part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMPlan) describing the risk management program at Potlatch's Idaho Pulp and Paperboard facility.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMPlan requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at the Lewiston Mill.\n\nThe risk management program at the Lewiston Mill consists of three elements:\n\n1. a hazard assessment to help understand (a) the potential offsite consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and (b) accidents that have occurred during the last five years associated with the use of substances regulated by the RMP rule (regulated substances) - see topics 1.3 and 1.6\n\n2. a prevention program to help maintain and safely operate the processes containing more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance (covered processes) - see topic 1.4\n\n3. an emergency response program to help respond to accidental releases of regulated substances from covered processes - see topic 1.7\n\nInformation further describing these elements is provided in this RMPlan.\n\nAlthough the risk management program at the Potlatch Corporation helps provide assurance that the facility is maintained and operated in a safe manner, it is only one component of the safety program at the mill.

Industry and government standards are closely adhered to in the design, construction, and operation of the equipment.\n\nThe Lewiston Mill limits damage from a release, if such a release occurs.  Potlatch Corporation trains workers to respond to an accidental release, reducing the consequences of a release if it occurs.  In addition, the mill\u00bfs fire department works with the City of Lewiston fire department and with the Lewiston-Nez Perce County Office of Emergency Management to help ensure that injuries and environmental damage will be minimized if a release does occur.\n\nThe safety program at the Lewiston Mill consists of a number of elements, only some of which are required by the RMP rule.

Potlatch has formed a mutual aid agreement with the City of Lewiston, Port of Wilma Fire Department, City of Clarkston, Asotin County Fire Protection District No. 1, City of Asotin, and Washington State University.  Response activities have also been discussed with the Lewiston-Nez Perce County Office of Emergency Management.\n\nIn order to effectively implement these policies, the Lewiston Mill established a management system headed by the Environmental Manager to oversee RMP-related activities.\n\n1.2  Facility Information and Regulated Substances\n\nPotlatch Corporation's  Idaho Pulp and Paperboard facility operates an integrated bleached kraft mill that employs approximately 759 full-time workers.  The mill produces approximately 1,450 tons per day of bleached kraft pulp and operates two coated paperboard machine.

The alternative release scenario for chlorine dioxide is the rupture of a 3\u00bf chlorine dioxide solution (1 wt%) transfer line from the storage tank to a bleach plant mixer.  This scenario assumes that the solution is pumped through a severed line at 230 gallons per minute, and workers require 20 minutes to detect the release and stop the transfer pumps.  The released chlorine dioxide solution forms a pool and the chlorine dioxide evaporates from the pool, forming a vapor cloud.  The maximum distance to the toxic endpoint is 0.90 mile.  The U. S. Census indicates that 2,000 people live within this distance from the mill. There are environmental receptors within this distance.\n \n1.4  Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-specific Prevention Steps\n \nSince its inception in 1951, the Lewiston Mill has used a prevention program to help prevent accidental releases of hazardous substances.  Beginning in 1992, the mill formalized this prevention program for both the Chlorine Unloading and Transfer and the Chlorine Dioxide Generation, Storage, and Transfer processes to comply with the 14 elements of the OSHA process safety management (PSM) prevention program.

The Lewiston Mill performs and periodically updates process hazard analyses (PHAs) of the covered processes to help identify process hazards and generate recommendations that might improve the safe operation of the process.  A team composed of personnel with engineering and process operating experience and a leader with process hazard analyses experience is assembled to analyze the hazards of the process.  The Lewiston Mill primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) technique to perform this analysis.  The PHA team prepares a written report describing the results of the analysis, including a list of recommendations.  Responsibility to resolve the recommendations is assigned to mill personnel and, when appropriate, changes to enhance the safety of the process are implemented.\n\n3. Operating Procedures.  Potlatch Corporation engineers, operators, and supervisors work together to develop and maintain operating procedures to define how tasks related to process operations should be safely performed.  The operating procedures (1) are used to train employees, and (2) serve as reference guides for appropriate actions to take during both normal operations and process upsets.

The Lewiston Mill maintains the mechanical integrity of process equipment to help prevent equipment failures that could endanger workers, the public, or the environment.  The mechanical integrity program includes (1) an inspection and testing program to help identify equipment deterioration and damage before the equipment fails and (2) a quality assurance program to help ensure that new and replacement equipment meet the design standards required for service in mill processes.  The mechanical integrity program includes:\n\n* specifications for inspection and testing of process equipment\n* specifications for replacement parts and equipment\n*  procedures for inspecting, testing, and maintaining process equipment\n*  procedures for safe work practices such as lockout/tagout, hot work, confined space entry, and line or equipment opening\n*  training of maintenance personnel\n* documentation of maintenance activities\n\n6. Management of Change.  The Potlatch management of change program evaluates and approves all proposed changes to chemicals, equipment, and procedures for a covered process to help ensure that the change does not negatively affect safe operations.  Process changes that are determined to be a replacement in kind (e.g., replacing a valve with an identical valve) are allowed without completing a full management of change program.  All other changes must be confirmed through the full management of change program to help ensure that inadvertent consequences of process changes are prevented, safety consequences of changes are addressed, affected process safety information and procedures are updated, and affected employees are notified of the changes.\n\n7.

Compliance Audit.  The Lewiston Mill audits covered processes to be certain that the prevention program is effectively addressing the safety issues of Potlatch operations.  The mill assembles an audit team that includes personnel knowledgeable in the RMP rule and in the process, and this team evaluates whether the prevention program satisfies the requirements of the RMP rule and whether the prevention program is sufficient to help ensure safe operation of the process.  The results of the audit are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate enhancements to the prevention program are implemented.\n\n9. Incident Investigation.  The Lewiston Mill investigates all incidents that could reasonably have resulted in a serious injury to personnel, the public, or the environment so that similar accidents can be prevented.  The mill trains employees to identify and report any incident requiring investigation.  An investigation team is assembled, and the investigation is initiated within 48 hours of the incident.  The results of the investigation are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate process enhancements are implemented.\n\n10. Employee Participation.

Employees are consulted on and informed about all aspects of the RMP rule prevention program, including PHAs, employee training, and operating procedures.\n\n11. Hot Work Permits.  The Lewiston Mill established a hot work permit program to control spark- or flame-producing activities that could result in fires or explosions in covered processes at the mill.  Potlatch Corporation reviewed OSHA\u00bfs fire prevention and protection requirements in 29 CFR 1910.252(a) and created a Hot Work Permit Form to comply with these requirements.  Personnel who are to perform hot work are required to fill out the Hot Work Permit Form.  The Shift Supervisor reviews the completed form before work can begin.  Training in the use of the Hot Work Permit Form is included in the Lewiston Mill\u00bfs safe work practices orientation.\n\n12. Contractors.  The Lewiston Mill established a program to help ensure that contractor activities at the mill are performed in a safe manner.  The program reviews the safety record of all contractors to help ensure that Potlatch only hires contractors who can safely perform the desired job tasks.  The Lewiston Mill trains the contract supervisors in the hazards of the process on which they and their employees will work, Lewiston Mill safe work practices, and mill emergency response procedures.  The mill requires that the contractor supervisors train each of their employees who will work at the mill before that worker begins work at the Lewiston Mill site.  The Lewiston Mill periodically reviews contractors\u00bf training documents and work performance to help ensure that safe work practices are followed.\n\n1.5  Chemical-specific Prevention Steps\n\nIn addition to the required prevention program elements, the Potlatch Corporation has implemented safety features specific to the hazardous substances used at the Lewiston Mill.  \n\nChlorine.

Chlorine detectors and alarms are provided in areas containing chlorine.\n\nChlorine Dioxide.  Chlorine dioxide is produced at the Lewiston Mill and stored as a dilute aqueous solution to avoid the necessity of transporting large quantities of the solution.  Chlorine dioxide is produced in the chlorine dioxide generator and piped to an absorber column, where a 1 weight percent chlorine dioxide solution is generated.  Storing this substance as a solution helps to reduce the consequences of a release.  A curbed area around the storage tanks further reduces the consequences of a release.\n\n1.6  Five-Year Accident History\n\nThe Lewiston Mill is proud of its safety record with respect to the generation, storage, and use of chlorine dioxide, and the use of chlorine.  No releases of chlorine and chlorine dioxide occurred from the Lewiston Mill in the past five years that resulted in deaths, significant property damage on-site, or known deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering-in-place, property damage, or environmental damage off-site.\n\nThe Lewiston Mill\u00bfs five year accident history includes three releases of chlorine and chlorine dioxide resulting in Occupational Safety and Health Association (OSHA) recordable incidents.  The releases occurred on September 25, 1998, July 12, 2001, and September 22, 2001.  \n\nOn September 25, 1998, one contracted employee working at the mill site was treated for chlorine inhalation that resulted in no lasting physical impairment.  As a result of this incident, lockout procedures were changed and reviewed with employees.  \n\nOn July 12, 2001, piping containing chlorine dioxide failed causing one company employee to be treated for chlorine inhalation.  The exposure resulted in no lasting physical impairment to the employee.  As a result of this incident, the failed piping was analyzed and an action plan is being dr"
