Executive Summary\n\nThe Potlatch Corporation is committed to operating in a manner that is safe for Potlatch employees, the public, and the environment.  As part of this commitment, the Idaho Pulp and Paper facility in Lewiston, Idaho, has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at its facility.  One component of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the Lewiston Mill and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency?s (EPA?s) regulation 40 CFR Part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMPlan) describing the risk management program at Potlatch's Idaho Pulp and Paperboard facility.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMPlan requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at the Lewiston Mill.\n\nThe risk management program at the Lewiston Mill consists of three elements:\n\n1. a hazard assessment to help understand (a) the potential offsite consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and (b) accidents that have occurred during the last five years associated with the use of substances regulated by the RMP rule (regulated substances) - see topics 1.3 and 1.6\n\n2. a prevention program to help maintain and safely operate the processes containing more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance (covered processes) - see topic 1.4\n\n3. an emergency response program to help respond to accidental releases of regulated substances from covered processes - see topic 1.7\n\nInformation further describing these elements is provided in this RMPlan.\n\nAlthough the risk management program at the Potlatch Corporation helps provide assurance that the facility is maintained and operated in a safe manner, it is only one component of the safety program at the mill.

When a hazardous substance is used at the mill, the equipment is carefully designed, built, and operated to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release.  Industry and government standards are closely adhered to in the design, construction, and operation of the equipment.\n\nThe Lewiston Mill limits damage from a release, if such a release occurs.  Potlatch Corporation trains workers to respond to an accidental release, reducing the consequences of a release if it occurs.  In addition, the mill?s fire department works with the City of Lewiston fire department and with the Lewiston-Nez Perce County Office of Emergency Management to help ensure that injuries and environmental damage will be minimized if a release does occur.\n\nThe safety program at the Lewiston Mill consists of a number of elements, only some of which are required by the RMP rule.

Potlatch has formed a mutual aid agreement with the City of Lewiston, Port of Wilma Fire Department, City of Clarkston, Asotin County Fire Protection District No. 1, City of Asotin, and Washington State University.  Response activities have also been discussed with the Lewiston-Nez Perce County Office of Emergency Management.\n\nIn order to effectively implement these policies, the Lewiston Mill established a management system headed by the Environmental Manager to oversee RMP-related activities.\n\n1.2  Facility Information and Regulated Substances\n\nPotlatch Corporation's  Idaho Pulp and Paperboard facility operates an integrated bleached kraft mill that employs approximately 759 full-time workers.  The mill produces approximately 1,450 tons per day of bleached kraft pulp and operates two coated paperboard machine.  The mill also supplies bleached kraft pulp to Potlatch?s Consumer Products Division, which manufactures tissue and towel products.

The offsite consequence analysis consists of evaluating both worst-case release scenarios and alternative release scenarios.  Potlatch Corporation does not expect a worst-case release scenario to ever occur.  The alternative release scenarios were selected to help the Lewiston-Nez Perce County Office of Emergency Management improve the community emergency response plan.  An alternative release scenario represents a release that (1) might occur at a facility like the Lewiston Mill and (2) would result in the greatest potential offsite consequences if the release occurred.\n\nThe RMP rule includes specific requirements for the worst-case and alternative release scenarios that must be reported by the Lewiston Mill.  These requirements are:\n\n* one worst-case and one alternative release scenario for chlorine, and\n*  one alternative release scenario for chlorine dioxide.\n \n The following information summarizes the offsite consequence analysis performed by the Lewiston Mill.\n \n 1.3.1  Chlorine Unloading and Transfer\n \nThe worst case release scenario for toxic substances is the rupture of a 90-ton chlorine rail car.  The maximum distance to the toxic endpoint concentration is 7.7 miles.  The U. S. Census indicates that 51,000 people live within this distance from the mill.  Several public receptors are located within this distance (e.g., the Snake River, part of the Nez Perce Reservation, the City of Lewiston, and part of the City of Clarkston).  Environmental receptors such as Hells Gate State Park and Nez Perce National Historical Park, are also located within this distance.\n \nThe alternative release scenario for chlorine is the rupture of a 2? chlorine transfer line to the bleach plant mixers.  This scenario assumes that the release occurs outside a building and that workers require 20 minutes to detect and stop the leak.  The maximum distance to the toxic endpoint is 2.3 miles.  The U. S.

There are environmental receptors within this distance.\n \n1.3.2  Chlorine Dioxide Generation, Storage, and Transfer\n \nNo worst-case scenario is reported for chlorine dioxide because the effects of the chlorine worst-case scenario exceed those of the worst-case scenario for an accidental release of chlorine dioxide.  The alternative release scenario for chlorine dioxide is the rupture of a 3? chlorine dioxide solution (1 wt%) transfer line from the storage tank to a bleach plant mixer.  This scenario assumes that the solution is pumped through a severed line at 230 gallons per minute, and workers require 20 minutes to detect the release and stop the transfer pumps.  The released chlorine dioxide solution forms a pool and the chlorine dioxide evaporates from the pool, forming a vapor cloud.  The maximum distance to the toxic endpoint is 0.90 mile.  The U. S. Census indicates that 2,000 people live within this distance from the mill. There are environmental receptors within this distance.\n \n1.4  Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-specific Prevention Steps\n \nSince its inception in 1951, the Lewiston Mill has used a prevention program to help prevent accidental releases of hazardous substances.  Beginning in 1992, the mill formalized this prevention program for both the Chlorine Unloading and Transfer and the Chlorine Dioxide Generation, Storage, and Transfer processes to comply with the 14 elements of the OSHA process safety management (PSM) prevention program.  In 1996, the EPA RMP rule established similar requirements for Program 3 processes.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the Lewiston Mill?s Program 3 prevention program that address the EPA RMP rule prevention program requirements.\n \n1.

The Lewiston Mill performs and periodically updates process hazard analyses (PHAs) of the covered processes to help identify process hazards and generate recommendations that might improve the safe operation of the process.  A team composed of personnel with engineering and process operating experience and a leader with process hazard analyses experience is assembled to analyze the hazards of the process.  The Lewiston Mill primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) technique to perform this analysis.  The PHA team prepares a written report describing the results of the analysis, including a list of recommendations.  Responsibility to resolve the recommendations is assigned to mill personnel and, when appropriate, changes to enhance the safety of the process are implemented.\n\n3. Operating Procedures.  Potlatch Corporation engineers, operators, and supervisors work together to develop and maintain operating procedures to define how tasks related to process operations should be safely performed.  The operating procedures (1) are used to train employees, and (2) serve as reference guides for appropriate actions to take during both normal operations and process upsets.  Lewiston Mill employees develop and maintain operating procedures that cover all phases of operations, including initial startup, normal operations, normal shutdown, emergency shutdown, startup following a turnaround or emergency shutdown, and temporary operations.\n\n4. Training.  Potlatch Corporation trains workers to safely and effectively perform their assigned tasks.  The Lewiston Mill training program includes both initial and refresher training that covers (1) a general overview of the process, (2) the properties and hazards of the substances in the process, and (3) a detailed review of the process operating procedures and safe work practices.
