The  owners,  management,  and  employees  of Western Wisconsin Ag Supply  are              committed  to  the  prevention  of  any  accidental  releases  of  anhydrous  ammonia.  If  an  accidental       release  should  occur,  the  facility  is  prepared  to  work  with  the  local  fire  company,  or  other authorities,  to  mitigate  any  release  and  minimize  the  impact  of  the  release  to  people  and  the environment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     2.)     The  primary  activity  at  the  facility  is  the  storage  and  blending  of  fertilizers  for  sale  to  farmers.  Anhydrous  ammonia  is  received,  stored,  and  distributed  to  farmers  for  application.  The  maximum  quantity  handled  would  be  the  unloading  of  a  semi  tanker  holding  40,000  pounds.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            3.)    - The  worst - case  scenario  would  be  the  release  of  the  total  contents  of  a  storage  tank  released  as  a  gas  over  10  minutes.  The  maximum  quantity  released  would  be  54,718  pounds,  which  represents  the  volume  of  the  largest  storage  tank  at  85  percent  capacity  as  limited  by  design  standards.  The  distance  to  the  endpoint  is  .74  miles. .
