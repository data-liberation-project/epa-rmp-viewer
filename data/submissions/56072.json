To assist with ongoing compliance, a Chemical Accident Prevention Compliance Manual along with a Operations and Maintenance Manual have been prepared and implemented.  Concerning the emergency response policy at the facility, the owner has made the decision that employees will not respond to accidental releases of regulated substances and will instead evacuate.\n\nThis facility is a waste water treatment plant.  Treatment includes chlorination of the waste water with three chlorine cylinders located at the facility (2,000 lbs each).  Treatment also includes de-chlorination via the addition of sulfur dioxide with two sulfur dioxide cylinders located at the facility (2,000 lbs each).  The process basically involves continuous mixing of chlorine with the waste water whereby the final mixture contains less than 1 % chlorine by weight.  This mixture is then routed to a contact chamber and sulfur dioxide is added whereby the final mixture is less than 1 % by weight of sulfur dioxide.  The treated waste water is then released.  The storage cylinders and mixing equipment are subject to the RMP requirements since it contains threshold quantities of regulated substances: chlorine capacity on site is 6,000 pounds and sulfur dioxide capacity is 4,000 pounds.\n\nThis facility has two applicable worst case release scenarios. Scenario #1 involves the release of all substances contained in the single largest chlorine container when full (2,000 pounds total). The distance to endpoint for this scenario is 3.0 miles. Scenario #2 involves the release of all substances contained in the single largest sulfur dioxide container when full (2,000 pounds total). The distance to endpoint for this scenario is 3.1 miles.\n\nThe worst case release scenarios use the maximum capacity of the single largest vessel without"

This program is discussed in a Chemical Accident Prevention Compliance Manual along with a Operations and Maintenance Manual prepared for the facility.  The prevention program does discuss chlorine and sulfur dioxide which are contained in amounts above the threshold quantity.   \n\nThe facility has not experienced a release as defined in the regulation within the past five years.  \n\nSince this facility is a Program 2, a written emergency response program is required.  This program is contained in Section 5.0 of the Chemical Accident Prevention Compliance Manual prepared for the facility.  Further, emergency response procedures have been developed and are contained at the front of this RMP and these procedures will be implemented in the event of an accidental release or the threat of such a release.  Basically, the instructions are to evacuate the facility and then notify the proper authorities.\n\nAt present time, there are no planned changes to improve safety."
