Alta Dean Dairy's 250,000 sq. ft. plant has fully automated dairy processing and product handling systems.  \n\n\n\nAlta Dena Dairy's senior management is not only committed to offer superior service, but also maintain a safety and environmental program to promote a safe environment for all its employees and the surrounding communities.  Alta Dena Dairy maintains a safety committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  Alta Dena Dairy has an Emergency Action Plan (Plan) in effect, which is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the PSM document maintained at the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This Plan will be reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate any facility changes.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system at the facility was built in 1997.  The facility is located at 17851 East Railroad Street, City of Industry, California, which is just north of Highway 60 and approximately 5 miles east of Highway 57.  The area immediately surrounding the facility is urban.  The system and the facility were constructed in accordance with the most recently adopted Uniform Fire and Mechanical Codes. \n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system uses 13,520 pounds of ammonia for the following three main purposes: To provide cooling for 1) dairy processing, 2) warehouse cold storage, and 3) HVA"

With the exception of the condensers and the diffusion box (including associated piping), the entire ammonia system is located inside the engine room.\n\n\n\nThe refrigeration cycle begins with the transfer of ammonia from the thermosyphon receiver to the high pressure receiver.  The thermosyphon receiver also supplies ammonia to the compressors for oil cooling.  From the high pressure receiver, high pressure liquid ammonia is transferred to three accumulators (AC-1, AC-2 & AC-3) and Cooler 5 Surge Drum that maintain ammonia at different temperatures.  As the ammonia enters each accumulator/surge drum, it is expanded through a hand expansion valve, reducing the temperature and the pressure.  Each accumulator/surge drum supplies liquid ammonia to a distinct heat exchanger which provides cooling for one of the three purposes listed above, vaporizing the ammonia.  The heat exchangers are located in the engine room and use a secondary fluid (glycol) to provide the required cooling throughout the facility.\n\n\n\nThe vapor is returned to each accumulator/surge drum in which constant pressures are maintained by back pressure regulating valves.  The vapor from two of the accumulators (AC-1 & AC-2) and Cooler 5 Surge Drum is then pulled by the compressors (6) where the pressure and temperature of the gas is increased.  Suction from the other accumulator (AC-3) is drawn to the Suction Accumulator (AC-4).  Designated compressor(s) pull high side suction from AC-4, while any residual liquid is sent back to the High Pressure Receiver via the liquid transfer unit.  Upon reaching a level set point in the transfer unit, hot gas discharge from the compressors pressurizes the vessel and the liquid is then returned to the high pressure receiver.  Compressor discharge (high pressure ammonia vapor, or hot gas) is sent to the four condensers where it is condensed to a high pressure liquid and returned to the thermosyphon receiver.  An"

The system also has a diffusion box (for equalizing pressure between vessels in the system), and a dilution tank (into which the relief header vents), which is kept full of water.  \n\n \n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nThe Alta Dena Dairy facility was designed and constructed in accordance with the 1994 Uniform Mechanical Code which specifically outlines requirements for the safe operation of ammonia refrigeration systems.  These safety features include a water diffusion tank, ammonia sensors in the engine room, and automatic shut down systems.  In addition, all of the ammonia is located inside the engine room or on the engine room roof (condensers).  The facility uses a heat transfer medium to provide cooling throughout the plant.\n\n\n\nAlta Dena Dairy's ammonia refrigeration system has many safety features.  Much of the safety associated with the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system.  For example, the facility operates in accordance with OSHA's Process Safety Management, California OSHA, EPA Risk Management and CalARP regulations.\n\n\n\nDETECTION AND MONITORING: There is one ammonia sensor placed in a strategic location in the engine room.  In the event of ammonia detection, a facility alarm sounds, a visible alarm is triggered, and the facility off-site alarm company is notified. The alarm company pages the duty operator via a pager, which prompts the operator to call into the alarm company for further information.  If necessary, the operator will contact the fire department.  In addition, Alta Dena Dairy's personnel circulate throughout the plant, taking note of unusual conditions in any portion of the system.  If a leak is detected or observed by any Alta Dena Dairy employee (or contractor), it is immediately reported to the plant management and "

Action is promptly taken to mitigate the leak so normal operations can resume.\n\n\n\nOther safety features of the ammonia refrigeration system include: emergency shut down buttons, located outside the engine room, that kill power to the engine room equipment (one inside the boiler room and one outside the man door to the outside of the facility). The system can also be shut down electronically by the computer system. There are also relief valves on all pressure vessels and continuous ventilation in the engine room to prevent ammonia explosions.\n\n\n\nIn addition to the Uniform Mechanical Code, the facility operates in accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines.  In particular, the IIAR Bulletin 110, \"Startup, Inspection, and Maintenance of Ammonia Refrigeration Systems\".\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nAn investigation into the Dean Foods' facility accident history during the Process Hazard Analysis Revalidation (February 25, 2014), revealed that there have been no releases of ammonia over the past five years.  Further there has not been an accident since the facility was built.  \n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe Alta Dena Dairy facility has adopted emergency response procedures and policies.  The Emergency Action Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the PSM/RMP document, which is maintained at the facility.

The Alta Dena Dairy safety committee is planning to complete several items, including the recommendations, over the next year, as a continual effort to provide a safe work environment for their employees.
