The plant is located on the east side of the Miami River. As a city department,  the Wastewater Treatment Plant is part of the city's Emergecy Preparedness Plan.  This plan which was written in 1985 and upgraded in 2012 is a comprehensive document which outlines the City's role and procedures for handling all levels of emergencies that might impact residence of the City or surrounding communities.  Presently this emergency preparedness plan is updated annually.\r\n\r\nESF-10 of the city's Emergency Response Plan contains the individual unit plans for the departments within the City of Piqua Utilities Department.  Specifically, Appendix 6 deals with Emergency Operation Plan for the Wastwater Plant which operates as a subunit of the Utilities Department.  As stated in the City's Emergency Preparedness Plan, up to 3 one ton cylnders of chlorine may be stored on site at any given time but only one cylinder is actually in use at any given time.  The physical state of the chorine can best be described as chlorine gas liquefied by pressure.\r\n\r\n\r\nTOXIC WORST POSSIBLE SCENARIO\r\nIn the development of the worst possible scenario accident it is assumed that a 2000 pound tank of chlorine would rupture and discharge the total contents to atmosphere.  Although the likelihood of this occuring would be unlikely, it is possible that a structural failure of the tank itself could possibly cause and event like this to occur.  Of  course, there is even the more remote possibility that a natural disaster such as a tornado could cause all of the tanks of chlorine that are in storage to be destroyed thus the potential for a release of up to 6000 pounds could be possible.  However, the worst possible scenario for the purposes of this document is to be calculated on a release"

In fact, experience has show us that in the accident of 6-20-98 this was the case and the discharge that resulted was in the form of chlorine gas.  The calculaions for the Toxic Alternate Release Scenario was based on this type of failure.  RMP Comp was used to calculate the endpoints for both this and the Toxic Worst Case.\r\n\r\nThe Piqua Waste Water Treatment Facility is located in an Urban Area in the City of Piqua, Ohio.  Many Trees, residences and businesses fall well with a 1/2 mile radius of the facility.  During the normal operation hours of 7am to 3pm Monday thru Friday the facillity is fully staffed.  However, during the following hours only one empoyee is on duty: 3pm to 11pm seven days a week, 11pm to 7 am seven days per week, 7am to 3pm on Sunday.

This procedure cn be found in Sectin ESF-10 Appendix 6 of the plan and reads as follows:\r\nCHLORINE LEAK\r\nAll operators are instructed not to change chlorine cylinders alone.  They are trained in detecting small leaks that may occur during a routine cylinder change.  In the event of a major leak (i.e. ruptured line, cylinder, or broken valve) the following procedures should be followed:\r\n\r\n1.  Evacuate Chlorine Building area Immediately.  Stay upwind.\r\n\r\n2.  Contact Central Dispatch (911)\r\n\r\n3.  DO NOT attempt to repair the leak alone.\r\n\r\n4.  A \"Chlorine Emergency Kit B\" for ton cylinders is located at the Piqua Fire Department.\r\n\r\n5.  Depending on wind velocity and direction certain areas around the plant may need to be evacuated.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the above procedures it is understood that the OHIO EPA would be notified in the event of a major release of contaminants to the air, land, or water.\r\n\r\n5 YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY DESCRIPTION\r\nThere were no accidents in the last five (5) years.  However, on 4-27-12 a high chlorine alarm went off and the fire department was sent to the plant to investigate. The Operator on duty smelled Chlorine at the building and saw the detector at .4PPM, buy the time the Fire department arrived on scene the reading was at .3PPM below the .4 PPM alarm level. All equipment was tested for proper working order and Leaks and none were found. All equipment was returned back into service and no further issues arose. Consequently, we did not report this as an accident involving a failure or Human error, but we felt we should address it in the executive summary."
