It is the policy of the Wastewater Treatment Division to provide its employees with a safe and healthful work environment and to conduct its operations in such a manner as to have minimal impact on the environment and the surrounding community. Every effort has been made to provide the greatest degree of safety possible for City employees and the citizens of Iowa City. This document addresses all required elements of the pertinent OSHA standard and EPA regulations. Wastewater Treatment Division employees, representatives of emergency response organizations, and the people of Iowa City will be provided full access to our Process Safety Program and Risk Management plan.\n\n\n* Primary activities\n \nThe Wastewater Treatment Division's mission is to provide primary and secondary treatment of Iowa City wastewater. This is partly accomplished through the use of  liquified, pressurized chlorine gas as a sewage disinfectant, and  the use of sulfur dioxide as a de-chlorination agent to reduce the chlorine toxicity of the treated effluent. Ton containers of chlorine and sulfur dioxide gas are stored in inside the Chemical Buildings at the North wastewater treatment facility, located at 1000 S. Clinton Street in Iowa City, and the South treatment facility, at 4366 Napolean Street, SE. Chlorine and sulfur dioxide are delivered to the wastewater stream through a system of chlorinators, sulfonators, and evaporators, and associated piping. The maximum amount of chlorine and sulfur dioxide in storage at both wastewater treatment plants is 8,000 pounds. Only a single container each of chlorine and sulfur dioxi"

This process reduces the volume of sewage, and at the same time produces potentially flammable methane/sewage gas. The gas accumulates in the digester tanks and is used in heating the digester buildings, or is periodically vented to a waste gas burner. The amount of methane generated by this process is less than the 10,000 pound minimum amount specified by the EPA, and was therefore not included in the development of any worst-or alternate-case scenarios.\n\n\n* General accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps in place at the City of Iowa City Wastewater Treatment Division\n\nThe City of Iowa City Wastewater Treatment Division has in place a preventive maintenance program covering all components of the chlorination/dechloriation systems.  The preventive maintenance program is intended to ensure the continued integrity of process equipment and to minimize the risk of a catastrophic chlorine or sulfur dioxide release.  The preventive maintenance program requires regular inspection and testing of chlorination and de-chlorination equipment by operations and maintenance personnel. The Wastewater Treatment Division also has in place an employee education and training program that encompasses all necessary training in safe operations and maintenance of the wastewater treatment process. All affected personnel receive training at the time of their initial assignment, and whenever there is a process modification, alteration of operating procedures, or change in job duties. It is the belief of the Wastewater Treatment Division that compliance audits are needed to evaluate the effectiveness of the process safety and risk management programs. It is the policy of Wastewater Treatment Division that audits should be conducted at regular intervals by a multi-disciplinary employee-management team"

      "SummaryText": ". This team should review the entire Process Safety Management program for its effectiveness and applicability, and make recommendations for changes and revisions, as necessary.\n\n\n* Five-year accident history\n\nThere have been no chlorine or sulfur dioxide releases at the Iowa City North or South treatment plants which resulted in death or injury to Wastewater Treatment Division personnel or the general public, or significant property or environmental damage on- or off-site during the five year period immediately preceding the date of this report.\n\n\n* Worst-case release and alternate-case scenarios\n\nIn the worst-case scenario, a ton container of chlorine gas ruptures, and releases approximately 2000 pounds of Cl2 gas to the atmosphere.  The contents of the container are expected to be released within ten minutes over urban terrain. The distance to the toxic endpoint for the worst case scenario was covers an approximately 1.3 mile radius from the North or South Plants. The radius was calculated under conditions of category F (most stable) atmospheric stability, and wind speed of 1.5 meters per second, as determined by the RMP COMP modeling program. In the alternate case for a chlorine or sulfur dioxide gas release, failure of a check value inside the Chemical Building results in approximately 0.30 pounds of chlorine or sulfur dioxide released in 10 minutes. The distance to the toxic endpoint for these scenarios, as determined by the RMP COMP program, is <0.1 miles, using category D (neutral) atmospheric conditions, wind speed of 3 meters per second, and urban terrain. \n\n\n* Emergency response program\n \nThe Wastewater Treatment Division has adopted an emergency response and action plan to deal with both major and minor chlorine and sulfur dioxide releases. The scope of the Wastewater Treatment Division's emergency response and action plan includes both minor chlorine and sulfur dioxide releases controllable by Wastewater Treatment Division staff and contained within the"

All Wastewater Treatment Division personnel receive initial training in emergency response and evacuation procedures, and undergo refresher training at least once every three years thereafter. Emergency response will be coordinated with the Iowa City Fire and Police Departments, Johnson County Disaster Services, Johnson County Hazardous Materials Response, and local area hospitals.  The Iowa City Fire Department has responsibility for emergency rescue and initial medical response during a chlorine or sulfur dioxide emergency; the 24-hour emergency response telephone number is 9-911.  Notification of residences and neighboring facilities will be the responsibility of Iowa City Police Department and Johnson County Disaster Services. Decontamination and clean up efforts will be coordinated with the Johnson County Hazardous Materials Response Team. Wastewater treatment personnel will also offer technical assistance to emergency responders.\n\n\n* Planned changes to improve safety\n\nThe Wastewater Treatment Division is committed to improving the quality of employee training and education programs, including training in the safe use of chlorine and emergency response.  These programs are to be evaluated at regular intervals and updated and revised as necessary. Employee training will be documented to the fullest extent possible. Wastewater Treatment Division personnel will continue to participate in drills and cooperative training with emergency responders in the local area. \nThe chlorination and de-chlorination systems preventive maintenance programs will also be evaluated, and if unsatisfactory conditions are noted or recommendations for corrective action are made, these conditions or recommendations will be promptly addressed and any outstanding problems will be resolved in a timely manner."
