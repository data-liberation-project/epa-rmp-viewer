GLEICKE (HEG) TRUST UPLAND AEROSOL FACILITY\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nHEG Trust has established a Risk Management Plan in accordance with EPA's (40 CFR Part 68) and California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) regulations for the A-70 Charging System at its Upland facility to enhance its already existing safety programs.  HEG Trust is extremely cautious in the handling of all chemicals and is very diligent about safety for its employees and its communities.  HEG Trust staff is highly trained and utilizes modern equipment to provide safeguards.  The A-70 Charging System, that contains the regulated substance A-70, is used to inject A-70 as a propellant into aerosol containers.  \n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nHEG Trust policy is to conduct all operations in a safe and conscientious manner to prevent accidental releases of any hazardous material, including substances regulated through the Federal Accidental Release Prevention Program and OSHA PSM.  HEG Trust trains its employees to properly handle and store hazardous materials to minimize the possibility of adversely affecting its worker's health, the workplace, the public, and the environment.  HEG Trust Accidental Release Prevention policy is implemented through the management system contained in its RMP.\n\nIn the event of an emergency, the HEG Trust Upland Aerosol Facility will contact the Upland Fire Department to respond.  A designated emergency contact for the plant initiates emergency notifications.  All employees are trained in the proper procedures and their appropriate role in an emergency.  \n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\nThe A-70 Charging System at the HEG Trust Upland Aerosol Facility uses A-70 as a propellant for spray paint containers.  A-70 is stored within the facility and is push through a pump to either one of two charging stations.  Each charging station contains four injection points that automatically deliver the appr"

      "SummaryText": "opriate volume of A-70 into the aerosol containers.  \n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nHEG Trust has implemented a Process Safety Management (PSM) program to manage the safety aspects of the A-70 Charging System.  In addition, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed.  The program includes strict requirements for written operating procedures, personnel training, contractor safety, equipment maintenance, incident investigation, process hazard analysis, management of change and periodic review or audit of program elements.  Management of change element addresses proper implementation of system updates to ensure that all changes are reviewed properly by knowledgeable persons, all engineering documents and operating procedures reflect the change, and personnel are trained on the change.   Process Safety Management also requires a pre-startup safety review to ensure that the system is properly reviewed before it is put back into service after a major change.\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nThe five-year accident history (December 2005 to December 2010) for the HEG Trust Upland Aerosol Facility reveals that there were no reportable accidents during this period.\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSeveral process and management system improvements are being considered and implemented as a result of the technical studies done in the course of the development of the PSM and RMP Programs.  \n"
