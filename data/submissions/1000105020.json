As part of its air pollution control technology, CBE uses Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR).\n\nThe SCR process removes nitrogen oxides from exhaust gases produced during combustion of fossil fuels in the gas turbines when generating electricity.  The SCR process introduces aqueous ammonia into the exhaust gas stream and then passes the mixture through a catalyst bed.  The resultant chemical reaction generates nitrogen gas and water as the reduced end products, which in turn are released to the atmosphere via the plant\u0092s exhaust stacks.\n\n\n(c)\tThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps;\n\nCBE stores the Aqueous Ammonia on site as a 29.5 percent solution in a 21,282 gallon tank, which is administratively limited to 13,000 gallons.  The quantity of Aqueous Ammonia stored exceeds the EPA regulated threshold quantity for accidental release prevention.  Therefore, CBE is subject to EPA\u0092s Risk Management Program (RMP).\n\nThe goal of the RMP is:  1) to prevent accidental releases of substances that can cause serious harm to the public and the environment form short-term exposures; and 2) to mitigate the severity of releases that may occur.\n\nCovered facilities, such as CBE, must develop and implement a RMP.  The RMP must include an \nanalysis of the potential off-site consequences of a regulated substance accidental release, a release prevention program, and an emergency response program.  Covered facilities also must submit to the EPA a summary of their Risk Management Program, which also will be made available to other federal, state, and government agencies as well as the public.\n\n\nAs required, CBE performed an off-site consequence analysis that included a worst-case and \nalternative accident scenario of its regulated substance, aqueous ammonia.

The accident analyses followed the steps detailed in the EPA guidance document \u0093Risk Management Program Guidance for Off-Site Consequence Analysis\u0094, March 2009.
