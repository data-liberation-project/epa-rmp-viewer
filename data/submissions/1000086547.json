The Mapleton facility is a non-responding facility for releases of the RMP-listed chemicals, so the site utilizes an Emergency Action Plan. The Mapleton facility coordinates with Timber Hollis Fire Department and the Peoria County Emergency Planning Coordinator, so these responding agencies can provide additional emergency response resources.\n\n\n\n<> The stationary source and regulated substances handled [40 CFR 68.155(b)]:\n\n-Stationary Source:\n\nThe Mapleton facility's primary activities are the manufacture and distribution of aluminum alkyls. \n\n\n\n-Regulated Substances Handled & Covered Process:\n\nThe LANXESS Mapleton facility uses two chemicals that are subject to reporting under this filing to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Both chemicals are necessary to manufacture aluminum alkyls. \n\n\n\nThe two (2) regulated substances present at the Mapleton site are ethylene and ethyl chloride. Ethylene is delivered to the plant by tank trucks as cryogenic liquid. Ethylene is liquefied by pressure and stored in a double walled vertical tank. Ethyl chloride is also delivered by tank trucks and stored under pressure. \n\n\n\n<> The general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps [40 CFR 68.155(c)]:\n\nThe Mapleton facility has implemented the Program Level 3 prevention program requirements under t"

These items, their specific requirements, and how the LANXESS Mapleton facility complies with the requirements are addressed in the individual procedural documents.\n\n\n\n<> The five-year accident history [40 CFR 68.155(d)]:\n\nThe LANXESS Mapleton facility has had zero RMP reportable incidents in the previous five years.\n\n\n\n<> The emergency response program [40 CFR 68.155(e)]:\n\nThe Mapleton Metal Organics Plant has developed a written emergency action plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials. The Emergency Action Plan that includes specific actions to be taken in the event of an accidental release, procedures for informing the public and local agencies, and information on emergency health care. Peoria County is the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) with which the emergency plan has been coordinated and verified, primarily through the county Emergency Coordinator.\n\n\n\n<> Planned changes to improve safety [40 CFR 68.155(f)]:\n\nThe Mapleton Metal Organics Plant is committed to improving the safety systems. The Mapleton facility continuously updates operating and maintenance procedures, replaces and/or maintains equipment to original - or higher - specifications and/or design codes, and develops and implements both capital and expense projects to improve both plant automation and EHS performance. Such improvements are part of Mapleton's continuous improvement efforts at the site.\n\n"
