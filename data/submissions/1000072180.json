Among other things, these standards may require employees to wear appropriate protection, adhere to all Company safety and hazardous material policies and practices including emergency response and require Agri-Mark/Cabot to provide proper training and supervision. We expect all directors, officers, employees, consultants, contractors, or visitors, to comply with all safety requirements.\n\n\n\nAgri-Mark/Cabot constantly strives to improve its safety program to reduce risks and eliminate and/or minimize potential injuries, accidents and releases. Agri-Mark/Cabot's goal is to train employees to recognize unsafe behaviors, to encourage safe behaviors, and to be actively involved in the safety process. An ongoing effort to provide a safe working environment for all employees is a major concern of the Companies. It is important for all employees to become more actively involved in day today safety awareness, particularly as it applies to their individual jobs. Agri-Mark/Cabot's goal is for employees to actively participate in the safety process, actively care about fellow employees, and to take corrective actions, as well as taking ownership of their individual safety.\n\n\n\n(b) The Stationary Source and Substance Handled: \n\nAgri-Mark owns and operates the Middlebury facility, located at 869 Exchange Street, which produces cheese and other dairy related products.
