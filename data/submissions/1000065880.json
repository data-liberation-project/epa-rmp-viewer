The plant has a full time staff of 8 employees.  Flammable hydrogen gas is stored in liquid form in two stationary horizontal jacketed vacuum insulated cryogenic, horizontal tanks. One vessel is rated to hold 17,030 gallons and the other is rated to hold 14,480 gallons.  The liquefied hydrogen is pressured over to  the inline vaporizing and purifying equipment. The gaseous hydrogen is transferred to a customer hydrogen distribution system. \r\n\r\nTHE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS:\r\n\r\nThe chemical specific accidental release and accident prevention steps are those to mitigate risk from flammable gases.\r\n\r\nEmployees are consulted on the conduct of process hazard analysis, trained on the process using standard operating procedures and the other elements of the risk management plan . \r\n\r\nThe equipment was designed by engineers. Documentation pertaining to the design of the process and recommended maintenance /integrity inspections are followed.\r\nProcess hazard analysis by HAZOP has been used to identify potential concerns and ensure mitigation to low levels of risk.\r\nIf contractors are used on the site, they are pre-qualified prior to selection and trained on site specific hazards and emergency awareness for the site to ensure potential hazards of contractors are mitigated.\r\nA safe/hot work program is used to lower risk associated with maintenance and repair.\r\nManagement of Change is used for any alterations to the system.\r\nPre Startup Review process (i.e., Ready for Startup Review )is used to review the initial and return to operational readiness following any significant"
