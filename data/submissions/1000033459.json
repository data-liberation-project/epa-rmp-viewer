Capitol Wholesale Meats Inc. has developed an Emergency Action and Response Plan (EARP) that contains procedures designed to maximize the safety of all employees, contractors, and visitors in the event of an emergency and also guard against environmental consequences.\r\n\r\nIII.\tFacility Identification\r\nThe Capitol Wholesale Meats Inc. facility is located at 8751 West 50th Street in McCook, Illinois.  The facility is a producer of specialty meatballs, Italian beef, pizza toppings, and specialty breakfast meats for the foodservice industry nationwide. \r\n\r\nThe NAICS code for the facility is 311612.  Many areas of the plant are refrigerated to preserve ingredients and products.   \r\n\r\nThe facility uses ammonia for refrigeration, and is regulated under 40 CFR Part 68, the EPA RMP Rule. There is one (1) refrigeration system onsite that is used for refrigerating ingredients, process areas, and products. \r\n\r\nThe amount of ammonia in the refrigeration system is approximately 38,000 pounds.  The refrigeration system is used to cool process rooms, holding freezers, coolers, docks and blast freezers.  This refrigeration system uses ammonia refrigerant in a three (3) stage evaporation/condensation cycle.  The \"low pressure\" equipment contains (3) Freezer Evaporators, (2) Blast Cells, (4) Spiral Freezers, (1) Low Temp Pump Package (LTPR), (1) Oil Pot and (3) Booster Compressors.  The \"intermediate pressure\" equipment contains (1) Corridor Evaporator, (10) Process Room Evaporators, (3) Dock Evaporators, (5) Roof Top Units, (1) Water Chiller, (1) Gravy Chiller, (1) High Temp Pump Package (HTPR), (1) Oil Pot, (1) Swing Compressor, and (3) High Stage Compressors.
