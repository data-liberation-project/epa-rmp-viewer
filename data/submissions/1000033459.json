Facility Identification\n\nThe Capitol Wholesale Meats Inc. facility is located at 8751 West 50th Street in McCook, Illinois.  The facility is a producer of specialty meatballs, Italian beef, pizza toppings, and specialty breakfast meats for the foodservice industry nationwide. \n\n\n\nThe NAICS code for the facility is 311612.  Many areas of the plant are refrigerated to preserve ingredients and products.   \n\n\n\nThe facility uses ammonia for refrigeration, and is regulated under 40 CFR Part 68, the EPA RMP Rule. There is one (1) refrigeration system onsite that is used for refrigerating ingredients, process areas, and products. \n\n\n\nThe amount of ammonia in the refrigeration system is approximately 38,000 pounds.  The refrigeration system is used to cool process rooms, holding freezers, coolers, docks and blast freezers.  This refrigeration system uses ammonia refrigerant in a three (3) stage evaporation/condensation cycle.  The \"low pressure\" equipment contains (3) Freezer Evaporators, (2) Blast Cells, (4) Spiral Freezers, (1) Low Temp Pump Package (LTPR), (1) Oil Pot and (3) Booster Compressors.  The \"intermediate pressure\" equipment contains (1) Corridor Evaporator, (10) Process Room Evaporators, (3) Dock Evaporators, (5) Roof Top Units, (1) Water Chiller, (1) Gravy Chiller, (1) High Temp Pump Package (HTPR), (1) Oil Pot, (1) Swing Compressor, and (3) High Stage Compressors.  The \"high-pressure\" equipment includes the (3) Evaporative Condensers and (1) High Pressure Receiver (HPR) and associated piping/valves.\n\n\n\nAn aerial map identifying the site location is included as Appendix A. \n\n\n\nIV.

Appendix D consists of the offsite consequence analysis data and maps for the alternative release scenario. \n\n\n\nVI.    General Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nA prevention program is in place to minimize the risk of hazardous chemical releases in accordance with the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29 CFR 1910.119) and the EPA Risk Management Program.   \n\n\n\nThis prevention program covers those processes that handle ammonia above the threshold quantity for both PSM and RMP rules. The first audit of the PSM program occurred on January 21, 2011, in compliance with the requirement to conduct PSM audits every three years.  The elements of the PSM / Program 3 prevention program and a brief description are listed below.\n\n?    Employee Participation - Capitol Wholesale Meats Inc. has updated a site-specific employee participation plan that ensures employees and their representatives are consulted when conducting and developing process hazard analyses and other information required to be developed under the PSM/RMP regulation.
