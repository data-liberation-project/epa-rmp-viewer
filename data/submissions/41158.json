      "SummaryText": "This Risk Management Plan covers the Pilgrim's Pride Corporation's chicken processing facility at the Mt. Pleasant, TX East plant.  The facility's two refrigeration systems are standard single-stage refrigeration designs using anhydrous ammonia as the refrigerant.  There is approximately 16,500 pounds of ammonia on site.  Because anhydrous ammonia is listed by both the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as a hazardous chemical, our accidental release prevention policy is designed to comply with the Process Safety Management (PSM) and Risk Management Program (RMP) regulations of these two agencies.  These regulations are designed to prevent the accidental release of ammonia and minimize negative consequences in the event that a release should occur.  Our emergency response policy follow the National Response Team's Integrated Contingency Plan Guidance (one plan) and is designed to comply with allgovernment emergency response regulations.\n\nAn offsite consequence analysis was performed for this site, including consideration of two ammonia release scenarios identified as worst case release and alternate release scenario.  The worst case scenario, as defined by the EPA, states that the owner or operator shall assume that the \u00bf maximum quantity in the largest vessel \u00bf is released as a gas over 10 minutes, due to an unspecified failure.  The alternative release scenario is defined as more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario.\n\nThe reason this RMP is being updated is because a new High Pressure Receiver has been put in since the last RMP was submitted.  It is larger than the previous vessel, therefore, the worst-case scenario has changed.  We are also taking this opportunity to correct some information in the previous report.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario at the Pilgrim's Pride Mt. Pleasant East Plant facility involves a failure of the High Pressure Receiver under maximum stora"

The scenario we chose to evaluate does reach offsite endpoints and a few nearby public receptors.\n\nThe passive mitigation for the Worst Case Scenario includes Berms and Drains.  The active mitigation considered for the Alternate Release Scenario includes a water deluge system for the Safety Relief Valves outlet piping.\n\nPilgrims Pride Corporation's accidental release prevention program is based on the following key elements:\n\n*  Hands-on and classroom training of the refrigeration partners\n*  Preventative maintenance program\n*  Operating procedures, written with the participation of the refrigeration partners\n*  Performance of a process hazard analysis of the entire system including equipment and piping\n*  Design and implementation of an auditing and inspection program\n*  Procedure for handling all changes to the system\n*  Pre-Startup review procedures for significant system modifications\n*  Up-to-date process safety information\n*  Procedures for investigating release incidents or near-misses\n*  Non-routine safe work permits for work on or near the ammonia process.\n\nThis program was developed with the participation of Pilgrims Pride Corporation refrigeration partners.  They were also instrumental in developing the Process Safety Information.  All anhydrous ammonia pipes and valves are labeled and all equipment information has been compiled.  The Company follows the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines for safe operations and preventative maintenance.  In addition, the facility has procedures in place for notifying contractors and their employees of the hazards pertaining to the system, as required under the RMP regulations.  Chemical-specific prevention steps include availability of self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) and respirators for the refrigeration partners' use, and awareness of the hazard"

The toxic cloud formed by the evaporating ammonia would reach offsite endpoints and nearby public receptors.  This scenario was performed using pre-defined conditions by the EPA, namely release of the entire amount as a gas in 10 minutes, use of the one-hour average ERPG-2 (Emergency Response Planning Guideline Level 2) as the toxic endpoint, and consideration of the population residing within a full circle with a radius corresponding to the toxic endpoint distance.  The EPA-mandated meteorological conditions used for this scenario were Atmospheric Stability Class F, wind speed of 1.5 m/sec, highest daily maximum temperature (77\u00b0 F), and average humidity (50%).  \n\nThe EPA set these conditions to facilitate the performance of the offsite consequence analysis; however, the assumptions used may be unrealistic because:\n\n1.  The maximum amount of anhydrous ammonia this vessel could hold is 5000 pounds.  Under normal operating conditions, this High Pressure Receiver contains approximately 1500 pounds and seldom, if ever, would reach the 5000 pound capacity.\n\n2.  Assumption is that ammonia liquefied under pressure is released at its boiling point.  At true atmospheric conditions only a fraction (about 20% of the total) of the liquid ammonia will release to the atmosphere flashing as a vapor.  The remaining un-flashed liquid will stay in the vessel or pool on the ground.\n\n3.  Requirement to compare a 10-minute release to a one-hour average standard.\n\n4.  Only the population within an elliptical plume extending downwind of the release point is potentially affected.  This plume area, or footprint, is approximately 6% of the area of the full circle.\n\nThe alternative release scenario involves the release of a Safety Relief Valve.  The scenario, by definition, is more likely to occur than the worst case scenario and must reach an endpoint off site using the typical meteor"
