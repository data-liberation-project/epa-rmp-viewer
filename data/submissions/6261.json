      "SummaryText": "1.  The Facility Policy:  The owners, managers and employees of R & T Ammonia are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia by utilization of proper equipment, regular inspections and maintenance and training of all persons that work with the material.  Should an accidental release occur, the facility has oriented the local fire department and the local emergency planning committee so that they can plan for response to any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.  Facility Information:  The primary activity at R & T Ammonia is the storage for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.  The maximum quantity stored would be 130,850 lbs in the facility's 3 tanks.  The capacities of these tanks are two 8,000 gallon tanks and one 12,000 gallon tank.  \n\n3.  Worst Case Scenario:  The worst case scenario would be the release of the total contents of the 12,000 gallon storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 56,000 lbs, which represents the volume of the storage tank at 85% capacity as limited by design standards and company procedures.  The distance to endpoint of dispersion based on the model used is 1.80 miles.  The alternative case scenario is assumed to be a release from the rupture of a 2 inch transfer hose with 12,000 lbs released over 2 minutes.  The distance to endpoint of dispersion is 1.18 miles.\n\n4.  The Accidental Release Program:  R & T Ammonia complies with the Rules and Regulations relating to the handling of anhydrous ammonia and low pressure nitrogen solutions, equipment, containers and storage facilities.  These regulations administered by the Illinois Department of Agriculture are consistent with ANSI K61.1and OSHA 29 CFR 1910.11 regarding storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.\n\n5.  The Five Year Accident History:  There have been no accidental releas"

The Emergency Response Program:  R & T Ammonia has a written emergency action plain in accordance with OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.38 and provides state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III of EPCRA.  Our emergency response action plan has been reviewed with the local fire department and provided to the local emergency planning committee for coordination in the community response planning.\n\n7.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety:  Safety improvements are an on-going process at R & T Ammonia.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe practices and operations.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
