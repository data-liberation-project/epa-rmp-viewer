      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n    \n    The following is a brief description of the risk management program currently in place at the Las Vegas Ice and Cold Storage Co. Inc. (LVCS) facility in Las Vegas, Nevada.  Also included in this document are recommendations for improvement upon the existing risk management program at the facility.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Emergency Response Policies\n\n    Although the use of anhydrous ammonia for refrigeration, as a process chemical, does not lend itself to many opportunities for an accidental release, LVCS has made chemical safety a priority at the facility.  The current Process Safety Management (PSM) plan addresses company policies in regards to the prevention of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia and also provides guidance in the event that such an emergency occurs.  While the current PSM plan is fairly comprehensive, recent performance of a HAZOP for the facility has demonstrated the need for review and revision of the current plan.  This plan for review and revision of certain aspects of the current PSM plan is discussed in further sections of this document.\n\nThe Las Vegas Ice and Cold Storage Co. Inc. Facility and Regulated Substances Handled\n\n    The LVCS facility manufactures, stores, and sells ice products in the Las Vegas Valley.  In addition, LVCS also provides cold storage for local businesses.  The manufacture of ice and cold storage services require the use of an industrial refrigeration system.  The system in place at LVCS uses anhydrous ammonia to cool the refrigerated and freezer portions of the facility.  Approximately 13,600 pounds of anhydrous ammonia are currently used in the refrigeration system at the facility.  The anhydrous ammonia is located in piping, storage vessels, compressors, and evaporators associated with the system.\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario and Alternate Release Scenario for the Facility\n\n    The Worst-Case Scenario devised for the LVCS facility involves a breach of the large high-pressure"

      "SummaryText": " receiver located on the outside of the facility.  While unlikely, calculations of the parameters for this scenario suggest that a release of the entire contents of the receiver (9,000 pounds) could impact locations approximately 1.2 miles from the facility.  Included within the 1.2 mile radius from the facility are various elementary, middle, and high schools; Las Vegas City Hall; North Las Vegas City Hall; North Las Vegas Hospital; North Las Vegas Police Station; Cashman Field; various parks; and a portion of the Moapa Band of Paiutes Indian Reservation. \n\n    A more likely release scenario involves damage to a 1-= inch pipe connection to the 3,600 pound receiver located inside of the facility.  Calculations of a release of this sort suggest that approximately 1,800 pounds of anhydrous ammonia are within the receiver at any given time under the current administrative controls.  Passive mitigation measures include the walls of the facility that would limit the spread of the release.  From calculations performed under ammonia refrigeration guidelines, it is estimated that the radius of impact from the alternate release scenario would be approximately 0.1 mile.  A park is located within the 0.1 radius from the facility.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe current PSM plan presents company policies in regards to the prevention of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia at the facility.  The PSM includes standard operating procedures for the process, employee housekeeping procedures, a mandate for weekly toolbox meetings, and plant safety issues.  While the current PSM plan is fairly comprehensive, recent performance of a HAZOP for the facility has demonstrated the need for review and revision of the current plan.  Revision of the PSM is scheduled to be completed by October 1, 1999.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\n    The facility has not had an accident involving the anhydrous ammonia system in the last five years.\n\n\n\n\n"

      "SummaryText": "Emergency Response Program\n\n    The current emergency response program for the facility involves the complete evacuation of the facility in the event of a major release from the anhydrous ammonia system.  Response to such a release would be provided by the City of Las Vegas Fire Department Hazardous Materials team.\n    However, the current emergency response plan has certain deficiencies that must be addressed.  For instance, further coordination with the City of Las Vegas Fire Department Hazardous Materials team must occur, as the team has not inspected the anhydrous ammonia system as it currently exists.  In addition, hazardous materials release drills have not been performed recently, with or without the involvement of the fire department.  Decisions must be made as to the degree of training and certification that each employee will receive in each department and these training programs must be instituted.  Finally, responsibilities and tasks must be delegated for each employee in the event of a release.  It is anticipated that a revised emergency response plan will be formulated by October of 1999.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n     The following planned changes to improve safety related to the anhydrous ammonia process at the LVCS facility are intended to be completed by October 1, 1999.\n\n7 Review and revision of the emergency action plan to include, among other aspects, coordination and drills with the City of Las Vegas Fire Department Hazardous Materials team; determination of training and certifications for all personnel; and delegation of responsibilities and tasks for each employee in the event of a release of anhydrous ammonia.\n7 Preparation of piping and instrumentation diagrams for the older portion of the anhydrous ammonia process (ice making and storage).\n7 Performance of a HAZOP evaluation of the older portion of the anhydrous ammonia process.\n7 Exploration of the feasibility of instituting computer controls on the older portion of the anhydrous ammonia"
