      "SummaryText": "VRU Executive Summary \n\nLone Star NGL Cedar Bayou Vapor Recovery Unit (VRU)\n\n\n\nBased on the regulated chemical quantities on site, predicted offsite impacts, and the five-year accident history, Lone Star NGL's Cedar Bayou VRU is classified a RMP Program level 1 process. \n\n\n\nIntroduction and Background\n\nThe Lone Star NGL Cedar Bayou VRU is process associated with the Lone Star NGL Cedar Bayou tank farm.  This facility is located in rural Harris County near Crosby, Texas.  The Cedar Bayou tank farm consists of a number of liquid hydrocarbon storage tanks which are classified as DOT \"break out\" tanks which are storage incident to transportation.  As such, the tanks themselves fall under 49 CFR part 195 regulations and are exempt from RMP.  The VRU is a process that was subsequently added to the tanks in order to control and meet growing air emission requirements associated with tank operations.  While the tanks are exempt from RMP the VRU process is covered by RMP and must meet the requirements of the RMP rule.\n\n\n\nTwo of the DOT regulated tanks (TK 5010 and TK 5050) are dedicated solely to natural gasoline service.  In order to meet growing air emission requirements a VRU was added for the purpose of recovering waste hydrocarbon from the pad gas maintained in the tank's vapor phase.  This vapor space pad gas is a mixture of externally supplied N2 and evaporated natural gasoline which comes from the contents of the tank.  The boiling point of the natural gasoline stored in these tanks has a range of 95 - 147oF.  Data shows that the pad gas temperature for TK 5010 and 5050 does not exceed 90o F and this is without benefit of refrigeration.  The point being that the flammable mixture in the tanks stays below their boiling point. This pad gas becomes waste gas when fluid is being injected and the tanks are being refilled.  The VRU unit was added so that hydrocarbon can be recovered and not vented to atmosphere.  This promotes safety and helps the environment by recovering "

      "SummaryText": "the tank's waste vapor space pad gas and recycling the hydrocarbons back to the product stream. This is achieved by having the waste gas first passed through a blower to boost pressure, it then enters the skid mounted John Zink Carbon Adsorption-Absorption Hydrocarbon VRU. The gas is passed through a carbon bed, where the gaseous natural gasoline hydrocarbon is captured in a carbon adsorption bed.  N2 does not adhere to the carbon and passes through this adsorption bed to be vented to atmosphere. The hydrocarbons in the adsorption bed are removed from the bed by pulling a vacuum on the bed. This releases the natural gasoline vapors which are then sent to an absorption bed where the vapors come in contact with a liquid solvent stream of chilled natural gasoline from TK 7300.  This causes the vapors in the absorption bed to liquefy and mix with the natural gasoline solvent. This enriched mixture is then sent back to TK 7300 so it can either be sent back to the product pipeline for transportation, or can be used for another cycle of absorption.\n\n\n\nRegulated Chemical Quantities on Site\n\nThe only vessel or pipe in the process with a substantial amount of flammable mixture and is therefore of greatest interest is TK 7300.  TK 7300 contains natural gasoline (a flammable hydrocarbon mixture).  The rated volumetric capacity of TK 7300 is 13,000 gallons with a maximum intended operational fluid level maintained at 6175 gallons or less.  Design and operational safeguards are in place to ensure the maximum intended inventory level of the fluid in TK 7300 does not exceed 6175 gallons.  The fluid has a typical weight of 5.44 lbs per gallon.  This gives an intended maximum weight of approx. 33,600 lbs.  The component break down weight for the flammable mixture in TK 7300 is as follows:\n\nEthane           1 lb\n\nPropane          3 lb\n\nIso-Butane      20 lb\n\nn-Butane       896 lb\n\nIso-Pentane  9,892 lb\n\nn-Pentane    9,484 lb\n\nHexane +    13,289 lb\n\n\n\nPredicted Offsite Impacts\n\nThe Wor"

      "SummaryText": "st Case Scenario (WCS) release is defined as the release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a vessel or process line failure that results in the greatest distance to an endpoint.   The facility does not handle any toxic chemicals and the only RMP regulated chemical is several hydrocarbon compounds found in the natural gasoline.  The greatest volume of natural gasoline at the VRU will be contained in TK 7300.  The WCS flammable mixture scenario required by RMP seeks the end point of a 1.0 psi overpressure (i.e. 15. 7 psia) resulting from a release of flammable substance and a subsequent vapor cloud explosion. The quantity in the vapor cloud is assumed to equal the storage capacity of TK 7300, i.e. the total release of the listed flammable mixture in TK 7300. The volume is assumed to vaporize instantaneously and ignite, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  Factors in selecting the WCS included consideration of scenarios involving smaller quantities as well as difference in locations to facility boundaries.  However, no other scenario results in a greater distance to an endpoint than the chosen WCS.  A 0.2 mile endpoint distance was found using EPA's RMP*Comp program. (Available online at the EPS web site, July 2016.)   Offsite impacts were determined using the Marplot program with a 0.2 mile radius of exposure a center point of the radius being TK 7300.  There are zero public or environmental receptors found within the 0.2 mile radius of TK 7300.\n\n\n\nFive-year Accident History\n\nThis is a new process with no accident history. \n\n\n\nEmergency Response Coordination\n\nLone Star NGL's Cedar Bayou operations maintains active coordination with local emergency response organizations including, Harris County LEPC, Baytown and Crosby Fire Dept., and Local Police jurisdictions. This coordination includes periodic joint response drills and emergency responder awareness notifications. \n\n"
