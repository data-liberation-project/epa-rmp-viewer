      "SummaryText": "Aqua Pennsylvania owns and operates the Neshaminy Creek Water Treatment Plant in Oakford, PA which provides potable water for the surrounding community.  The company is dedicated to providing a safe and healthy work environment for all its employees.  The Corporate Mission is to continue in a leadership role as a good corporate citizen and encourage employees' active participation in the communities served.  The Neshaminy Creek Water Treatment Plant conducts a safe, productive business, contributing to the community while minimizing risk to employees and neighbors.\n\nThe Plant has developed and implemented an effective release prevention program.  A management Team, consisting of qualified management personnel located onsite and at Corporate Headquarters, is accountable for enforcement and oversight of the above elements of the release prevention program.  \n\nEmergency Response to any potential incident at the plant is accomplished in accordance with the site's Integrated Contingency Plan.  The Integrated Contingency Plan identifies response capabilities and qualification requirements of the onsite Emergency Response Team.  The Plan complies with the emergency response requirements of OSHA, EPA and PADEP.  The Plan is tested annually for effectiveness.  \n\nThe Neshaminy Creek Water Treatment Plant has installed a scrubber that will effectively contain and neutralize any chlorine release that could occur at the facility.  In addition to the scrubber, the facility uses a vacuum process with alarms, detectors and isolation valves to further minimize the risk associated with accidental releases.  \n\nAs an indication of the effectiveness of the above-mentioned programs, the site has experienced no accidental releases within the past five years.  An accidental release is defined as any release that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage."
