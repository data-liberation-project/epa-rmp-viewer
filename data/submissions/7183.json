Hunter Farms operations include the processing of dairy products for public consumption. Hunter Farms has been in operation since 1917 and has been at this facility for over 8 years providing quality dairy products and over 130 jobs to the local community. Dairy production has occurred at this facility for over 50 years.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy\n\nHunter Farms is committed to protecting the health of its associates, the surrounding community, and the environment; therefore it is Hunter Farms' policy to maintain compliance with 40 CFR 68 as well as Occupational Safety and Health Organization (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations promulgated as Title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations Chapter 1910, Section 119 (29 CFR 1910.119), and OSHA's Hazardous Operations and Emergency Response regulations (29 CFR 1910.120). \n\nStationary Sources and Regulated Substances\n\nHunter Farms is subject to section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act because ammonia, a regulated substance, is present at the facility in amounts greater than 10,000 pounds.  Hunter Farms is required to maintain low temperatures in the dairy processing areas of the facility that are within standards required by the Federal Drug Administration (FDA)  to ensure quality in the delivered products.  Hunter Farms uses anhydrous ammonia (the 112(r) regulated substance) as a refrigerant to maintain 75,900 ft2 within the required range of operating temperatures.  Anhydrous ammonia is a typical refrigerant for dairy processing. Hunter Farms' refrigeration system consisting of receivers, accumulators, compressors, evaporators, condensers, and piping can contain an oper"

      "SummaryText": "ating capacity of 32,100 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.\n\nWorst Case Release Scenario\n\nAs required by 40 CFR 68 Subpart B, Hunter Farms has evaluated a worst-case release scenario for anhydrous ammonia using the parameters specified by the EPA.  Hunter Farms' worst-case release scenario is the rupture of the largest single receiver (2,200 gallons) when filled to 100% capacity (there are no engineering controls on the receivers) over a 10-minute period.  Using the EPA's RMP*Comp program, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint is 1.2 miles.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario was developed following EPA regulations and is not considered to be a likely release scenario.  During normal operations, Hunter Farms maintains the receivers at 20-30% capacity. Only during pump-down operations do the receivers have the potential to be filled to 100% of capacity.  The receivers are operated in pump-down mode less than 1% of the time during the year.  \n\nAlternative Release Scenario\n\nA more realistic release scenario (alternative release) was developed by Hunter Farms taking into consideration the 9-year history of operation's experience and the hazards identified in the process hazard analyses (PHAs) conducted under the Occupational Safety and Health Organization (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations promulgated as Title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations Chapter 1910, Section 119 (29 CFR 1910.119).  The most likely release scenario identified by Hunter Farms would be a release caused by a >-inch flange gasket failure in an ammonia vapor line. In developing the release parameters of this alternative scenario, Hunter Farms considered the most common gasket size and the average response time of the community's Hazmat team. Using EPA's RMP*Comp program, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint is 0.10 miles.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is designed and constructed in accordance with ANSI/IIAR 2-1992 Standard for Equipment, "

To prevent and mitigate accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia, Hunter Farms has implemented several precautionary measures.  \n\nHunter Farms has developed and implemented a PSM program pursuant OSHA regulations and as such, has evaluated the system for the potential of anhydrous ammonia releases.   Some of the controls installed to prevent catastrophic releases of ammonia are process equipment (pressure relief valves, rupture disks, purge system, backup pumps, and manual shutoffs) and automated controls (automatic shut-offs, interlocks and ammonia leak detection system). In addition, Hunter Farms has spent time with the local Fire Department who would respond to potential ammonia releases and the Fire Department has toured the facility to become familiar with the location of the system equipment, valves and emergency shut-offs.\n\nHunter Farms has developed standard operating procedures (SOPs), that  incorporate safety measures into the procedures. for all associates and contractors that have contact with the ammonia refrigeration system. These safety procedures were developed by refrigeration system operators and are reviewed on an as-needed basis. Process safety information for the refrigeration system is reviewed anytime there is a change in the process or SOP.  Hunter Farms requires associate participation in development of overall safety measures used at the plant by means of company newsletters, total quality management teams and training sessions.  Pursuant to written management of change procedures established by Hunter Farms, any changes to the operating procedures are to be communicated to affected employees.\n\nHunter Farms understands that maintaining the refrigeration system in good working order is essential to preventing accidental releases; therefore Hunter Farms has implemented a preventative maintenance program.  The preventative maintenance program is scheduled, documented and ma"

Upon arrival at the facility the fire department evacuated three blocks of residential area and moved 71 individuals to a local church.
