      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe ExxonMobil Baytown Chemical Plant has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety and protecting the environment.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, personnel training, and safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our objective is to implement effective controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control, contain and mitigate the release.\n\nExxonMobil modified its safety programs in 1991 to adopt structured environmental and safety management systems, entitled Operations Integrity Management System (OIMS).  In 1997, Lloyd's Register Quality Assurance reviewed OIMS and evaluated it against the international standard for Environmental Management Systems (ISO 14001) to determine if OIMS meets the requirements of ISO 14001.  After an extensive review which included a number of facility audits, they concluded that the \"environmental components of OIMS are consistent with the intent and meet the requirements of the ISO 14001 Environmental Management Systems Standard.\"  They went on to say, \"We further believe ExxonMobil to be among the industry leaders in the extent to which environmental management considerations have been integrated into its ongoing business processes.\"\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe ExxonMobil Baytown Chemical Plant is located in Baytown, Harris County, Texas.  It operates to produce a variety of petrochemical products such as Butyl Rubber, polypropylene plastic, and a number of chemical intermediate feedstocks such as propylene.  The plant has several regulated flammables such as propylene, ethylene, propane, and isobutylene.  In addition, the plant uses anhydrous ammonia, chlorine, bromine, and methyl chloride that are regulated substances under RMP.  The p"

These tables cover all the parameters required by the RMP rule for both worst case (WCS) and alternate case (ACS) scenarios.\n\nThe WCS associated with toxic substances in Program 3 processes at our plant is a release of bromine from a storage tank that would have an off-site endpoint.  Although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences should an incident occur, no credit for administrative controls or active mitigation measures was taken into account in evaluating this scenario. \n\nThe WCS associated with a release of flammable substances in Program 3 processes at the plant is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) involving the full inventory of the largest storage tank containing a covered flammable, in our case isobutylene (2-methylpropene).  The full tank inventory is assumed to release, completely vaporize, and ignite, resulting in a VCE.  Although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences should an incident occur, no credit for mitigation was taken into account in evaluating this WCS. This WCS has an off-site endpoint.\n\nThe alternative case scenario (ARS) for Anhydrous Ammonia is a failure of a loading hose during transfer operations. This ARS has an off-site endpoint. \n\nThe alternative case scenario for bromine is a leak in a loading hose during unloading operations.  This scenario would have an off-site endpoint.\n\nThe alternative case scenario for chlorine involves a piping failure on a shipping cylinder. This scenario has an off-site endpoint.\n\nThe alternative case scenario for methyl chloride involves the failure of a piping flange gasket.

This is the same approach taken with respect to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.  We believe that this approach provides the maximum safety for our employees and the community.  \n\n In addition, Exxon Mobil Corporation has implemented its Operations Integrity Management System (OIMS).  OIMS includes aspects of EPA's prevention program.  As already mentioned, OIMS has been attested as equivalent to ISO 14001 as a valid management system to oversee the implementation of the risk management activities.\n\nAdditional details are included in the Data Element section of this RMPlan.  Due to the ongoing nature of our safety program, the dates associated with the various activities in our accident prevention program are constantly changing.  To accommodate the ever-changing nature of the database, we selected April 1, 1999, as the date to collect this information.  Most of the reviews/updates conducted after that date are not reflected in the Data Element information.\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nThe ExxonMobil Baytown Chemical Plant encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling operating and maintenance procedures to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that addresses each accident"

These initiatives include forming teams to promote both process and personal safety.  The teams typically have members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and plant management.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe ExxonMobil Baytown Chemical Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Specific groups within the chemical plant are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.  \n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).  This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For specific process areas, the chemical plant has identified Operating Envelopes; i.e. documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters such as temperature, level, and compositions.  The chemical plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using computerized process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems, alarm systems).\n\nThe chemical plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide much information about the design and construction of process equipment.

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe ExxonMobil Baytown Chemical Plant primarily uses the Knowledge Based Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) study that is an adaptation by ExxonMobil Research and Engineering and ExxonMobil Chemical Americas of widely used industry methodologies to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating experience and engineering expertise on the process to be evaluated.  This PHA team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are appropriate.\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local management for resolution.  Mitigation options are identified and evaluated. Selected mitigation options are tracked until they are complete.  The resolution and completion of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo ensure that process controls do not deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the ExxonMobil Baytown Chemical Plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years for the life of the process. \n\nOperating Procedures and Safe Work Practices\n\nThe ExxonMobil Baytown Chemical Plant maintains written procedures that addre"

These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a consistent basis for training new operators. The procedures are maintained current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process. These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  \n\nThe chemical plant has identified operating envelopes; i.e. documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters such as temperature, level, and compositions. This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Baytown Chemical Plant has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in chemical plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with an experienced operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After employees demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operations technicians periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years. Training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nContractors\n\nThe ExxonMobil Baytown Chemical Plant uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased mai"

This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.  In addition, the ExxonMobil Baytown Chemical Plant evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.  Chemical plant personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\nThe ExxonMobil Baytown Chemical Plant conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information controlled by management of change (MOC).  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides an additional check to ensure construction is in accordance with design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.

In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process equipment.\n\nMaintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their job in a safe manner.  Written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training.  Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended, and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels).  If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or an MOC team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\n\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance.  The ExxonMobil Baytown Chemical Plant incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs.  This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\nHot Work & Other Safe Work Practices\n\nThe ExxonMobil Baytown Chemical Plant has long-standing safe work practices in place to ensure worker and process safety.

Through the input of citizen volunteers, a communications plan was developed to meet with over 50 local professional, neighborhood, civic, and church organizations.  Additionally, RMP briefings were scheduled for the trustees of the local school district and community college, LEPC, city council and business/service organizations.  To date (early April), ExxonMobil has participated in or has been the lead presenter at the first six of these community meetings attended by about 650 of our neighbors.  Feedback from the community has been positive and gratifying.\n\nFor the 4,000+ ExxonMobil Baytown area employees, the ExxonMobil site managers made over 20 RMP presentations during January 1999. An invitation to attend one of these meetings was extended to every employee of the ExxonMobil Baytown Complex.\n\nRMP is indeed providing the ExxonMobil Baytown Chemical Plant with the opportunity to open additional avenues of dialogue with the community in order to educate and inform citizens about our operations.  Our community outreach programs are intended to earn the trust of the Baytown community and provide a means for continuing dialogue between the community and ExxonMobil.
