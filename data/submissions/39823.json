      "SummaryText": "Accidental release prevention and emergency response policy of this facility.  This facility is newly constructed (1996) and was designed and built to conform to all codes, specifications, and applicable regulations that were in place in 1996, both state and federal.  Hopefully through continued plant maintenance and employee training, an accidental release will not occur.  If, however, an accidental release should occur it is our policy to notify the Sutherland Community Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.\n\nFacility description and the regulated substance handled:  This facility is a fertilizer plant and is operated as such by the local agricultural cooperative.  The facility handles anhydrous ammonia for use as fertilizer by its farmer members.  The plant has permanent anhydrous ammonia storage capacity of 30,000 gallons which puts the plant into the regulated category.  Along with the permanent storage tank and associated valves, piping, etc.  We use nurse tanks and applicators for our farmers to transport and inject the ammonia into the ground.\n\nWorst case scenario:  Our worst case scenario would be if the 30,000 gallon tank was filled to allowable capacity and for some reason would rupture.  This could conceivably result in the release of 131,325 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  According to EPA look-up tables the distance to the endpoint is 6.9 miles where in the rural environment 1548 people reside.\n\nGeneral accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention program:  This facility complies with all \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\" (ANSI K6 1.1) guidelines published by The American National Standards Institute (ANSI).  In addition to these standards it is our policy to continually maintain and update our equipment to all current state and federal anhydrous ammonia handling guidelines.  We also maintain a continuing education and safety education program for all employees insid"

      "SummaryText": "e and out.\n\nFive year Accident History:  We have never had an accident involving anhydrous ammonia that caused death, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations or shelterings in place.\n\nEmergency Response Program:\n\nThis Facility has:\n\na. A written Emergency Action Plan, in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\nb. Provided state and local authorities with the emergency planning and community right-to-know as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA);\n\nc. A written emergency response program, in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.120, including pre-emergency planning and employee training.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to asses the maintenance of safe conditions.\n\nThere are no additional specific safety recommendations regarding storage or use of anhydrous ammonia for implementation at this time."
