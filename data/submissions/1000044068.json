As a reflection of our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations, we submit this plan to address the hazards inherent with the use of hydrogen fluoride.  Our program addresses safety precautions regarding the handling and operation of the hydrogen fluoride process, as well as proper training for those who operate and maintain the process. The company training policy requires that all employees will be properly trained for a job position before assignment to that job.\n\n\n\nMatheson Tri-Gas, Inc. senior management is not only committed to offer superior service, but to also maintain a safety and environmental program to promote a safe environment for all its employees and the surrounding communities.  Matheson Tri-Gas, Inc's safety and environmental policies are administered by the Branch Manager with the assistance of the Plant Manager, Maintenance Manager, and Corporate Environmental Compliance.  Periodic inspections of the facility are conducted to ensure compliance and to oversee the entire safety and environmental programs.  These programs include various safety programs, the Emergency Response Contingency Plan, as well as the Risk Management Plan.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\n\nThe Matheson Tri-Gas, Inc. facility is located at 1861 Lefthand Circle in Longmont, Colorado.  The plant packages compressed specialty industrial gases in Department of Transportation (DOT), National Fire Protection Association (NFPA), and Compressed Gas Association (CGA) approved containers. This operation includes manufacturing and filling material into cylinders. \n\n\n\nThe source gas for operations is manufactured at the facility and placed in cylinders. Finished product is stored and shipped in cylinders with capacities of 130 pounds to 22 pounds. The plan"

HF is used as a raw material in the manufacture of another specialty gas. The HF process involves two cylinders stored together in the process area dedicated to HF operations. Each HF cylinder has a capacity of 1,330 pounds. At any given time, one cylinder will be utilized in the manufacturing process, while the second cylinder is stored until the first cylinder is emptied during manufacturing.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nThe Matheson Tri-Gas, Inc. facility has many safety features.  Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system.  For example, the facility operates in accordance with OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation.  \n\n\n\nCompressed gas cylinders are manufactured and maintained to the exact codes and standards specified by DOT, NFPA, and CGA. Cylinder construction is mandated in all aspects including metallurgy, wall thickness, and design pressure. These codes and standards have been established to insure that compresses gas cylinders are designed to withstand extremes of operation and overpressure conditions. Each cylinder must be tested and re-qualified every 5 years. Valves must meet stringent manufacturing standards as well. In addition to these codes and standards, Matheson Tri-Gas, Inc. has internal policies for handling compressed gas cylinders.  Compliance with these standards, codes, and policies significantly reduces the likelihood of a catastrophic failure of a compressed gas cylinder.\n\n\n\nIn addition to the integrity of the cylinder and components, a primary element of this facility's prevention program is experienced operators. Not only are they certified with the knowledge, skills, and abilities to perform their duties safely, they are able to assess and resolve possible abnormalit"

Operators are present at the facility 24 hours a day, five days a week. \n\n\n\nCylinders are stored with protective caps covering the valve. The facility is monitored for HF gas at various locations inside and outside the manufacturing area. The monitoring system has automatic process shutdown capabilities. The HF cylinder room is exhausted to a scrubber unit dedicated to and designed for emergency releases.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\n\n\n\nThe Matheson Tri-Gas, Inc. facility has an emergency response plan in effect.  The facility's Emergency Response Contingency Plan (Plan) was developed and designed to:\n\n\n\n  1.) Save lives.\n\n  2.) Minimize and avoid injuries.\n\n  3.) Protect the environment.\n\n  4.) Minimize property damage.\n\n\n\nThe Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, chemical health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.\n\n\n\nThe facility also maintains an emergency response team.  Each member receives refresher training and re-qualification annually.  Equipment necessary to quickly respond to an incident is kept at the facility, including monitors and an emergency scrubber. The Longmont Fire Department is invited to walk-throughs and drills to acquaint the staff with the facility. \n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nEPA's RMP regulation defines \"accident\" as the following:\n\n\n\n\"The release must be from a covered process and involve a regulated substance held above its threshold quantity in the process.\n\n\n\nThe release must have caused at least one of the following:\n\n\n\n?    On-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage (?68.42(a)); or\n\n?    Known offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place (?68.42(a)).\"\n\n\n\nAn investigation into the facility's accident history during the PH"
