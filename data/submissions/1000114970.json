      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nThe Metropolitan Water District of Southern California (Metropolitan) treats and distributes drinking water to member water agencies throughout Southern California. Metropolitan provides approximately 40 percent of the drinking water used by nearly 19 million people living on the southern California coastal plain between Ventura County and the Mexican border.\n\nDisinfection is a critical process used by Metropolitan in the treatment of its drinking water.  Disinfection helps to protect public health by killing pathogens in the water and preventing the spread of waterborne diseases.  The use of chlorine as a disinfectant in the treatment of drinking water and wastewater has been the dominant disinfection method in the United States since it was introduced, around the beginning of the previous century.  While many of Metropolitan\u0092s facilities have switched to ozone as a primary disinfectant, Metropolitan will still continue to utilize bulk chlorine for residual disinfection and as a backup disinfectant to ozone at all of its water treatment plants.  Metropolitan currently utilizes bulk chlorine for disinfection at all of its water treatment plants, including the Joseph Jensen Water Treatment Plant (Jensen Plant).\n\nAs one might expect from its superior disinfection properties, chlorine is a hazardous substance.  Thus, storing and handling chlorine can present a risk to employees and the public without proper precautions.  Metropolitan regards safe practices in the storing and usage of chlorine to be of primary importance and has an excellent safety record with chlorine. To further safe practices, Metropolitan has constructed a Chlorine Containment and Handling Facility at Jensen Plant to contain all chlorine inside a building which is protected by vapor scrubbers.\n\nJensen Plant's chlorine storage and usage process is subject to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program Rule (RMPR) and also to the California Accidental Relea"

Jensen Plant has had an excellent safety record of chlorine use.\n\nGeneral Facility and Regulated Substance Information\n\nThe Joseph Jensen Water Treatment Plant (Jensen Plant) is located at 13100 Balboa Boulevard in Granada Hills, California.  The plant is situated south of the Golden State Freeway (I-5) and Antelope Valley Freeway (14) junction.  The facility was constructed in 1972 and covers 232 acres.  The plant is designed to treat drinking water, including disinfection with chlorine.  The facility stores and uses chlorine, a regulated toxic substance under the RMPR and CalARP Program rules, as well as the Federal and California Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Standards.  \n\nThe Chlorine System at the Jensen Plant is composed of the following components: (1) a totally contained chlorine feed system to receive, store, and deliver liquid chlorine to the evaporators, chlorine expansion vessels, associated piping and valving, leak sensors and monitors, and instrumentation, (2) totally contained evaporators to convert the chlorine to gas for use in the chlorinators (evaporator units, associated piping and valving, instrumentation), (3) totally contained chlorinators to regulate flow of chlorine gas under vacuum to the ejectors (chlorinator units, associated piping and valving, instrumentation), (4) ejectors to mix the chlorine gas with service water and inject chlorine solution at application points throughout the plant, and (5) chlorine gas treatment systems for capture and neutralization of an accidental chlorine release in the contained areas (scrubbers, caustic soda, fans, pumps, and associated piping and valving).\n\nThe chlorine storage vessels (railcars) are totally contained in the Chlorine Containment and Handling Facility storage bays.\n\nThe process flow for the Chlorine System begins at the liquid chlorine angle valves located on the storage vessels in each storage bay, conne"

Liquid chlorine is transferred by its own pressure from an on-line storage vessel in each storage bay to one or more evaporators in each evaporator room.\n\nEach evaporator uses an electrically heated water bath to vaporize the liquid chlorine.  The chlorinators regulate the flow of chlorine gas (under vacuum) through venturi eduction to the ejectors.  The ejectors are located at various points throughout the facility, and introduce chlorine (under vacuum) into service water to form chlorine solution that subsequently mixes with the water supply at different stages of the treatment process for disinfection purposes.\n\nThe Chlorine Containment and Handling Facility (CCHF) is continuously monitored in the control room by video cameras, process condition transmitters (pressure, flow, etc.) and chlorine leak detectors. Chlorine leak detectors are provided in the storage bays, evaporator rooms, chlorinator room, pipe tunnels and ejector cabinets.  Based on the concentration and location of chlorine detected, the leak detection system will activate a succession of safety measures, beginning with visual and audible alarms, the start-up of the chlorine neutralization system and shut down of the normal ventilation system, and finally, automatically closing the storage vessel liquid chlorine angle valve.  The alarms are annunciated at the chlorine alarm panel as well as at the operator\u0092s console in the control room.  Once alerted, fully trained personnel will respond to assess the chlorine leak.  In addition, each storage vessel valve connecting to the process is provided with a remotely actuated (pneumatic) emergency shutoff system.  In case of a major chlorine leak, chlorine supply can be stopped almost instantaneously by actuating the shutoff system, automatically or manually from any of three control panels: unloading platform, chlorine maintenance room, or control room.

Jensen Plant management ensures that each employee newly assigned to the process is trained and tested to be competent in the operating procedures listed pertaining to their duties.  The Jensen Plant training program includes four elements: (1) initial training and awareness training, (2) refresher training, (3) documentation, and (4) testing.  Each employee presently involved in operating the chlorine process has been trained to receive the required knowledge, skills, and abilities to safely carry out the duties and responsibilities, including chlorine leak response, as provided in the operating procedures.\n\nRefresher training is provided every three years or less to each employee operating the covered process to ensure that the employee understands and adheres to the current operating procedures.  In addition, the Jensen Plant management ensures that operators are trained in any updated or new procedures prior to startup of a process after a major change as indicated in their Management of Change procedures and/or Pre Startup Safety Review procedures.  \n\nJensen Plant management prepares and retains records of initial and refresher training, provides certification of the records, which includes the identity of the employee, the date of training, and the signature of the person(s) administering the training.\n\nContractors\n\nMetropolitan has procedures and policies in place that ensure that the contractors are properly informed of the hazards, access limitations to these process areas, and emergency procedures, and are prepared to safely complete the work.

Jensen Plant operators, managers and EHS representatives hold contractor safety briefings before allowing them near or in the process area. Jensen Plant management controls access to the process areas and helps evaluate the contractor's safety performance with EHS representatives.\n\nPre-Startup Safety Review and Mechanical Integrity Program\n\nJensen Plant management ensures that a pre-startup safety review (PSSR) is completed for any new process covered by this regulation, or for significant modifications to an existing covered process that requires a change in the process safety information.  \n\nJensen Plant management maintains the mechanical integrity of process equipment to help prevent equipment failures that could endanger workers, the public, or the environment.  The Jensen Plant mechanical integrity program includes the following:\n-Written procedures for maintaining mechanical integrity through inspection and testing of process equipment, based on instructions of equipment vendors, industry codes and practice, and prior operating experience.\n-Implementation of the written procedures by performing inspections and tests on process equipment at specified intervals.\n-Training of maintenance personnel in preventive maintenance program procedures; safe work practices such as lockout/tagout, line or equipment opening, and avoidance and correction of unsafe conditions; and safe use and application of special equipment and/or unique tools.\n\nHot Work Permits and Management of Change \n\nJensen Plant management requires employees and contractors to employ safe work practices when performing \u0093hot work\u0094 in, on, or around the covered process.

Metropolitan PSM/RMP Management of Change Procedure \u0093HSE 108.5\u0094 describes the process that must be completed prior to implementing changes to the chlorine system.  The Management of Change process of Metropolitan provides a system and approach to maintain and implement any management of change or modifications to equipment, procedures, chemicals, and processing conditions. This system allows Jensen Plant employees to identify and review safety hazards or provide additional safety, process, or chemical information to existing data before the proposed change would either compromise system safety or need training to be completed.\n\nInternal Compliance Audits\n\nInternal compliance audits are conducted every three years to verify compliance with the programs and procedures contained in the RMP.  Metropolitan management assembles an audit team that includes personnel knowledgeable in the Risk Management Program rule and in the process.  This team evaluates whether the prevention program satisfies the requirements of the Risk Management Program rule and whether the prevention program is sufficient to help ensure safe operation of the process.  The results of the audit are documented, recommendations resolved, and appropriate enhancements to the prevention program are implemented.  The last internal compliance audit was completed in May 2023.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nJensen Plant management investigates all incidents that resulted in or could reasonably have resulted in a catastrophic release (serious injury to personnel, the public, or the environment) so that similar accidents can be prevented.  If required, an investigation team is assembled and the investigation is initiated within 48 hours of the incident.  The results of the investigation are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate process enhancements are implemented.

The Jensen Plant has Technician Level HAZWOPER-trained plant employees who will respond only to incidental chlorine releases and will respond to emergency releases only to assess the situation and take defensive measures.  The Jensen Plant also includes employees trained in the Incident Command System, who can coordinate with and provide technical assistance to outside emergency responders.  Depending on the severity of the accidental release, external hazardous materials response agencies, such as the Los Angeles City Fire Department Hazardous Materials Response Team, will be called to handle a chlorine release.  Jensen Plant management coordinates routinely with local response agencies (Los Angeles City Fire Department) to help ensure that they are familiar with the Jensen Plant chlorine system and its emergency response requirements and that this is reflected in their Area Plans.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nNumerous changes to improve safety (recommended actions) were previously identified for the chlorine process in 1991, 1994, 1995, 1998, 2005, 2010, 2015, and 2020 when Process Hazard Analyses (PHAs) were conducted under the California Risk Management and Prevention Program (RMPP), Process Safety Management (PSM) Program and Risk Management Program were prepared for the facility.  These recommended actions have been evaluated and implemented as required."
