These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. Specific departments within the gas plant are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information. \r\n\r\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/ exposure treatment considerations, is provided in safety data sheets (SDSs).

The RMP established three levels of requirements for the program.  Programs 1 and 2 are for facilities that pose less risk to the environment and therefore have reduced compliance requirements. Program 1 is designed for no impact facilities and has the fewest requirements, while Program 3 is the most stringent of the three levels.\r\n\r\nThe program level for each facility is determined by:\r\n\u00bf\tUse of regulated substances in threshold quantities\r\n\u00bf\tImpact of an off-site public receptor (e.g., residence, school, park\r\n\u00bf\tNorth American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) cod\r\n\u00bf\tFive-year accident history\r\n\u00bf\tOSHA Process Safety Management (PSM), 29 CFR 1910.119 applicability\r\n\r\nThe Chisholm Trail Gas Complex is regulated under Program 3 requirements under the applicability criteria of \u00a768.10 because:\r\n\u00bf\tIt stores a Flammable Mixture (comprised of methane, ethane, propane, isobutane, n-butane, isopentane, and n-pentane) in excess of the threshold quantity (10,000 lbs).\r\n\u00bf\tIt is subject to OSHA PSM because Propane is a flammable gas/liquid which is stored above the threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds and the facility is planned to be normally occupied.\r\n\r\nElements required by USEPA 40 CFR 68 Subparts B through H for Program 3 are presented in\r\nSections 2 through 10 of this document.\r\n\r\n1.1 \u00a768.155(a) Accidental Release and Emergency Response Policies\r\nBlue Mountain Midstream and the Chisholm Trail Gas Complex have a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\r\n\r\nThe Chisholm Trail Gas Complex has primarily used the Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations. HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques. The analyses are conducted using a team of Blue Mountain Midstream personnel and/or contractors who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This PHA (Process Hazards Analysis) Team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\r\n\r\nThe PHA team's recommendations are reviewed with corporate management to approve or revise recommended mitigation actions. Once approved, mitigation actions are assigned a relative risk ranking based upon the magnitude/immediacy of necessary actions to reduce hazard risks - as deemed necessary by the PHA Team, PHA Team Leader, and/or Corporate Management. This risk reduction ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.

In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation\r\nThe Chisholm Gas Complex promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury. The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to gas plant management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings. Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidations.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits\r\nTo help ensure that the accidental release prevention program is functioning properly, the Gas Complex periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented. Compliance audits are required at least every 3 years. Both hourly and staff personnel participate as audit team members. The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to gas plant management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete.

However, if a release does occur, gas plant personnel are trained to follow Blue Mountain's emergency response procedures in an effort to safely avert further release and minimize the impact to public and environmental receptors.\r\n\r\n1.2 \u00a768.155(b) Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\nThe Chisholm Trail Gas Complex, located in Grady County, Oklahoma, operates a cryogenic expander plant with refrigeration assist to extract liquid petroleum products from raw natural gas. The plant products include pipeline quality natural gas - primarily methane - and natural gas liquids (NGL) comprised of propane, butane, pentane, and heavier hydrocarbons, some of which are regulated flammable substances. The part of the process that was selected to represent all regulated flammable substances at the Chisholm Trail Gas Complex which could contain a regulated flammable substance above the threshold quantity is the NGL Surge Tank, which contains a flammable mixture of Natural Gas Liquids (NGL), primarily propane.  This vessel was selected due to having the greatest inventory and endpoint potential of a regulated flammable substance that could hypothetically be released and have offsite consequences.  In order to establish the safest possible environment for our employees and the public, any inventory of regulated toxic substances is maintained below the threshold quantity. In addition to following the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP), the Chisholm Trail Gas Complex follows applicable laws set forth in OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard 29 CFR 1910.119.\r\n\r\n1.3 \u00a768.155(c) Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps Prevention Program 3 elements a"

The PHA Revalidation verities that the process does not deviate significantly from its original engineering design and safety features. These periodic revalidations/reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is decommissioned. The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained. As with the initial analysis, the PHA Team findings/recommendations will be forwarded to corporate management for approval/revision, and the final resolution of the action tasks will be documented and retained.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\nThe Chisholm Trail Gas Complex maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, including (1) initial unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) startup following a turnaround or after an emergency shutdown.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate. The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.  \r\n\r\nIn addition, the Chisholm Trail Plant maintains Operating Procedures and/or process safety information that provide guidance on how to respond to upper or lower limit exceedances for specific process or equipment parameters. This information is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\nThe Chisholm Trail Plant has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process."

The Chisholm Trail Gas Complex incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs. This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\r\n\r\nSafe Work Practices\r\nThe Chisholm Trail Gas Complex has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety. Examples of these include:\r\n\u00bf\tControl of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel;\r\n\u00bf\tA lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance;\r\n\u00bf\tA procedure for safe removal of hazardous substances before process piping or equipment is opened;\r\n\u00bf\tA permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work); and\r\n\u00bf\tA permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.\r\nThese procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\r\n\r\nManagement of Change (MOC)\r\nThe Chisholm Trail Plant has a comprehensive system to manage changes to all covered processes. This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented. Changes are reviewed to ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.

      "SummaryText": "New employees receive basic training in gas plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, and skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years. All training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\r\n\r\nContractors\r\nThe Chisholm Trail Gas Complex uses contractors to supplement its work force during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities. Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the gas plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors:\r\n\u00bf\tPerform their work in a safe manner;\r\n\u00bf\tHave the appropriate knowledge and skills;\r\n\u00bf\tAre aware of the hazards in their workplace;\r\n\u00bf\tUnderstand what they should do in the event of an emergency;\r\n\u00bf\tUnderstand and follow site safety rules; and\r\n\u00bf\tInform gas plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.\r\n\u00bf\tThis is accomplished by providing contractors with:\r\n\u00bf\tA process overview;\r\n\u00bf\tInformation about safety and health hazards;\r\n\u00bf\tEmergency response plan requirements; and\r\n\u00bf\tSafe work practices prior to their beginning work.\r\nIn addition, the Chisholm Gas Complex evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.
