      "SummaryText": "The Tallgrass Terminals, LLC - Sterling Butane facility handles Butane liquids that are stored\n\non site and injected into the Crude oil. The facility stores up to 520,000 pounds (lbs.) of\n\nButane which is split between two 60,000 gallon storage vessels and piping.\n\n\n\nProcess Controls are in place at the facility, to prevent or minimize an emergency release, including\n\nvarious automatic and manual shutoffs, alarms, vents, relief and check valves, excess flow devices,\n\nand grounding equipment. In addition, the facility is equipped with UV/IR detection and LEL/HAM\n\n(Hazardous Atmosphere Monitors).\n\n\n\nThe Worst Case Scenario was assumed to be 80% of the total quantity of one of the 60,000 gallon Butane\n\nbulk storage tanks forming a vapor cloud within the lower and upper flammability limits which\n\ndetonates. For flammable substances, the endpoint is overpressure of 1 pound per square inch for\n\nvapor cloud explosions. Under EPA requirements the WCS assumes weather conditions that allow\n\nthe chemical to travel as far as possible, and further assumes that none of the facility's mechanical\n\ncontrols or safety systems are functioning. Based on these assumptions, the WCS vapor cloud\n\nexplosion would not reach any residences, commercial or industrial areas since they are all outside of \n\nthe .5 mile endpoint. The process controls mentioned in the previous paragraph minimize the potential \n\nfor the WCS to occur.\n\n\n\nThe facility complies with Occupational Safety and Health Administrations (OSHA) regulations,\n\nincluding the Process Safety Management (PSM) requirements. Facility personnel undergo\n\noperaitons competency training and testing including emergency response drills. The response\n\ntraining and drills program includes notification to local emergency response agencies as available\n\nduring the response training. In addition, the facility is inspected and audited on a compliance schedule\n\naccording to the PSM requirements. A Process Hazard Analysis / Hazop is conducted at leas"
