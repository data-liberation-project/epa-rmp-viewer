Facility Accidental Release Policy\n\nThe owners, management, and employees of TSI, Dixon facility (herein referred to as the Facility) at 7235 Tremont Road, Dixon, California, 95620 are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia and aqua ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.  A detailed emergency response plan has been developed and will be implemented in the event of an accidental release.\n\n2.  Facility Information\n\nThe primary activity at the Facility is the storage, blending, and sale of fertilizers, in addition to, the sale of pre-packaged agricultural chemicals to farmers.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for both direct application and for blending into mixed grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients.  Anhydrous Ammonia is also used in the production of ammonium polyphosphate fertilizer and aqua ammonia.  \n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received by rail and truck and stored in one 33,333-gallon rail car, one 30,000-gallon and one 18,000-gallon storage tanks (bullets).  The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia handled in this process is 406,400 pounds.\n\nAqua ammonia (upto 30% of ammonia by weight) is produced at the site using an aqua ammonia convertor and stored in three 20,000 gallon above ground tanks at the site. The storage tanks are located within a secondary containment structure.  The maximum quantity of aqua ammonia handled is 450,000 pounds.  The total quantity of ammonia present in the aqua ammonia, based on 30% active ingredient by weight, is  135,000 pounds.  \n\nAmmonium polyphosphate is produced at the site using anhydrous ammonia  and a 10-34-0 reactor. The end product, ammonium polyphosphate, is not a regulated substance. \n\n3.  The Worst-Case Release Scenario and Alternative Release"

Anhydrous Ammonia Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios  \nThe worst-case release scenario is failure of the largest storage tank, a rail car, when filled to the greatest amount would release 170,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank, a rail car.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 2.87 miles.   \n\nThe first alternate release scenario is failure of the largest storage tank permanently on site, when filled to the greatest amount would release 130,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank permanently on site at 85% capacity as limited by regulations.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 2.53 miles.   The second alternative release scenario, based on the PHA scenarios (or the most likely potential incident) and  is a release from a broken 3-inch diameter pipe.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.20 miles.\n\nb.  Aqua Ammonia Alternative Release Scenarios  \nThe first alternative release scenario is failure of the largest storage tank when filled to the greatest amount would release 150,000 pounds of solution ammonia (containing 45,000 pounds ammonia based on a 30% active ingredient) into the containment area.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 0.67 miles.  The second alternative release scenario, based on the PHA scenarios (or the most likely potential incident) is a release from a storage tank modeled with an increased wind speed and \"D\" Stability modeling parameters.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 0.19 miles.\n\nc.  Ammonium Polyphosphate Alternative Release Scenarios  \nThe first alternative release scenario is failure of the largest anhydrous ammonia storage tank in the process when filled to the greatest amount would release 78,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, which represents the volume of the large"

Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia and Aqua Ammonia:  The Facility has implemented the provisions of the \"Safety Requirements for Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc.; California Code of Regulations, Title 8, Subchapter 1, \"Unfired Pressure Vessel Safety Orders\"; and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.\"\n\n5.  Five-year Accident History\n\na. There have been no accidental releases or near misses of anhydrous ammonia or aqua ammonia in the past five years that:\n\n1.  Have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor\n\n2.  Have resulted in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property  damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6. The Emergency Response Program\n\nThe facility's emergency response program was written in accordance with the following regulations:\n\nOSHA 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\nOSHA 29 CFR 1910.120; and\n\nSection 25503, Division 6.95 of the California Health and Safety Code\n\n7.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  Specific planned changes to the anhydrous ammonia and aqua ammonia processes at the facility are listed in the Facility PHAs."
