      "SummaryText": "JOHNSON CONTROLS INC. PULASKI, TENNESSEE\n\n\n\n1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\n\nJohnson Controls, Inc. (Johnson Controls)owns and operates a foam seat manufacturing facility located in Pulaski, Tennessee (Pulaski facility).  On site, Pulaski facility has two 12,000 gallon storage tanks, one 6,000 gallon and six 60 gallon day tanks which store Toluene Diisocyanate (TDI), a regulated hazardous substance, for the manufacturing of polyurethane foam car seats.  In addition, Johnson Controls-Pulaski may have a 20,000 gallon rail car on-site storing TDI.  The maximum intended inventory of TDI on site is above the threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds listed in 40 C.F.R. A? 68.130.\n\n\n\nSince the quantity of TDI exceeds the threshold quantity, Pulaski facility is required to implement a Risk Management Program (RMP).  The Pulaski facility is subject to Program Level 1 requirements.  This submission of RMPSubmit presents the details of the RMP compliance measures conducted by the Johnson Controls Pulaski facility.\n\n\n\nRMP Submit defines minimum and maximum values that can be entered.  Specifically, limitations exist for the release rate (Section 2.6), release duration (Section 2.7), toxic endpoint distance (Section 2.11).  Due to these limitations, the Pulaski facility was forced to use the default (inaccurate) values for the release rate, release duration, and toxic endpoint distance for this submittal rather than the more accurate values utilized by the ISCST3 model.  \n\n\n\nTable 1.  Difference Between RMP Submit Values and Actual Modeled Parameters\n\n\n\n\n\n  RMP Submit Default Value Actual (Correct) Modeled Value\n\n\n\nRelease Rate        0.2 lb/min                2.8x10-2 lb/min\n\n\n\nRelease Duration  9999.9 minutes         6.79x10+6 minutes\n\n\n\nToxic Endpoint\n\nDistance              0.049 miles                0.049 miles\n\n\n\n\n\n1.1 Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nAt the Pulaski facility, certain precautions, such as implementing engineering controls, and wearing appropr"

      "SummaryText": "iate personal protective equipment, including respiratory protection are taken when handling TDI itself or equipment that has been in contact with the chemical.  In order to prevent accidental release of the chemical from various sources, numerous safety procedures have been enacted to ensure the maximum safety of the employees working with TDI and the population surrounding the plant.  Employees of the plant have been trained in the proper handling of TDI and in the actions to be taken in case of an accidental release.\n\n\n\nThe Pulaski facility has a maximum intended on-site inventory of 400,000 lbs of TDI.  The largest spill would be a release from the 20,000 gallon (190,000 lbs) rail car.  These values are expected to be reduced by 20% shortly with conversion to a product generically known as TM-20, which is 20% diphenylmethane diisocyanate and higher oligomers.  This mixture should have no appreciable effect on the worse-case model since MDI has a vapor pressure even lower than that of TDI. The rail car is located in an enclosed building which is designed to contain the entire contents of the tank. The TDI will then be captured in the containment area under the large storage tanks and volatilize into the atmosphere. Due to the mitigation measures in place and the low volatilization of TDI, the toxic endpoint concentration of 7.0 mg/m3 does not reach outside the building.  In addition, safety measures that have been taken include informing the plant population of the hazards of the chemical, and making sure that proper procedures in the maintenance of the TDI equipment, such as pumps, filters, and valves, have been followed and adhered to.\n\n\n\nThe Pulaski facility's emergency response policies have been designed to comply with all applicable state and federal regulations.  These policies also summarize the actions that need to be taken in response to a chemical release.\n\n\n\n1.2 Description of Johnson Controls-Pulaski facility and the Regulated Substance Handled\n\nJohn"

      "SummaryText": "son Controls-Pulaski facility, an ISO/TS 16949 and ISO 14000 certified facility, produces molded polyurethane foam for automotive seating applications.  Foam production is a result of a specific blend of chemicals, including TDI, which are poured into specially designed molds.  Once the foam is inspected for imperfections, it is moved to the packing area by a conveyor system and then packed and shipped to Johnson Controls' customers.\n\n\n\nThe regulated substance handled at this facility is Toluene Diisocyanate (unspecified isomers) [Benzene, 1,3-diisocyanatomethyl].  The maximum amount of TDI that can be stored in the plant (i.e., not including the rail car) is 210,000 pounds.\n\n\n\n1.3 The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nJohnson Controls-Pulaski facility has specific process controls in place to minimize the risks of spills.  All chemical storage tanks are located indoors, above ground with secondary containment.  Tanks critical to the process have level sensors to prevent any tank from being overfilled.  Fill duration is also monitored during the transfer of TDI to the process lines and if not satisfied within a set time period, auto filling ceases and an alarm is activated.  Chemical wet systems are equipped with high and low-pressure switches to shut down in the event of a line rupture.  Critical valves are monitored electronically as to open/closed positioning.\n\n\n\nJohnson Controls-Pulaski facility has a preventative maintenance software program in place to address maintenance of all vital parts of the plant's day-to-day operations.  Specific environmental issues are also addressed with this computer driven program.\n\n\n\nJohnson Controls-Pulaski facility has established an Air Monitoring Program that monitors the airborne concentration of  TDI within the production facility.\n\n\n\nProperty Conservation and Risk Management audits are conducted annually by Factory Mutual Risk Appraisers as well as Environmental audits by"

These policies summarize the actions to be taken in response to a chemical release.  In the event of a release, the HazMat Team will respond using appropriate actions, as described in the Environmental Spill Contingency Plan, in association with the local fire department.\n\n\n\nThe Johnson Controls-Pulaski facility has established a spill response team (HazMat Team) and has assigned specific duties and responsibilities to specific individuals, like the Spill Incident Commander, who have been selected and trained to respond to in-house chemical releases.  If necessary, the appropriate outside facilities, such as the hospital or nearby residences and businesses, will be notified.  Employees are and will be trained in the safe handling and management of hazardous materials, respiratory protection, confined space entry, transportation of dangerous goods, and in the emergency response procedures to be taken in the event of an accidental release.\n\n\n\nAll spills that take place at the Pulaski facility must be documented and reported to the appropriate personnel.  The reporting allows the number and type of spills that occur to be tracked.  This in turn allows measures to be implemented to prevent similar spills from occurring in the future.  Spills exceeding the reportable quantity must be reported to certain regulatory agencies.\n\n\n\nIf a release of 10 gallons or more of TDI has occurred, Johnson Controls informs Bayer Corporation, the supplier of TDI, of the accidental release and inquires about assistance and advice.\n\n\n\n1.6 Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe Johns"
