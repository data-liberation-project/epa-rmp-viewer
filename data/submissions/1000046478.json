      "SummaryText": "To ensure employee safety, and reduce the potential for exposure to the community, the Wilkinsburg-Penn Joint Water Authoritys' (WPJWA) Nadine Road Pump Station provides awareness training on the chemical hazards of chlorine and in the safe handling of hazardous materials at the facility.  Personnel working with hazardous materials are trained in safe operating procedures, the proper utilization of safety equipment and safeguards, and maintenance techniques required to operate the process in a safe and efficient manner.\n\n\n\nWPJWA Nadine Road Pump Station is a raw water treatment facility located along the Allegheny River that utilizes chlorine in its' treatment process.  The chlorine is contained inside a brick structure (the chlorine feed building) in four one-ton cylinders utilized for the pre-treatment process.  Up to six full cylinders can also be stored just outside the building in a fence enclosed area.  The four cylinders that are inside are situated horizontally on two sets of hydraulic scales.  WPJWA Nadine Road Pump Station employs a dual high capacity vacuum reglator system with automatic switchover.  Typically, the front scale and vacuum regulator are in service with the rear scale and regulator as backup.  Two cylinders are connected to a manifold and the valves are opened to activate one scale assembly.  The chlorine gas passes through the regulator and travels to the chlorinators located in an adjacent room.  The chlorinators regulate feed rates to produce an appropriate mixture of domestic water and chlorine relative to the raw water being treated.  The mixture travels through the solution line to the application point where it is injected into the raw water coming from the Allegheny River.\n\n\n\nWPJWAs' Nadine Road Pump Station has implemented a prevention program to reduce the potential for an accidental release.  The process equipment is evaluated against best engineering practices and adheres to codes and standards regulating the water treatment indu"

      "SummaryText": "stry.  Supplier Manuals and Maintenance instructions are used as a basis for scheduled maintenance activities and equipment changes.  Training on operating procedures, the safe handling of chlorine, and inspection and testing procedures, are in place to reduce the potential for an accidental release of chlorine.  Operators monitor chlorine sensors from a remote control panel.  Personnel are trained in the use of Self Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA) and in the use of repair kits for one ton and 150 pound cylinders.\n\n\n\nThere hasn't been a chlorine release in the past five years that has affected employees or the environment.\n\n\n\nThe facility emergency response plan has been approved by the Local Emergency Planning Committee of Allegheny County.  In addition to Mark Lerch, Facility Response Coordinator, Scott Olsen may be contacted at 412-243-6254.  If an emergency exists, the facility emergency coordinator will notify the Penn Hills Fire Department, Penn Hills Police Department, Penn Hills Emergency Services, and County Emergency Management Agency.  Employees have been trained in the use of safety equipment(SCBAs), evacuation procedures, and notification procedures.\n\n\n\nA more intensive training program has been adopted to focus on the chlorine process and the controls required to improve safety for employees and the public.  Employees initial training and retraining will be conducted and documented as required by SARA Title III.  Maintenance procedures with documented schedules have been implemented to ensure that potential equipment failures are reduced due to improved maintenance and inspection activities.  Procedures have been improved and a more accurate documentation system has been implemented.  Additional training programs are still ongoing."
