The facility manufactures silicones, silanes and metal-organic compounds and utilizes various process equipment in the manufacture of its products including closed reactors with condensers, dryers, powder blenders, mills and air pollution control equipment.  The highly specialized chemical substances manufactured at the facility are used primarily as intermediates in the manufacture of numerous products that include, but are not limited to micro-electronic, diagnostic, optical, pharmaceutical and cosmetic products.  \r\n\r\nRegulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nThe facility stores dimethyldichlorosilane above the OSHA and EPA threshold quantities of 1000 lbs and 5000 lbs, respectively.  Dimethyldichlorosilane is a toxic and highly flammable liquid.  It is also water reactive.  Dimethyldichlorosilane reacts with water, moist air or steam to produce heat and corrosive, toxic vapors of hydrogen chloride.   Methyltrichlorosilane is also stored at the facility above the OSHA and EPA  threshold quantities of 500 and 5000 lbs, respectively.  Methyltrichlorosilane has hazard characteristics similar to that of dimethyldichlorosilane. The facility also stores cylinders of Tetramethylsilane which is a flammable substance.  A cylinder of tetramethylsilane contains a maximum quantity of 1400 kg or 3086 lbs. These cylinders,however, may be co-located for storage in an amount above the 10,000 lb RMP threshold quantity.  The facility has a process hazard management system to comply with both the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard and the Environmental Protection Agency's Risk Management Program (RMP), Program 3 requirements.  \r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n \r\nSenior management is committed to continuous efforts to"

The production buildings are constructed according to the NFPA 68, damage limiting construction standard and the NFPA 69, vapor detection and evacuation ventilation standard.  In addition, the facility has a fire alarm system and foam fire suppression system with an onsite foam storage tank that provides fire protection inside and outside the buildings.  Inside the buildings, there are both water and foam fire protection sprinkler systems and hose reels.  Outside the building, chemical storage areas can be protected by fire hoses and fire monitor nozzles.  \r\n\r\nThe facility has several monitoring systems to check the function of system safeguards and engineering controls designed to prevent hazardous conditions which could potentially cause a fire or accidental release.  These monitoring systems include smoke and lower explosive limit (LEL) detectors, monitors to detect failures in the operation of nitrogen generating equipment, ventilation/exhaust fans, freeze protection equipment and the electrical system.   The proper operation of these critical safety systems is monitored on a 24-hour basis.  \r\n\r\nAll Gelest production personnel are degreed chemists/chemical engineers or have a minimum of two years of college chemistry which provides a higher level of understanding related to the hazards of the chemicals handled and manufacturing processes at the facility.  Employees are trained in process hazard management system requirements.  They also receive frequent safety training on topics that include safety and physical hazards of the materials and processes to which they will be exposed, information on safe work practices and procedures that they must know to prevent accidental release during handling and storing chemicals, and emergency alarms and evacuat"

Specific training on RMP/PSM covered processes is performed to ensure standard operating procedures, emergency procedures, safeguards and work practices are understood.  In addition, approximately 80% of production personnel have received 40-hour OSHA HAZWOPER emergency response training which is the highest level of training possible.\r\n\r\nProduction and maintenance employees receive specific training on the health and safety hazards of regulated chemicals and on specific operating procedures for storage and transfer operations when affected by work on or near a covered process. Maintenance personnel are also trained and follow specific preventative maintenance procedures to ensure the integrity of the equipment is maintained for safe operation.  Contractors received safety orientation on PSM and RMP covered processes.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\n\r\nThe facility has employees who are designated emergency response team members that are trained at the Hazardous Materials Technician level or above and will respond to a release for the purpose of stopping the release. Employees trained as emergency responders receive annual refresher training and practice emergency response drills.  All production and R&D staff also receive hands-on training in the use of fire extinguishers, hose reels and fire monitor nozzles. The local fire department tours the plant annually to familiarize personnel with the operations, layout and emergency response procedures at facility.   The facility's emergency response plan is shared with local fire, police and the local emergency planning committee.

These improvements include: installation of additional fire monitor nozzles to provide added fire protection coverage for outdoor chemical storage areas and the construction of additional chemical storage areas to improve  chemical segregation and separation."
