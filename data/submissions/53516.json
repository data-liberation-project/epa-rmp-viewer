These PHAs are revalidated at least every 5 years, and will be conducted at this frequency until the process no longer contains hazardous chemicals above the threshold quantities. The recommendations from these revalidated PHAs are also forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of each revalidated PHA recommendation is documented and retained.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe Kripple Kreek Gas Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, (6) out of service (shutdown) mode, and (7) initial startup of a new process. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate. In addition, the Kripple Kreek Gas Plant maintains information on how to respond to upper or lower limit exceedances for specific process or equipment parameters. This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\nTraining\n\nToo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Kripple Kreek Gas Plant has implemented a comprehensive training program for employees involved in operating a process.

Kripple Kreek Gas Plant personnel periodically monitor contractor performance with respect to their safety obligations, and provide contractors with applicable safety performance feedback.\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\nThe Kripple Kreek Gas Plant conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information. The purpose of the PSSR is to see that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service. This review provides one additional check that construction is in accordance with the design specifications and required safety systems are operationally ready. A PSSR also verifies that appropriate safety, operational and maintenance procedures are in place, and adequate training has been provided to the appropriate personnel. A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented. \n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe Kripple Kreek Gas Plant has established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition. The basic aspects of this program include: (1) utilization of appropriately trained maintenance personnel, (2) developing written procedures, and (3) performing inspections and tests, and correcting identified deficiencies.

The goal of each investigation is to determine the factors that may have led to the incident, and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team documents its recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to Kripple Kreek Gas Plant management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's recommendations are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the recommendations. Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future and revalidated PHAs.\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nTo determine that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the Kripple Kreek Gas Plant will periodically conduct an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented. Compliance audits will be conducted at least every 3 years. Personnel familiar with the facility and Process Safety Management participate in these audits. The audit team develops findings that will be forwarded to Kripple Kreek Gas Plant management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports will be retained. \n\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION "
