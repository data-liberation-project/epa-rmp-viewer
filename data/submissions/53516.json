After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years, or more frequently upon request. All of this training is documented for each operator, including skills demonstration used to verify that the operator understood the training. Process maintenance personnel are trained in their perspective duties for maintaining the mechanical integrity of critical process equipment and systems.

The goal of each investigation is to determine the factors that may have led to the incident, and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team documents its recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to Kripple Kreek Gas Plant management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's recommendations are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the recommendations. Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future and revalidated PHAs.\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nTo determine that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the Kripple Kreek Gas Plant will periodically conduct an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented. Compliance audits will be conducted at least every 3 years. Personnel familiar with the facility and Process Safety Management participate in these audits. The audit team develops findings that will be forwarded to Kripple Kreek Gas Plant management for resolution.

This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment. This information, in combination with procedures and equipment operating history, provides a basis for inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes so safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nThe Kripple Kreek Gas Plant has a comprehensive program to identify and control hazards associated with the various processes that are identified and controlled. Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify potential hazards and controls in place to manage these hazards, and recommend additional controls, as appropriate.\n\nThe Kripple Kreek Gas Plant uses a variety and combination of applicable methodologies to conduct PHAs. These PHAs address (1) facility siting, (2) human factors, (3) qualitative evaluation of a range of the possible safety and health effects of failure of controls on personnel, and (4) one or more of the following methodologies appropriate to determine and evaluate the hazards of the process, (a) What-if, (b) Checklist, c Hazard and Operability (HAZOP), (d) Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA), (e) Fault Tree Analysis, and/or (f) an appropriate equivalent methodology. \n\nPHAs are conducted using a team of people who have the appropriate operating and maintenance experience for the process, as well as engineering expertise. This PHA team identifies and evaluates potential hazards of the process, as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and then makes recommendations for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures. \n\nThe PHA team recommendations are forwarded to local management for resolution.

The approved mitigation options in response to PHA team recommendations are tracked until they are completed. The final resolution of each recommendation is documented and retained.\n\nThe Kripple Kreek Gas Plant periodically revalidates these PHAs. These PHAs are revalidated at least every 5 years, and will be conducted at this frequency until the process no longer contains hazardous chemicals above the threshold quantities. The recommendations from these revalidated PHAs are also forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of each revalidated PHA recommendation is documented and retained.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe Kripple Kreek Gas Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, (6) out of service (shutdown) mode, and (7) initial startup of a new process. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate. In addition, the Kripple Kreek Gas Plant maintains information on how to respond to upper or lower limit exceedances for specific process or equipment parameters. This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\nTraining\n\nToo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Kripple Kreek Gas Plant has implemented a comprehensive training program for employees involved in operating a process. New operational employees receive training on the Kripple Kreek Gas Plant's Operating Procedures, and basic training in process o"

In addition, the Kripple Kreek Gas Plant evaluates contractor safety programs and performance prior to selection of a contractor. Kripple Kreek Gas Plant personnel periodically monitor contractor performance with respect to their safety obligations, and provide contractors with applicable safety performance feedback.\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\nThe Kripple Kreek Gas Plant conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information. The purpose of the PSSR is to see that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service. This review provides one additional check that construction is in accordance with the design specifications and required safety systems are operationally ready. A PSSR also verifies that appropriate safety, operational and maintenance procedures are in place, and adequate training has been provided to the appropriate personnel. A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented. \n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe Kripple Kreek Gas Plant has established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition. The basic aspects of this program include: (1) utilization of appropriately trained maintenance personnel, (2) developing written procedures, and (3) performing inspections and tests, and correcting identified deficiencies. In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.\n\nMaintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and healt"

Written inspection, testing and maintenance procedures provide that work is performed in a consistent manner, and serve as a basis for training maintenance personnel in their relative assigned duties. Inspections and tests are performed to help verify equipment functions as intended and that equipment is within acceptable limits. If a deficiency is identified that presents an immediate safety concern, Kripple Kreek Gas Plant personnel will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service. \n\nSafe Work Practices\n\nThe Kripple Kreek Gas Plant has safe work practices in place to help provide worker and process safety. Examples of these include (1) safe practices manaul, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to isolate energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work), and (4) a permit and procedure to verify that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space. These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help perform operations and maintenance activities safely.\n\nManagement of Change\n\nThe Kripple Kreek Gas Plant has a comprehensive system to manage changes to all covered processes. This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including operating conditions of the process), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.
