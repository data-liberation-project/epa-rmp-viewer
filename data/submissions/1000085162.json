      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) requires that facilities having regulated substances above listed threshold quantities must develop a formal Risk Management Program (RMProgram) and register and submit a Risk Management Plan.  These regulations apply to an estimated 7,200 public and private drinking water and wastewater treatment facilities that use significant quantities of chlorine or ammonia.\n\n    This rule was formulated to decrease the number and severity of serious chemical accidents.  The EPA regulation applies to facilities that manufacture, process, use, store, or otherwise handle regulated extremely hazardous substances in quantities that exceed specified thresholds (40 CFR Part 68 Subpart C).\n\n    The Municipal Authority of the City of New Kensington's  H. Burns Smith Water Treatment Plant operates under the following objectives:  to provide sufficient water of safe, sanitary quality, and to provide an attractive water, which is free from objectionable turbidity, color, taste and odor.  In order to achieve these objectives, the implementation of Chlorine treatment is a necessity.  Due to the large volume of customers served by the H. Burns Smith Water Treatment Plant (over 47,000 persons), subsequently large volumes of Chlorine must be available on-site for the effective treatment process.\n\n    In compliance with the EPA's Risk Management Rule, the Municipal Authority of the City of New Kensington and Gibson-Thomas Engineering Co., Inc. have developed a Risk Management Plan that will not only aid in preventing avoidable accidents, but also better inform the public as to the many steps and precautions involved in the process of safe water treatment and distribution, and the necessary conduct to follow in the event of a chlorine release at the H. Burns Smith Water Treatment Plant.\n\n    The H. Burns Smith Water Treatment Plant is located at 2200 Constitution Boulevard in New Kensington, Pennsylvania.  The Plant is owned a"

The Authority supplies water to domestic, commercial and industrial users in the City of New Kensington and surrounding areas.\n\n    Chlorine is the only EPA-regulated chemical stored at levels above EPA RMP threshold quanity on-site at the H. Burns Smith Water Treatment Plant.  Approximately 8,000 lbs. of chlorine are stored in four (4) 2,000 lbs. vessels.   As part of the EPA compliance, a worst-case scenario predicated on the release of chlorine gas has been modeled utilizing the EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables and software applications.  The worst-case release quantity has been determined to be 2,000 lbs. (1 full vessel), at a release rate of 200 lbs./minute for a 10-minute duration.  In this highly unlikely scenario, the affected area would be a 0.90 mile radius from the center of the treatment facility (chlorine feed room).   In this situation, approximately 7,310 persons living within the radius area could potentially be subject to the affects of the chlorine gas.\n\n    An alternative release scenario is modeled after an occurrence that is more likely to occur than the total release of a 2,000 lbs. vessel.  In this alternative situation, chlorine gas would be released during a transfer hose failure during the connection process of a full tank in the chlorine feed room located at the center of the facility.  According to the model, approximately 317 lbs. of chlorine gas would be released at a rate of 10.5 lbs./minute over a one-hour duration.  The outcome of this type of release is much less severe than that of the worst-case scenario results.  The affected area is shown to be a radius of only 0.10 miles, affecting no persons.   \n\n    Flammable chemical modeling was not required for this RMP because the H. Burns Smith Water Treatment Plant does not house flammable chemicals in quantities exceeding EPA threshold requirements.\n\n    As part of the Risk Management Plan compliance, each facility is requir"

Section 6 of the plan is reserved for any reportable accidents or chemical spills that have occurred in the last five years.  This Five Year Accident History portion of the current plan remains vacant because no reportable accidents or spills have occurred within the last five years.  In the event that a release occurs, it will be documented accordingly and the EPA will be notified in writing.\n\n    The main goal of the Level 2 Prevention Program (Section 8) is to reduce the risk to employees and the public of injury or death from the accidental release of chemicals.  The requirements of the Level 2 Prevention Program are detailed in 40 CFR 68.48 through 68.60 and include safety information, hazard review, operating procedures, training, maintenance, compliance audits and incident investigations.  \n\n"
