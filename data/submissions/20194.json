The system contains approximately 13,500 pounds of anhydrous ammonia which is liquified under pressure.\n  \nJ. W. Allen & Company endeavors to eliminate accidents and health hazards to our Associates, customers, and the community by providing our Associates educational training, safe working conditions, and the means to increase awareness of potential dangers both on and off the job.  J. W. Allen & Company's objective is to prevent unwanted releases of ammonia into locations that could potentially expose Associates and others to serious hazards.  An effective program requires a systematic approach to evaluating the entire system.  Workplace and process safety are major concerns to management and Associates alike.  The prevention and mitigation of unwanted releases of ammonia into locations that could expose Associates and the community to serious hazards is of primary concern.   \n\nJ. W. Allen & Company has developed this program in accordance with OSHA Title 29 CFR 1910.119, and the USEPA Title 40 CFR Part 68.  The program is designed to inform all Associates of the hazards of ammonia, procedures for the safe use of ammonia, and the steps taken for the safety of Associates in the event of a release or spill (i.e., emergency response plan, management of change procedures, preventative maintenance program, associate training, etc.).  In addition, Rich Products Corporation (the parent company of J. W. Allen & Company as of January 22, 2000) has generated \"The 15 Point Plus Health and Safety Program\" which outlines the corporate policy for safety policies, safety procedures, and sample programs to be implemented at each facility owned by Rich Products Corporation. \n\nJ. W. Allen & Company has performed a worst case release scenario and an alternative release scenario to determine the potential impact of an unmitigated release on the surrounding "

      "SummaryText": "community.  The worst case release scenario would impact approximately a 0.9 mile radius from the facility and the alternative release scenario would impact approximately a 0.2 mile radius from the facility.  Therefore, each scenario has a potential offsite impact.  The worst case release scenario looked at a potential release from the intercooler which contains approximately 2,700 pounds of ammonia.  The alternative release scenario also dealt with a potential release from the intercooler through a 1/4-inch hole in this pressure vessel.   USEPA's RMP Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration reference tables and equations were used in determining the worst case and alternative release scenarios offsite impacts.  A release of either nature is unlikely due to the following:  J. W. Allen & Company Associates perform routine visual inspections and maintenance on all components which comprise the system, the system has automatic system shutdown capabilities, the intercooler has liquid level alarms which result in the automatic shutdown of the system and includes liquid level sight glasses which are inspected hourly and must lie in a safe operating range or the system is shutdown, the intercooler is monitored for pressure and will result in a system shutdown if a high pressure situation is reached, the intercooler has solenoid valves which control the flow to each device and will open and close dependant upon the liquid levels detected and thereby minimize the potential of a release, and the intercooler has pressure relief valves which will vent to the roof if a high pressure situation is encountered.\n\nThe emergency response program was written to comply with OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119 (n), OSHA 29 CFR 1910.20, and USEPA 40 CFR 68.95.  These regulations establish the parameters to be included in the ammonia refrigeration emergency response program.  J. W.
