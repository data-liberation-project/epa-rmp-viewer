      "SummaryText": "INTRODUCTION:\n\n\n\nThis document was prepared to satisfy the five-year requirement to update the Risk Management Program (\"RMP\") for the Mogadore Performance Chemicals Plant (\"Mogadore Plant\") of OMNOVA Solutions Inc. (\"OMNOVA\"). This RMP update conforms to the most current legal requirements established by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\"). The purpose of the RMP is to:\n\n\n\n>> Describe existing safety systems at the Mogadore Plant designed to protect employees, the community, the environment, and the process; and\n\n>> Comply with applicable environmental laws and EPA regulations (Section 112r of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 and Title 40, Part 68 of the Code of Federal Regulations).\n\n\n\nThe following is an overview of the Mogadore Plant's accident prevention and emergency response programs:\n\n\n\nCOMMITMENT TO SAFETY:\n\n\n\nOMNOVA and the Mogadore Plant are and always have been committed to safe operations as their number one priority. This commitment begins with highly qualified people and is reflected at all levels of the operation. All employees at the Mogadore Plant are provided with the training, tools, and authority to perform their duties in a safe manner. Strict operational procedures and controls are in place to ensure safety from the conceptual stage through product development, manufacturing, handling and storage, and delivery to customers. The Mogadore Plant has a staff of highly qualified safety and environmental professionals, engineers, and support personnel to assure implementation of, and an on-going commitment to, the highest standards of safe process management. Their experience and professional competence have resulted in many years of safe operation which consistently exceed industry averages.\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF REGULATED PROCESS:\n\n\n\nThe Mogadore Plant produces synthetic styrene-butadiene, styrene-butadiene-acrylonitrile, and styrene-acrylic polymer products used mainly in the paper, textile and specialty industries. The RMP-regulated"

      "SummaryText": " substances used to manufacture these products are 1,3-butadiene (CAS 106-99-0), acrylonitrile (CAS 107-13-1), and 28% ammonium hydroxide solution (CAS 7664-41-7 for ammonia). 1,3-Butadiene is the only regulated flammable substance on-site; acrylonitrile and 28% ammonium hydroxide solution are the regulated toxic substances on-site. Finished products are non-hazardous polymers and take the form of a low-viscosity, milky-white liquid emulsion.\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\n\n\n\nEPA regulations require regulated facilities to provide information about all accidents in the last five years involving an RMP-regulated substance if the accident resulted in (1) death, injury according to the RMP definition, or significant property damage on-site, or (2) known deaths, injuries, or property or environmental damage off-site. The Mogadore Plant had no accidents meeting this regulatory definition within the last five years.\n\n\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENTS:\n\n\n\nEPA regulations, Process Safety Management (\"PSM\") requirements under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, and the Responsible Care(R) Initiative of the American Chemistry Council require the Mogadore Plant to conduct hazard assessments of regulated processes. EPA regulations specifically require off-site consequence analyses in the form of worst-case scenarios and alternative release scenarios for certain regulated substances.\n\n\n\nOMNOVA believes that the worst-case scenarios required to be disclosed under the RMP regulations likely overstate the risk of a worst-case release. Models such as RMP*Comp still result in highly improbable and, in some cases, physically impossible risk scenarios.\n\n\n\nOMNOVA has also prepared alternative release scenarios which it believes are more accurate predictions of potential accidental releases from the Mogadore Plant. Alternative release scenarios are, by definition, more likely to occur than worst-case scenarios, but even they are still improbable because of engineering and administrative controls "

      "SummaryText": "in place at the Mogadore Plant.\n\n\n\nWORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS:\n\n\n\nEPA regulations require facilities to develop one worst-case scenario to represent all toxic substances and one worst-case scenario to represent all flammable substances from lists of regulated materials. Additional worst-case scenarios are required if different public receptors (off-site residences, businesses, or community buildings within a possible impact radius) could be affected by the release of another regulated material. OMNOVA is not subject to this additional requirement.\n\n\n\nDescriptions of the worst-case and alternative release scenarios have been removed from this Executive Summary consistent with the requirements at 40 CFR 68.155, as amended on April 9, 2004 (69 FR 18819).\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM:\n\n\n\nOMNOVA began a formal PSM program at its Mogadore Plant in 1992 after OSHA promulgated regulations at 29 CFR 1910.119. The effectiveness of the PSM program, in conjunction with high-quality engineering design, employee safety programs, Responsible Care(R) implementation, EPA's RMP requirements, and emergency response programs, make up OMNOVA's Accidental Release Prevention Program. Safety systems in place at the Mogadore Plant include combustible gas sensors and alarms, automatic controls, automatic shutdown systems, deluge water systems, secondary containment dikes and below-grade vaults, and employees specially trained in chemical handling and emergency response.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN:\n\n\n\nOMNOVA's overall safety efforts at the Mogadore Plant consist of measures to prevent the release of hazardous materials, as well as programs to mitigate the effects of an actual release. The Mogadore Plant has a trained and properly equipped team of volunteer emergency responders capable of handling most foreseeable emergency situations. Importantly, coordination with local safety forces is a key element of the emergency response planning process. Specific plans are"

All PSM-covered process equipment designs and modifications are subject to formal Process Hazard Analysis (\"PHA\") procedures. During a PHA, recommendations are made for the improvement of the process. Since 1992, when the PSM regulations were promulgated, over 500 recommendations for process improvements have been implemented. Application of new design principles to existing equipment is also an important element of continuous process safety improvement. In addition, formal accident and incident investigation procedures are in place so that causes of even the smallest failures are identified and corrected."
