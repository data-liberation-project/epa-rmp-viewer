ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY POLICIES\n\n     Fieldbrook Foods recognizes management's responsibility in protecting it's employees, equipment, property, and the environment. The safety and health of all personnel are very important.  The control of accidents has been and will continue to be a basic responsibility of all personnel in the facility.\n\n     The Fieldbrook Foods PSM/RMP program assigns and documents the specific responsibilities for developing, implementing and integrating the OSHA PSM and the EPA RMP standards into its safety program.  The PSM/RMP program focuses attention on \"Making PSM/RMP the way we manage our ammonia based refrigeration system\" rather than a project we expect to complete and put on the shelf when the filing date has passed.\n\n     Fieldbrook Foods believes that Employee participation is the key to a successful program.  Operating level employees, particularly the Maintenance Supervisor and the Refrigeration System Operators, have been deeply involved in implementing the PSM/RMP Program and they assume the major responsibility for operating the Dunkirk, NY facility safely.\n\n     The Fieldbrook Foods Emergency Response Program has been developed with the complete cooperation and support of the Dunkirk Fire Department.  All Fieldbrook Foods employees have received documented emergency response training.\n\n\nII.  STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\n     Fieldbrook Foods is a Producer of Ice Cream Products.  Anhydrous Ammonia is the only Hazardous Material on site in quantities above the threshold quantity.\n\nIII.  SUMMARY OF WORST CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nFor Off-Site Consequence (OCA) data please refer to onsite documentation at Fieldbrook Foods.\n\n\nIV.   DESCRIPTION OF THE FIELDBROOK FOODS ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n     Fieldbrook Foods conducts an annual training and response exercise with the Dunkirk Fire Department to practice, train and update the Emergency Response Program.\n"

Fieldbrook Foods considers the PSM/RMP manuals to be \"living\" documents that must be updated and revised regularly to maintain their viability.\n\n     Fieldbrook Foods emphasizes and insists on  \"employee participation\" from the refrigeration system operators in all aspects of the developent, implementation, and integration of their PSM/RMP program.\n\n     Fieldbrook Foods provides a comprehensive, computer based, user friendly training program with \"one-on-one\" teacher involvement in specific training modules for each ammonia refrigeration employee.\n\n     Fieldbrook Foods maintains a pro-active \"open-door\" policy toward neighbors and concerned community citizens.  Facility tours and risk management discussions are scheduled and conducted upon written request.\n\nV.  FIVE YEAR ACCIDENTAL RELEASE HISTORY\n\n     There have been no releases of ammonia at Fieldbrook Foods, Dunkirk facility that resulted in an injury, or that had an off-site impact, or that resulted in significant property damage either on-site or off-site.\n\nVI.  Emergency Response Program\n\n     Facility employees have been trained to respond to accidental ammonia release.  The site emergency plan has been coordinated with the community emergency plan under the jurisdiction of the Local Dunkirk Fire Department.\n\nVII.  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n      Fieldbrook Foods recognizes that (even though their Ammonia release and injury experience has been excellent) their PSM/RMP program will provide much needed improvement to their safety effort. The PSM/RMP program is considered to be a set of \"living\" documents and procedures that will require constant attention, development, and revision before \"Safety\" becomes second nature.\n\n     Fieldbrook Foods expects to improve safety performance by emphasizing  the following elements of their PSM/"
