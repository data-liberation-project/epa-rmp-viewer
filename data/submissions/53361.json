The WCS is considered to be unrealistic because it does not reflect actual operating conditions, nor allow credit for existing mitigation measures that have been identified.  Based on the review conducted when preparing this executive summary, the ARS is considered a more realistic scenario and takes into account actual operating conditions.\n\nThe following are summaries of the toxic and flammable WCS and ARS modeling at Motiva.  All OCA release modeling was performed using the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\u00bfs (USEPA) RMP*Comp Version 1.07 off-site consequence analysis program.  Population estimates, public receptors and environmental receptors were analyzed using the U.S. Department of Commerce, Economics and Statistics Administration, BUREAU OF THE CENSUS LandView\u00ae VI Environmental Mapping Software (2003).  \n\nAlthough the RMP rule does not allow credit for the consideration of mitigation measures in WCS modeling, various prevention measures that are in place should reduce the likelihood of the WCS and its impacts should it occur.  These measures include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n- Mechanical integrity inspection and preventive maintenance programs;\n- Routine surveillance by trained operators;\n- Various audible and visual alarm and notification systems;\n- Responder call-out, incident command establishment and staging, and agency notification, as necessary.\n\n1. Toxic Worst-Case Release Scenario \u00bf Anhydrous Ammonia\n\nThe worst-case toxic release scenario involves the catastrophic failure of the anhydrous ammonia storage tank (PV-82) resulting in the release of 74,970 lbs of anhydrous ammonia.

Bayou Trepagnier, a designated scenic stream adjacent to the northern side of the facility, may also be impacted.\n\n2. Toxic Alternative Release Scenario #1 \u00bf Chlorine\n\nThis scenario involves the failure of a 9/16\u00bf fusible plug on a one-ton chlorine cylinder.  The fusible plug is assumed to fail on the liquid side of the cylinder and was estimated to empty the cylinder contents in approximately 10 minutes.  No passive (i.e. containment) mitigations were applied to the release model calculation.  The release calculation assumes urban topography due to the close proximity of congested process areas.  This scenario was selected because of a 1998 incident in the industry which involved a fusible plug failure on the vapor side of a chlorine cylinder.  The endpoint distance was calculated at 0.3 miles (1,584 ft).  A population estimate of 210 people off-site, primarily located in residential areas, could be potentially affected by the release.  No environmental receptors were identified.  \n\n3.

A calculated amount of 835 lbs of ammonia is released in approximately 5 minutes before mitigation of the leak can occur.

Toxic Alternative Release Scenario #3 \u00bf Hydrochloric Acid\n\nThe hydrochloric acid (HCl) storage tank (L-432) has a release as a result of a 3\u00bf transfer hose line break during vessel charging.  A calculated amount of 28,900 lbs of HCl will be released in approximately 10 minutes before mitigation of the leak can occur.  This scenario was selected due to (1) a history of similar releases that occurred over the last 8 years on this tank during transfer operations and (2) the location of the vessel with respect to off-site receptors.  The release calculation assumes urban topography due to the close proximity of congested process areas.  A 750 cubic foot dike area encompasses the storage tank and was including in the model as a passive mitigation technique.  The endpoint distance was calculated at 0.2 miles (1,056 ft).  A population estimate of 182 people off-site, primarily located in residential areas, could be potentially affected by the release.  No environmental receptors were identified.\n\n5. Toxic Alternative Release Scenario #4 \u00bf Hydrogen Sulfide\n\nThe block valve on the overhead vapor line in the HPLT separator (PV-1983) is inadvertently closed off creating an overpressure in the separator.  Approximately 95 lbs per minute of hydrogen sulfide would be released for 10 minutes before emergency responders could contain the situation.
