If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Walhonding Valley Fire District, or other authorities, to mitigate the release and to minimize the off site impact of a release.  \n\n2.    Facility Information\nThe primary activity of Warren Lapp and Son is farming. One of the nutrients used is nitrogen. To supply nitrogen, anhydrous ammonia is used. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored in two bulk storage containers, and distributed on site for use on the owner?s crops and for sale to local farmers.\n  \n3.    Description of the RMP operation\nThe RMP covered process consists of:\n?    Two bulk storage containers for anhydrous ammonia\n?    A receiving station where tank trucks connect and delivery anhydrous ammonia into the containers\n?    A filling station where the anhydrous ammonia is transferred from the storage containers into nurse tanks\n?    The nurse tanks are built for and are carried into the field for application.\n\n4.    Worst case release scenario\nThe EPA defined worst case scenario is for the total quantity in the largest container to be released in 10 minutes. The quantity of ammonia in the larger bulk storage container is enough to have an offsite consequence.\n\nThe largest container has a water capacity of 18,000 gallon. For ammonia this equates to 15,300 gallons of 78,500 pounds. The worst case release scenario is thus a release of 7875 pounds per minute for 10 minute. Using RMP Comp and the EPA defined atmospheric parameters the distance to the toxic endpoint, 0.14 mg/liter, is 5.1 miles.  \n  \n5.    Administrative Controls\nAs anhydrous ammonia is a liquid under pressure (in a closed container) expansion of the liquid must be taken into account. To address this liquid expansion due to a rise in temperature the liquid ammonia maximum quantity in the container is restricted to 85% of the water capacity of the containe"

Alternative release scenario\nAfter reviewing many scenarios that would result in a release of ammonia, the event that was predicted to have the most likely possibility of occurring was the rupture of a delivery or transfer hose containing liquid anhydrous ammonia during the filling of a nurse tank. This is calculated to result in a release of about 360 pounds per minute of ammonia and could take 1 hour to control the release. This time is estimated as the time for the HazMat team to arrive, suit up, and turn off the valves necessary to stop the release. This scenario was selected as most likely to occur and have a greater impact then other scenarios. \n\nUsing RMP Comp the distance to a toxic endpoint is 0.4 miles. This distance is enough to have an offsite impact. \n  \n7.    Accidental release history\nAn accidental release history has been maintained and documented since 1994 and there have been no accidental releases of ammonia. The history is maintained annually as long as there are no accidental releases of as soon as possible if there is an accidental release of ammonia.\n  \n8.    Accidental release prevention program\nThe ammonia system will be inspected on a schedule, checklist will be completed, and all findings will be addressed and documented.\nEmployees using the ammonia system will be trained in the proper use of the system and safety precautions of ammonia.\nOhio Department of Agriculture inspectors audit the ammonia system and all findings are addressed.\n\n9.    Emergency Response Program\nThe employees of Warren Lapp and Son will not respond to a major release of ammonia. They are instructed to close any valves they can and evacuate the area, then call 911. The ammonia process is known by the local Fire Department and has inspected the site. \n\n10.
