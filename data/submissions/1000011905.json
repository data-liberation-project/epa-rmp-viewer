      "SummaryText": "Paris Wastewater Treatment Plant, located at 6500 Martin Luther King Blvd., Paris, KY, has one independent chlorine and sulfur dioxide injection system.  The chlorine and sulfur dioxide storage and feed systems are located outdoors.  The chlorination and sulfur dioxide injector process is located inside a building.  Both the chlorine and sulfur dioxide systems have one (1) one-ton container on-line and one (1) one-ton container on standby at any one time.  Usually, there are containers containing chlorine or sulfur dioxide in storage.  The system is operated under vacuum using gases.  There is a Vacuum Regulator-Check Unit (Wallace & Tiernan 500 lb/24 hour capacity) which automaticlly shuts off the cylinder in the event of a break in the vacuum line.  The chlorine supply system automatically switches between the on-line and standby chlorine containers when the on-line container is depleted.  A similar system is used to supply sulfur dioxide (Wallace & Tiernan 475 lb/24 hour capacity).\n\nThe Facility has chlorine and sulfur dioxide detectors to monitor leakage in the chlorinator/sulfonator room.  The sensors are located at about twelve (12) inches above floor level.  The detectors will automatically alarm at the Facility and at the main control room panel.\n\nAll gas cylinders (empty and full) are stored on the loading dock.  The Facility normally has a maximum of 4,000 plus pounds of chlorine and sulfur dioxide at the site at any one time.  Deliveries are arranged to take place when all cylinders are near empty.  During chlorine/sulfur dioxide deliveries, the delivery truck backs up to the unloading area and the cylinders are taken off the truck via the Facility crane and placed onto the dock.\n\nNormally, the chlorinator/sulfur dioxide injector room is secured with doors that remain closed except when the system is being inspected.  Inspection takes place daily.  If a chlorine/sulfur dioxide leak is detected, the respective alarm will sound and the Operator will notify"

The Operator and Standby will don the Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA) and the Operator will then investigate the cause for the alarm.  Exhaust fans will be activated from the exterior of the building.  The air inside the building is evacuated and fresh air is drawn into the building through upper and lower vents, respectively.  The Standby will remain outdoors in contact with the Operator, ready to call for assistance if needed.  The Operator and Standby are trained in chlorine safety and emergency procedures.  The Operator will shut the chlorine cylinder.  If the leakage is not stopped the Fire Department will be contacted and the exhaust fans shut down to try to contain the leak within the building.\n\nThe Facility has not had an accidental release of chlorine or sulfur dioxide from these covered processes in the five years prior to the submission of this Risk Management Plan (RMP)."
