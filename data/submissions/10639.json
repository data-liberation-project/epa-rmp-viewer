We limit the use of hazardous substances.  Before using a hazardous substance, less hazardous alternatives are considered.  When a hazardous substance is used, consideration is given to the potential for this substance to adversely affect our workers, the public, and the environment, and we take steps to prevent any such effects.\n\nThe safety program consists of a number of elements, only some of which are required by the RMP rule.

This facility implements reasonable prevention programs to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances.  These controls include training programs for personnel; programs to help ensure safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of processes; and programs to evaluate the hazards at this facility.\n\nIn the event of an accidental release, we control and contain the release in a manner that will be safe for workers and will help prevent injury to the public or the environment.  This facility coordinates response efforts with the local emergency response personnel.\n\n\nREGULATED SUBSTANCES\nThis facility is primarily involved in the recovery of liquid hydrocarbons from a gas stream.  As part of this process, we handle several regulated, flammable substances in sufficient quantities to be covered by the RMP rule.  There are no such quantities of regulated toxic substances handled at the Plant.  The following RMP-regulated flammables are found at the Plant:\nEthane\nMethane\nPropane\nIso-Butane\nButane\nIso-Pentane\nPentane\n\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\nAn offsite consequence analysis was performed to estimate the potential for an accidental release of a regulated substance to affect the public or the environment.  The offsite consequence analysis consists of evaluating both worst-case release scenarios and alternate release scenarios.  We do not expect a worst-case release scenario to ever occur.  The alternate release scenarios were selected to help the local fire department or, if applicable,  emerge"

An alternate release scenario represents a release that: \n1) might occur at this facility\n2) would result in the greatest potential offsite consequences if the release occurred.\n\nThe main objective of performing the offsite consequence analysis is to determine the distance at which certain effects might occur to the public because of an accidental release (called the endpoint distance).    At distances less than the endpoint distance, the effects could be greater; at distances greater than the endpoint distance, the effects would be less.\n\nThe Worst-Case release Scenario (WCS) for flammable substances is failure of the Condensate Storage Tanks (V-21, V-22  or V-23), resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  Each tank can contain up to 35,000 gallons of Natural Gas Liquids (NGL). No administrative controls or passive mitigation were considered for this release scenario although procedures do exist which usually limit the filling to 80%.  The maximum distance to the overpressure endpoint is 0.46 miles.  Few public receptors are located within this distance.\n\nThe Alternate Release Scenario (ARS) for flammable substances is a hose rupture at the NGL loading station while loading a truck with natural gas liquids. This scenario assumes that the flammable substances (ethane, propane, butane, pentane, and condensate) are released through the ruptured hose for 30 seconds before workers detect the release, initiate the pump shutdown and isolation of the piping section.  The substances form a pool, which ignites and results in a pool fire. Using the methods in the EPA's Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance, the predicted distance to the flammable endpoint is 0.02 miles. There are no residents, public receptors, or environmental receptors within this distance. \n\n\nPREVENTION PROGRAM\nThis facility uses a prevention program to help prevent accidental releases of hazardous substances.

In 1996, the EPA RMP rule established two levels of prevention program requirements.  Program 3 is essentially the same as OSHA PSM, except that the program also focuses on protecting the public and the environment. Our Program 3 prevention program, which applies to this plant, consists of the following 12 elements:  \n \nEmployee Participation - We provide for participation by it's employees in all aspects of our process operations. Employees are actively involved in the maintenance of our process safety programs.  \n\nProcess Safety Information - We maintain a variety of technical documents that are used to help ensure safe operation of our processes.  These documents address:  \n1) Physical properties of hazardous substances handled\n2) Operating parameters of the equipment\n3) Design basis and configuration of the equipment  \n  \nMaterial safety data sheets (MSDSs) document the physical properties of hazardous substances handled, including regulated substances in covered processes.  MSDSs for hazardous substances handled in each process are available in the Plant's MSDS book so that personnel have ready reference to this information. The information available for each hazardous substance typically includes:  \n1) Toxicity information and permissible exposure limits\n2) Physical data (e.g., boiling point, melting point, flash point)\n3) Reactivity and corrosivity data\n4) Thermal and chemical stability data\n5) Hazards of mixing substances in the process.  \n\nThe engineering design documents include the operating parameters and the design basis and configuration of the equipment in each covered process.

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.  The What-If?/ Checklist analysis technique is the primary tool used to perform these evaluations.   The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience, as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process, as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.  The PHA team findings are forwarded to local and company corporate management for resolution.  To help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the plant updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results at least once every 5 years.   \n \nOperating Procedures - This facility maintains written operating procedures that address various modes of process operations. These procedures are used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.

New employees receive basic training in gas plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a qualified operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.  To ensure training is adequate and serves the safety of employees, operators are consulted with on the type and frequency of their training.\n \nContractors - This facility uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors:  \n1) perform their work in a safe manner\n2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills\n3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace\n4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency\n5) understand and follow site safety rules\n6) inform gas plant personnel of any hazards they find during their work\n\nThis is accomplished by providing contractors with a process overview, information about safety and health hazards, emergency response plan requirements, and safe work practices prior to their beginning work. In addition, CIG evaluates contractor safety programs and their past performance before selection of a contractor is made.  Facility personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSR)  - A PSSR is conducted at this facility for any major"

The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.    \n \nMechanical Integrity - This facility has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems and safety systems in a safe operating condition.  Written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training.  Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels).  If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or a management of change team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment. Another integral part of the MI program is quality assurance.  Quality assurance measures are incorporated into equipment purchases and repairs.  This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.  \n \nSafe Work Practices - This facility has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.  Examples of these include; control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel,\na lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance,\na procedure for safe removal of hazardous substances before process piping or equipment is opened,\na permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work), and a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place bef"

This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Affected hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.  \n \nIncident  Investigation - Incidents are promptly investigated that result in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, flammable gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to gas plant management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings. The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings.  Incident investigation reports are retained for at least five years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHA revalidations.\n \nCompliance Audits - To help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, this facility periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented. Compliance audits are conducted at least every three (3) years.  Both Operations and Corporate staff personnel may participate as audit team m"

Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.\n \n\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\nThe processes at this facility have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.    \nWe have safety features on many units to help; contain/control a release, quickly detect a release, and reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release. Several safety features are utilized in the covered processes including:\n1) Release detection - Hydrocarbon detectors with alarms, Release containment/control \n2) Process relief valves that discharge to a flare to capture and incinerate episodic releases \n3) Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated)  \n4) Automated shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high pressure and temperature)  5) Release mitigation:  Fire suppression and extinguishing systems. Our employees are trained to fight\n    small fires or initiate an ESD only \n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThis facility has an excellent record of accident prevention over the past five years.  There have been no accidents or incidents in covered process areas in the past five (5) years resulting in offsite effects.  \nOur approach is to investigate incidents or events that could have reasonably resulted in an uncontrolled release of hazardous substances, to determine ways to prevent these events from recurring.\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nThis facility maintains a written emergency plan, which is in place to protect worker and public safety, as well as the environment.  The Emergency Plan is provided to assist personnel who react to and respond to plant emergencies.  It contains information relating to recognition and reporting of emergencies, minimizing hazards, and actions that must be"

The objective of the Emergency Plan is to assure that personnel who could be involved in an emergency are adequately trained to recognize and deal with emergency situations in an expeditious and safe manner. \n\nFacility personnel are trained to take defensive or incipient firefighting actions. Local fire departments will be responsible for extinguishing fires that have gone beyond the incipient stage. Therefore, this plan is limited to providing guidance for our employees to evacuate the facility and notify the appropriate authorities.   \n\nEmployees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency plan duties.  The emergency plan is updated when necessary, based on modifications made to gas plant processes or other facilities.  The emergency plan changes are administered through the Plant Supervisory approval process, which includes informing and/or training affected personnel in the changes.  \n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES to IMPROVE SAFETY\nWe are committed to operating this facility in a safe manner for workers, the public, and the environment.  Our personnel utilize auditing processes to ensure that this facility complies with safe operations of its processes. Improvements to safety are a continual process at the plant and safety policy and procedure modifications are constantly evolving. Specific changes to control equipment or technology and installation of new mitigation systems are not in progress at this time."
