      "SummaryText": "The Accidental Release Prevention Risk Management Program rule (40 CFR Part 68) is similar to the Occupational Safety and Health Adminstration's Process Safety Management Program, which is designed to protect workers from the accidental release of hazardous substances.  The Risk Management Program Rule addresses over 100 chemical substances, 77 of which are acutely toxic and 63 are flammable gases, and the accidental release of these substances.  The United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) estimates that over 100,000 sources are covered by the rule, including chemical manufacturers and wholesalers, certain retailers, potable water treatment systems, wastewater treatment plants, ammonia refrigeration systems, and federal facilities.\r\n\r\nThe Rio Grande City Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) falls under this regulation because of the on-site storage of chlorine.  The amount of chlorine stored is above the threshold limit specified by the USEPA thereby making the facility subject to compliance with the regulation.  Rio Grande City personnel have complied with the USEPA Risk Management Program rule and have completed an Accidental Release Program Plan (ARPP) that contains the following required information.\r\n\r\nMANAGEMENT SYSTEM\r\n\r\nA hazards assessment that establishes the worst case and alternate release scenarios and their impact on the population and the environment (40 CFR Subpart B)\r\n\r\nA prevention program that includes safety information, a hazards review, operating procedures, training, maintenance, compliance audits and incident investigation (40CFR Subpart C)\r\n\r\nAn emergency response plan (40 CFR Part 68 Subpart E)\r\n\r\nThe following list subsections discuss details of the plan that has been implemented at the Rio Grande City WWTP.\r\n\r\nRELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\r\n\r\nThe WWTP facility in Rio Grande City, Texas has an excellent record in preventing and minimizing releases of chlorine.\r\n\r\nThe emergency response policies at this facil"

There are also adequate provisions for coordination with outside agencies, such as the Rio Grande City Fire Department, in the event of an emergency.  In the event of a release, plant staff will contact the Rio Grande City Fire Department, relaying information regarding the release prior to implementing plant evacuation to a location outside the plant gates, awaiting the fire department to inform its personnel of all information about the release and to provide assurance that the plant has been totally evacuated.\r\n\r\nREGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nThe WWTP uses chlorine as a disinfectant in the wastewater treatment process.  The plant regularly has a storage maximum of 2 one-ton cylinders of chlorine at its facility that is stored outside.  This is above the threshold limit of 2,500 pounds set by the EPA.\r\n\r\nPROCESS DESCRIPTION\r\n\r\nThe WWTP is located on the Fort Ringgold Campus, Rio Grande City, Texas and on the banks of the Rio Grande River.  The wastewater is treated at the plant and subsequently discharged into the Rio Grande River.\r\n\r\nThe existing chlorine feed facility at the WWTP consists of (1) 2 one-ton chlorine containers, (2) two vacuum regulators mounted to an automatic switchover module with gas piping and miscellaneous valves, (3) flow proportionate feed chlorinators and (4) gas piping and ejectors.\r\n\r\nOn the plant grounds, the only area in which chlorine has a potential to generate a gaseous release is the chlorine storage area (Items 1 and 2 above).\r\n\r\nChlorine is delivered to the WWTP by truck and chlorine containers are stored in the outside storage area located to the west of the Chemical Building.  Chlorine is removed as a gas under pressure from the liquid in the individual containers; however, the majority of the chlorine feed is operated through a water injection induced vacuum, making the system extremely safe and minimizing potential pressurized leaks along the fee"

The WWTP will include provisions and procedures for alerting the proper Mexican officials in the event of a release.\r\n\r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nThe Rio Grande City WWTP's accident history was reviewed from December 2012 to December 2017.  During this period, no accidental releases of chlorine have occurred.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThis facility has developed an Emergency Response Program involving the immediate plant evacuation once the City's Fire Department is called to implement response and repair to leaking chlorine gas.  The plant is staffed 24 hours per day, 7 days a week.  Plant operators are required to make rounds for inspection and monitoring of the plant's processes every hour.  Accordingly, plant staff will detect any releases of chlorine and the Fire Department is trained to respond to this situation.\r\n\r\nThe Emergency Response Plan includes:  (1) procedures to follow in the event of a chlorine emergency, (2) information about the plant's evacuation plan and (3) a detailed description for the emergency responders plan for handling such an emergency.\r\n\r\nThe Rio Grande City Fire Department has been designated to provide emergency responders and equipment, and will assume Incident Command upon arrival to the plant's emergency.\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nThe WWTP facility will continue to train plant personnel in chlroine safety procedures by attending classes and safety meetings.  The use of safey equipment (self-contained breathing apparatus, gloves, clothing) shall be emphasized."
