Our prevention program includes the use of proper equipment, regular inspecitons and maintenance and training for all employees that work with the material.  Should an accidential release occur, the facility has oriented the Dieterich Volunteer Fire Dept. and the Effingham County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  These steps have been taken to assure a quick response and minimize the impact of the release in our community and the environment.\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage of anhydrous ammonia for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.  The maximum quantity stored at our facility would be 252,000 pounds, in the facility's 4 tanks totaling 57,000 gal.\n\nThe worst case release scenario is the release of the entire contents of the storage tanks as a gas in 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity relased would be 252,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the storage tanks at 85 percent capcity as limited by design standards and the company policies.  The distance to the endpoint of dispersion based on the model used is 8.9 miles.\n\nThe alternative case scenario is assumed to be a release from the rupture fo a two-inch transfer hose, with 1000 pounds released in a 5-minute period.  The distance to endpoint of dispersion is 0.30 miles.\n\nEffingham Equity complies with all rules and regulations relating to The Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia and Low Pressure Nitrogen Solutions, Equipment, Containers and Storage Facilities.  These regulations administered by the Illinois Department of Agriculture are consistent with ANSI K61.1 and OSHA 29 CFR- 1910.111 regarding proper storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia for the covered process in the past five years.\n\nEffingaham Equity has a written emergency actio"
