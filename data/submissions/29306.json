The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including the following: proper first-aid and medical treatment for exposures; evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation; notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs; and post-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements. In addition, BASF has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment. Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties. The Emergency Response Program is updated as necessary based on modifications made to plant processes or other plant facilities.  The Emergency Response Program changes are administered through the MOC process, which includes informing and/or training affected personnel in these changes.  The overall Emergency Response Program is coordinated with the Jefferson County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives. BASF has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., Port Arthur fire department). This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident. In addition to periodic LEPC meetings, BASF conducts periodic emergency drills that involve the LEPC and emergency response organizations. \n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nOngoing Work Permit Training\nOngoing Environmental awareness training\nImplementation of an electronic MOC program \nSafety Suggestion Program\nHousekeeping Audits"

This commitment is evident by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as employee training and consideration of safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement controls to prevent potential releases of hazardous chemicals.  However, if a release does occur, our well-trained personnel will respond to mitigate the release. \n \n DESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED\n BASF FINA Petrochemicals complex is a joint venture between the BASF Corporation and ATOFINA Chemicals.  SABINA Petrochemicals is a joint venture between the BASF Corporation, ATOFINA Petrochemicals, and Shell Chemical. This complex is operated by BASF and is located in Port Arthur, TX adjacent to the ATOFINA Refinery.  The sites steam cracker receives naptha feed from the adjacent Atofina refinery.  This feed is used to produce ethylene, propylene, benzene, and toluene.  Approximately two-thirds of the feed-stock processed in the Sabina Petrochemicals LLC facility will come from Shell, and one \u00bfthird will come from the BASF FINA Petrochemicals naptha steam cracker.

Therefore, BASF has no worst case (WCS) or alternate release scenario (ARS) identified for toxic chemicals in this Risk Management Plan. \n\n GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\n The following is a summary of the General Accidental Release Prevention Program in place at BASF. Because processes at the plant regulated by the EPA RMP regulation are also subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the Accidental Release Prevention Program. \n \n PROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION\n BASF maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to ensure safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Specific departments within the complex are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date Process Safety Information.

In addition, safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, and composition) have been documented in the unit.  Operation teams verify the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and automated shutdown systems. \n \n BASF also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This documentation includes equipment information such as, materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical ratings, etc.  In combination with written procedures and trained personnel, this information provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes via Management of Change (MOC), to confirm that safety features in the process are not compromised. \n \n PROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS\n BASF has a comprehensive program to ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled prior to the design phase. Each process is systematically examined during this process to identify hazards and verify that adequate controls and safeguards are in place to manage and/or mitigate these hazards. \n \n BASF primarily uses the HAZard and OPerability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform process hazard analysis. HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the premier systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques. The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and process experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process.

Periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted until the process is no longer operating. The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.\n \n OPERATING PROCEDURES\n BASF maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as  (1) commissioning/first time startup, (2) unit startup, (3) normal operations, (4) temporary operations, (5) emergency shutdown, and (6) normal shutdown.  These procedures can be used as a reference by Process Technicians and provide a basis for consistent training of new Process Technicians.

All Process Technicians periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to confirm their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. All of this training is documented for each Process Technician, including the method used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n \n MECHANICAL INTEGRITY\n BASF has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition. The basic aspects of this program include: (1) developing written procedures, (2) conducting training, (3) performing preventative maintenance (PM) inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures.

All equipment is inspected to ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use.\n \n MANAGEMENT OF CHANGE (MOC)\n BASF has a comprehensive system to manage change. The MOC procedure applies to the installation of, and/or modifications to equipment, facilities, procedures, chemicals, and technology. Changes are reviewed by operations management to (1) verify adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change. All affected chemical hazard information, process-operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures are updated to incorporate these changes.  All personnel are trained on applicable procedural changes.\n \n PRE-STARTUP SAFETY REVIEWS (PSSRs)\n BASF conducts a PSSR for any new facility or modification to the existing facility that requires a change in the process safety information.  A PSSR is conducted prior to startup to ensure that: (1) all equipment is installed per design, (2) all procedures are updated to reflect changes, (3) all affected employees are trained on the new procedures, (4) and a PHA was performed and all action items are closed or that the change was handled under the MOC program.

The goal of each investigation is to perform a root cause analysis and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to management for resolution.  Corrective actions are tracked until these items have been resolved.
