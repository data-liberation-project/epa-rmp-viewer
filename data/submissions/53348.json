      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nFIRST ENERGY BURGER PLANT\nRMP PLAN\n\nBackground\n\nFirst Energy operates a coal fired electrical generation plant, known as the RE Burger plant, in Shadyside, Ohio.  Federal and Ohio regulations increasingly are requiring coal burning utilities to reduce emissions of pollutants from combustion stack gases including nitrogen oxides (Nox), sulfur dioxide, particulate matter, and mercury.  In response to these regulatory drivers, new technologies are being developed to control multiple pollutants.  One such technology is being developed by Powerspan Corporation known as Electro-Catalytic Oxidation (ECO?).\n\nFirst Energy is working with Powerspan to demonstrate the commercial viability of this technology in the Burger Commercial Unit (BCU).  This involves a plant to treat a flue gas stream from one of the operating units at the Burger plant.  The system has been operating since 2004 and may operate for several more years.\n\nThe ECO process uses several different chemical reagents including 29% aqueous ammonia to help reduce SO2 air emissions.  Ammonia reacts with SO2 to form Ammonia Sulfate (fertilizer).  EPA Risk Management Plan (RMP) rules cover any process with over 20% aqueous ammonia and 20,000 pounds.  OSHA Process Safety Management rules cover aqueous ammonia solutions of over 44%.  Only EPA RMP rules apply.\n\nThe covered process includes:  truck unloading, storage, and transfer lines up to the point in the ECO system where aqueous ammonia drops below 20%.  There is one aqueous ammonia storage tank that contains 27,000 gallons (@90% capacity).\n\nBurger site operations are also covered by other regulations such as the CAA, CWA, SPCC rules, OSHA, etc.\n\nOverview of the RMP Prevention Program \n\nThe Burger ECO process is considered a Program 2 site by RMP rules, however First Energy and Powerspan have chosen to implement additional elements of a Program 3 site.  Burger uses a management of change and pre-startup safety review procedure as well as tri-annual"

Warning signs\n\nIt is the policy of First Energy and Powerspan to assure the safe operation of the facility which is designed and built to good engineering practices that incorporate methods or principles in accordance with applicable industry standards.  Some of these standards include ASME code for pressure piping, B31.3, and ASME Boiler and Pressure code, Section VIII.   \n\nAccident History\n\nThere have been no accidents in the history of operation of the ammonia system.\n\n\nEmergency Response\n\nThere is a written emergency response plan that is coordinated with the Belmont County LEPC and t"
