Each process is examined in detail to ensure that all hazards are identified and that appropriate controls are in place to manage those hazards.\n\nA hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis is typically used for our process hazard analyses.  A team comprising personnel with engineering, chemists, operations, safety, environmental and maintenance experience systematically examines each hazard in each section of the process and identifies potential causes and a range of possible consequences.  The team then compares the hazard to the existing set of prevention and mitigation measures designed to contain that hazard, making further recommendations when deemed necessary.  These recommendations are resolved by management and are tracked until they are implemented.\n\nWe update and revalidate each process hazard analysis every five years or whenever a significant change is made.   The results and findings from these revalidation studies are documented and retained, and recommendations are tracked until resolved by management.\n\n\n\nOPERATING PROCEDURES\n\nOur engineers, operators, chemists and supervisors work together to develop and maintain operating procedures that ensure the safe operation of our facility.  These procedures cover all modes of operation, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new or improved process.  In addition to describing the steps for safely conducting operations, the procedures also contain valuable information about safe upper and lower limits, consequences of deviations, and applicable safety and health information.  Operating procedures are annually certified as accurate to ensure that they are updated following any process changes. \n\nThe Innospec Performance Chemicals-Salisbury Plant also operates using the Innospec Performance Chemicals batchsh"

The batchsheets include process deviation codes describing the actions to take under various conditions (e.g., high temperature, high pressure, loss of cooling, etc) that may be encountered while manufacturing batches using highly hazardous chemicals.\n\n\n\nTRAINING\n\nThe Innospec Performance Chemicals-Salisbury Plant trains workers to safely and effectively perform their tasks.  Employees who are new to a process are given basic training that includes (1) a general overview of the process, (2) the properties of the substances used in the process and their associated hazards, and (3) a detailed review of the operating procedures for that process.  Once they have demonstrated their understanding of this initial training, they are paired with an experienced operator to learn their specific job functions and tasks.  After they demonstrate their competence in performing these tasks, they are allowed to work independently.\n\nThrough oral reviews, written tests, and on-the-job demonstration, we ensure that our employees understand the training given to them.  The frequency of refresher training is decided, in part, by our employees but is performed at least every three years.  All training given to an employee is documented, along with the means used to verify that the training is understood.\n\n\n\nMECHANICAL INTEGRITY\n\nThe Innospec Performance Chemicals-Salisbury Plant maintains the mechanical integrity of our equipment to prevent equipment failures that could endanger workers, the public, or the environment.

Except for replacements-in-kind (e.g., replacing a valve with an identical valve), all changes are subjected to a hazard analysis to ensure that (1) new hazards are not inadvertently introduced into the system, (2) safety consequences resulting from the change are addressed, (3) operators in the process are notified of the change and made aware of possible repercussions, and (4) all training material, process safety information, and operating procedures are updated.  The management of change system applies to changes in the chemicals used, process equipment, technology, procedures, and other facility changes.\n\n\n\nPRE-STARTUP REVIEW\n\nWhenever a change occurs that requires updating the process safety information, the Innospec Performance Chemicals-Salisbury Plant performs a pre-startup safety review.  This review ensures that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are prepared for service before the process is restarted. A pre-startup review will generally include field verification of new construction and also serves a quality assurance function by verifying that accident prevention measures are implemented correctly.  Generally, a pre-startup review will ensure that (1) construction and equipment are consistent with design standards, (2) adequate operating, safety, and maintenance procedures are in place, (3) training for all affected employees is complete, and (4) a process hazard analysis has been performed, if necessary.\n\n\n\nINCIDENT INVESTIGATION\n\nThe Innospec Performance Chemicals-Salisbury Plant trains its employees to prom"
