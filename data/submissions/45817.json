Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nFMC Corporation's Lithium Division facility in Bessemer City, North Carolina (FMC) is committed to conducting its business in a manner that protects the safety and health of its employees, contractors and neighbors. This commitment is demonstrated in the resources invested in accident prevention, training and the highest regard for safety throughout facility deign, installation, operation and maintenance. Our policy is to implement effective controls to prevent releases of regulated substances. Trained emergency response personnel work with local response agencies to control emergencies and protect public safety.\n\nII. Source Description and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe FMC Bessemer City facility manufactures and processes organic and inorganic compounds. Ethyl ether, an RMP regulated substance, is used to manufacture isopropyl magnesium bromide in diethyl ether (i-PrMgBr/DEE). Ethyl ether is shipped and handled as a liquid and is considered flammable. Up to 45,000 pounds of ethyl ether may be stored at the facility as a raw material and/or in the final product solution.\n\nIII. Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nProcess safety analyses have been conducted to identify potential hazards in the i-PrMgBr/DEE process and mechanisms to prevent releases have been implemented. Experts have been consulted and used in the design of the i-PrMgBr/DEE process to ensure that process safety systems protect our employees and neighbors. Operating procedures have been developed, reviewed and operators trained on routine operations as well as process startup, shutdown and emergency safety systems.\n\nIV. Five year accident history\n\nThe i-PrMgBr/DEE process is a new process. There have been no accidents involving ethyl ether in the past five years.\n\nV.
