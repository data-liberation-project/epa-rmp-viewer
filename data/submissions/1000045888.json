WE HAVE DETERMINED THAT WE HAVE TO SUBMIT A RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN TO EPA.OUR FACILITY STORES FOR RETAIL SALE ANHYDROUS AMMONIA WHICH IS USED AS A FERTILIZER.  THE FACILITY IS USED IN THE SPRING FROM APRIL TO JUNE AND IN THE FALL FROM OCTOBER TO FREEZE UP, NORMALLY NOVEMBER. THE WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO COULD AFFECT 50 PEOPLE.  THIS SCENARIO IS VERY UNLIKELY BECAUSE OF SAFETY EQUIPMENT INSTALLED AT THE FACILITY AND THE COMPANIES COMMITMENT TO SAFETY TRAINING ANDMAINTAINENCE OF EQUIPMENT.  THE ALTERNATE RELEASE SCENARIO WOULD AFFECT ABOUT 10 PEOPLE AND COMPANY PROPERTY. WE HAVE NOT HAD ANY ACCIDENTAL RELEASES IN THE LAST 5 YEARS.  THROUGH INPECTIONS, MAINTANENCE AND SAFETY TRAINING FOR EMPLOYEE'S. SAFETY TRAINING IS OFFERED TO CUSTOMERS. ANNUALLY WE INVITE THE FIRE DEPARTMENT TO TOUR OUR FACILITY. EMERGENCY SHUT-OFFS,POWER AND PLUMBING CODES ARE LOOKED AT. AT THIS TIME WE DISCUSS OUR EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM AND HOW THE EMERGENCY SERVICES FIT INTO OUR PROGRAM. IN THE FUTURE WE WILL CONTINUE TO PROVIDE ANNUAL TRAINING AND WORK WITH EMERGENCY SERVICES. OUR GOAL IS TO REMAIN ACCIDENT FREE AND PROVIDE A SAFE ENVIRONMENT."
