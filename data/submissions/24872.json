      "SummaryText": "1.  FACILITY POLICY.  The owners, management and employees of United Suppliers are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.  FACILITY INFORMATION.    The primary activity at this location is the storage and mixing of fertilizers for sale to Retail Agriculture Dealers and farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received and mixed into 10-34-00 fertilizer.  This operation takes place twice a year, normally early spring and in the fall.   This mixing operation is performed by a T-Reactor.  The T-Reactor process is a method of producing fertilizer composed of nitrogen and phosphorous.  The nitrogen is supplied to the process in the form on anhydrous ammonia.  Phosphorous is supplied as liquid superphosphoric acid.  Water is the other raw material and is used as a stablilizer to produce, standard grades of commercial fertilizer.  The standard grades produced by this process are 10-34-00 and 11-37-00.  The maximum  quantity of anhydrous ammonia on hand during the blending operation would be approximately 78,000 pounds.\n\n3.  WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO.  The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of the bulk storage tank.  The maximum quantity released would be 78,000 pounds.  The distance to the endpoint is approximately 0.90 mile.\n\n4.
