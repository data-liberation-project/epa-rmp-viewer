Therefore, this Facility is subject to the Risk Management Plan (RMP) requirements codified in Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations Part 68 (40 CFR 68) administered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA). \r\n\r\nThe Facility is also subject to Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29 CFR 1910.119) and public receptors are located within the worst-case release scenario. Therefore, the Facility is subject to Prevention Program 3 requirements as stated in 40 CFR 68.10. OSHA's PSM standard closely parallels requirements outlined in USEPA's RMP Rule. All elements required by USEPA's 40 CFR 68 - Program 3 Prevention Program are also required by OSHA's PSM. \r\n\r\nThe Facility has not had an accidental release of a regulated substance where exposure to the substance, its reaction products, overpressure generated by an explosion involving the substance, or radiant heat generated by a fire involving the substance led to any off-site death, injury, or response or restoration activities for an exposure of an environmental receptor.  \r\n\r\nThe Facility employs four (4) full-time employees on-site who ensure the proper operation and maintenance of the Facility.  \r\n\r\nEnLink Midstream Operating, L.P. (EnLink), formerly Crosstex Energy, last submitted a full RMP 5-year update to the USEPA in January 2012 for the Facility.  The current RMP includes administrative updates associated with the change from Crosstex Energy to EnLink.  \r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\t\r\n\r\nThe Facility maintains a policy of safe natural gas liquids (NGL) operations, reducing to th"

The regulated flammable chemicals stored at the Facility include Refinery Grade Butane (a flammable mixture containing ethane, propane, isobutane, n-butane, isopentane, and n-pentane) and n-butane (a flammable mixture containing n-butane, pentane, and isobutane).  The Facility also stores a small quantity of propane (500 gallons); however, the propane is used as fuel for an on-site flare and is not RMP-regulated.  \r\n\r\nThe Facility has two underground storage caverns that may contain either n-butane or Refinery Grade Butane, one of which is capable of storing 1,773,479 barrels of product, and the other of which is capable of storing 1,562,855 barrels of product.  \r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nThe Facility maintains a consistent accidental release prevention program to eliminate or minimize releases of butane. As previously indicated, the Prevention Program required under 40 CFR 68 is identical to the prevention program required under OSHA's PSM. The Napoleonville Facility's Prevention Program 3 elements, as required under 40 CFR 68 Subpart D, are included in the Facility's PSM Plan, which is kept on-site as a separate document. Required elements include:  \r\n\r\n\u00bf\tEmployee Participation; \r\n\u00bf\tProcess Safety Information; \r\n\u00bf\tProcess Hazard Analysis; \r\n\u00bf\tOperating Procedures; \r\n\u00bf\tTraining; \r\n\u00bf\tContractors; \r\n\u00bf\tPre-startup Review; \r\n\u00bf\tMechanical Integrity; \r\n\u00bf\tHot Work Permits; \r\n\u00bf\tManagement of Change; \r\n\u00bf\tIncident Investiga"

The Emergency Response Program required under the RMP and PSM Rules must be site-specific and comprehensive, including the following elements: \r\n\r\n\u00bf\tPublic and emergency response agency notification procedures; \r\n\u00bf\tProper first aid and emergency medical treatment; \r\n\u00bf\tEmergency response measures; \r\n\u00bf\tProcedures for inspecting, testing, and maintaining emergency response equipment; \r\n\u00bf\tEmployee training; and \r\n\u00bf\tProgram review procedures. \r\n\r\nThe Facility maintains written Emergency Shutdown and Startup Procedures (ESSP) that provide guidance for emergencies. Further safety information is also detailed in the ESSP. In addition, operating procedures and equipment design codes and standards associated with operations at the Facility are maintained. Furthermore, the Facility has coordinated the emergency response plan with the Assumption Parish Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and the Assumption Parish Sheriff's Department. The Assumption Parish Sheriff's Department is designated as the first responder in the event of butane release.  For these reasons, the Facility meets the exceptions listed in 40 CFR 68.90(b) and therefore is not required to have the Emergency Response Program as described in 40 CFR 68.95.  \r\n\r\nA site map, MSDSs, and a list of chemicals kept on-site are maintained at the Facility.
