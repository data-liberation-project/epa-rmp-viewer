Should a release occur KMWW employees are trained in what to do. One operator is always on duty. The Local fire dept. will provide support responders and provide fire response.\n  \nB. The KMWW property consists of approx. 5 acres, bounded by Main St. on the South, Water St. on the East or River side, First St. on the West side and the power plant employee parking lot on the North. The plant produces potable water for the City of Keokuk. Mississippi river water is conveyed to the plant through a screen house located upstream of the locks for dam #19. Treatment chemicals are delivered by truck. Chlorine is use to disinfect the final water product before storage and distribution. 2000 lb. chlorine cylinders are currently stored at the 1938 treatment facility.\n\nC. The offsite consequence analysis's considered two scenarios: Worst case and an alternative for chlorine.\nThe worst case scenario is defined by EPA, which states the \"the owner/operator shall assume that the maximum quantity in the largest vessel is released and vaporizes to gas over 10 minutes\" due to an unspecified failure. The alternative scenario is defined as \"more likely to occur than the worst case scenario.\n\nThe distance traveled by the chlorine released before its concentration decreases to the \"toxic endpoint\" selected by EPA as 3 ppm, which is the Emergency Response Planning Guideline Level 2 (ERPG-2). This is defined by the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) as the \"maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms which could impair an individual's ability to take protective action.\" The residential population within a circle with a radius corresponding "

This amount will be lost in the 10 minute period by EPA definition. Therefore the spill rate is considered to be 200#/min. RMP offsite consequence analysis guidance, RMP version 1.06 was used for worst case end-point determination. At the worst case concentration of chlorine sensors in the chlorination room will automatically alarm the alert the operator of a problem. The endpoint radius for this worst case scenario is 1.3 miles or 6,900 ft. The population inside this area in all directions is 4,000. For toxic gas releases the only population that will potentially be affected are those within an elliptical plume extending downwind of the release point. This plum area, or footptint, is approx. 6% (one-twentieth) of the area of the full circle,\n\nAn alternative chlorine release assumes a leak of 0.4 pounds from the vacuum piping. EPA's Reference table 3 was used for toxic gas modeling. The toxic end point for this quantity and up to 21lbs/min of release to be 320 ft. and would reach only travelers on the bridge and any people in the church to the south.\n\nD. KMWW's accidental release prevention program is based on the following key elements.\nTrained and state certified operators operate the chlorine system.\nUse of vacuum regulators for all chlorine down stream of the 1 ton cylinders.\nPerformance of a hazard review of the equipment and procedures.\nUse of inspection and auditing programs.\n\nE. No major releases of chlorine have occurred that any personnel can recall. Definatly no releases of chlorine have occurred during the last 5 years. EPA specifies inclusion of all releases that resulted in: deaths, injuries, significant property damsge on site, Known offsite deaths, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\nF. The KMWW plant has an Emergency Response Plan"

KMWW operators are involved in this porgram as key personnel with working knowledge of the chlorine system.\n\nG. Improvments are presently being developed to address terrorism and chlorine security. Mass flow meters allow operators instant feedback of chlorine flow conditions via the SCADA and remote operator interface systen throughout the plant."
