The BMS-Syracuse facility comprises 89 acres and is bordered by residential, commercial, and industrial properties. Over 70 buildings are located at the site, providing facilities for two divisions of the company: Technical Operations and Pharmaceutical Research Institute (PRI). The Technical Operations facilities consist of pharmaceutical manufacturing, quality control, chemical and biological development laboratories, pilot plants, and administrative offices. Pharmaceutical manufacturing activities include fermentation, chemical extraction, chemical synthesis, and bulk operations. The manufacturing operations produce primarily intermediate bulk antibiotics and other pharmaceutical compounds which are shipped outside the facility for final processing to finished product forms. PRI facilities consist primarily of research laboratories and administrative offices.\n     The primary NAICS code for facility operations is \"325411: Medicinal and Botanical Manufacturing\". Specific operations which occur at the Thompson Road facility that are classified under this NAICS code include: (1) antibiotics: bulk, un"

      "SummaryText": "compounded and (2) chemicals, medical: organic and inorganic - bulk, uncompounded.\n     BMS utilizes one chemical at the Thompson Road facility at levels in excess of the established RMP thresholds: anhydrous ammonia. Anhydrous ammonia is maintained in one bulk storage tank at a working capacity of 26,011 pounds (the storage tank is located in a dedicated building).\n     The use of anhydrous ammonia at the Syracuse facility is summarized below.  Anhydrous ammonia is utilized in both fermentation and hydrolysis operations. Fermentation uses anhydrous ammonia for pH control. The Fermentation pH control system consists of a probe in each tank to measure the pH, a computer control system, a solenoid valve on the ammonia line to each tank, and associated piping.  When the pH drops below the predetermined value, the solenoid valve is energized (opening for a short time) and ammonia flows into the tank with the air supply. In addition, the hydrolysis plant uses anhydrous ammonia for pH control during hydrolysis. Setpoints for pH control, hydrolysis time, and ammonia use are entered into the analog output control prior to hydrolysis. During hydrolysis, two pH probes in each hydrolyzer are monitored continuously. Total ammonia use and minimum hydrolysis time are also monitored during hydrolysis.\n     In June 2004, Bristol-Myers Squibb employed approximately 800 full-time personnel at the Thompson Road facility. Access to the site is restricted by both fencing and security personnel/equipment.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION SYSTEMS (Ammonia System) - Bristol-Myers Squibb has implemented a number of passive and active mitigation measures in an effort to reduce the probability or minimize the impacts of an anhydrous ammonia gaseous release. These measures include: (1) the bulk anhydrous ammonia tank is maintained in a diked building which would contain minor releases and dramatically reduce the impacts of a catostrophic release; "

These protective measures limit the potential for significant impact to the local population/environment from the anhydrous ammonia system.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY - Bristol-Myers Squibb has not had any accidents from the anhydrous ammonia  processes at their Syracuse operations which would be \"reportable\" under 40 CFR 68.42 (\"reportable\" accidents are incidents which have resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage).\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM - The BMS-Syracuse facility has developed a formal, written Emergency Response Program. This program is coordinated with the local emergency response agencies.  \n     Any chemical spills and/or compressed gas releases which may pose a threat to the health and safety of BMS site personnel or the surrounding community is considered a spill incident. The \"Emergency Response Procedure\" outlined in the \"BMS Emergency Response Plan\" requires that all spill incidents discovered or suspected be reported immediately to Security. All spill incidents also require the notification of the Environmental, Safety, Industrial Hygiene (ESIH) Department. A qualified ESIH representative is responsible for determining the level of response required to mitigate the incident.\n     There are three levels of Spill Incident Classification. Level I Incidents are any spill incidents that can be controlled using equipment immediately available to the Operating Department, and/or do not require the evacuation of employees and have no impact beyond the immediate area of the spill. Level II Incidents are any spill incident that can only be controlled utilizing the"

The Plant Emergency Organization is used as the command structure for responses to Level II and III Incidents. All facility incidents which require a response by the ERT are documented, and the documentation is provided to the facility Safety Manager. The ERT Leader is responsible for conducting an incident debriefing and critique within 48 hours of the incident and submitting a written report, including recommendations for follow up actions, to the Safety Manager. The Safety Manager is responsible for evaluation and appropriate implementation of follow-up recommendations.\n     The site-wide Emergency Response Procedure has been submitted to the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC).\n\nPLANNED CHANGES ON ANHYDROUS AMMONIA SYSTEMS - Through the implementation of their PSM Program, BMS has identified a number of modifications (both equipment and procedural) aimed at providing additional safety of the anhydrous ammonia system at their Syracuse, New York facility.  These modifications have been implemented. BMS continues to review their safety programs and update the anhydrous ammonia system on a regular basis in accordance with OSHA/EPA requirements."
