This program has been prepared to address the risks involved in operating and maintaining the following process which have the presence of hazardous chemicals above threshold quantities: \n\n\n\nProcess Name          | Process Chemical          | Process Quantity(lbs.)\n\nAmmonia Refrigeration   Anhydrous Ammonia           25,000\n\n\n\nOur RMP-PSM program promotes overall plant, worker, and public safety. The program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of hazardous chemicals. Overall, the program is designed to prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, illnesses and physical property damage.\n\n\n\nOur company has many policies and procedures in place to promote overall plant, worker and public safety. We have: \n\n- Prepared a unified program based on the PSM plan to meet CalARP and RMP obligations as well\n\n- Orga"

The facility has an ammonia refrigeration system that provides refrigeration capacity to five (5) cold rooms and a hydrocooler. The cold rooms utilize bunker-mounted evaporator coils that contain chilled liquid ammonia.  \n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system utilizes flooded refrigeration design and operates as follows. High pressure liquid from the high pressure receiver is piped to each cold room where it passes through an expansion valve into a low pressure accumulator vessel mounted behind the bunker wall.  Low temperature liquid circulates by thermal convection through the evaporator coils in the cold rooms.  Low pressure and temperature gas collects in the accumulator vessel, and passes through a pressure regulator into a suction line. The suction line returns the vapor to the main suction accumulator located in the engine room, which separates any residual liquid from the gas. The gas is piped to four (4) screw compressors which elevate the temperature and pressure of the gas.  The high pressure discharge from the compressors is sent to two (2) water cooled evaporative condensers where the high pressure gas ammonia is liquefied and returned to the high pressure receiver. Liquid separated from the suction return gas in the primary accumulator vessels drains into the liquid transfer vessel.  Operation of a float switch activated solenoid valve raises the pressure in the liquid transfer vessel to the point the liquid can be drained into the high pressure receiver.\n\n\n\nThe facility was originally built in the 1986 "

It was also built in compliance with the Uniform Mechanical Code and Uniform Building Code applicable at the time of construction. The system contains numerous safety devices including sensors which stop the compressors if temperatures or pressures exceed or drop below established limits, and safety relief valves which vent ammonia gas to the atmosphere if the pressure in the system exceeds their set point. \n\nThe ammonia system at Family Tree Farms consists of vessels which are interconnected, or which are co-located such that a release of ammonia could impact the ability to operate vessels that are not directly connected.  Therefore, the system is treated as a single process.\n\n\n\n1.3 General Accident Release & Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\n1.3.1 General \n\n\n\nWe inform our employees engaged in process operations of the dangers of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia in annual safety meetings. During these meeting we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\n\n\n\nFamily Tree Farms has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the ammonia refrigeration process. These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release. The results of the analyses are reported in PSMWriter and hard copy binders. \n\n\n\n1.3.2 Anhydrous Ammonia\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration process at the Family Tree Farms facility is an integral part of the overall business and operates most of the year. The ammonia process contains a total charge of approximately 25,300 lbs. It is extremely important that this process is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner.

In addition, the process is checked frequently by one of the outside refrigeration contractors that we use. These contractors also assist in performing the annual mechanical integrity inspection of our ammonia equipment. \n\n\n\n1.4 Five Year Accident History\n\n\n\nFamily Tree Farms has had no accidental release within the last five (5) years.\n\n\n\n1.5 Emergency Action and Response Plan\n\n\n\nFamily Tree Farms' emergency action and response program has been developed to satisfy the following requirements:\n\n- California Emergency Action Plan - Title 8 CCR ?3220\n\n- Federal Emergency Action Plan - Title 29 CFR ?1910.38 \n\n\n\nStrategically, we will respond minimally to a release. Under this plan we will call emergency personnel and evacuate the facility. All response activities would be done in coordination with the Local Fire Department and their Hazardous Materials Response Team. \n\n\n\nEvery year we review with our employees our evacuation procedures in the event of an emergency, including a hazardous chemical release.\n\n\n\n1.6 Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nFamily Tree Farms has implemented many policies and procedures to promote overall plant, worker and public safety. Nevertheless, Family Tree Farms continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.\n\n\n\nBy utilizing PSMWriter software, all necessary employees have access to every aspect of the RMP-PSM program. This has improved Family Tree Farms' ability to communicate hazardous situations to employees and contractors. In addition, PSMWriter tracks all RMP-PSM related events so that Family Tree Farms' management team can ensure that the RMP-PSM program is being implemented.\n\n\n\nFamily Tree Farms has implemented all aspects of the RMP-PSM program.

It is an interactive framework that guides safe action for Family Tree Farms employees, but allows for feedback and continual improvement. Through the RMP-PSM program Family Tree Farms will continue to maintain overall plant worker and public safety."
