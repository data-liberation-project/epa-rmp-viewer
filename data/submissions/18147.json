      "SummaryText": "a.        The Greater Hazleton Joint Sewer Authority owns and operates GHJSA Wastewater Treatment Plant located in Hazleton Township, Luzerne County, Pennsylvania.  The service area includes the City of Hazleton, the Borough of West Hazleton, and portions of Hazle Township.  The wastewater treatment plant,  located at Jaycee Drive at Oscar Thomas Drive in the Valmont Industrial Park, processes approximately 8.90 million gallons per day of wastewater and discharges under a NPDES permit to the Black Creek.   Wastewater treatment processes include grit and coarse screenings removal, preliminary sedimentation, secondary biotowers and activated sludge treatment, clarification, and disinfection.  Solid material removed from this process is digested to inert material that is dewatered and disposed in landfill.  The plant is operated 24 hours per day, every day of the year.\n\nb.          The wastewater treatment plant includes a chlorinator building, which contains three (3) one-ton cylinders of chlorine liquified under pressure, a chlorinator, various safety equipment, and instrumentation consisting of flow recorders, electrical panels, and a gas detector/alarm unit.  The chlorinator system extracts chlorine gas from the storage cylinders through high pressure regulators and dissolves this gas into water to form a disinfection solution that is used to kill pathogenic bacteria in treated wastewater prior to its discharge into the creek.  Up to eight (8) one-ton cylinders may be stored outside in cradles on a raised pad adjacent to the chlorinator building.  Treatment Plant operators regularly check the building and its equipment, inventorying the rate of chlorine use and adjusting the rate as necessary.  Accounting for administrative controls on inventory, the maximum intended inventory is 16,000 pounds.  Wastewater treatment is not an industry classification included in section 40 CFR 68.10(d), nor are municipal wastewater treatment plants regulated under OSHA PSM in Pennsy"

The off-site consequence analysis includes consideration of two chlorine release scenarios, one \"worst-case\" and one \"alternative-case.\"  The first scenario is defined by the regulations as the \"maximum quantity in the largest vessel\" being released \"as a gas over ten minutes,\" due to an unspecified failure.  The alternative-case scenario is defined as \"more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario.\"\n\n            Atmospheric dispersion modeling was performed using the RMP*Comp program distributed by the Chemical Emergency Preparedness and Prevention Office of the EPA.  This model determined the distance traveled by the chlorine released until its concentration decreases to the\"toxic endpoint\" selected by EPA of 3 ppm, (0.0087 mg/L,) which is the Emergency Response Planning Guideline Level 2, defined by the American Industrial Hygiene Association as the \"maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms which could impair an individual's ability to take protective action.\"  The residential population within a circle with a radius corresponding to the toxic endpoint distance has to be defined \"to estimate the population potentially affected.\"\n\n          The worst-case release scenario at the GHJSA Wastewater Treatment Plant involves a failure of one of the two chlorine containers, or a 2,000 pound release, possibly while the container is outside.  The off-site consequence analysis was performed under the prescribed EPA conditions of all volume released as gas within a ten minute period, to an ERPG-2 endpoint radius of 1.3 miles according to the RMP*Comp model.  Within the 5.4 square-mile area bounded by this circle reside 3,720 people who may potentially b"

The RMP*Comp model was run assuming a 23 minute duration release at 87 pounds per minute from a rust hole in the liquid portion of the cylinder, stored outside in the storage rack, which yielded a distance to endpoint of 0.2 miles and an area of eighty acres surrounding the facility.  The meteorological conditions used were taken from the Guidance to be stability class D and wind speed of 3.0 m/sec.  Up to 1,000 people may be affected by this release, assuming a full-employment workday at the surrounding businesses in the Valmont Industrial Park.  Night-time population density in this zone falls off considerably.\n\nd.         The Greater Hazleton Joint Sewer Authority's wastewater  treatment plant accidental release prevention program is based upon the following elements:\n         1)  High level of training for the operators.\n         2)  Preventative maintenance program for equipment.\n         3)  Use of standard process and safety equipment.\n         4)  Use of accurate and effective operating procedures, written with the participation of the \n              operators.\n         5)  Performance of a hazard review of the equipment and procedures.\n         6)  Implementation of an auditing and inspection program.\nChemical-specific prevention steps include availability of self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA,) worn by the operators during connection/disconnection of the chlorine supply, awareness of the hazards and toxic properties of chlorine, and the presence of a chlorine gas detector.\n\ne.         No accidental releases of chlorine have occurred at this facility in the past five years.\n\nf.

Emergency response drills have been conducted with the fire companies, and the operation and response procedures are reviewed and updated on a regular basis.\n\ng.         Changes to improve safety (recommended actions) were made following a March 11, 1999, inspection of the disinfection systems by the Authority's consulting engineer.  These recommendations included third-party training of all water plant employees in chlorine usage and safety, done on April 26, 1999.  Other recommendations have been implemented or will be implemented during the remainder of 1999."
