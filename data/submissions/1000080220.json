      "SummaryText": "The Chester Water Authority (CWA) operates the Octoraro Water Treatment Plant in Little Britain Township, Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. The treatment plant processes include use of chlorine for disinfection. Chlorine is regulated under EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) regulations.  CWA carefully stores and handles chlorine.  CWA's Risk Management Program describes the chemical hazards and the measures taken to prevent accidental releases.   CWA's RMP has been developed and implemented in accordance with EPA RMP regulations (40 CFR 68) and guidelines specifically created for water treatment plants (WTPs).\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nThe Chester Water Authority has the following policy addressing its commitment to accident prevention and risk management:\n\n\"The Chester Water Authority is committed to protecting its employees, the public, and the environment from accidental releases of hazardous materials used at its facilities. CWA will implement safety, environmental protection, and risk management programs to minimize the risks presented by hazardous materials used at its facilities. If there is an accidental release, CWA will either provide, or request from others, immediate emergency response to minimize the effects of the release. CWA will also immediately notify the public, through county emergency management agencies, of any actions necessary to ensure public protection and safety.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program Overview\n\n\n\nCWA's Octoraro treatment plant has a release prevention program encompassing the elements of the EPA RMP Prevention Program 2 requirements.  The program delineates accountability and responsibility for each of the prevention program elements. The prevention program includes: maintaining up-to-date chemical and process Safety Information; conducting periodic Hazard Reviews, maintaining up-to-date Operating Procedures; Training employees on the procedures, hazards, and safe work practices; Ma"

It didn't escape the room due to the scrubber or cause inhalation exposure due to respirator use.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response\n\n\n\nCWA takes every precaution to prevent an emergency from occurring, including training and equipping its employees to abate a potential release in its initial stages before it can become an emergency.  CWA relies on Lancaster County Emergency Management Agency to provide emergency response personnel and equipment.\n\nCWA's emergency action plan includes procedures for emergency notifications, evacuation of non essential plant personnel from the affected area and coordination with emergency responders by qualified plant personnel. \n\n\n\nPlanned Safety Improvements\n\n\n\nThe Authority works to safely manage chemical hazards present at the Octoraro Treatment Plant.  This includes maintaining equipment and facilities, updating procedures, following safe work practices and making improvements to our practices and facilities.  Periodically, we Audit our program, update our Hazard Review and implement any additional improvements recommended by these evaluations. \n\n    \n\nWe have already updated procedures and enhanced the function"
