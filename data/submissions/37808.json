Four process areas at the facility contain regulated toxic substances above the threshold quantity listed in Table 1 to Sec. 68.130.  Worst-case and alternative toxic release scenarios have been modeled for the four processes using TRACE (Toxic Release Analysis of Chemical Emissions) chemical release modeling software, a commercially available product from DuPont SAFER Systems, Inc.  These areas and the release scenarios have not changed since the last filing.\n\n\n\nAll scenarios were modeled using Subpart B input requirements.  There are no regulated flammable substances at WSTF that are above the threshold quantity.\n\n\n\n2.0    WSTF DESCRIPTION AND BACKGROUND\n\n\n\nWSTF was established in 1962 to support certification of Apollo spacecraft propulsion and power systems and association subsystems for the Manned Space Center, now the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center (JSC).  WSTF remains a facility operated under the direction of JSC.  The mission of WSTF is to provide the expertise and infrastructure to test and evaluate spacecraft materials, components, and propulsion systems to enable the safe human exploration and utilization of space.  Although a majority of the work of WSTF is in direct support of JSC programs, we also perform work for other NASA Centers, other Government entities, commercial customers, and foreign governments.\n\n\n\nThe facility is located 20 miles northeast of Las Cruces, New Mexico, and 65 miles north of El Paso, Texas.  This site was chosen for its isolated location and topography, which minimize the inherent hazards of aerospace propulsion testing to the general population.  Meteorological and geographical conditions were emphasized in de"

The direction of prevailing winds, which flow in a northeasterly direction away from WSTF and population centers and over the San Andres Mountains, offers ideal conditions to protect employees and the public.  In the three decades that WSTF has been in operation, the city of Las Cruces and the surrounding areas have grown, but WSTF remains well away from large population bases.\n\n\n\nA security force that is on duty on a 24-hour, 365-day per year basis controls access to the WSTF site.  Security guards control access to the industrial complex and also patrol the site boundaries.\n\n\n\n3.0 ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n\n\nThe White Sands Test Facility is committed to providing a safe place of employment by meeting or exceeding applicable health and safety requirements to assure personnel, community, and environmental safety and preservation of resources.  The WSTF Safety Management System is based on the concept that safety is the individual and personal responsibility of everyone at WSTF.   Imbedded within the management system are procedures for control of processes containing hazardous substances during the design, buildup, and test phases of programs, and emergency protocols to be followed in the event of an accidental release of a hazardous substance.  The management system assures that WSTF is compliant with applicable State, Federal, and NASA regulations.\n\n\n\nThe primary accidental release prevention measures are provided in the Process Safety Management (PSM) program.  The PSM instruction, written in compliance to 29 CFR (OSHA) 1910.119, Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals, outlines the steps necessary to design, build, verify, and perform testing operations using highly hazardous chemicals as defined by the standard.  Included in the PSM program are provisions for training of personnel, employee participation, desi"

WSTF has chartered an EPP Board, whose principle responsibility is the continuous review and update of the plan, assuring its effective maintenance.\n\n\n\nWSTF recognizes the need for public awareness where hazardous chemicals are concerned.  Representatives from the site participate in the Dona Ana County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  Representatives from the WSTF site brief the committee on what chemicals are located on site, what processes they are involved in, and what safety precautions are taken to ensure the safety of employees as well as the public.  The representatives report mishaps and releases in the LEPC annual report, if any occur.\n\n\n\n4.0    WSTF FACILITIES REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nSeveral hazardous chemicals are essential in testing propulsion systems at WSTF.  The EPA regulates two of these chemicals that WSTF possesses in an amount over the regulated threshold, the rocket propulsion fuels hydrazine and monomethyl hydrazine (MMH).  These fuels are used in several Space Shuttle and Space Station propulsion subsystems.  Hydrazine and MMH are stored in regulated quantities in four test areas within the site.  \n\n    \n\n* The 300 Area Hydrazine System - 2,000 gallons of hydrazine\n\n* The 300 Area MMH System - 3,197 gallons contained in the ready storage units (RSU's) and 3,585 gallons contained in dump tanks\n\n* The 400 Area MMH System - 5,200 gall"

In the event of a propellant release at the tanks, the material would remain in the secondary containment barrier rather than drain to grade.  The tanks are also protected by a remote-activated FIREX water deluge system.\n\n* Testing activities in the 300 and 400 Areas are controlled from hardened blockhouses that protect employees from potential explosions or toxic releases.  The blockhouses are designated as a safe haven for toxic releases.  The blockhouse monitors are stationed at the safety console during propellant operations so that activation of safety systems such as intercoms, sirens, and FIREX systems can be accomplished quickly.  The monitor can readily communicate with WSTF Fire Department personnel in the event of an accident during testing operations.\n\n\n\n5.1 WORST-CASE SCENARIO\n\n\n\nAll four EPA-regulated processes were modeled to determine the one that had the greatest risk of exposure to public or environmental receptors.  It was found that the 400 Area MMH System posed the greatest risk of the four regulated processes and is the process that will be reported.   The meteorological conditions used were those specified by EPA regulations.  The ambient and in-vessel fluid temperature used was 112 oF; humidity was set at 50 percent with a wind speed of 1.5 m/s, and an atmospheric stability class of  \"F\" (very stable).

Three major types of credible releases were consistently given:  (1) a transportation handling accident, (2) process piping failure during circulation of propellant at one of the Ready Storage Units (RSU's), and (3) process piping failure during transfer of propellant from an RSU to one of the Test Stand Auxiliary Conditioning Units (ACU's).\n\n\n\nUpon consideration of the credible releases, a shipping container mishandling scenario was selected for the 500 Area Propellant Storage area.  A process piping release scenario during transfer of propellant from an RSU to an ACU was selected for the 300 and 400 Area MMH systems and the 300 Area Hydrazine system.\n\n\n\nThe meteorological conditions for all the alternative releases were the same.  Each scenario was modeled as a liquid stream released continuously at 70 oF at ground level into a concrete substrate with a pool area of 900 square feet.  The wind speed was chosen to be 15 mph, an ambient temperature of 75 oF, a stability class of \"C\" (slightly unstable), and a humidity of 30 percent.  These conditions were selected as representative based on data from the WSTF Facility Master Plan, Section 5, Environment.\n\n\n\n5.2.1 500 Area Propellant Storage - Shipping Container Mishandling Scenario \n\n\n\nThe scenario chosen involves a 55-gallon drum of MMH being transported from the 500 Area Propellant Storage to the 300 or 400 Area MMH Systems.  A traffic accident causes the drum to be physically dropped off the transport vehicle, resulting in a release of the entire contents.

During a transfer operation from the fuel RSU to a Test Stand ACU, mechanical failure of a section of line downstream of the RSU and upstream of the ACU occurs.  The approximate flow rate for this operation is 50-60 gallons per minute.  The response by the technicians performing this manual operation was estimated to be within 30 seconds, but a conservative value of a 1-minute response was selected.  In this case, 50-60 gallons may be released plus the quantity of propellant in the 2-inch-diameter line.  Given a 50-foot section of line, the quantity released would be an additional 10 gallons (rounded up from 8.16 gallons), resulting in a total release of 60-70 gallons of MMH.  Since a continuous release toxic model was selected, the inputs used were the release rate at 400 pounds per minute and time duration of 1 minute.\n\n\n\nAdministrative controls and mitigation measures used for the 300 and 400 Area MMH processes to prevent and minimize the effects of a release are listed in Section 5.0.\n\n\n\n5.2.3 Transfer of Hydrazine from the 300 Hydrazine Conditioning Unit (HCU) to Test Stand 303 - Process Piping Failure Scenario\n\n\n\nThe following scenario was used for the 300 Area Hydrazine System:  During a transfer operation from the 300 HCU to Test Stand 303, mechanical failure of a section of line occurs.

Two lower level documents, WSTF Standard Procedure (WSP) 25-0001, Safety Planning, and WSTF Standard Instruction (WSI) 25-SW-0005, Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals, are the primary documents to ensure prevention of accidental releases.  The lower-level documents, in turn, reference relevant portions of the WSTF Quality System, including Design Control, Process Control, and Training.\n\n\n\nIn general, the accidental release prevention program in WSP 25-0001 and WSI 25-SW-0005 can be summarized as follows:\n\n\n\n* Training of employees, from new hire status through in-depth system training, is accomplished and tracked within the WSTF Training Database.\n\n* System safety is accomplished in the design stages of programs through design review, system safety analyses, operational readiness inspections, and test readiness reviews.  Integral to these reviews are the presentation of Failure Modes and Effects Analyses and Process Hazard Analyses.  Changes to existing systems or processes require review and approval by appropriate personnel to ensure continued safe operations. \n\n* Process control is accomplished in the buildup and test phases of projects through step-by-step work instructions that are re"
