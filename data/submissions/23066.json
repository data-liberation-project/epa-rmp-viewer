Personnel receive training approximately monthly and members are specialty trained (ERT, EMT, HAZMAT). The Natchez Mill has established a written emergency response plan that complies with the RMP rule and with other federal contingency plan regulations.  This plan has been communicated to local emergency response officials through the civil defense office and the fire department.  Regular dialogue is maintained between the Natchez Mill and the local emergency planning committee (LEPC).  The Natchez Mill conducts periodic drills and participates in the annual LEPC community drill.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe Natchez Mill strives to improve the safety of the processes. Improvement items come from annual review of procedures, the management of change program, PHA revalidations.  A recently completed item was to reroute the SO2 pulldown system to the Flakt scrubber in the power house and away from the bleach plant."

This potential release scenario could possibly impact public receptors such as schools, residences, hospitals, correctional facilities, recreational and industrial facilities.  There are also potential environmental receptors of national and state parks, forests, and officially designated wildlife sanctuaries, preserves or refuges.\n\nThe alternate release scenario for sulfur dioxide is a tank overfill and a release of 50 gallons (568 pounds) detected and stopped within 10 minutes.  Public receptors possibly impacted are residences, recreation and industrial areas.  There are no environmental receptors impacted.\n\nChlorine\n\nThe alternate release scenario for chlorine is a gasket leak of 10 gallons/minute (3675 pounds total), detected and stopped within 30 minutes.  Public receptors possibly impacted are residences, recreation and industrial areas.  There are no environmental receptors impacted.\n\nChlorine Dioxide\n\nThe alternate release scenario for chlorine dioxide is a liquid solution leak into the diked containment area around the largest of the two onsite storage tanks to 80% of the dike height (506 pounds) that evaporates over one hours time.  Public receptors possibly impacted are residences, recreation and industrial areas.  There are no environmental receptors impacted.\n\nAccidental Release P"

The Natchez Mill maintenance program includes (1) procedures to safely guide workers in their maintenance tasks, (2) worker training in the maintenance department procedures, and (3) an inspection and testing program to help identify equipment deterioration and damage before the equipment fails.  Procedures are reviewed annually for accuracy.  Refresher training is given to appropriate employees.  Preventative maintenance routes are performed on a regular basis (daily, weekly, monthly, annually as necessary).  Maintenance personnel are specialty task trained (STT) to where only those workers receiving the STT training can perform work on the covered systems.\n\nCOMPLIANCE AUDITS.  The Natchez Mill has compliance audits performed every three years of covered processes to verify that the processes are operating in compliance with the requirements of Process Safety Management and the RMP rule.  The audits are conducted by trained corporate personnel.  A compliance audit report is prepared after each audit and any deficiencies noted by the audit team are corrected in a timely manner.  Our last audit was in May, 1998.\n\nINCIDENT INVESTIGATION.  The Natchez Mill investigates all incidents that could reasonably have resulted in a serious injury to personnel, the public or the environment.  The Natchez Mill encourages all employees to identify and report any incident requiring investigation to the regulatory compliance technician, EHS coordinator, area management personnel, etc.  Also, there is a near miss hotline where incidents can be reported anonymously.

As part of this committment, the Natchez Mill has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at the facility.  One component of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the Natchez Mill and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMPlan) describing the risk management program at the Natchez Mill.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMPlan requirement of the RMP rule (CFR 68 150 through 185) and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at the Natchez Mill.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe Natchez Mil is committed to the safety of its workers and the public, and to the preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  The Natchez Mill implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances.  In the event of an accidental release, the Natchez Mill controls, contains, cleans up the release in a manner that will be safe for workers and will help prevent injury to the public or the environment.\n\nThe Natchez Mill and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Natchez Mill is a dissolving pulp mill with 100% chlorine dioxide bleaching operations.

The following paragraphs describe the prevention program elements at the Natchez Mill that apply to these units.\n\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION.  The Natchez Mill maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to help ensure safe operation of the dissolving pulp process.  Material safety data sheets (MSDSs) document the physical properties of hazardous substances handled at the mill, including RMP regulated substances in the covered process.  There are engineering design documents that show proper operating parameters, design basis and the process overview.  There are also references to applicable codes and standards.\n\nPROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS.  The Natchez mill has performed all initial PHAs and is in the process of revalidating all PHAs.  The PHAs help identify and control process hazards.  HAZOP and checklists were used extensively in the initial PHAs and in the revalidation process being used to update the PHAs.  This is a technique to verify the accuracy of original PHAs, ensure corrective actions were completed, studies Management of Change documentation and conducts a facility siting and human factors study.  The reviews include items that help ensure that the Natchez Mil operates and maintains the equipment in a manner consistent with applicable design specifications, codes, standards and regulations.\n\nOPERATING PROCEDURES.  The Natchez Mill has developed and maintains operating procedures to define how tasks related to process operations should be performed.
