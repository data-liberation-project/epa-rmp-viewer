NE location utilizes the following accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the stationary source: \n   -systems are designed by engineers\n   -standard operating procedures to ensure the facility is operated as designed\n   -?management of change? to ensure the covered process is not altered without a safety review \n   -operator training to ensure correct operating procedure (SOP) \n   -operator training to ensure emergency response including shutting down systems to limit the impact of potential release\n   -enforcement of area electrical classification and conforming equipment\n   -safety training for all personnel on site\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED:\n\nThe substance which triggers 40 CFR 68 compliance is hydrogen, stored in both liquid and gas form.\n\nThe primary function of the Air Liquide Electronics U.S. LP (ALEUS) facility at 3322 Road ?N? NE is to supply bulk gasses to our customer via pipeline on a 24 hour, 365-day basis. The facility manufactures a flammable gas by process of catalytic reformation.\n\nDuring the process of manufacturing flammable gas, raw material flammable gas is combined with steam at high temperatures, which causes a reaction releasing product flammable gas. \n\nFlammable gas is stored in liquid form in stationary bulk tanks.\n\nThe ALEUS stationary source located at 3322 Road ?N? NE, includes two 20,000 gallon (jacketed vacuum insulated cryogenic, horizontal) tanks of flammable gas, one 20,260 gallon (jacketed vacu"

The equipment was designed by engineers. Documentation pertaining to the design of the process and recommended maintenance / integrity inspections are followed. \n\nProcess hazard analysis by HAZOP has been used to identify potential concerns and ensure mitigation to low levels of risk per ALEUS policy. \n\nIf contractors are used on the site, rigorous selection and training specific to the site is performed to ensure potential hazards of contractors are mitigated. \n\nA hot work program is used to lower risk from hot work. \n\nManagement of change is used for any alterations to the system. \n\nAn incident investigation process applied at multiple facilities in different geographic areas facilitates the timely review of all similar systems operated by Air Liquide ensuring identified risks are mitigated. \n\nAn emergency action plan is utilized. All employees are trained on emergency action plan. \n\nAudits of the system are conducted periodically and a pre-startup review occurs prior to startup after any significant change.\n\nThis facility complies with EPA?s accident prevention rule, the OSHA PSM standard, and all applicable state and local codes and regulations. The covered bulk tanks were designed / installed and is maintained in accordance with NFPA-58 and Washington state law. \n\nIn addition, the Air Liquide Electronics U.S. LP (ALEUS) facility at 3322 Road ?N? NE utilizes safety equipment such as:\n      -gauges and internal piping to ensure the bulk tanks are operated at or below maximum allowable "
