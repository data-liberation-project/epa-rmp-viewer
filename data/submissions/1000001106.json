We have considered a train derailment to be our worse-case scenario.  Our employees have been trained in their respective emergency actions, including the emergency meeting place and each of their individual responsibilities regarding an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia. We comply with the standards of the U. S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia and the regulations of the Kansas Department of Agriculture. \n\n\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage. \n\n\n\nThe facility has a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38. We have provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title lll (EPCRA).
