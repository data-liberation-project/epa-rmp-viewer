The process is located at 411 W. Gemini, Tempe, Arizona 85283.  The chlorine transfer system for Pool Chlor of Tempe consists of chlorine one-ton containers which are the storage vessels.  Chlorine gas is drawn from the ton container to 20 pound cylinders.  The following is a list of the chlorine equipment.\n\nChlorine Tanks (one ton containers)\n(6 - Maximum that can be stored) Located at the south end of the facility\n\nChlorine Tank (20 lb. container)\n(150 - Maximum that can be stored): Located at the north end of the facility\n\nFilling Manifold: Located at the south end of the facility\n\nScrubber System: Located at the north end of the facility.\n\nThe maximum quantity of chlorine that can be stored on site is 12,000 pounds.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nPool Chlor of Tempe has a Process Safety Management program in place to manage the handling of chlorine.

      "SummaryText": "includes common practices outlined by the Chlorine Institute and the National Association of Gas Chlorinators.  In addition to the Management Programs, there is a scrubber system that is used in conjunction while transferring chlorine.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nBased on the Hazard Assesssment (dated April 6, 2004), the five year accident history investigation (June 1999 - June 2004) revealed that there has been no reportable release of chlorine at the facility.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nIf a release of chlorine were to occur, Pool Chlor of Tempe's response plan is to call 911 in order to reach the Fire Department's HAZMAT team.  Hill Brothers Chemicals would be contacted to perform the actual repairs.  Pool Chlor of Tempe has a B-kit available at the facility in order to mitigate a chlorine release.  Employees will evacuate the facility to a point that is upwind of the hazard.  Evacuation drills are performed annually.  The emergency response plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, and to ensure that the plan is kept current.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nPool Chlor of Tempe has conducted a PSM/RMP Compliance Audit (September 2002) and revalidated the Process Hazard Analysis (April 2004).  All recommendations resulting from the audit have been completed.  The Process Hazard Analysis Revalidation revealed that no necessary modifications are needed to ensure a safe operation. \n\nThe Process Safety Management team will continue to provide a safe environment by ensuring employee involvement in safety development and training."
