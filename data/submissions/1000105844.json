This prevention program was designed around a management program that includes the development of system & equipment operating procedures, maintaining the mechanical integrity of the equipment, and training of the operators on the proper operation of the system.  The primary objective of the prevention program is to ensure the complete containment of ammonia through safe operation and maintenance of the refrigeration system.\n\t\nMichigan Milk Producers Association completed a process hazard analysis (PHA) of the ammonia refrigeration system as part of their commitment to safety and the facility continues to revalidate it every five years and update it as needed.\n\t\nFive-year accident history\n\t\nMichigan Milk Producers Association has not had an event occur in the last five years that meets the EPA definition of an accident that caused injuries, deaths, or significant property damage on-site, or injuries, deaths, environmental damage, property damage, evacuations, or shelters-in-place off-site.\n\t\nIn the event"

The refrigeration system has an inventory of ammonia that is considered hazardous by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  The same properties that make this chemical valuable as a refrigerant also make it necessary to observe specific safety precautions.  These safety precautions are exercised in the operation and maintenance of the refrigeration system to control human environmental exposure in an effort to reduce the overall threat to workers as well as the surrounding communities and the environment.\n\t\nIt is Michigan Milk Producers Association's policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws, rules, and regulations.  However, the safe handling of ammonia is paramount at Michigan Milk Producers Association.  Standards and recommended practices governing the safe handling of ammonia are used to ensure that a reasonable level of risk reduction is maintained.  Safety depends upon management commitment, the manner in which ammonia refrigerant is handled, the safety devices inherent to the refrigeration system design, operating procedures and philosophies, and the training of Michigan Milk Producers Association workers.\n\t\nThe Emergency Evacuation Plan outlines procedures for warned and unwarned emergencies that may occur at the plant.  Warned emergencies are usually tornadoes, heavy snowstorms, or conditions that are reasonably predictable.  Unwarned emergencies usually consist of onsite emergencies such as a spill, fire/explosion, or chemical release.
