              "Description": "The Olympic Regional Development Authority (ORDA) Olympic Sports Complex (OSC) has developed a Risk Management Program designed to manage the hazards associated with operating an anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system. The OSC refrigeration system is a single process and is used to maintain the ice surface on the Combined Bobsled, Skeleton and Luge Sliding Track. This section includes information describing the Prevention Program. \n\n\n\nOften correlated, the prevention program encompasses twelve major elements:\n\n*Process Safety Information\n\n*Process Hazard Analysis\n\n*Operating Procedures\n\n*Training\n\n*Employee Participation\n\n*Mechanical Integrity \n\n*Management of Change\n\n*Pre-Startup Review\n\n*Compliance Audits\n\n*Incident Investigation Procedures\n\n*Hot Work Procedures\n\n*Contractor Procedures\n\n\n\nProcess safety information is compiled and a hazard analysis completed by a team consisting of OSC refrigeration employees and others knowledgeable of the process and of PHA techniques. This information and analysis is frequently reviewed for necessary changes or updates. A PHA What If/ Checklist and tracking report is developed and recommended changes defined and implemented. The hazard review is revalidated and updated through ?PHA Sessions? held every at least every five years or whenever a new hazard may be introduced.\n\n\n\nEndeavoring ownership in the Risk Management Program and accident prevention, the OSC promotes employee participation. Employees were involved during the initial development and implementation of the PSM and RMP. Employees assist with the ongoing evolution of the risk management program and have free access to all relative information. \n\n\n\nManagement of Change and Pre-Startup Review are addressed through documented procedures and a review log. These reviews allow the OSC to evaluate the need for modification of the prevention provisions.\n\n\n\nAudit procedures have been written and an internal compliance audit is conducted at least every three years. The audit looks at compliance with regulations and the effectiveness of the Prevention Program. An Audit Report is developed. The findings and recommended changes are documented and tracked for progress.\n\n\n\nAn incident investigation procedure is established which would allow us to identify the cause(s) of a release, so corrective measures can be implemented to prevent recurrence.  \n\n\n\nThe Olympic Sports Complex maintains a term contract with a qualified refrigeration contractor, usually on a five year cycle. Contractor procedures are established where contractor?s safety program and performance is thoroughly reviewed and documented. Procedures also address contractors who are hired to work near but not on the ammonia system.\n\n\n\nWritten standard operating procedures are well developed, updated as needed and recertified at least annually. Employee training is conducted and documented on procedures and hazards associated with the process. The procedures and training incorporate practices for conducting; safe work, hot work, confined space, lockout/ tagout, PPE inspection and use, emergency operations, emergency response and more.\n\n\n\nTo ensure safety and reliability of process equipment, the OSC has developed and maintains a mechanical integrity program. Overall, the program is reviewed and revalidated at least annually. The program addresses items such as equipment inspections, test procedures, frequency of procedures, safe operating limits, deficiencies, corrections and documentation. The OSC adheres to good engineering practices and manufacturer recommendations. \n\n",

Van Hoevenberg, in the Town of North Elba, near Lake Placid, NY. Like the other facilities in and around Lake Placid that ORDA operates and maintains, the facility was mostly constructed for the 1980 Olympic Games. The Olympic Sports Complex includes two tracks; The Combined Track which became operational in February, 2000 and the historic 1980 track, used in the Olympic Games.\n\n\n\nThe Combined Track includes an industrial refrigeration system which utilizes anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant to create and maintain an ice surface. The ammonia refrigeration system operates on a seasonal basis, typically between October and April.  During the off-season, the refrigeration system is shutdown. During winter operation, the facility is staffed 24/7. \n\n\n\nSince the refrigeration system uses greater than 10,000 lbs. of anhydrous ammonia, the facility is subject to the USEPA's Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions. The Olympic Sports Complex has developed a comprehensive Risk Management Program to ensure the safe use of anhydrous ammonia and fulfill its commitment to the safety of employees, the community and the environment.\n\n\n\nKey components of the Risk Management Program include:\n\n*Management System \n\n*Prevention Program \n\n*5 Year Accident History\n\n*Offsite Consequence Analysis\n\n*Emergency Response\n\n\n\nManagement System\n\n\n\nA management system is in place which designates responsibilities and guides implementation of the Risk Management Program.\n\n\n\nPrevention Program\n\n\n\nA prevention program in compliance with 40 CFR Part 68 Subpart D Program 3 and OSHA's 29 CFR 1910.119 PSM Standard is established and described in section 7 of this Risk Management Plan (RMP).

However, as required by regulations, the OSC has completed an Offsite Consequence Analysis which evaluates both a worst case scenario (WCS) and alternate release scenario (ARS) involving hypothetical ammonia releases.  Both the WCS and ARS identify the potential for impacts to public and environmental receptors. \n\n\n\nWorst Case Scenario\n\n\n\nThe WCS considers a catastrophic failure of the largest vessel resulting in the 48,400 lbs of anhydrous ammonia postulated to release over a period of ten minutes. Scenario parameters factor worst case meteorological conditions. EPA's Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration and Appendix E: Supplemental Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Facilities was used in modeling the scenario. The result shows a potential offsite impact distance to endpoint radius of 1.6 miles.\n\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenario\n\n\n\nThe ARS evaluates a release that has more plausible chance of occurring than the WCS. The scenario was computed using EPA's RMP*Comp Program and involves a loss of 275 lbs of ammonia through a pressure safety valve which would potentially impact a .2 mile radius. \n\n\n\nEmergency Response\n\n\n\nThe Olympic Sports Complex has a well developed Emergency Response Plan in place which details how to handle potential emergencies at the facility.
