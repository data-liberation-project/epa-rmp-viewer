Van Hoevenberg, in the Town of North Elba, near Lake Placid, NY. Like the other facilities in and around Lake Placid that ORDA operates and maintains, the facility was mostly constructed for the 1980 Olympic Games. The Olympic Sports Complex includes two tracks; The Combined Track which became operational in February, 2000 and the historic 1980 track, used in the Olympic Games.\r\n\r\nThe Combined Track includes an industrial refrigeration system which utilizes anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant to create and maintain an ice surface. The ammonia refrigeration system operates on a seasonal basis, typically between October and April.  During the off-season, the refrigeration system is shutdown. During winter operation, the facility is staffed 24/7. \r\n\r\nSince the refrigeration system uses greater than 10,000 lbs. of anhydrous ammonia, the facility is subject to the USEPA's Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions. The Olympic Sports Complex has developed a comprehensive Risk Management Program to ensure the safe use of anhydrous ammonia and fulfill its commitment to the safety of employees, the community and the environment.\r\n\r\nKey components of the Risk Management Program include:\r\n*Management System \r\n*Prevention Program \r\n*5 Year Accident History\r\n*Offsite Consequence Analysis\r\n*Emergency Response\r\n\r\nManagement System\r\n\r\nA management system is in place which designates responsibilities and guides implementation of the Risk Management Program.\r\n\r\nPrevention Program\r\n\r\nA prevention program in compliance with 40 CFR Part 68 Subpart D Program 3 and OSHA's 29 CFR 1910.119 PSM Standard is established and described in section 7 of this Risk Management Plan (RMP).

However, as required by regulations, the OSC has completed an Offsite Consequence Analysis which evaluates both a worst case scenario (WCS) and alternate release scenario (ARS) involving hypothetical ammonia releases.  Both the WCS and ARS identify the potential for impacts to public and environmental receptors. \r\n\r\nWorst Case Scenario\r\n\r\nThe WCS considers a catastrophic failure of the largest vessel resulting in the 48,400 lbs of anhydrous ammonia postulated to release over a period of ten minutes. Scenario parameters factor worst case meteorological conditions. EPA's Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration and Appendix E: Supplemental Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Facilities was used in modeling the scenario. The result shows a potential offsite impact distance to endpoint radius of 1.6 miles.\r\n\r\nAlternative Release Scenario\r\n\r\nThe ARS evaluates a release that has more plausible chance of occurring than the WCS. The scenario was computed using EPA's RMP*Comp Program and involves a loss of 275 lbs of ammonia through a pressure safety valve which would potentially impact a .2 mile radius. \r\n\r\nEmergency Response\r\n\r\nThe Olympic Sports Complex has a well developed Emergency Response Plan in place which details how to handle potential emergencies at the facility.
