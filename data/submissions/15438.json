The California Office of Emergency Services (OES) oversees the CalARP regulations.  The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) has delegated implementation authority for the federal program to OES.  At the local level, the program is implemented by the Certified Unified Permitting Agency (CUPA).  For facilities operating within the City of Tulare, the CUPA is the Tulare County Environmental Health Department.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia, a regulated chemical is present above threshold quantities at the Land O'Lakes, Dairyman's Division, Tulare facility.  There are four individual covered processes present on-site with three separate refrigeration processes.  The first refrigeration process serves Plant I and Plant II with a refrigeration process for each of the other two covered processes.\n\nThe federal threshold quantity for anhydrous ammonia is 10,000 pounds and the state threshold quantity is 500 pounds.  \n\nThe RMP must be developed from a comprehensive assessment of the processes, operations, and procedures at the facility, and includes four main elements:\n\n     A Management System that specifies qualified and responsible persons;\n     A Hazard Assessment that analyzes and documents potential environmental and population receptors due to an accidental release;\n     A Prevention Program that compiles operational procedures, safety information, and specific hazard information into a program that minimizes the threat of an accidental release; and\n     An Emergency Response Program that establishes procedures to deal with the results of an accidental release.\n\nAny facility that p"
