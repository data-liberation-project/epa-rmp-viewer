In addition, it is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state and local laws.\n\nIvanhoe Farmers Elevator's Mission states \"To provide for the safety of our employees, our customers and the general public.\"  In order to fulfill this mission, Ivanhoe provides a corporate EHS group to maintain and administer compregensive safety and environmental programs and procedures.  EHS field safety services supervisors audit and monitor facility compliance with the safety standards of the company.\n\nThis Facility maintains approximately 17 1000 gallon nurse tanks for customer delivery.  Our combined storage capacity in nurse tanks is 17000 pounds.\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia is stored in 3 stationary storage tanks 1- 18000 gallon and 2- 12000 gallon on site.  36120 pounds of anhydrous ammonia is the maximum storage capacity of stationary storage tanks.  The largest single storage vessel at our facility contains 15480 pounds.\n\nThe worst case scenario\n\nOur worst case scenario is the loss of the total contents of the 36120 gallon storage tank, when filled to the greatest amount allowed (85% of capacity), release as a gas over 10 minutes, resulting total vaporization.  The maximum quantity released would be 420 pounds.  According to DEGADIS modeling, "

It should be noted that Ivanhoe Farmers Elevator has never had a release of an entire stationary storage tank.\n\nAlternative Release scenario\n\nThe most common alternative release scenarios from our facility would not reach an end-point off-site.  The alternative release scenario modeled for the purposes of this plan is a 2- minute release form a stationary storage tank representing a valve and hose failure requiring a manual shut down.  The total amount of angydrous ammonia released in this scenario would be 18000 pounds.  This release scenario ( distance to point of dispersion to 200 ppm) would have off site impact.  It should be noted Ivanhoe has not had a release of this type from any distribution facility.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps.  \nThe ammonia system is designed, installed and is maintained in accordance with ASTM standards and the ASME codes.  This facility complies with the ANSI K 61.1 standars (1989), OSHA (29 CFR 1910.111), EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule as well as all applicable federal, state and local codes and regulations.\n\nOur ammonia system is protected from major releases by inernal excess flow valves, check valves, relief valves, manual shutoffs and emergency shutoff valves.  The load- out risers used for the purpose of filling the nurse tanks are protected by excess flow valves and fill line breakaways to immediately stop the flow of ammonia if a line or a hose fails.  All of the main storage tank valves and the riser load valves are locked when not in use.\n\nOur ammonia system is inspected  on a regular basis with maintenance and preventive maintenance scheduled and documented.  Liquid and vapor valves, hoses, excess flow valves, gauges, and relief valves are replaced when necessary and /or according to the guidelinges in the ANSI standards.\n\nThis location is required to conduct their own "

Anhydrous Ammonia is received by truck, is handled and stored on-site and is regulated substance by the EPA requiring us to comply with the Risk Management Program.  We sell anhydrous ammonia to grower custormers in 1000 gallon nurse tanks.  The customer applies the ammonia into the soil as a souce of nitrogen fertilizer for growing agricultural crops.  Ammonia may also be used for blending into mixed grade fertilizers fro crop production nutrients.\n\nTraining is provided to all employees at least annually, whenever there is a change in the process or whenever competency with the regulations is questioned.

This will help to ensure that our community has the strategy for responding to and mitigationg the threat posed by an ammonia release.  This complies with the requirement for our facility to be included in the community emergency response plan prepared wuner EPCRA and coordingated with our LEPC.\n\nIn addition, Ivanhoe Farmers Elevator has an Emergency Response and Contingency Plan for the facility that complies with the requirements of OSHA (29 CFR 1910.38 and 1910.1200).  The plan includes public notifiction, provisions for initial medical care, evacuations and LEPC coordination.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety\nWe do not plan to make any changes to the physical site.
