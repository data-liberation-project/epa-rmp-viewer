The site occupies approximately 1,500 acres and has approximately 680 employees on site. Production at the McIntosh site began in 1952 with 32 employees manufacturing one product.  Currently, the site produces additives for plastics, paints, and oils, optical brightners used in the detergent, paper and textile industries, and chemicals used in household products.  \n\nWith an injury frequency rate of 44 percent and DART rates 50% below the national average, the McIntosh site is a leader in safety.  In fact, employees at the site have worked one million safe hours (hours worked without a lost time accident) 38 times since 1972.  The OSHA VPP Star Designation program requires stringent inspections and an excellent safety and health program.  In 1989, the McIntosh site became the 64th industrial site out of five million in the U.S. to receive the coveted designation.  The site was re-certified as an OSHA VPP Star site in 2006.\n\nThe line of products at McIntosh may vary in response to market demand. A brief description of each production area follows below:\n\nThe Antioxidants and Metilox Area 1 is designed to produce Irgafos (process stabilizers used primarily as blend components) and Irganox (antioxidants).  In this Area, raw materials and solvents are fed to reactors.  The reaction mass undergoes additional processing steps such as stripping, crystallizing, centrifuging, blending, and drying.  The products are then either packaged dry or transferred to the granulations area.  Solvents used in the process are recovered and reused. \n\nThe Tinuvins Area 17/18 is designed to produce various additives by diazotizing o-nitro"

The intermediate is then separated from the reaction mass and dissolved in a solvent before being reacted with hydrogen in the presence of a catalyst to form the corresponding additive product.  The catalyst is then removed from the reaction mass and the solvents partially stripped off.  The product is finally purified, isolated and dried to the finished form for packaging. \n\nThe HALS Area 20 is a multi-product batch processing unit that produces a variety of additives that are used in other finished products.  Some of the chemicals produced in Area 20 include light stabilizers, antioxidants, and oil additives. \n\nThe Stilbenics Area 8 produces fluorescent whitening agent (FWA) intermediates and paper dyes.  These are either further processed on site or sold.  The FWA intermediates and some of the paper dyes are produced from a para-nitro toluene base.  Many dyes are also formulated and/or repackaged, but not chemically produced in the Area. \n\nThe Stilbenics Area 10 primary task is to produce fluorescent whitening agents (FWA) that are used in various commercial products, such as paper, textiles, and detergents.  The process consists of reacting cyanuric chloride, diaminostilbene disulfonic acid, and various amines and/or glycols to form a number of final products.  Solvents used include water and methyl ethyl ketone. The final products are sold in liquid, solid or slurry forms.  Various additives are used to enhance product performance.\n\nThe Utilities Department controls all the boilers as well as the hydrogen storage and header system. \n\nA waste management facility (Area 15) also exists on site which includes an incinerator for hazardous waste as well as aboveground wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) that treats sanitary and process wastewater generated at the plant. \n\nRMP-regulated substances at the site in quantities exceeding the thr"

These levels range from a Program 1 that imposes minimal requirements on a process to a Program 2 or 3 which require a much greater level of effort.  The McIntosh site is subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, 29 CFR 1910.119.  The site?s processes are also included in the nine SIC codes specified by the RMP rule.  Therefore, the facility has designated all of its RMP-subject processes to be in the Program 3 level of the RMP.\n\nThe third key element in the RMP regulations is that Program 3 facilities must conduct an offsite consequence analysis.  Ciba opted to use the EPA guidance manual mainly because it is more conservative than most commercial models. Ciba also used the toxic endpoint concentrations specified in the manual, which represent concentrations below those believed to cause serious health effects after thirty to sixty minutes of exposure. This data was then confirmed using the EPA provided software RMP*COMP. \n\nA worst-case and an alternative release scenario were considered for each RMP-regulated toxic chemical on site.  The alternative release scenarios were based on process knowledge, accident history or the process hazard analysis conducted for the unit.\n\nSpill prevention measures in place for certain RMP chemicals include the use of a double walled storage tank, redundant level instrumentation, preventive maintenance programs, scrubber system, and computer controls and interlocks. If a spill should occur, the storage area is located within a concrete dike to contain the spill, and a storage tank is always kept empty for emergency storage. A special neutra"

The unloading operation is also monitored by a computer and by control room operator. Should a problem with the unloading occur, the tank trucks are equipped with an emergency cut off valve that can quickly be closed from the front of the truck.  Also, the unloading area is surrounded by a concrete dike that is large enough to hold the contents of an entire truckload of material. This diked area is equipped with a foam spray system that can be used to provide a protective barrier to prevent vapors from a spill from being released to the air. Procedures, training, safety systems and preventive maintenance programs are all in place to prevent spills, but should a spill occur, this unit  is well prepared to effectively respond.\n\nTraining, procedures, safety systems, and preventive maintenance programs are all in place to ensure we will  handle all materials safely.\n\nAnother key element of the RMP regulations is to develop and submit a five-year accident history involving RMP-regulated substances.  \n\nAn accident occurred on February 3, 2005 from a release of approximately 80 gallons of phosphorous trichloride  that resulted in injuries to  two contract employees from exposure to hydrochloric acid vapors and requiring medical treatment and overnight observation at an area hospital as a precautionary measure. The release lasted for approximately 45 minutes. As a result of this release, the operating unit has updated the maintenance procedure and implemented improved controls in the process.\n\nIn order to deal with potential accidents and emergencies, Ciba has an Emergency Action and Response Plan in place.  In addition, there is a written contingency plan for the Area 15 treatment, storage and disposal (TSD) facility.  The contingency plan is part of the RCRA part B permit applicatio"

The Ciba hazmat team is utilized by the county for any hazmat incidents. Ciba's emergency response coordinator is also the chairman of the Local Emergency Planning Committee.  A community evacuation drill was conducted on February 19, 2000.  A tabletop emergency response exercise including the community was conducted on October 15 2003, and a full scale emergency response drill with community participation was conducted on November 14, 2003. In addition, this Ciba facility in coordination with other companies in the industrial park have provided local residents within a three mile radius a microsiren alert radio. This is an emergency alert system which will provide emergency information and instructions to the local community in an emergency situation."
