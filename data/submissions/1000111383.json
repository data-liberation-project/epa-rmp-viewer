Five Year Accident History: \nNone.\n\n6. Emergency Response Program:\nAll employees are trained on Emergency Action Plan including alarm response and building evacuation. There is a trained emergency Response Team for minor leak repairs and incipient fire fighting. Fire alarm will automatically summon the local fire department, shut down the process, and shut off the gas supply. Pre-planning will be conducted with the local fire department. Emergency operation and response will be reviewed on an annual basis."

      "SummaryText": "RMP Louisville Executive Summary\nPlease note: Flammable Mixture (Isobutane and Butane ) and Propane, while both are above threshold quantities, are considered the same for emergency response and below scenario evaluation. \n\n1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\nThe Sealed Air Plant at Louisville has implemented an accidental Release Prevention Policy which integrates hydrocarbon sensors, redundant safety systems, alarm systems, stringent inspection, testing and calibration procedures, operational procedures, and management practices. All applicable EPA, OSHA, Kentucky and Louisville environmental health and safety regulations are adhered to. The Sealed Air, Louisville Emergency Response Policy involves site specific plans which are detailed in the Emergency Response Plan. This includes trained on site emergency responders for all operational hours and automatic systems that will stop the process and notify the local fire department.\n\n2. The Stationary Source and Regulated Substance Handled:\nThe Louisville Plant manufactures plastic foam packaging, and uses Isobutane, Butane, and Propane as  blowing agents to make the plastic foam. These are the only regulated substances in threshold quantities at this location.  Isobutane, Butane, and Propane  are  flammable hydrocarbons stored and used in liquid form by keeping the material under pressure,  they are released as a gas during the manufacturing process. This gas is collected and sent to an oxidizer in order to control emissions.\n\n3. Worst and Alternate Case Scenarios:\nThe Worst-case Release scenario is defined by EPA in the OCA as failure of the largest tank when full, and the vapors find an ignition source and the release explodes. The endpoint for a 1 psi overpressure is .43 miles. The plant is located in an industrial park with no residential receptors close by.\n\nThe Alternative Release scenario, or more credible scenario, is based upon catastrophic failure of the 2in delivery piping"
