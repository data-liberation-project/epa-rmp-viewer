Plains management philosophy goals are achieved through the implementation of the environmental, health and safety management systems, by the personal commitments of employees and contractors, and by open communication with employees, customers, neighbors, and regulators.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this Risk Management Plan (RMPlan) is to provide information about operations at the facility, programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, emergency response plans in the event an accidental release should occur, the five-year accident history of the facility, and planned changes to improve safety at the facility.\r\n\r\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\r\n\r\nThe Ridgelawn facility is owned by Plains LPG Services, L.P. and operated by Plains Marketing Canada, L.P. At the facility, railcars are stored on the property until marketing can find a suitable market for the liquids. Propane and butane are the primary substances regulated under the Risk Management Program (RMP) that are present at the Ridgelawn facility in amounts above threshold quantity. The facility is classified as Program Level 2 under the regulation.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs in place at the facility are part of the high standards striven for by Plains. These high standards include:\r\n\u00bf\tOperating in compliance with required environmental permits and regulations.\r\n\u00bf\tOperating and maintaining the assets in such a manner that unintentional releases are minimized.\r\n\u00bf\tOperating and maintaining assets in such a manner that the small releases associated with normal operation and maintenance will be minimized to"

However, they do operate under the requirements of Program Level 2 in the RMP regulations. Analysis of the potential hazards of the process, training of employees, and emphasis on safety has helped avoid any serious chemical release accidents since operations began. Part of this program has also involved identifying and taking steps to avoid potential accidental chemical releases.\r\n\r\nFive-Year Accident History\r\n\r\nNo incident resulting in onsite injuries, death or property damage or offsite impacts from a propane or butane release has occurred at the Ridgelawn Facility within the last five years.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\n\r\nThe facility has developed an emergency response plan, which will be coordinated with local emergency response groups such as the Sidney Fire Department. Also involved in emergency response for the facility would be the Richland County Sheriff's Office and County Emergency Services. The facility operator is responsible for coordinating the notifications required to initiate an emergency response. The Emergency Response Plan provides the essential planning for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nCompliance with the RMP Prevention Program coupled with the environmental, health and safety management systems, forms the framework for continuous safety improvement.
