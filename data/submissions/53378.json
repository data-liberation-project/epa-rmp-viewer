In 1993 we built a new state of the art manufacturing facility in Grundy County. We built this plant according to all Federal, State and Local requirements, and with strict compliance to NFPA #58, #70 and #15 specifications. We are committed to ourselves, our employees, the public and the environment to operate our facility in a safe manner.\n\n1. When we designed our plant all requirements of NFPA #58 to control accidental releases were built into it. We have always strived to keep up with changing regulations for the products that we handle and also any new safety devices that help insure that we do not have a chemical release. Since the plant was built we have monitored any change in safety regulations and have added any items required to date.\n\nTechnical Propellants, Inc. takes a very responsible attitude toward safety. Proper emergency planning and response are important elements of any safety and health program to help minimize employee exposure and injury. We have had emergency response policies in effect at our facility since we opened, with a copy on file with the LEPC. Since the inspection of RMP, we have updated them to include written instructions to alert our employees, the LEPC and required responders in case of emergency. We have also included safe distances and places of refuge, site security and control, evacuation routes and procedures. We are also involved in and a supporter of the Grundy County Hazmat team.\n\n2.

Our tank farm which consists of 22 steel ASME pressure tanks that contain our products is north of the office building.\n\nWe are a manufacturer of aerosol propellant. We receive raw LPG: ie-Propane, Isobutane, Butane into our plant by rail and by trucks. We process this material through molecular sieves that tak"
