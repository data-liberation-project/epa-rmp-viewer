Chlorine is used to treat plant water before it is returned to the city system.  This facility has an active HAZMAT Team that is involved with both hazardous materials on a 24 hour basis.  The local LEPC, fire department, police department, hospitals, and other local agencies are kept aware of the facility needs through a written emergency response program and on-site tours and discussions with the above agencies.  Both alternate and worst case release scenarios have been completed for chlorine and anhydrous ammonia.  A complete report including mapping can be reviewed by contacting the company at the address included in this report.  All other release data is included in this report under sections 2 and 3.  No accidents are reportable under this EPA regulation during the last five years.  The facility is continuously upgrading and reviewing the safety, health, and environmental programs.  This is accomplished by a full staff including, a safety coordinator, safety liason employees, a registered nurse, and an environmental engineer."
