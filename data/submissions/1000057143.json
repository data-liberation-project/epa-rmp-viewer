The facility uses a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of its employees and the public, as well as protection of the environment.  EDCC maintains an open dialogue with local emergency responders and has provided them with a copy of its Emergency Response Plan, detailing important facility-specific information.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that have been designed and implemented, including the following:\n\n\n\n?    A description of our facility and use of substances exceeding threshold quantities, in a single process, which are regulated by the EPA's RMP Rule;\n\n?    A summary of the potential off-site consequences from possible accidental chemical releases;\n\n?    An overview of accidental release prevention programs;\n\n?    A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by the RMP Rule;\n\n?    An overview of the Emergency Response Program; and,\n\n?    An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment.\n\n\n\n3.1  Regulated Substances\n\n\n\n    EDCC's primary activity involves the production of ammonium nitrate, nitric acid, and sulfuric acid.  These products are used extensively in the agricultural, mining, specialty chemical manufacturing, and forestry products industries.  From a consumer's viewpoint, these products are used in the manufacture of paper, water treatment chemicals, computer chips, and even blue jean dye to name a few applications.  The facility uses or manufactures the following chemicals that EPA has listed on the RMP Rule Toxic Substances list, and that are stored above threshold quantities:\n\n\n\nChemical    Process    Storage Temp (&#61616;F)    Storage pressure (psig)    Density\n\n(g/cm3)    Ma"

The facility keeps a maximum quantity of approximately 2,000 lbs of 15% bromine chloride on-site.  The threshold quantity for bromine is 10,000 lbs.\n\n\n\nAs this RMP will illustrate, accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning efforts enable the facility to effectively manage any potential hazards posed by these substances.\n\n&#8195;\n\n\n\n3.2  Accidental Release Prevention and Response Policies\n\n\n\nEDCC maintains a number of programs to help prevent accidental releases and ensure safe operation.

The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program in place at the facility.\n\n\n\n    3.2.1  Process Safety Information\n\n\n\nEDCC maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\n\n\n    3.2.2  Process Hazard Analysis\n\n\n\n    The facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is the \"HAZOP\" and/or the \"what if\" checklist.  These analyses are conducted by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are validated at regular intervals.  Findings related to the process hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n\n\n    3.2.3  Operating Procedures\n\n\n\n    For the purpose of safely conducting activities within covered processe"

These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, and operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\n\n\n    3.2.8  Compliance Audit\n\n\n\nEDCC conducts compliance audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions of the prevention program set out under Subpart D are being implemented.  These audits are carried out at least every three years by at least one person knowledgeable in the process.  Corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and timely manner.\n\n&#8195;\n\n\n\n    3.2.9  Incident Investigation\n\n\n\nEDCC promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the root cause of the incident, as well as any corrective actions needed to prevent the release from recurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of five years.\n\n\n\n    3.2.10  Employee Participation\n\n\n\nEDCC believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP Rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses.  \n\n\n\n    3.2.11  Hot Work Permits\n\n\n\n    EDCC has in place a standard hot work procedure which establishes a system to ensure adequate controls are maintained to detect and eliminate hazardous conditions associated with fire or \"hot work\".  The system dictates the coordination of hot work, pre-permit preparations, fire watch requirements, air monitoring, personnel protection equipment, special precautions, and other department responsibilities.\n\n\n\n    3.2.12  Contractors\n\n\n\n    On occasion, EDCC hires contractors to conduct spe"

The facility has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related to their work and the processes.  A Daily/Shift Safe Work Permit is issued prior to beginning work.  Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response, should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\n\n\n\n3.3  Chemical Specific Release Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nEDCC has instituted the following measures to prevent accidental releases from the following regulated substances used or produced at the facility:\n\n\n\n3.3.1  Nitric Acid and Ammonia\n\n\n\nSeveral process controls are in place to prevent and/or mitigate accidental releases of nitric acid or ammonia.  These controls include vents, relief valves, check valves, manual and automatic shut-offs, interlocks, alarms, keyed bypass system, emergency back-up power, back-up pumps, rupture disks, excess flow devices, and quench systems.  Passive mitigation includes earthen dikes that route spills to neutralization and the wastewater treatment system, a deluge system, water curtains, and enclosures.  pH probes and alarms are located throughout the plant's storm water system to alert staff of accidental spills or releases.\n\n\n\n\n\n    3.3.2  Oleum\n\n\n\n    Process controls are in place to prevent and/or mitigate accidental release of oleum to the environment.  The tank is installed with a vacuum breaker, sumps that pump lost solution back to the process and a scrubber with an induced draft blower to collect all vents and remove any vaporized sulfur trioxide by dissolving it in water to form sulfuric acid.  The sulfuric acid is returned to the process.  A concrete dike surrounds the tank and is sufficient to contain the entire release of vessel contents.\n\n\n\n3.4  Five-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThe following is a brief summary of significant accidental c"

The explosion did not result in a chemical release.  On-site impacts included total destruction of the DSN Plant as well as structural damage to surrounding processes.  Off-site impacts included minor structural damage to residences and businesses.  No deaths or injuries resulted from the incident.  Procedures following the explosion were executed in accordance with the emergency response plan. The local Office of Emergency Services, as well as, emergency medical assistance, local fire departments, and the county police department were notified for assistance.  \n\n\n\nThe DSN Plant has been replaced with a new Nitric Acid Concentration (NACSAC&reg;) Plant. The NACSAC&reg; Plant will concentrate weak nitric acid (56% - 65% strength) to strong nitric acid (greater than 98% strength) by extracting water from the weak nitric acid with sulfuric acid.  Since the previously used strong acid process, which required the addition of oxygen, will not be reintroduced, the potential for this explosion scenario to be repeated is eliminated.\n\n\n\n    3.4.2  Ammonia\n\n\n\n    During the past five years, EDCC has not had an accidental ammonia release, resulting in on-site or off-site site consequences, including deaths, injuries, significant property damage, environmental damage, off-site evacuation, or sheltering in place.\n\n    \n\n    3.4.3  Oleum\n\n\n\n    During the past five years, EDCC has not had an accidental oleum release resulting in on-site or off-site consequences, including deaths, injuries, significant property damage, environmental damage, off-site evacuation, or sheltering in place.\n\n \n\n\n\n3.5  Emergency Response Programs\n\n\n\nEDCC maintains an Emergency Response Plan, which is based on a similar format to the EPA's Integrated Contingency Plan (ICP), consolidating all of the various"

The program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting the workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  The Plan includes the following components:\n\n\n\n?    Procedures for informing the public and emergency responders of accidental releases,\n\n?    Documentation of proper first aid/emergency medical treatment that may be necessary to treat exposure,\n\n?    Emergency response procedures,\n\n?    Procedures for using, inspecting, testing, and maintaining response equipment,\n\n?    Employee training; and,\n\n?    Response plan review and update procedures.\n\n\n\nCoordination of the Plan with the Union County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) is an integral part of the verification process.  \n\n\n\n3.6  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nEDCC is actively promoting public awareness and education programs concerning emergency response through the Union County Local Emergency Planning Committee and Community Advisory Panel.  This education process enhances the public's ability to respond in a given emergency situation.  EDCC continually strives to improve and upgrade operating procedures, replace or maintain equipment, and develop and implement safety improvement projects.  A list of proposed future improvements is as follows:\n\n\n\n?    Continue the partnership and education process with local fire departments to ensure fire department personnel are knowledgeable of site specific processes, materials and products and, as necessary, assist them in updating a site specific fire plan; and,  \n\n?    Provide continued EMT training to employees and on-site confined space rescue team; and\n\n\n\nEDCC realizes the improvements listed above are necessary for improving safety and emergency response capabilities.\n\n\n\n"
