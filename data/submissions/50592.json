      "SummaryText": "Heartland Corn Products operates as a fuel ethanol production plant located in near Winthrop, in Sibley County, Minnesota.  As a requirement of the Clean Air Act Amendments 112(r) Accidental Release of Hazardous Air Substances program, Heartland Corn Products completed a risk management plan (RMP) for any chemical stored on-site that will be above the reporting threshold of 10,000 pounds for pentane, isopentane, and anhydrous ammonia.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nHeartland Corn Products is committed to the protection of its employees, the greater community and the environment from hazardous substances used in the ethanol fuel production process, specifically anhydrous ammonia as a toxic and pentane and isopentane as flammables.  Pentane and isopentane are constituents of the natural gasoline used as the ethanol denaturant.  The ammonia is used for pH control directly in the process feed mixture to fermentation.  The denaturant is added to the ethanol to make the ethanol unfit for human consumption.  It is the policy of Heartland Corn Products to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  In the event of an emergency, including an accidental release of toxics and flammables, it is the policy of Heartland Corn Products to notify the Winthrop City Fire Department and Sibley County Sheriff Department and evacuate all employees at the facility.  \n\nRegulated Substances Handled\nThe facility produces fuel grade ethanol from corn and a fermentation process co-product known as wet distillers' grain.  The wet distillers' grain is either mixed with syrup and sold as wet distillers' grain with solubles or dried and sold as dried distillers' grain with solubles, both of which are used as a livestock feed.  Anhydrous ammonia is stored on-site and used in the ethanol production process for pH control.  The maximum anhydrous ammonia stored will be approximately 190,000 pounds.  The anhydrous ammonia is stored in two separate locatio"

      "SummaryText": "ns with approximately 171,000 pounds in one location and approximately 17,000 pounds at the other location.  The fuel ethanol production process requires use of a denaturant (natural gasoline) which may contain approximately 45 percent pentane and 35 percent isopentane, both RMP regulated substances.  The maximum amount of denaturant on-site is estimated to be approximately 890,000 pounds (total pentane approximately 400,500 pounds and total isopentane approximately 311,500 pounds).  The natural gasoline is stored in an above ground tank as a liquid and is introduced to the fuel ethanol in the final stage of production.  The natural gasoline is stored in two separate locations with approximately 570,000 pounds in one location and approximately 320,000 pounds at the other location.  Denaturant tanks are located in tank farm containment dikes.  Unleaded fuel may also be used as a denaturant in place of natural gasoline and does not contain any regulated constituents above the threshold quantity.  Heartland Corn Products has evaluated the worst-case and alternative case scenarios as it related to the reportable substances.  Where the anhydrous ammonia and denaturant are stored seperately, off-site consequence analyses were completed for each location; however only the worst case results were presented.  Emergency response program for these scenarios has been prepared and implemented. Heartland Corn Products has coordinated emergency response with the local authorities and will conduct periodic drills.  \n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\nThrough the completion of this RMP, Heartland Corn Products has complied with the EPA requirements under 40 CFR Part 68 and OSHA Process Safety Management requirements under 29 CFR 1910.120.  Process safety information and operations/maintenance procedures are documented on-site.  Periodic functions such as process hazard analysis, training, change management and incident investigation are conducted on a regular basis.  Aud"

This facility began operations in April of 1995."
