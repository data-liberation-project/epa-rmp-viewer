Additionally, this new regulation, 40 CFR Part 68 Chemical Accident Prevention Program, Risk Management Plan, will further enhance Paterson West's commitment to risk management.\n\nFacility and Regulated Substances Handled:  Patterson West, Goodyear Facility, consists of one operation involving highly hazardous materials.  The operation is a sodium hypochlorite manufacturing (bleach) process.  Chlorine is received at the facility via 90 ton railcars.  There is typically two railcars on site for a maximum total of 360,000 pounds.  The facility manufactures sodium hypochlorite (bleach) utilizing chlorine as a reactant.  \n\nThe Worst-Case Release Scenario and the Alternate Release Scenario:  Because chlorine is received at the facility via 90 ton railcars, complying with Department of Transportation regulations, the worst-case scenario for the facility would be the release of the contents of 1 railcar.  This scenario was chosen based on the requirements contained in 40 CFR Part 68.  However, in contrast to the required worst-case release scenario, Patterson West chose the failure of a 1 inch flexible transfer line for the alternate release scenario for both products.  Through actuated valves located on both the railcar and the process side of the flexible transfer line and a detector located at the railcars interlocked with the actuated valves, it was estimated that the flow of chlorine could be stopped within 90 minutes.  Modelling for both scenarios was completed utilizing RMP*Comp, Version 1.06, as provided by EPA.  Modelling for the worst-case release scenario demostrated potential off-site impacts to r"

The accident took place on August 9, 1995 and resulted in the hospitalization of one person and a release of chlorine estimated at 2500 pounds.  \n\nThe Emergency Response Program:  Patterson West, Goodyear Facility, has a written emergency response plan prepared pursuant to 29 CFR 1910.38.  \n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:  Patterson West strives to mprove safety by implementation of the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard (including compliance audits every three years and process hazards analysis revalidation every five years)."
