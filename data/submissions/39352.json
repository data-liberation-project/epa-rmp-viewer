The RMP summarizes the management, administrative, procedural, and technological controls that work together to minimize the risk to the community of hazardous chemical releases. The Risk Management Plan is organized to correspond with specific U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) RMP definitions and requirements, including:\n\u00b7 Pleasant Prairie's policies to protect health, environment, and safety;\n\u00b7 Facility identification and regulated substances covered processes;\n\u00b7 Hazard Assessment;\n\u00b7 Prevention Program;\n\u00b7 Five-Year Accident History;\n\u00b7 Emergency Response Plan; and\n\u00b7 Planned changes to improve safety.\n\nPLEASANT PRAIRIE POLICIES TO PROTECT HEALTH, ENVIRONMENT, AND SAFETY\nRisk management and safety are important concerns at Pleasant Prairie; this RMP formalizes and documents these activities. Pleasant Prairie is committed to conducting its operations in a safe and responsible manner and to reducing risks to human health and to the environment.\n\nFACILITY IDENTIFICATION\nThe Rust-Oleum Corporation owns and operates a paint manufacturing plant in Pleasant Prairie, Wisconsin. LP gas (propane/butane mixture) is used at the facility as a propellant for aerosol paints. LP gas is a regulated flammable RMP substance with a threshold quantity for accidental release prevention of 10,000 pounds.  The amount of LP gas  present in the system is approximately 93,000 pounds.   \n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT - WORST CASE SCENARIOS (WCS)\nThe WCS was determined used EPA's OCA Guidance document.\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT - ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS (ARS)\nThe ARS was determined used EPA's OCA Guidance document.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\nA prevention program is in place to minimize the risk of hazardous chemical releases in accordance with the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29 CFR 1910.119) and the EPA"

There are also no reported incidents of off-site consequences from an accidental release of LP gas.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\nPleasant Prairie has an emergency response plan to ensure that in the event of an emergency the personnel are aware of the appropriate actions to take and authorities to contact in order to mitigate the effects of a release.  Response activities are coordinated with the Pleasant Prairie Fire Department.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nChemical safety is an important part of the Pleasant Prairie operations. Continuous improvement in safety is an important goal.  The Pleasant Prairie facility has begun the initial stages of acquiring an explosion suppression system for one of two gas houses of the aerosol propellant filling operation. The other gas house already has such a system."
