Its accidental release policy is an integrated approach, involving employee participation, management practices, written procedures, and training. MEP has developed a comprehensive Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) accident prevention program considering all aspects of process operation and maintenance. The accident prevention program includes compliance with ongoing mechanical integrity inspections, which includes the API RP 510 Pressure Vessel Inspection Program and API RP 570 Piping Inspection Program.  In addition, the facility conducts 3 year PSM Compliance Audits.  If an emergency were to occur, it is MEP's policy to notify the City of Vancouver Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency. The Vancouver Terminal also maintains incipient stage firefighting equipment on site. Additionally, the facility has been equipped with fire suppression cannon nozzles along the facility perimeter. This facility complies with NFPA-58 requirements for LP-Gas storage, and it is MEP's policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws. The facility came online new in 2011 and is annually inspected for compliance by the City of Vancouver. \n\nA description of the West Vancouver Terminal facility and the regulated substances handled: \n\nThis facility is a bulk terminal storing LPG for resale to retail butane and propane dealers. The facility consists of two 80,000-gallon tanks holding approximately 290,000 pounds each of liquid propane and one 75,000 gallon tank holding approximately 330,000 lbs of liquid butane. There is also the capacity for sixteen 33,000-gallon rail cars onsite and capacity for another six 33,000-gallon rail cars adjacent to the facility on leased property. There are both manual and automatic emergency shutdown systems on all"

The LPG system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with NFPA-58 and state law.\n\nFive-year accident history:\n\nThe terminal facility began operations in February 2011. There has not been an accident involving LPG that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or any shelter in-place. \n\nThe emergency response program:\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving the Vancouver Terminal's LPG system, it is MEP's policy to notify the City of Vancouver Fire Department and request help in responding to the emergency. MEP also has trained employees in incipient stage firefighting. The Vancouver Terminal has coordinated the facility's response plans with the fire department; members of the fire department have been provided the opportunity to visit the Vancouver Terminal facility and inspect the LPG storage system.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety:\n\nMidstream Energy Partners will continually strive for safety improvement. Periodic process safety inspections and Process Hazard Analyses will be conducted followed with timely response."
