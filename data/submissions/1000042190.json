Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nArizona / Pima Chemical  (also \"APC\") stores and repackages chlorine, which is considered a hazardous material that is a regulated substance and is considered in this Risk Management Plan (RMP).  The properties of chlorine make it necessary to observe safety precautions in handling chlorine to prevent human exposure, and to reduce the threat to the facility's workers and nearby members of the community.  It is the facility's policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the safe procedures used to handle chlorine; the safety devices and systems designed and constructed into the facility; and the training of pertinent personnel.  APC has posted Emergency Response Procedures at the site and in the office, which includes procedures for reporting any hazardous chemical accident or release and the emergency contact telephone numbers.  APC has also posted its Emergency Medical and First Aid Response Procedures, which is a quick reference for employees and office personnel on what to do if a person is exposed to chlorine gas, as well as its Emergency Escape Mask  Procedures, which details how to use the emergency escape mask in the event of an accidental  release.  All APC service vehicles contain Emergency Response Documents, which is a quick reference for employees on what to do in various potential emergency and/or release situations.  APC also has an emergency action plan contained in section N of the OSHA PSM. \n\n\n\nAPC's Emergency Action Plan is contained within its PSM.  Employees will respond only to incidental releases and emergency responders will be called for emergencies.  When filling cylinders with chlorine, employees don safety goggles, gloves and have available escape masks.  Employees test the System using ammonia for leak detection prior to filling the system with chlorine from the ton container.  A verbal notification system is in place t"

Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nAPC provides chlorination service to swimming pools.  Chlorine is repackaged at the facility from one-ton containers to twenty pound net capacity service cylinders.  The twenty pound cylinders are used by the facility's service staff to chlorinate customer swimming pools in accordance with the Chlorine Institute's Pamphlet 97.  The facility operates five days a week (M-F), eight hours per day, and 50 weeks per year.\n\n\n\nThe Fill Yard is used exclusively for the storage and repackaging of chlorine.  The yard area provides adequate room for the delivery and parking of chlorine delivery vehicles during the off-loading of full one-ton containers and the loading of empty one-ton containers. \n\n\n\nThe Fill Yard is not exposed to vehicular traffic.  The Fill Yard houses all of the chlorine containers and is locked after normal working hours.  Company policy does not allow unauthorized personnel entry into the building.  Signs are posted indicating a restricted area.  Container handling and storage is per applicable local, state and federal regulations. \n\n\n\nThe amount of chlorine packaged per month is seasonally dependent.  The summer months, for obvious reasons, are the busiest swim times of the year.  Consequently, the quantity of chlorine on site is highest during this period. APC stores a maximum of 10,400 pounds of chlorine.  This amount includes the contents of 3 one-ton containers, 120 max twenty-pound cylinders, and the (1) one-ton container in the repackaging process.   The Federal threshold of 2,500 pounds is exceeded as the maximum on site at any given time is 15,000 pounds of chlorine.\n\n\n\nChlorine is purchased from and delivered by commercial chlorine suppliers.  Delivery of one-ton containers is during normal working hours.  The one-ton containers, up "

The one-ton containers are placed on steel sheet runners in the Fill Yard.  The one-ton containers are manually rolled to the desired location and chocked to prevent movement.  Empty and full twenty pound cylinders are segregated and are chained or strapped into place in an upright position.  The company has administrative procedures in place that limit the amount of chlorine at the facility to no more than 5 one-ton containers and 250 each twenty pound cylinders for a maximum total of 15,000 pounds.  The procedure, in part, requires the owner/operator to verify existing chlorine inventory to ensure that an order and delivery of a one-ton container will not cause the aggregate quantity to exceed 15,000 pounds.\n\n\n\nChlorine is repackaged as a liquid from one-ton containers into twenty pound net-capacity, DOT approved cylinders.  Any residual chlorine in small diameter, short length piping is directed into a liquid caustic absorption scrubber.  The twenty pound cylinders are transported by company service vehicles to customer's swimming pools where the service personnel dispense the chlorine as a gas into the pool.  The twenty pound cylinders are owned by the company and maintenance is performed in accordance with the Chlorine Institutes Pamphlet 17- Cylinder and Ton Container Procedure for Chlorine Packaging, and the maintenance procedures in the PSM.  \n\n\n\nThe receipt, storage, and repackaging of chlorine is considered a single process.  The major components of the chlorine system are:  the one-ton DOT approved cylinders, the proprietary transfer piping assembly, the twenty pound capacity DOT approved cylinders, the pan scale for weighing the cylinders during the filling operation, and the chlorine absorption system.\n\n\n\nA proprietary tube assembly is attached to the lower (liq"

Filling commences by opening the one-ton container liquid valve, the cylinder valve, and various other proprietary and confidential steps in the transfer assembly.  After filling, which is indicated by weight on the pan scale reaching the desired value, the cylinder valve is closed, the ton supply of chlorine is closed, and the transfer tubing is evacuated into the chlorine absorption system prior to disconnecting the full service cylinder.  The caustic solution comprising the absorption medium is prevented from being sucked back into the system using the unique design of the proprietary and confidential chlorine packaging system.\n\n\n\nThe packaging system is operated under pressure from the chlorine container.  Only a small amount of residual chlorine remains in the lines after fill to be routed to the caustic scrubber.  Operational and test procedures are in place which ensure that the scrubber system is operating correctly.  Chlorine is not vented to the atmosphere.  Full twenty pound cylinders are stored in the packaging area until loaded onto delivery trucks.  Transport and loading of the cylinders adheres to DOT and other regulations.\n\n\n\nFilling is done by trained, qualified personnel.  Written filling procedures exist and are followed.  The entire system is evacuated and the one-ton container liquid valve is shut during non-working hours.  Filling personnel have available escape masks.  The following emergency equipment is available at the fill yard:  an emergency drench shower/eyewash unit; safety goggles; safety gloves; ammonia to detect leaks; fire extinguisher; first aid kit; valve protectors on the stored  ton containers; valve protectors and caps on the smaller service cylinders.\n\n\n\n3a.

APC also has a maintenance program for equipment, including pH testing of caustic in the absorption scrubber, and rebuilding the valves on the fill system. Equipment is continuously inspected for maintenance and upkeep.  The specific safe work processing place at APC's facility are detailed in the PSM.  \n\n\n\n5.  Five Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of chlorine in the last five years.\n\n\n\n6.  Emergency Response Plan\n\n\n\nThe emergency response program is based upon alerting personnel at the facility to evacutate the facility and await the arrival of local emergency responders at the evacuation assembly location if a release occurs that causes the evacuation to be initiated.  APC's Emergency Response Plan is posted at the fill yard and in the office as a quick reference for how to handle an emergency, and has also been filed with the US EPA.  APC is not included in the Tuscon written community emergency response plan.\n\n\n\n7.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nAPC's Process Hazard Analysis element of the Process Safety Management (PSM) is reviewed every 5 years, as required, The process has not changed since April 2003.   Current applicable codes and regulations are reviewed as part of the PSM to determine if other commitments need to be made to achieve increased operational safety for the regulated chlorine process system."
