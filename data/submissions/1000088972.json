Chlorine is located at ten (10) separate locations.\n\nThe Utility Process Area also utilizes cyclohexylamine at 50% concentration as a water treatment chemical for the boiler feed water system. This material is located in 3 different bulk tanks on site. \n\nCurrently this new material is in one location and under the Threshold Quantity, we anticipated changing the bulk tank volumes and utilizing this material throughout the site in 2016 at which point, the onsite amount, would exceed the threshold quantity.\n\n",

The Feed Preparation Section consists of purification towers to purify and concentrate isobutane prior to charging the Peroxidation Section for an oxidation reaction.   The Epoxidation Section manufactures propylene oxide.  The Tertiary Butyl Alcohol (TBS) section reclaims and purifies tertiary butyl alcohol for reuse; the Propylene Oxide Section does the same for propylene oxide.  The Formate Destruction section converts the formates generated in the F5 Process prior to sending the feed material to the MTBE section.  The MTBE section manufactures and purifies MTBE. The risk management program elements apply to the F5 unit. The flammable mixture noted below includes inventories of non-RMP flammable chemicals and RMP flammable chemicals. This process unit has associated diked storage tanks.",

The Site utilizes the HAZOP methodology, a recognized and generally accepted method, for identifying and evaluating hazards in the process.  The Site assigns employees to the HAZOP team who are knowledgeable in the HAZOP methodology and the specific process.  The HAZOP team develops recommendations to reduce the potential hazards which, if approved, are implemented within a reasonable period of time.  Hurricanes and inclement weather are not investigated in the PHAs; however, Indorama does have a Hurricane Procedure and implements this procedure under the threat of a hurricane and inclement weather.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nIndorama PNO maintains written operating procedures that are developed in consultation with operators to provide clear instructions for safely conducting activities associated with a covered process.  The procedures address steps for all operating phases, safety systems, control measures and precautions to prevent exposures to process hazards.  The procedures are reviewed and revised periodically to ensure their accuracy and completeness.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\nIndorama PNO provides initial training as well as refresher training to employees to assure that the required level of skills and knowledge a"

A team comprised of employees from the Corporate PSM department and other Indorama facilities, with appropriate knowledge of audit techniques and process safety experience, conduct audits every three years to verify that the procedures and practices developed are adequate and being followed.  The findings of the audit team are reviewed and appropriate corrective actions are implemented and tracked until resolved.  \n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nIndorama PNO investigates any incidents that resulted in, or could reasonably have resulted in, a catastrophic release of covered chemicals.  The investigation is promptly conducted, commencing within 48 hours of any incident.  To perform the investigation, the site has established a procedure to appoint an incident investigation team consisting of persons with the appropriate knowledge and experience to thoroughly investigate and analyze the incident.  A report is prepared at the conclusion of the incident investigation that addresses the incident, the factors that contributed to it, and recommendations resulting from the incident investigation.  The site has established a system to promptly address, document and resolve the incident report findings and recommendations.  Finally, incident reports are reviewed with the affected personnel.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nIndorama PNO has developed a written action plan for employee participation in all aspects of its Process Safety Management and Risk Management Programs.  The site employees are involved in the PHA reviews, Operating Procedures, Incident Investigations, work permits and many other PSM programs.

All operators receive periodic refresher training.  \n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity (MI)\n\nIndorama PNO has developed a Risk Based Mechanical Integrity (RBMI) program for maintaining the fixed components of the process (including pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems).  The site has also developed Mechanical Integrity Procedures (MIP) for the emergency shutdown system controls.  The rotating equipment and non-safety system Instrumentation also have a developed mechanical integrity and maintenance strategy program.  The programs are comprised of well-trained personnel who follow maintenance, testing and inspection procedures that ensure proper function of process equipment.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change (MOC)\n\nIndorama PNO has established and implemented written procedures and an electronic system to manage changes to process chemicals, technology, equipment, procedures, and any changes to the facility that affect a covered process.  The procedures assure that, prior to any change, the following issues are considered:  the technical basis for the proposed change, its impact on safety and health, any modifications to operating procedures, the necessary time period for the change, and any authorization requirements.  Employees involved in operating a process, as well as maintenance and contract employees whose job will be affected, are informed of and trained in the change.  If necessary, the process safety information and operating procedures are updated as a part of the management of change process.\n\n\n\nPre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR)\n\nIndorama PNO performs pre-startup safety reviews when an addition or a modification to the facility is made and the MOC evaluation designates a PSSR is required.

If any hot work is performed near a covered process, the site issues a permit that documents the fire prevention and protection requirements for the operation, the date authorized for hot work, and the object on which the work is performed.  Hot work permits are kept on file until the work is complete.\n\n\n\nContractors\n\nIndorama PNO has developed procedures for selecting and ensuring that contractors are competent and knowledgeable and can safely perform their work.  The site provides information to contractors about the hazards that may be present in the work area and have developed appropriate safe work practices.  The site also evaluates the safety performance and programs of the contractors as a part of their continued employment.\n\n\n\n4.  5 Year Accident History.  The PNO Site has had no reportable RMP incidents in the last five years.  \n\n\n\n5.  Emergency Response Program.  Indorama has a written emergency response program that contains procedures to be followed in the case of an accidental release of a regulated substance.  These procedures include steps for informing the public, proper first aid and medical treatment, the proper use of emergency equipment and emergency response training for emergency response employees who perform emergency response duties and to local emergency responders who may be called to assist in emergency response.

There are several planned improvements at the PNO Site to reduce the on and offsite impacts of hazardous processes.  Selected ongoing projects include improvements to install and in some cases upgrade the Safety Instrumented Systems (SIS) as well as upgrade the process control and instrumentation equipment in many of the units.  There is continual commitment to implement changes, when identified, that will improve the safety of employees and neighbors of the PNO Site as well as projects that enhance safety, environmental protection and protect neighbors from exposure to accidental releases.\n\n\n\n7.  Reason for 2020 Re-submittal is due to increasing the amount of already listed chemicals on site.  Some of the flammable raw materials that are used on site were stored at the TPC facility.  After TPC had an unfortunate event, it required the onsite storage of those materials at the Indorama facility to increase.  This increase is not through more or larger storage tanks but instead more rail cars and tank wagons, thus the existing Worst Case and Alternative case scenarios have not changed.   The site will also start using a new waste water treatment chemical that contains a listed RMP chemical, it is the same one that is already being reported.  Again, it is an increase in the amount held on site due to the increase in wt% of that material.  These are the reasons for the re-submittal.  "
