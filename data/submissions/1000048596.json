In a post submittal review, it was noted that the quantity of ammonia on-site was not updated from 97,500 lbs to 130,000 lbs. This update in quantity does not impact the Worst Case Scenario as documented in the plan. This correction updates the amount of ammonia on-site to 130,000 lbs and was submitted on later in the day on 2/27/2015. This correction also clarifies ammonia tank operation in the Executive Summary. \n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response\n\n\n\nAt Rohm and Haas Texas Incorporated, we are committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes (especially those using hazardous substances) in a safe and responsible manner.  We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment.  The company/corporate policies are embodied in the numerous EHS and Engineering standards which apply globally.  At Rohm and Haas Texas, these policies are implemented through the site and global EH&S programs. \n\n\n\nThis document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n\n\n- A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulation\n\n- Notes relating to our assessment of the potential offsite consequences from accidental chemical releases\n\n- An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\n\n- A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule\n\n- An overview of our emergency response program\n\n- An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and advers"

In our processes, we use the following chemicals that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release:\n\n\n\nToxic Chemicals:\n\n\n\nAmmonia\n\nAmmonia is received by pipeline and stored as a pressurized liquid in a horizontal tank.  The quantity is limited by capacity by automatic and manual systems to 40% of the tank's capacity; this is the inventory reported in the Section 1.17.   Ammonia is reacted with natural gas and air in the presence of a platinum gauze to produce HCN.  It is also used in various neutralization processes around the plant.\n\n\n\nHydrogen Cyanide\n\nHCN is produced by the catalytic reaction of ammonia, natural gas and air over a platinum gauze.  It is stored as a refrigerated liquid in two separate, non-connected, widely-separated stainless steel tanks. One tank belongs to the N3 process and one to the N5 process. Since these tanks are in separate, discrete processes, they are listed as two different processes in the plan. The release scenarios are identical as well as management systems which cover both Acetone Cyanohydrin N3 and Acetone Cyanohydrin N5. Normal inventory is limited to 60% of each tank's capacity. This was the inventory reported in the Section 1.17. The HCN is used as an intermediate in the production of methacrylic acid and its esters, methyl methacrylate and butyl methacrylate.  \n\n\n\nChlorine\n\nChlorine is used in our Battleground Water facility to sanitize process water.  The chlorine is stored and used in one ton cylinders. Only two cylinders at a time are valved into the proces"

There are two long, interconnected pipelines from the metering station to the process units.  The total quantity reported in Section 1.17 is the volume contained in both pipelines and in the vaporizers.  Propylene is used to produce acrylic acid via partial oxidation in the presence of a catalyst.\n\n\n\n\n\nOur accidental release prevention programs and our contingency planning efforts help us effectively manage the hazards that are posed to our employees, the public, and the environment by our use of these chemicals.\n\n\n\nKey Offsite Consequence Analysis Scenarios\n\n\n\nEPA's RMP rule requires that we provide information about the worst-case release\n\nscenario(s) and alternative release scenario(s) for our facility.  The following notes about these scenarios include information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the exposure distances for each scenario:\n\n\n\nWorst-case Release Scenario(s) - Regulated Toxic Chemicals:\n\n\n\nAmmonia\n\nThe inventory of the tank is limited to 40% of capacity by automatic level controls and the operating procedures.  The worst case for ammonia is the release of the entire tank inventory in 10 minutes.  This will result in a liquid spill and vaporization and will produce a cloud that does have offsite residential impact. This scenario is unlikely because the tank has 1.5\" thick steel walls, is made of stress relieved carbon steel, and is inspected periodically.\n\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenario(s) - Regulated Toxic Chemicals:\n\n\n\nAmmonia\n\nThere are two alternate case scenarios for the site. The first alternate ammonia scenario is a 1.5\" hole in the line.  This will produce a cloud that will not impact public receptors other than neighboring industrial plants and Tidal road.  For the alternative scenario, the Rohm and Haas emergency response system will allow mitigation to begin within 10 mi"

Fire monitors are available for water curtain in most areas of the plant. The second alternate scenario results from a 2\" line break of an over head pipeline containing vaporized ammonia running from the ammonia tank to a boiler in which the ammonia is combusted. The Rohm and Haas emergency response system will allow mitigation to begin within 30 minutes. This will produce a cloud that will not impact public receptors other than neighboring industrial plants and Tidal road.\n\n\n\nHydrogen Cyanide\n\nThe Alternative case for HCN is a 0.5\" hole in a line which will leak into a diked area.  This will produce a cloud that will not impact public receptors other than neighboring industrial plants and Tidal road.  For the alternative scenario, the Rohm and Haas emergency response system will allow mitigation to begin within 20 minutes.  There are HCN detectors in strategic locations throughout the plant and remote manual valves available to isolate the release.  Fire monitors are available for water curtain in most areas of the plant.\n\n\n\nChlorine\n\nThe Alternative case for chlorine is a 5/8\" line leak.  This will produce a cloud that will not impact public receptors other than a neighboring industrial plant. There are automatic shut-off valves which will isolate the cylinders from the feed piping to isolate the release. There are also chlorine detectors in strategic locations.\n\n\n\nWorst-case Release Scenario(s) - Regulated Flammable Chemicals:\n\n\n\nPropylene\n\nThe Worst case release scenario for propylene is a rupture of the pipeline that would release the entire inventory of propylene in 10 minutes, which then ignites.  A vapor cloud explosion would result in an overpressure that would affect Tidal road.  Depending on the location of the pipeline rupture, off-site effects could occur and affect industrial neighbors.  B"

The pipeline is equipped with remotely-operated isolation valves which will shut on low pipeline pressure which will occur upon line rupture or significant leaks.  The quantity reported in the alternative scenario assumes the valves will shut and the volume contained in the longest section of the pipeline between the isolation valves will be released. Depending on the location of the leak along the pipeline, this scenario results in overpressure that could  affect a portion of Tidal road and could affect one industrial neighbor.  Because this area is unconfined, a vapor cloud fire was chosen for the scenario.   \n\n\n\n\n\nWe are using this information to help us ensure that our emergency response plan and the community emergency response plan address all reasonable contingency cases.

They also help us target the most important equipment for more frequent inspection.  \n\n\n\n- Operating procedures - Operating procedures include windows for safe operations and guides for trouble shooting which allow operators to keep the processes out of unsafe areas.  Operators are involved in writing, reviewing, and updating operating procedures.\n\n\n\n- Training - Training is based on the operating instructions.  Operators help determine the frequency of refresher training.\n\n\n\n- Mechanical integrity - We have a comprehensive inspection and preventive maintenance system that ensures that equipment maintains its capability to contain the process chemicals.  This system is being continuously improved.\n\n\n\n- Management of change - As an industry pioneer in the management of change, we have a comprehensive, well-institutionalized MOC system.  Employees at all levels are involved in the operation of the MOC system.\n\n\n\n- Pre-startup review - The Pre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR) is integral to ensuring that any new or modified process is built as intended.  It is the completion of hazard analysis to ensure that the analyses conducted are, indeed applicable to the process as built.  PSSRs are part of the institutionalized MOC and PHA systems.\n\n\n\n- Compliance audits - Several types of compliance and management system audits are performed.  RMP/PSM self-audits are performed every three years. Actions needed are entered into a computer-based action tracking system that automatically tells those responsible if completion of action items is taking longer than anticipated, so that remedial steps may be taken. In addition, annual self-assessments are performed on different elements of process safety.\n\n\n\n- Incident investigation - We also pioneered process safety incident investigations u"

We continue to investigate process incidents using this technique and other root cause analysis tools so that we can gain all the information from each incident that we can to determine the root cause(s), in order to prevent future incidents and to add to the body of information about each process.\n\n\n\n- Employee participation - Employees participate in all aspects of the prevention program.  Operators are included in Process Hazard analysis as well as help write operating instructions and perform much of the training for new employees.  Operators and maintenance personell are expected to particpate in MOC reviews.\n\n\n\n- Hot work permit - We have had a very effective Hot Work permit, and safe work permit, system.  \n\n\n\n- Contractors - Contractors are picked according to stringent standards of management, competence, and safety.  Contractors are expected to adhere to the same standards of safety that our own employees do.  A monthly management meeting is held to review all contractors' EHS performance. \n\n\n\nAs part of our prevention efforts, we have implemented the following chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\n\n\nAmmonia:  Most of the ammonia piping is all-welded carbon steel from the metering station to the unit. There are two tanks capable of storing ammonia, but only one is in service at any time. The tanks are made from carbon steel and are stress-relieved.  There are excess-flow check valves in the tank outlets and in the line from the tank to the north end of the plant.  These valves will slam shut on major flow increases which would occur upon line rupture or significant leaks.\n\n\n\nHydrogen Cyanide: Where flanges are required, we use 300# flanges and spiral-wound gaskets for maximum integrity.  Pumps for 100% HCN are canned motor pumps which have no seals, and leaks are highly unlikely.  HCN detectors are mounted at strategic locations throughout the unit"

There are evacuation procedures at each HCN unit which are tested and drilled.\n\n\n\nChlorine:  The chlorine system feed piping uses a vacuum delivery system.  Leaks in the vacuum section of the delivery piping will automatically isolate the feed cylinders.  Chlorine detectors are installed in the area surrounding the chlorine system.   \n\n\n\nPropylene:  The propylene lines are welded carbon steel; one is buried, the other is above ground.  The buried pipe is coated and wrapped and is cathodically protected.   The propylene piping is designed for high pressure and normally operates at less than 20% of the design pressure.  The extra capability gives us an inherently safer means of being prepared for pressure surges, but there are also relief valves in the system to prevent damage to the pipelines.  There are remotely-operated isolation valves in the line to allow isolation of a segment in the event of a  leak.  These valves will shut automatically if a line rupture or significant leaks occurs.  There are vehicle barricades to protect above-ground parts of the line.  There is no tank, so the only inventory is in the lines themselves.  The metering area and the vaporizer system are equipped with propylene detectors.\n\n\n\nNote:  All lines and vessels have inspection programs tailored to the hazards.\n\n\n\nThese individual elements of our prevention program work together to prevent accidental chemical releases.  Our company and our employees are committed to the standard that these management systems set for the way we do business, and we have specific accountabilities and controls to ensure that we are meeting our own high standards for accident prevention.\n\n\n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nWe keep records for all significant accidental chemical releases that occur at our facility.
