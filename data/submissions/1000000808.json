Annually, the list of chemicals warehoused in the facility will be reviewed to determine if any other chemicals fall under these requirements.\nThe maximum intended iventory of flammable liquids at the warehouse is 150,000 pounds.  The temperature in the flammable liquid storage roon is maintained at <80F with a target of <72F. There are also flammable liquids stored between -5F to 45F in temperature controlled storage. Information pertaining to the hazards of all chemicals in the process is the MSDS (Material Safety Data Sheets) kept on file in the warehouse office.\nRinchem uses electic forklifts and electric and manual pallet jacks (no propane equipment is in use.

INTRODUCTION \n\n    A.1    Purpose \n\nThe purpose of the Contingency Plan is to minimize hazards to human life and the natural environment that may arise in an emergency situation at the Rinchem Facility. The provisions of the Contingency Plan are to be carried out by facility personnel immediately when an emergency occurs.  Emergencies may include, but are not limited to fire, explosion, or release of hazardous material causing air, soil, or surface water contamination. \n\n    A.2       Types of Potential Emergencies\n\nHandling and warehousing hazardous materials obviously creates the potential for emergency situations.  Natural events such as tornadoes or flooding may also create emergency situations necessitating appropriate and effective management. In order to appropriately handle these hazardous situations, we have created the Contingency Plan.\n\nA.2.1    Emergencies Inherent to Industrial Facility Operations\n\nPotential emergencies that may result of any industrial facility operation include:    \n\n(1)    Fire\n(a)    Could cause the release of toxic fumes\n(b)    Could spread and possibly ignite materials at other locations onsite, or cause heat-induced\n(c)    Could produce contaminated runoff from controlling fire with water or chemical suppressants.\n\n(2)    Explosion\n(a)    Could cause a safety hazard from flying fragments "

For example, release of hazardous chemicals due to flooding could cause the contamination of surface and groundwater.  A tornado could cause ignition of flammable chemicals or contamination of the environment.  These situations could also cause commingling of incompatible chemicals.  \n\nB.    IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT AND DECISION PROCESS\n\nB.1    Assessment and Decision Process\n\nIn case of an imminent or actual emergency situation, the individual observing the incident will use the appropriate notification equipment (or make contact in-person) to notify RinchemA?s Emergency Coordinator, or his alternate, of the location, nature, and extent of the incident. The Emergency Coordinator will set up a command post and take control of the affected area.  He will commit any necessary resources until the emergency has been terminated, and until any warranted clean up or restoration is complete.\n\nThe Emergency Coordinator will direct the following activities:\n\n(1)    Where applicable see that operations are stopped and that any released chemicals are contained and collected\n(2)    Determine the source, extent of the spilled materials, and assess the primary and secondary hazards. The Emergency Coordinator will determine if the Contingency Plan, in its entirety or in part, should be implemented\n(3)    See that any materials spilled in the incident area are isolated from incompatible materials / chemicals and ignition sources.\n\nB.2    Implementation of the Contingency Plan    \n\nWhen a decision has been made to implement the Contingency Plan, the Emergency Coordinator wil"
