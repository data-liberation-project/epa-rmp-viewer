It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal, State, and local regulations. If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to immediately notify the Belmond Volunteer Fire Department (via a 911 call) and request that it respond to the emergency. Incidental to the notification to the fire department, a call to the Region 5 Emergency Planning District (Wright County, Iowa LEPC) will be made.\n\nWhile we have planned for an emergency, it is acknowledged that a real emergency will be unexpected and may very well be much different and cannot be ensured to duplicate what may have be planned. In reality, the situation that develops may not happen in the manner in which it has been planned. In that event, what may have been planned will serve only as a guideline to follow.\n\nThe Emergency Action Plan for this facility describes certain procedures that are intended to minimize the hazards associated with human health and the environment from fires, explosions, the sudden and unexpected release of chemicals (i.e., Anhydrous Ammonia), tornadoes, bomb threats or other accidents or acts of God which might occur on our premises.\n\nThe primary emergency coordinator for the Belmond, Iowa location is Ron Schachtner, operations  manager. His work and 24-hour emergency response telephone numbers are provided in the Registration Section of this document. In addition, the following individuals (with associated work and 24-hour emergency response telephone numbers) are to be contacted in order:\n\n                      Ron Schachtner, operations manager\n                               WORK:    (641) 444-4004\n                               24-Hour:  (641) 444-4279\n\n                      Richard Morris, grain operations\n                               WORK:     (641) 444-4004\n                           "

The anhydrous ammonia that is stored at  this facility is distributed to agricultural crop producers in the surrounding area who utilize the anhydrous ammonia for crop nutrient purposes. \n\nThe anhydrous ammonia plant is only operated on a seasonal basis (Spring and Fall). Full-time equivalent employee numbers were computed on that basis. At a maximum, the plant operates a total of three months (1/4 of the year). The FTEs for this company location is one (1).\n\nNurse tanks are filled and positioned awaiting distribution and transportation from the parking lot to the farm. The parking lot is separate from the storage tank facilities. In this instance, nurse tanks are parked in a lot that is not situated on continguous property to the bulk storage tanks. At any one point in time twenty (20) 1,500-gallon nurse tanks could be parked in this lot awaiting pickup or delivery to area crop producers. The specific address of the parking lot is described in the registration section of this document.\n\nTHE WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO:\n\nThe worst-case scenario is the failure of the one (1) 1,500-gallon nurse when filled to the greatest amount allowed (85% of capacity), resulting in the release of the total volume in a gaseous (hazardous ammonia vapor cloud) form. According to EPA's RMP*Comp Program (Version 1.06), the distance to the endpoint is 1.0 miles. \n\nThe alternative release scenario involves the rupture of the transfer hose on the nurse tank or the act of vandals opening the liquid withdrawal valve to illegally obtain anhydrous ammonia for methamphetamine production.

An evacuation plan is in place.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS:\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable State and local codes and regulations. The anhydrous ammonia system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with ANSI Standard K-61.1-1995 and State law. \n\nIn addition the company has specific operating procedures in place intended to minimize the potential for an accidental (and potentially catastrophic) release of anhydrous ammonia. Finally, Ag Max Partners, L.C.  has extended to the Belmond Volunteer Fire Department the opportunity to visit our anhydrous ammonia plant, to participate in mock emergency simulation training, and to avail themselves of specific anhydrous ammonia health hazard information and training provided by the company.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\n\nAg Max Partners, L.C., Belmond, Iowa has never had an accident involving anhydrous ammonia that caused death, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations or shelterings in place.\n\nTHE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving our anhydrous ammonia system, it is the policy of Ag Max Partners, L.C. to immediately notify the Belmond Volunteer Fire Department and the Region 5 Emergency Planning District (Wright County, Iowa LEPC) to request that they respond to the emergency. In the unlikely event that the Belmond Fire Department is unable to adequately respond to an emergency at our Belmond location, the Volunteer Fire Department with whom Belmond has a reciprocal agreement will be summoned.  We have discussed this policy with the fire department and Region 5 Emergency Planning District (Wright County LEPC). Members of t"

      "SummaryText": "he fire department and the LEPC have inspected our anhydrous ammonia plant. In addition, copies of photographs taken of our plant have been provided (for reference) to both entities.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\n\nThe plan is to minimize hazards to human health and to the environment from spills and accidental releases. A safety inspection is performed before product is moved from the storage tank to nurse tanks. By doing a short walk around inspection of the facility a person is able to detect any problems before they arise. If any part of the system showed signs of stress, or if odors were present, corrective measures would be taken to repair the system before the facility became a problem. Employees are trained and schooled so they are aware of the hazards of handling and transferring anhydrous ammonia. The safety plan also includes a safety drill, wherein employees are exposed to the safe procedures of handling and transferring anhydrous ammonia. All employees handling anhydrous ammonia are required to comply with all safety measures and rules set forth by the Ag Max Partners, L.C."
