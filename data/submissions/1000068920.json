The emergency response program includes procedures for the use of on-site emergency response equipment and for its inspection, testing and maintenance. Employees are trained periodically on emergency response procedures. \r\n\r\nH. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nIn an effort to improve safety and to reduce the risk of accidental releases, changes to the RMProgram and the facility will be implemented as identified.

Other chemicals have been reviewed on previous dates.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA) - A PHA has been performed for the Program 3 covered process at Daikin in accordance with 40 CFR Part 68.67. The PHA was performed using What-If/ Checklist and Hazard and Operability Study (HAZOP) methods. The PHA identified the potential hazards associated with the regulated substances in the covered process; causes of potential accidental release scenarios; safeguards used to prevent accidental releases; and methods used to detect, monitor or control accidental releases. Any issues identified during the PHA were documented and resolved in a timely manner. The PHA will be revalidated and updated once every five years following completion of the initial PHA.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures - Detailed and up-to-date process operating procedures have been developed and are maintained for the covered process in accordance with 40 CFR Part 68.69. Operating procedures provide clear instructions for safely conducting activities involving a covered process in a manner consistent with process safety information and are readily accessible to employees involved in a covered process. Operating procedures are reviewed annually to ensure that they remain current and accurate.\r\n\r\nOperating procedures cover each operating phase"

When completed, all affected personnel including contract employees review the report. Incident investigation reports are maintained at the facility for a minimum of five years.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation - A written employee participation plan has been implemented that provides employees with access to PHA and all other information developed under the RMP regulation in accordance with 40 CFR Part 68.83. The employee participation plan describes employee participation in conducting PHA and in implementing all other RMP elements.\r\n\r\nHot Work Permit - An authorization and permit program for hot-work operations has been prepared and implemented for hot-work conducted on or near a covered process in accordance with 40 CFR Part 68.85. The permit is used to document that fire prevention and protection standards in 29 CFR Part 1910.252(a) have been implemented prior to beginning the hot-work operations. Also, the permit lists the date(s) authorized for the hot-work and identifies the equipment to be worked on or near.\r\n\r\nContractors - A contractor safety program in accordance with 40 CFR Part 68.87 is in place for all contractors performing maintenance or repair, turnaround, major renovation, or specialty work on or adjacent to a covered process. The safety performance of each contractor is evaluated prior to selection. Each contractor employee is informed of the known potential fire, explosion, or toxic release hazards related to work on a covered process as well as the relevant provisions of the emergency response program. Procedures are in place to control the entrance, presence, and exit of contract employees in covered process areas. Periodically, the p"

      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary \r\n\r\nDaikin America, Inc. (Daikin) is a fluorocarbon manufacturing facility located in Decatur, Alabama. As a result of the manufacturing process, the following regulated chemicals are present at the facility in quantities that exceed the threshold quantities specified by EPA regulations: chloroform, hydrogen fluoride (HF), ethylene, vinyl chloride, tetrafluoroethylene (TFE), and vinylidene fluoride (VF). The facility has one covered process that requires the facility meet Program 3 requirements of the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation.\r\n\r\nDaikin operates the MDA manufacturing process and oversees safety, environmental and maintenance for MDA. In an emergency involving either Daikin or MDA, Daikin personnel will be directly involved. Therefore, Daikin is submitting the RMP for the covered process, which includes the MDA operations.\r\n\r\nHF and chloroform are delivered to the facility via railcars and are offloaded to storage tanks. In the process, HF and chloroform are used as raw materials in the production of chlorodifluoromethane (R-22) at MDA. \r\n\r\nTFE is produced from R-22 at Daikin. TFE is stored in storage tanks and is used as a raw material for other Daikin products. It is transported via pipeline to MDA to manufacture hexafluoropropylene (HFP) and is also transported via pipeline to a nearby 3M facility.\r\n\r\nEthylene is stored on site in a tank. Ethylene is a raw material used in the production of ethylene tetrafluoroethylene at Daikin. \r\n\r\nVinylidene fluoride is stored onsite in multi-tube trailers, each containing 23,000 lbs of product.\r\n\r\nVinyl chloride is delivered to the site via rail. Vinyl chloride is a raw material used to produce fluoropolymer solutions.\r\n\r\nB. Accidental Release Prevention & Emergency Response Policies of Daikin\r\n\r\nDaikin is committed to protecting facility personnel, the public and the environment from any workplace and accidental release hazards. Appropriate responses to releases of regulated chemicals are"

Safety, environmental protection and risk management programs are fully implemented and coordinated with community emergency responders for emergency planning and response efforts.\r\n\r\nC. Release Scenario Discussion\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the requirements of the EPA RMP regulations each owner or operator of a stationary source is required to perform the following offsite consequence analyses. Daikin has performed this analysis as required. The summary of this analysis is not required to be included with the executive summary.\r\n\r\nD. Five-year Accident History\r\n\r\nUnder the EPA RMP regulations, an accidental release is defined as a release of a regulated substance that resulted in deaths, injuries or significant property damage on-site, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage. \r\n\r\nDaikin has not had any accidents within the past five years that resulted in deaths, injuries or significant property damage on-site, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\r\n\r\nE. Management Program\r\n\r\nDaikin has a management program in place that assigns overall responsibility for the development and implementation of the Risk Management Program (RMProgram) to a qualified individual or position of responsibility. It clearly delineates accountability and responsibilities for any elements where responsibilities are delegated.\r\n\r\nF. Prevention Program Elements\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information - Up-to-date process safety information is maintained for use by employees operating the covered process in accordance with 40 CFR Part 68.65, including the following:\r\n\r\n\u00bf\tSDSs for chloroform, HF, ethylene, vinyl chloride, vinylidene fluoride, and TFE that contain toxicity information, permissible exposure limits, physical data, reactivity data, thermal and chemical stability data and synergistic effects from mixing process fl"
