(the facility) are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release would occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local police and fire departmets (and/or other authorities), to mitigate any releases and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.  FACILITY INFORMATION\n     The primary activity at the facility is the storage and distribution of anhydrous ammonia for direct application as a crop production nutrient.\n     The maximum quanity stored would be 96,118 pounds located in a 12,000 gallon storage tank and 10-1000 gallon applicator trailers.  The maximum amount handled at any one time would be the unloading of an 9,200 gallon truck trailer.\n\n3.  WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO\n     a.  The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of the 12,000 gallon storage tank released over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 52,428 pounds which represents the volume of the storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 2.6 miles as calculated using RMP Comp.\n\n     b.  The alternative release scenario based on the most likey potential incident is a release from a valve left open by an unauthorized person (during a theft of ammonia for drug production).  A total of 150 pounds of ammonia could be released from a partially frozen cut off valve over a time period of 30 minutes.  This time period would be sufficient for the ammonia release to develop into a nuisnce smell and be noticed and reported.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 0.1 miles as calculated using RMP Comp.\n\n4.  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n     The facility has implemented the provisions of"

FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n     There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\n     -  have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility: nor\n\n     -  to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property\n        damage, or environmental damage. \n\n6.  EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n     The faciliy has:\n     a.  a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29CFR 1910.38\n\n     b.  a written emergency response program, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.120,\n          including pre-emergency planning and employee training.\n\n     c.  provided state and local authorities the emergency plannin and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\n7.  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n     Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
