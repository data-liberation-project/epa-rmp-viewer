It is in addition to the Risk Management and Prevention Program (RMPP) dated September 1, 1992.\n\nIt is the policy of AES Placerita, Inc. to operate its facilities in such a manner as to prevent accidental releases of any regulated substances and coordinate any required response activities with the appropriate regulatory agencies, specifically, the Administering Agency (AA) - Los Angeles County Fire Department, Health Hazardous Materials Division.  AES and its employees will take all reasonable steps to avoid releases which have an impact on the environment or the surrounding community.\n\nThe purpose of this CalARP is to:  Prevent the accidental release of regulated substances and to increase the protection of public health and the environment by ensuring appropriate emergency response and mitigation procedures.\n\nPart of this Risk Management Plan includes a worst case release scenario and alternative release scenarios which include administrative controls and mitigation measures intended to limit the distances for each reported scenario.  This Risk Management Plan incorporates the general Accidental Release Prevention Program and prevention steps intended to prevent the release of ammonia specifically."
