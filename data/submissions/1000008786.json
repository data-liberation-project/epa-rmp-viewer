      "SummaryText": "FACILITY DESCRIPTION\nThe North Texas Municipal Water District is a regional entity that treats water, wastewater, and solid waste for four counties in the north Texas area. The Wilson Creek Regional Wastewater Treatment is located in Lucas, at 3020 Orr Road. The facility is owned and operated by the North Texas Municipal Water District (NTMWD).\n\nCOMPLIANCE\nNTMWD maintains compliance with the U.S. Environmental Protection AgencyA?s (USEPA) regulations for the prevention and mitigation of accidental releases of extremely hazardous substances under section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act.   Facilities covered by the regulations (40 CFR 68) are required to implement a risk management program and submit a description of the program (called a risk management plan, or RMP) to USEPA.  \n\nThe Wilson Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) falls under this regulation because of the onsite storage and use of chlorine and sulfur dioxide.  The amounts stored for both chemicals exceed the threshold limits specified by the USEPA, thereby making the facility subject to compliance with the regulation.  \n\nThe following information summarizes the Wilson Creek WWTP 2009 update:\n\nREGULATED SUBSTANCES\nThe Wilson Creek WWTP uses chlorine as a disinfectant in the wastewater treatment process.  Sulfur dioxide is used at the plant in the de-chlorination process to remove residual chlorine from the treated wastewater prior to discharge.   \n1. Chlorine\nThe Wilson Creek WWTP regularly has a maximum storage quantity of 16 tons of chlorine at its facility.  The chlorine is stored in 16 one-ton cylinders.  The total amount of chlorine exceeds the threshold limit of 2,500 pounds set by the USEPA.  Chlorine is delivered to the Wilson Creek WWTP by truck.    \n\nA release of chlorine gas could potentially occur at the chlorine storage area or at the chlorine process areas.\n\n2. Sulfur dioxide\nThe Wilson Creek WWTP stores sulfur dioxide in 12 one-ton cylinders.  The total amount exceeds the threshold limit of"

Sulfur dioxide is delivered to the Wilson Creek WWTP by a truck.  \n\nA release of sulfur dioxide gas could potentially occur at the sulfur dioxide storage area or at the sulfur dioxide process areas.\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT\nMalcolm Pirnie, Inc. reviewed and updated the offsite consequence analyses at Wilson Creek WWTP by identifying and documenting a worse case scenario (sulfur dioxide) and one alternate release scenario each for chlorine and sulfur dioxide.   EPAA?s RMP*Comp was used as the model for the resubmission.  \n\nThe results of this review are documented and are maintained as part of the RMP records.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThe accident history for the Wilson Creek WWTP was reviewed for the period from June 2004 through June 2009.  During this period of time, no accidental releases of chlorine occurred that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on-site, or off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or any environmental impact.\n\nPREVENTION PROGRAM\nThe NTMWD maintains a consistent accidental release prevention program to eliminate or minimize releases of chlorine and sulfur dioxide at Wilson Creek WWTP.  The program consists of seven elements:\n\n1. Safety Information\nNTMWD has maintained information concerning process chemicals, technology, and equipment as part of their risk management program at Wilson Creek WWTP.  The information is made available to employees and contractors at Wilson Creek WWTP who will work in the chlorine and sulfur dioxide process area.  Emergency response planners can also use the information to develop training programs and procedures.\n\n2. Hazard Review\nA hazard review of chlorine and sulfur dioxide processes and procedures is conducted at least every five (5) years to evaluate potential causes and consequences of accidental releases.  A chlorine and sulfur dioxide process hazard analysis using the A?What-IfA? method was conducted by Malcolm Pirnie, Inc"

Existing precautions were reviewed and determined to be adequate.  Potential changes in operating, maintenance, and other process safety management procedures that could further improve the overall safety of the chlorine and sulfur dioxide systems were identified.\n\nThe results of this review are documented and are maintained as part of the RMP records.  \n\n3. Operating procedures\nNTMWD have developed and implemented written operating procedures that provide instructions and step for conducting activities associated with the chlorine and sulfur dioxide processes at Wilson Creek WWTP consistent with the safety information. Wilson Creek WWTP operating procedures include startup, shutdown, and emergency operating procedures, and describe how the system should be operated in order to minimize the chances of an accidental release. The procedures also emphasize safety considerations during operation and address hazardous situations that can occur and how to correct them.\n\n4. Training\nAll Wilson Creek WWTP staff currently involved in chlorine and sulfur dioxide processes have been trained in the classroom and/or during on-the-job training in an overview of the processes and in the operating procedures, as is new staff assigned to the processes.  Training includes emphasis on safety and health, hazards, emergency operations including shutdown, and safe work practices.  Refresher training is provided at least every three years to ensure Wilson Creek WWTP staff understands and adheres to current operating procedures.  \n\n5. Maintenance\nWilson Creek WWTP has developed and implemented a preventive and corrective maintenance program to ensure equipment used to process, store, or handle chlorine and sulfur dioxide is functioning properly and installed to minimize the risk of releases.   The program addresses equipment testing, inspection, and pre"

Compliance audits\nUSEPAA?s risk management rule requires that Wilson Creek WWTP complete a compliance audit for its risk management program at least once every 3 years. The primary goals of conducting a compliance audit are to verify compliance with risk management rule requirements and good process safety practices, identify process safety or program deficiencies and develop corrective actions, and increase safety awareness among Wilson Creek WWTP staff. \n\nMalcolm Pirnie, Inc., with the assistance of Wilson Creek WWTP plant management and staff familiar with the processes operation and maintenance, conducted an audit in March 2009. The results of this both audits, in addition to recommendations made, are documented and are maintained as part of the RMP records. \n\n7. Incident Investigation\nWilson Creek WWTP management investigates each incident that resulted in or could reasonably have resulted in a catastrophic release of chlorine or sulfur dioxide. A process to identify the underlying causes of incidents and implement procedures for preventing similar events has been developed. \n\nAn incident investigation team will be established following criteria established in the Wilson Creek WWTP risk management program.  As part of the investigation, an incident report will be prepared to recommend system changes (i.e., operational modifications, additional training and competency requirements), to prevent a similar incident from occurring in the future. The incident investigation report and any changes resulting from the report will be reviewed with all staff members who operate and maintain the applicable system.\n\nNo incidents were reported between 2004 and 2009\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\nAn Emergency Response Plan (ERP) has been developed for Wilson Creek WWTP, which provides specific emergency response procedures for accidental relea"

These procedures include leak investigation, operational-level response activities, and communications to coordinate response activities with outside agencies, such as the local fire department and a environmental response contractor, in the event of an emergency. \n\nNTMWD will be updating the ERP into an NIMS-compliant all-hazard integrated contingency plan (ICP) in 2009.  The ICP format minimizes duplication in the preparation and use of emergency response and risk management plans for various regulatory requirements, and will eliminate confusion for Wilson Creek WWTP staff that would have had to decide which plan applies to a particular emergency.\n\nRECOMMENDED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nA?
