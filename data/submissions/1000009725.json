This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training and consideration of safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nThe Philtex/Ryton Plant, located in Borger, Texas, operates a variety of processes to produce specialty chemicals and plastics.\r\nThe Philtex units of the plant produce specialty chemicals such as organo-sulfur compounds, high purity hydrocarbons, solvents and diversified organic chemicals. Since the last update, allyl alcohol use and piperidine production have bben removed form the site and removed from this report. The chemical plant has several regulated flammables (i.e., propane, butane, butadiene, propylene) and toxics (i.e., hydrogen sulfide, sulfur dioxide, methyl mercaptan). \r\nThe Ryton unit of our plant produces plastic (the Ryton unit does not contain a regulated substance covered by the Risk Management Program regulation).   \r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\r\n\r\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the Philtex/Ryton plant.  Because processes at the plant that are regulated by the EPA RMP regulation are also subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program. \r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\n\r\nThe Philtex/Ryton plant encourages employees to participate in all facets of risk management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical docu"

Employees have access to all information created as part of the plant accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in the employee participation element of the Philtex/Ryton Risk Management system and in the employee participation section of all other risk management elements.  In addition, the plant has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and employee safety issues.  These initiatives include forming teams to promote both process safety and personal safety.  The teams typically have members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering and plant management.  \r\n\r\nTwo key areas for employee participation include the employee behavioral safety process and OSHA's Voluntary Protection Program.  This award recognizes Philtex's use of a behavioral-based safety process (POWER, People Observing Work, Eliminating Risk).  This employee driven process along with other safety efforts has reduced our total recordable injury rates from 1.50 (1999) to .76 (05/2009).  Our Plant became a STAR site in 1999 and has maintained it since.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\n\r\nThe Philtex/Ryton Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Specific departments within the plant are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.  Process safety information reference documents are readily available as part of the written employee participation plan to help employees locate any necessary process safety information.  \r\n\r\nChemical-specific information, includin"

For specific process areas, the plant has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in the unit-specific Process Safety Information (PSI) document.  The plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems). A current list of what is contained in process equipment and sotrage vessels is available on-lin for access by all employees.  \r\n\r\nThe plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, pressure relief settings, etc.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.  \r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis\r\n\r\nThe Philtex/Ryton Plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.  \r\n\r\nThe Philtex/Ryton Plant primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.

Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA team findings are tracked in an electronic database until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.  \r\n\r\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, Philtex/Ryton periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating. The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained. Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\n\r\nPhiltex/Ryton maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.

This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\n\r\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, Philtex/Ryton has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process. New employees receive basic training in plant operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years. All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\r\n\r\nContractors\r\n\r\nPhiltex/Ryton uses contractors to supplement its work force, more so during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.

In addition, Philtex/Ryton evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor. Plant personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.  Our primary contractor received STAR status from OSHA in 2002.\r\n\r\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\r\n\r\nPhiltex/Ryton conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a management of change review. The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service. This review provides one additional check to make sure construction or changes are in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready. The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness. A PSSR involves field verification and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\n\r\nPhiltex/Ryton has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.

Written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training. Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended, and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels). If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or a Management of Change team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\r\n\r\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance. Philtex/Ryton incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs. This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\r\n\r\nPhiltex/Ryton has developed a team-based defect elimination process known as PRIDE (Philtex/Ryton Integrated Defect Elimination).  The objective of this employee driven process is to eliminate equipment failures through predictive and preventive maintenance and this effort has reduced failure rates by 20% for critical equipment.  As this process continues to take hold we expect continuous improvement in operating reliability and safety. \r\n\r\nSafe Work Practices\r\n\r\nPhiltex/Ryton has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.

This management system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, personnel and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented. Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change. Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes. In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change. All management of change reports since the pervious PHA are reveiwed at ehnext PHA revalidation.\r\n \r\n\r\nIncident Investigation\r\n\r\nPhiltex/Ryton promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury. The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to plant management for resolution.   Corrective actions taken in response to the"

      "SummaryText": "investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked in an electronic databe until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings.  Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 6 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidations.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits\r\n\r\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, Philtex/Ryton periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.  Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years (last one performed 07/2006, next one is scheduled 07/2009). The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to plant management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding is documented in an electronic database, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.\r\n\r\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nThe processes at Philtex/Ryton have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.  The accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all processes at the plant.  Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by (1) equipment failures and (2) human errors.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the accident prevention program activities, Philtex/Ryton has safety features on many units to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release.  The following types of safety features are used in various processes:\r\n\r\nRelease Detection\r\n\r\nHydrocarbon detectors with alarms\r\nChemical specific detectors with alarms & interlocks to specific HVAC systems"

The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released. The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first-aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements. In addition, Philtex/Ryton has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions th"

The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to plant processes or other plant facilities. The emergency response program changes are administered through the MOC process, which includes informing and/or training affected personnel in the changes.\r\n\r\nThe overall emergency response program for Philtex/Ryton is coordinated with the Hutchinson County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and the Panhandle Emergency Response System (PERS). This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives. \r\nPhiltex/Ryton has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department). This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident. In addition to periodic LEPC meetings, Philtex/Ryton conducts periodic emergency drills that involve the LEPC and emergency response organizations.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY CONTACT INFORMATION\r\n\r\nThere are multiple contacts possible at Philtex/Ryton since our Shift Team Leaders rotate in 12 hour shifts.  The Shift Team Leader on duty will act as our Incident Commander in the event of an emergency since all have been trained in plant and emergency operations.  The phone number given in the RMP Submit form Section 1 contacts the Philtex Operations Manager on duty and the 24 hour phone number will contact security personnel in the event the Philtex Operations Manager can not be reached.
