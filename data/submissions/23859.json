      "SummaryText": "I. Introduction\n\nA. Background\n\nThe storage, use and handling of hazardous materials by businesses, agencies and households has grown exponentially since the development of the petrochemical industry and allied chemical manufacturing industries.  This expansion has been one link in a chain of developments that has supported an increase in the general lifestyle of western culture.  While many of the advancements and applications of newly developed chemical products have had direct positive effects on public health, other situations, e.g., contamination of drinking water sources, have had both real and at times perceived negative effects.  Accidental releases of acutely hazardous chemicals from industrial sites has been one type of incident that has had negative consequences and catalyzed public awareness.  \n\nDuring a ten year period from 1974 to 1984 at least four major accidents, most notably a chemical plant explosion in Bhopal, India, occurred which had catastrophic effects on surrounding populations.  Although the accident at Three Mile Island during this same period was a radioactive versus chemical release, it further sensitized the public, and governmental agencies, to the potential hazards and risks posed by the use of acutely hazardous materials in relatively close proximity to populations.  \n\nRegulatory agencies responded by adopting legislatively mandated requirements that focused on the prevention of such accidental releases of acutely hazardous materials.  The Federal Occupational Safety & Health Administration enacted the Process Safety Management standard in August 1992, requiring certain facilities to identify and analyze the potential causes which could lead to chemical releases and then implement mitigation and prevention steps, including additional employee safety training.  The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency followed in June 1996 with amendments to the Clean Air Act (section 112(r); 40 CFR 68) titled Risk Management Programs for Chemical Acc"

The contents of the PSM plan constitute a substantial portion of the RMP plan and, consequently, there is some economy of effort when complying with both.  The integration also facilitates a consistent approach with regard to multiple agency enforcement.  \n \nB. Executive Summary\n\nThe City of Eureka is committed to providing a safe and healthful workplace free from recognized hazards as well as minimizing, to the greatest extend practicable, the risks to the public and visitors.  This commitment is embodied in this Risk Management Program plan for the prevention of accidental releases of acutely hazardous materials, including chlorine and sulfur dioxide gas.  Risks are reduced by ensuring that recognized industry standards of process engineering and hazard mitigation are employed along with effective administrative procedures, including emergency response and employee training.\n\nThis plan focuses on preventing releases of chlorine and/or sulfur dioxide gasses from the wastewater disinfecting process.  The disinfecting process involves the extraction of gaseous chlorine from 1-ton cylinders and the subsequent injection of a liquid solution of that chlorine into the wastewater effluent.  The process then involves the extraction of gaseous sulfur dioxide from 1-ton cylinders and the subsequent injection of a liquid solution of that sulfur dioxide into the chlorinated wastewater effluent for the purpose of de-chlorinating prior to discharge. The phase during which the chlorine and/or sulfur dioxide gas is extracted and delivered to the"

      "SummaryText": "liquid injectors via piping is the period during which and accidental release could potentially have offsite consequences, depending upon the extent of the release.\n\nThe RMP regulation mandates that facilities assess at least two scenarios of potential releases for each process chemical.  One scenario is a default worst-case release and the other is an alternate scenario.  The parameters effecting the dispersion of an airborne release for any given situation, e.g., release rate, ambient temperature, wind speed, etc., are mandated as default values by EPA for the worst-case release scenario.  Under these set conditions the release rate is defined as the loss of the entire contents of the largest container, in both cases a 1-ton cylinder, in ten minutes.  EPA acknowledges that such a scenario may well be, as it is in these cases, so improbable as to be a near impossibility.  These scenarios depict a catastrophic breach of the 1-ton cylinder for both chlorine and sulfur dioxide.  Under these circumstances there are no mitigation measures in place to effectively address such a release.  Only a catastrophic event like a roof collapse or an airplane crashing into the cylinder could bring about this type of cylinder breach.  Under these highly improbable scenarios any engineered mitigation measures would likely be rendered inoperable.  \n\nFor the alternate release scenarios, the EPA dictates that the alternate release must reach an offsite endpoint regardless of how unlikely it is to occur, just as long as it exists as a potential.  The parameters characterizing both the cause and dispersion factors of the alternate releases were selected by taking into account accidental release history, process design, and operating procedures.  For chlorine, location-specific climatic and topographic data was used.  For sulfur dioxide, an EPA look-up table was used for the release rates and distance to the toxic endpoint.  The alternate release scenarios selected for both chlorine and"

      "SummaryText": "sulfur dioxide involved the release of gas through a 5/16  diameter hole in the tank valve for a period of 90 minutes.  The primary mitigation measure to address each scenario would be to call 911 and receive an emergency response by the Hazardous Materials Response Team, stationed at the City of Eureka Fire Department on 6th and C Streets in Eureka, CA.\n\nThe wastewater treatment plant's Process Safety Management Plan, as well as standard operating procedures and preventative maintenance form the core of the accidental release prevention strategy.  These programs ensure that regular facility and equipment inspections, preventative servicing, and repairs are made in a timely manner.  This reduces the risk of equipment failure that could interrupt the disinfecting process and/or potentially lead to a release of chlorine or sulfur dioxide.  On-going employee training prepares employees to respond effectively and rapidly to releases or threatened releases of chlorine or sulfur dioxide.  Additional steps implemented to reduce the risk of accidental release include cylinder inspection procedures and third-party observations and assessments of operating and response procedures.\n\nThe wastewater treatment industry has, overall, an excellent safety record for the storage and use of chlorine and sulfur dioxide.  Likewise, the City of Eureka Elk River Wastewater Treatment Plant has neither had any release that presented a serious health risk to individuals offsite, nor any minor release in the last five years that resulted in injury or illness.  In 1997 there was a minor sulfur dioxide release resulting from a break in the sulfur dioxide liquid injector feed line to the outfall pipe.  In 1998, a faulty valve on a tank created a chlorine leak when connected to the pigtail tubing and the tank was taken out of service.  \n\nThe emergency response program for the wastewater treatment plant emphasizes a rapid, defensive response to maintain employee safety and, if necessary, to quic"

The level of response by treatment plant personnel is limited to that which is possible with use of air-purifying respiratory protection.  This will include most minor leaks. Any major leak necessitating the use of supplied air respirators such as self-contained breathing apparatus will require the response of the Hazardous Materials Response Team.  The response procedures also include making the proper notifications to Humboldt County Environmental Health Division and other agencies.\n\nDuring development of the Process Safety Management plan and review of operating procedures in 1999, changes were implemented as a means to reduce the risk of an accidental release.  The use of a cylinder-receiving checklist now provides a procedure whereby full cylinders being delivered by the vendor can be checked to ensure that they are in compliance with federal hydrostatic testing requirements.  Hydrostatic testing is performed every 5 years (60 months) and is directly related to the structural integrity and strength of the cylinders.  Any cylinders which are either overdue for testing or could become overdue for testing while onsite are not accepted for delivery.  A spare regulator is now kept onsite as an emergency replacement unit, should a regulator that is in service develop a leak.  Proposed future changes include the acquisition and use of portable chlorine monitors to be utilized in the initial response phase in the event of a chlorine release.  \n\nSulfur dioxide was not included in the original 1999 Risk Management Plan due to a misinterpretation of the Risk Management Program's definition of process.  The RMP definition of process includes the both quantity of chemical in use plus the quantity stored on-site.  The rule's limit for sulfur dioxide is 5000 pounds, and the combination of sulfur dioxide used and stored on-site at the wastewater treatment plant exceeds this limit.  The inclusion of sulfur"
