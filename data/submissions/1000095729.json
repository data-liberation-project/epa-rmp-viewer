In the cold box, methane and heavier hydrocarbons are separated from the gas mixture by liquefaction and the gas stream is further cooled to permit most of the nitrogen to condense leaving a gas stream that is enriched in helium (a non-condensable in this system).\r\n\r\nFlammable gas and liquid mixtures are the only regulated substances handled at this facility in amounts exceeding the threshold quantity.  The maximum intended inventory of all flammable mixtures at this facility is 219,000 pounds.\r\n\r\n3.  The worst-case release scenario(s) and the alternative release scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distance for each reported scenario:\r\n\r\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS), as defined by the EPA, is a catastrophic failure of the largest single vessel containing flammable mixture, releasing all 197,400 pounds of natural gas liquids which is assumed to vaporize forming a vapor cloud and igniting resulting in a vapor cloud explosion (VCE).  The maximum distance to the EPA-defined endpoint (1 psi overpressure) for this WCS is 0.50 miles (2640 feet).  Although we have both active and passive controls directed at preventing or mitigating such releases, no credit for active or passive mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating this WCS.\r\n\r\n4.  The general accidental release prevention program and specific prevention steps:\r\n\r\nThe facility-developed prevention program elements are based on the Federal EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Plan and OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation.  This facility was designed  and constructed to comply with applicable state and industry codes.\r\n\r\n5.  Five-year accident history:\r\n\r\nThe Cliffside Gas Field reservoir began operations in 1929.  The new Helium Enrichment Unit (HEU) with NGL storage came on line during November, 2003.  In the last five years there have been no reportable accidental releases of flammable gas or liquids"

Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\r\n\r\nAt this facility, we concentrate helium from helium-rich natural gas from the Cliffside Gas Field.  Natural gas and natural gas liquids, in the amounts handled by our facility, exceeds the threshold quantity set by EPA.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and state rules and regulations.  The USBLM manages the safety of the regulated processes by means of operating procedures, equipment testing and inspections, safety devices (e.g., alarms, shutdowns, instrumentation, relief devices) inherent in the design of this facility and other controls and systems designed to prevent accidental release of hazardous chemicals.  Safe work practices and training of our personnel supplement the inherent safe design of the plant.\r\n\r\nThe emergency response plan includes procedures for the notification of the local fire authority and Hazardous Materials unit so that appropriate measures can be taken by local responders to control accidental releases.\r\n\r\nThis document has been prepared in accordance with the EPA's Risk Management Plan regulation (40 CFR, Part 68).  The substances and processes considered during the preparation of this RMP and the scenarios described were selected based on criteria established in the regulation.\r\n\r\n2.  The stationary source and regulated substances handled:\r\n\r\nThe primary purpose of this facility is to produce an enriched helium gas stream for delivery by pipeline to users and helium refiners.  Gas from the Cliffside Gas Field is received by our plant via pipeline and used as our feedstock.  The feed stock is compressed and carbon dioxide is removed by a DGA adsorption system.  Following CO2 removal, the feed stream is dehydrated by a Temperature Swing Adsorption (TSA) system before it is sent to the cold box for cryogenic n"
