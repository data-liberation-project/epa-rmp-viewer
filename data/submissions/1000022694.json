The only difference between the valve of a 1-ton container and 150-pound cylinder is the location of the fusible plug.  The release rates therefore would be expected to be the same.

As a primarily retail business (i.e. selling to end users) with less than 10 full time employees on site, this facility does not meet the requirements for regulation under the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard.   This facility therefore qualifies as a Program 2 facility under U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) guidelines.  \n\nb.\tIt is anticipated that no more than four (4) people will be employed by the facility.

The facility is generally staffed by 1-2 persons during the normal business hours of 0800 hours to 1600 hours, Monday through Friday.  \n\nc.\tThe offsite consequence analysis includes consideration of two chlorine-related release scenarios, identified as worst-case release and alternative release.  The first scenario is defined by EPA, which states that, the owner or operator shall assume that the maximum quantity in the largest vessel is released as a gas over 10 minutes, due to an unspecified failure.  The alternative scenario is defined as more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario.\n\n(1.)\tThe worst-case release scenario at this Davis Supply facility involves the release of the contents of a single 150-pound chlorine cylinder in 10 minutes.

This scenario followed conditions pre-defined by the EPA, namely release of the entire amount as a gas in 10 minutes, use of the one-hour average ERPG-2 (3 ppm) as the toxic endpoint, and consideration of the population residing within a full circle with the radius corresponding to the toxic endpoint distance.

This facility is located at 25058 Blue Star Highway (Highway 90) in Quincy, Florida at 30&#61616; 33' 13.20 North latitude and 84&#61616;31'23.50 West longitude.  A site location map is included as Figure 1 at the end of the executive summary.  This office/warehouse facility includes a chlorine storage area within the warehouse area, which contains 150-pound cylinders of chlorine and sulfur dioxide gases chained to a custom wall pipe system located in the southeastern corner of the warehouse portion of the building.  The piping for the cylinders is designed to segregate the chlorine from the sulfur dioxide as well as the full cylinders from the empty cylinders in adjacent compartments.  A maximum inventory level of 72 cylinders or 10,800 pounds of chlorine gas and 30 cylinders or 4,500 pounds of sulfur dioxide will be stored on site at any time.  While chlorine gas and sulfur dioxide are the only chemical inventories subject to the Risk Management Plan (RMP) standard, a considerable inventory of a number of other hazardous water treatment chemicals is also stored at this site.  The quantity of inventory of these chemicals varies with client needs but includes liquid bulk tanks of 10% sodium hypochlorite; bulk tanks and totes of 23% hydrofluorosilicic acid; totes of 40% hydrofluorosilicic acid; totes of 40% aluminum sulfate; totes of 38% and 93% sulfuric acid; drums and gallon jugs of 32% hydrochloric acid; as well as dry chemical calcium hypochlorite powder and trichloro-s-triazinetrione tablets in bucket quantities.   A site drawing depicting the chemical locations is included at the end of the executive summary as Figure 2.  Based on the maximum chemical inventory levels at the facility, only chlorine will be subject to the RMP standard.  Public receptors are within the distance to the endpoint for the worst-case rel"
