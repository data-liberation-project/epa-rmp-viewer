This facility is located at 25058 Blue Star Highway (Highway 90) in Quincy, Florida at 30&#61616; 33' 13.20\" North latitude and 84&#61616;31'23.50\" West longitude.  A site location map is included as Figure 1 at the end of the executive summary.  This office/warehouse facility includes a chlorine storage area within the warehouse area, which contains 150-pound cylinders of chlorine and sulfur dioxide gases chained to a custom wall pipe system located in the southeastern corner of the warehouse portion of the building.  The piping for the cylinders is designed to segregate the chlorine from the sulfur dioxide as well as the full cylinders from the empty cylinders in adjacent compartments.  A maximum inventory level of 72 cylinders or 10,800 pounds of chlorine gas and 30 cylinders or 4,500 pounds of sulfur dioxide will be stored on site at any time.  While chlorine gas and sulfur dioxide are the only chemical inventories subject to the Risk Management Plan (RMP) standard, a considerable inventory of a number of other hazardous water treatment chemicals is also stored at this site.  The quantity of inventory of these chemicals varies with client needs but includes liquid bulk tanks of 10% sodium hypochlorite; bulk tanks and totes of 23% hydrofluorosilicic acid; totes of 40% hydrofluorosilicic acid; totes of 40% aluminum sulfate; totes of 38% and 93% sulfuric acid; drums and gallon jugs of 32% hydrochloric acid; as well as dry chemical calcium hypochlorite powder and trichloro-s-triazinetrione tablets in bucket quantities.   A site drawing depicting the chemical locations is included at the end of the executive summary as Figure 2.  Based on the maximum chemical inventory levels at the facility, only chlorine will be subject to the RMP standard.  Public receptors are within the distance to the endpoint for the worst-case rel"

      "SummaryText": "ease.  This facility does not fall into any of the North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) codes as listed in the RMP standard.  As a primarily retail business (i.e. selling to end users) with less than 10 full time employees on site, this facility does not meet the requirements for regulation under the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard.   This facility therefore qualifies as a Program 2 facility under U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) guidelines.  \n\nb.    It is anticipated that no more than four (4) people will be employed by the facility.  In addition to one (1) office manager and (1) plant manager, there two (2) drivers currently employed at this facility.  The facility is generally staffed by 1-2 persons during the normal business hours of 0800 hours to 1600 hours, Monday through Friday.  \n\nc.    The offsite consequence analysis includes consideration of two chlorine-related release scenarios, identified as \"worst-case release\" and \"alternative release.\"  The first scenario is defined by EPA, which states that, \"the owner or operator shall assume that the maximum quantity in the largest vessel is released as a gas over 10 minutes,\" due to an unspecified failure.  The alternative scenario is defined as \"more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario\".\n\n(1.)    The worst-case release scenario at this Davis Supply facility involves the release of the contents of a single 150-pound chlorine cylinder in 10 minutes.  An offsite consequence analysis for this scenario was performed based on calculations provided by the EPA's Risk Management Program Guidance for Chemical Distributors (January 27, 1999) document. This scenario followed conditions pre-defined by the EPA, namely release of the entire amount as a gas in 10 minutes, use of the one-hour average ERPG-2 (3 ppm) as the toxic endpoint, and consideration of the population residing within a full circle with the radius corresponding to the toxic endpoint distance. These conditions wer"

The toxic endpoint based on EPA assumptions was estimated to be to be 0.4 miles.  The residential population within the entire 0.5 square mile toxic endpoint potential impact area with a radius of 0.4 miles for this scenario was estimated to be 135 people.  Figure 3, presented at the end of Section 4 of this plan, depicts the worst-case scenario 0.4-mile toxic endpoint potential impact area with a smaller plume shown to the East to depict the prevailing wind the majority of the year and, therefore, most likely impact direction.  Public receptors within the area contained in a circle with its center at the Davis Supply facility and outwards to a radius of 0.4 miles were noted as follows:\n\n        Public Receptors*\nNone Noted\n        Environmental Receptors\n            None Noted\n        Major Commercial, Office, or Industrial Buildings\n            None Noted\n\n* It note worthy that the Gadsden High School and a Police Academy are located approximately 2.0 miles ENE of the subject facility considerably outside the 0.4-mile worst case toxic endpoint distance.\n\n(2.)  The alternative release scenario involves valve failure on a single 150-pound chlorine cylinder.  From the Chlorine Institute Pamphlet 74, Estimating the Area Affected by a Chlorine Release, the release rate for the valve of a 1-ton container of chlorine is 12.7 pounds per minute.  The only difference between the valve of a 1-ton container and 150-pound cylinder is the location of the fusible plug.  The release rates therefore would be expected to be the same.  Based on the calculations as provided by the EPA's Risk Management Program Guidance for Chemical Distributors (January 27, 1999) document the toxic endpoint for the alternative scenario was estimated to be 0.1 miles.  Figure 4, presented at the end of Section 4 of this plan, depicts the alternative release scenario 0.1-mile toxic endpoint pote"

The Davis Supply accidental release prevention program is based on the following key elements:\nA?    Training of chlorine handlers\nA?    Supplier provided cylinder preventive maintenance program\nA?    Use of industry standard process and safety equipment\n\nChlorine-specific prevention steps include:\nA?    Training in the practices of safe chlorine handling\nA?    The availability of an A-kit on site for any active mitigation to limit a release\nA?    Awareness of the hazardous and toxic properties of chlorine\n\ne.    No accidental releases of chlorine have occurred at this facility in the past five years.\n\nEmergency response procedures are coordinated with local emergency responders, as this facility has limited emergency response capabilities. In the event of an emergency, 911is contacted, and the site is evacuated.  The phone number for the Quincy Fire Department is (850)875-7315. "
