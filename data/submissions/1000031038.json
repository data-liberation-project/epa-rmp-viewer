      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\n\nThis report contains the Risk Management Plan (RMP) for the ammonia refrigeration systems located at the Americold-Dallas cold storage facility in Dallas, TX.   The RMP  was prepared in accordance with the requirements of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RM program) regulation (Risk Management Programs for Chemical Accidental Release Prevention, 40 CFR Part 68).\n\n\n\nMr. Randell Willaims, Regional Compliance Manager, coordinated the preparation of the RMP with Price McNutt the Facility Service Manager of the Americold-Dallas facility. The information presented in this report reflects the facility data for elements of the EPA RMP release prevention program and Off Site Consequence analysis.  This was done through the E-submit portal of EPA's central data exchange server.  \n\n\n\nAmericold recognizes management's responsibility in protecting its employees, equipment, property, and the environment.  The safety and health of all personnel are first and foremost very important.  The prevention of accidental releases has been and will continue to be a basic responsibility of all personnel in the Dallas facility.\n\n\n\nTo accomplish the goal to prevent accidents, the facility has an established Process Safety Management Program (PSM).  The objectives of the PSM Program are to: prevent ammonia releases, roff site impacts, harm to public and environmental receptors, maximize efficiency and improve safety performance, reduce losses associated with damage of property, eliminate human suffering and the economic burden resulting from injuries and accidents.\n\n\n\nOne of the activities associated with the PSM Program has been the development and implementation of accidental release prevention and emergency planning initiatives which are designed to comply with EPA 68.90-95 and OSHA 1910.38 Emergency Action Plan.\n\nThe purpose of the accidental release prevention and emergency response programs is to prevent the occurrence, and minim"

      "SummaryText": "ize the consequences of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents.  Overall, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.\n\n\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency planning programs help prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices which govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment.  These rules are detailed and improved as (often as) necessary.  They are also communicated to and accepted by all employees at the facility.\n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nAmericold operates the cold storage facility in Dallas, TX.  The facility operates two ammonia refrigeration systems (i. e., the Building 1 and Building 2 Refrigeration Systems) to provide cooling and freezing capabilities.  The amount of anhydrous ammonia (CAS #7662-41-7) contained in one of these systems is above the EPA's threshold of 10,000 pounds.  The maximum intended amount of ammonia charged to the Building 1 and 2 Refrigeration Systems is 10,800 and 9,900 pounds respectively. The average daily quantity of ammonia is calculated to be below the maximum reported on this RMP submission. \n\n\n\nSummary of Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\n\n\nBuilding 1 and 2 Refrigeration System\n\n\n\nA worst-case release scenario was modeled for the Building 1 and 2 refrigeration systems at the Dallas facility in order to determine the off site impacts to public and environmental receptors. \n\n\n\nThe worst-case release scenario related to the refrigeration systems is unlikely for the following reasons:\n\n\n\nThe worst-case weather conditions which were used for this scenario are not typical;\n\nThe controlled pressure receiver is located in an enclosed area that could help to contain such a release and minimize traffic (e. g.; forklifts) near the receiver;\n\nIndustry standards have been followed for the manufacture and "

Employees are also to be involved when a process hazard analysis is conducted.  The program also ensures that all employees have complete access to the program.\n\n\n\n         Process Safety Information: Written information has been collected which enables the employees to identify and understand the potential hazards in the system. The written information includes the ammonia MSDS and a description of the design of the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\n\n\n         Process Hazard Analysis: Formal studies using the Hazop Technique have been conducted to look at the system and identify potential hazards.\n\n\n\n         Operating Procedures:  Written, detailed procedures have been developed which describe the steps which should be followed to safely operate the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\n\n\n         Training: A training program has been developed which ensures that employees are trained on all aspects of the system and on the duties which they should perform to ensure the safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\n\n\n         Contractors: All co"
