These practices, along with related procedures and training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\r\n\r\nManagement of Change (MOC)\r\n\r\nThis facility has a comprehensive system to manage changes to process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes.  The MOC process facilitates appropriate review and authorization before a change is implemented.  Changes are reviewed to ensure adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and to verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, equipment information, drawings, and procedures are updated for these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training related to the change.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation\r\n\r\nThis facility promptly investigates incidents that resulted in (or could have reasonably resulted in) a fire, explosion, release, major equipment/property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.

The Management of Change (MOC) process is used to steward assignment and completion of PSSRs.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity (MI)\r\n\r\nExxonMobil's Facility Integrity Management System (FIMS) is designed to manage mechanical integrity.  By incorporation of FIMS into its processes, this facility has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief/vent systems, controls, pumps, compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.  The basic aspects of this MI program include: training, written procedures, inspections/tests, correction of identified deficiencies, and quality assurance measures.  In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.  Maintenance personnel receive training on the process, safety and health hazards, applicable maintenance procedures, emergency procedures, and applicable safe work practices to help ensure they perform their jobs in a safe manner.  Written procedures and equipment manuals help ensure work is performed in a consistent and safe manner and provide a basis for training.  \r\n\r\nInspections/tests and preventive maintenance are performed on a scheduled basis to help ensure equipment and safety devices function as intended and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness, pressure relief device set points).  If a deficiency is identified, employees correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service, or a group of subject matter experts (e.g., engineers, technicians) review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure safe operation of the equipment until the deficiency can be corrected.\r\n\r\nAnother integral part of the MI program is quality assurance.

Procedures are readily available to operators and other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.  These procedures provide a consistent basis for training new operators and are annually reviewed and validated.  The Competency Assurance Standard (CAS) provides guidance and electronic tools to ensure the procedures are maintained.

New employees receive basic training in facility operations (e.g., process overview, applicable procedure reviews, etc.).  New operators are then paired with experienced operators (mentors) to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After the new operators demonstrate (e.g., written tests, hands-on skills demonstration) they have adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they are allowed to work independently.

If a release does occur, our trained personnel will take steps to control and contain it until local emergency organizations arrive.  Additional details are included in other sections of this plan.  \r\n\r\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nThe Shute Creek Facility, located about 33 miles Northeast of Kemmerer, Wyoming, consists of one Program Level 3 process which utilizes several operations (e.g., separation, dehydration, compression, cryogenic) to produce methane, carbon dioxide, and helium from a naturally occurring hydrocarbon gas mixture.  The facility could contain regulated refrigerant propane, and regulated toxics ammonium hydroxide (29%) and hydrogen sulfide in excess of the threshold quantities established in the regulation.  Transportation of regulated flammables and toxics is handled into the facility via pipeline and trucks and out of the facility via trucks and pipelines.  This facility is surrounded by unoccupied high plains rural area.\r\n\r\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results\r\n\r\nIn accordance with special security guidance provided by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), data addressing the facility's Offsite Consequence Analyses (Worst Case Scenarios and Alternative Release Scenarios) are not detailed in this section.  Refer to Data Element Sections 2, 3, 4, and 5 of this plan.\r\n\r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\r\n\r\nThe following is a summa"

This summary addresses each of the EPA RMP elements and describes the management systems in place to implement the accident prevention program for covered processes.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\n\r\nThis facility provides for and encourages employees to participate in process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating/compiling technical information and drawings to participating on process hazard analysis (PHA) and incident investigation teams.  Employees have access to information related to the accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are detailed in an Employee Participation Plan that is maintained at the facility and addresses each program element.  In addition, this facility has other initiatives that address process and employee safety topics (e.g., hazard reporting/resolution process and numerous safety meetings [daily, monthly, pre-job], etc.).\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information (PSI)\r\n\r\nThis facility keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the facility.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, safe operating limits for key process parameters, specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  The on-site Engineering group is responsible for coordinating the PSI updates.\r\n\r\nChemical-specific information (including exposure hazards, emergency response, and exposure treatment considerations) is provided in safety data sheets.  For specific process areas, this facility has documented safety-related operating limits for process parameters (e.g., temperature, pressure, level) in its operating procedures.

The program consists of procedures for handling releases of regulated substances (i.e., flammables, hydrogen sulfide) including the possibility of fires or explosions.  The procedures address facility/equipment isolation and shutdown, initial first aid and medical treatment for exposures (i.e., Safety Data Sheet information), evacuation plans for this facility, accounting for facility personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies, and post-incident cleanup/decontamination requirements.  In addition, this facility has procedures that address the maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency equipment and alarms.  Facility personnel receive training in these procedures, as necessary, to perform their specific duties.  \r\n\r\nThe emergency action plan is"

The information includes materials of construction, design pressure, temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment.  In combination with written procedures and trained personnel, the information provides a basis for inspection/maintenance activities and the evaluation of proposed process or facility changes.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\r\n\r\nThis facility has a comprehensive program to help ensure hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\r\n\r\nIn the most recent PHA cycle, the facility utilized a Knowledge-Based HAZOP process, a recognized hazard evaluation technique for RMP and PSM-covered processes.  These analyses are conducted using a team of facility operating/maintenance personnel, facility engineers, and technical consultants (as necessary).  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as the accident prevention and mitigation measures.  \r\n\r\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to management to coordinate further evaluation and resolution.  This process involves field level business teams, which include engineering personnel, operations personnel, and management.  Operating personnel are also involved in the evaluation of resolution options.  Implementation of the resolutions is prioritized for accomplishment based on a relative risk.  Resolution plans are tracked until completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\r\n\r\nTo help ensure the process controls and/or hazards do not deviate significantly from the original design, this facility"
