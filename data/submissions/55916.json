              "Description": "URC utilizes a Process Safety Management (PSM) program which complies with Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulations.  The elements of this accidental release prevention program are described below:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Employee Participation                                                                                                           United encourages employees to participate in all facest of PSM and accident prevention.  Employee verify/evaluate procedures and assist in technical accuracy of Process Hazard Analyses (PHA).  Employees have access to all information developed and maintained as part of the accident prevention program.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Process Safety Information (PSI)                                                                                                                          United Refining maintains technical documents that are used for safe operation of each process.  These documents have been developed in conjunction with the PHA.  These documents contain information on hazards of chemicals and their properties, flow description, process chemistry, maximum intended inventories, operating parameters, consequences of deviations, and information on equipment data.  United's management of change for each process and periodic audits ensure accurate PSI.  PSI for each process is available to employees at the process site.  In addition to PSI and related technical documents, United ensures each process is operated within safe operating parameters by using process controls, monitorng instruments, trained personnel, and protective devices.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Process Hazard Analysis                                                                                                                  United's PHA is a comprehensive program to ensure hazards associated with each process are identified and controlled.  Each process has been studied to systematically identify potential hazardes and operability problems and ensure adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.  United uses the Hazard and Operabitlity (HAZOP) study technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP is a systematic and organized approach to evaluate processes using a team of individuals with pertinent expertise.  The team identifies potential hazards and operability problems within each process, as well as applicable safeguards for these hazards.  PHA findings and recommendations are assigned a ranking to ensure that attention is given to items demmed most significant by the HAZOP team, and resolution of items is tracked to completion.  United has completed all PHAS as well as several revalidations, which are completed once every five years or more frequently if signficant process changes occur.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Operating Procedures                                                                                                            United maintains written operating procedures which address various modes of operation for each process, and separate generalized procedures applicable to all processes.  Procedures are available in the control room where the process is located.  Procedures are periodically reviewed to ensure accuracy and completeness.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Training                                                                                                                   A new operator receives on the job training from an experienced operator or supervisor until such time as he/she is confident to take a three part qualification test.  In addition to new operator training, all operators receive refresher training on procedures and applicable job skills via supervisor instruction, quizzing, and group discussion sessions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Contractors                                                                                                             United utilizes contract employees to supplement is workforce in times of increased work acitvity and for specializing services.  United has implemented a pre-qualification system to determine if a contractor's safety record and programs are adequate to performe work in the refinery.  All contract employees are given safety orientation prior to plant entry to familiarize them with URC safety procedures.

      "SummaryText": "United Refining Company\nRisk Management Plan\nExecutive Summary\n\nI. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nUnited Refining Company (URC) has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is embodied in Company Policies and Procedures and demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and incorporating safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of processes.  URC policy is to implement controls to prevent accidental releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained personnel respond to control and contain the release in accordance with procedures in the Company's Off-site Response Plan; Facility Response Plan; Preparedness, Prevention, and Contingency Plan; Spill Prevention Response Plan; Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasures Plan; and Air Contingency Plan.  United coordinates emergency response with the Warren County Local Emergency Planning Committee and the Warren City Fire Department for mutual aid in responding to plant emergencies.\n\nII. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nUnited Refining Company, located in Warren, Pennsylvania, operates petroleum refinery processes to produce gasoline, distillate fuels, asphalt, sulfur, and liquefied petroleum gases (LPG) from crude oil.  Regulated substances handled at the site are flammable mixtures including pentanes and butanes.  None of the regulated toxic substances used, extracted, or processed at the refinery are held above their respective threshold quantities.\n\nIII. Hazard Assessment Results\n\nUnder EPA's risk management regulation one worst case scenario (WCS) and one alternative release scenario (ARS) are required to be assessed for regulated flammable substances.  WCS means the release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a vessel or process line failure that results in the greatest distance affected by the release.  This assessment is re"

      "SummaryText": "quired regardless of its likelihood.  EPA has also required companies to assess ARSs.  URC's Risk Management Plan (RMP) assessed an ARS and two WCSs for regulated flammables.  The refinery is a long, narrow facility and therefore a second WCS was required to incorporate all potentially effected offsite receptors.  URC utilized the EPA provided RMP*COMP to perform all release scenario analyses.\nOne WCS for regulated substances at the refinery is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) involving a release of flammable substances from Tank 431.  This tank contains a flammable mixture of pentanes, small quantities of butanes, and non-regulated substances.  An administrative limit of 35 feet is established as the maximum fill height for the tank.  In addition, the tank is in a 12,000 square foot containment area.  The WCS assumes the tank fails and fills the dike with the flammable liquid.  EPA's Risk Management Program Guidance for Offsite Consequence Analysis (April 1999) was used to determine an evaporation rate of 5,000 pounds per minute from the diked area.  For a WCS, this rate is assumed to occur for 10 minutes.  Consequently, 50,000 pounds of flammable liquid (as pentane) is assumed to release, completely vaporize, and ignite, resulting in a VCE.  EPA's computer model, RMP*Comp was used to determine that the maximum distance affected by this release is 0.3 miles.  Controls exist to prevent such a release and manage consequences making this scenario extremely unlikely, but no credit for active mitigation measures is permitted in evaluating this WCS according to EPA's regulations.\nA second WCS for regulated substances is a VCE involving a release of flammable substances from a butane storage tank.  An administrative limit of 85 percent full is established as the maximum fill height for the tank.  Taking this limit into account the maximum inventory of 137,000 pounds is assumed to release, completely vaporize, and ignite, resulting in a VCE.  The maximum distance affected by "

      "SummaryText": "this release is 0.4 miles.  Controls exist to prevent such a release and manage consequences making this scenario extremely unlikely, but no credit for active mitigation measures is permitted in evaluating this WCS according to EPA's regulations.\nOne ARS for flammable substances is a VCE resulting from a transfer line release of LPG occurring at a central location in the refinery.  This scenario is based on releasing 1460 pounds per minute for thirty minutes.  The anticipated time for operators to isolate the release is within thirty minutes.  The maximum distance affected by this release is 0.1 (one tenth) mile.  This event depicts a practical scenario for use in emergency planning and response.\n\nIV. General Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nURC utilizes a Process Safety Management (PSM) program which complies with Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulations.  The elements of this accidental release prevention program are described below:\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nUnited encourages employees to participate in all facets of PSM and accident prevention.  Employees verify/evaluate procedures and assist in technical accuracy of Process Hazard Analyses (PHA).  Employees have access to all information developed and maintained as part of the accident prevention program.\n\nProcess Safety Information (PSI)\n\nUnited Refining maintains technical documents that are used for safe operation of each process.  These documents have been developed in conjunction with the PHA.  The documents contain information on hazards of chemicals and their properties, flow description, process chemistry, maximum intended inventories, operating parameters, consequences of deviations, and information on equipment data.  United's management of change for each process and periodic audits ensure accurate PSI.  PSI for each process is available to employees at the process site.  In addition to PSI and related technical documents, United ensures each process is operated within sa"

Each process has been studied to systematically identify potential hazards and operability problems and ensure adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\nUnited uses the Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) study technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP is a systematic and organized approach to evaluate processes using a team of individuals with pertinent expertise.  The team identifies potential hazards and operability problems within each process, as well as applicable safeguards for these hazards.  PHA findings and recommendations are assigned a ranking to ensure that attention is given to items deemed most significant by the HAZOP team, and resolution of items is tracked to completion.\nUnited has completed all PHAs as well as several revalidations, which are completed once every five years or more frequently if significant process changes occur.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nUnited maintains written operating procedures which address various modes of operation for each process, and separate generalized procedures applicable to all processes.  Procedures are available in the control room where the process is located.  Procedures are periodically reviewed to ensure accuracy and completeness.\n\nTraining\n\nA new operator receives on the job training from an experienced operator or supervisor until such time as he/she is confident to take a three part qualification test.  In addition to new operator training, all operators receive refresher training on procedures and applicable job skills via supervisor instruction, quizzing, and group discussion sessions.\n\nContractors\n\nUnited utilizes contract employees to supplement its workforce in times of increased work activity and for specialized services.
