PPGAF also follows applicable Responsible Care (registered service trademark) Codes of Management Practices including the Community Awareness Code of Management Practices, and PPG's own Community Awareness and Emergency Response (CAER) Policy to assure emergency preparedness and foster community right-to-know. PPGAF also  trains Distribution Center employees in accident prevention, hazard communication, emergency response, safe material handling procedures and fork truck driving safety. All of these activities form an integral part of PPG's overall Environmental, Health and Safety Policy, whose main goal is to manufacturer, sell and distribute products worldwide in a manner that is safe and protective of our employes, neighbors, customers and other stakeholders and the environment.\n\nRegulated Substance Handled\n\nPPGAF Batavia Distribution Center  is a part of the PPG Architectural Finishes business unit. The Batavia DC stores paint, stain and related products and distributes them to independent dealers and home centers throughout the central United States. The DC stores products in various size containers, including aerosol spray cans. Some of the aerosols contain propane, butane, isobutane and methyl ether, which are used as propellants.  These four materials are regulated flammable substances under the EPA-RMP regulation, although propane is currently subject to a judicial stay. \n\nWorst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nEPA rules require that a worst case scenario be analyzed per the EPA guidelines. This would involve the highly unlikely ignition, and explosion of a vapor cloud formed by the release of the entire contents of the largest storage container. \n\nAn off-site consequence analysis was performed for"

      "SummaryText": "the largest quantity of propellant (i.e., - the regulated substances)  in the largest aerosol can stored at the facility. DNV Technica's PHAST software  was used to perform the analysis. The results of the analysis is 21 feet. Please note that this distance is reported as 0.01 miles in the RMP submittal due to limitations of EPA's RMP Sumit sofware. Based on EPA RMP criteria, the worst case release scenario does not have offsite impact.\n\nBecause the worst case scenario has no off site impact, no alternative release scenario analysis is required by the RMP regulation.\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of  aerosol  products at the Batavia DC  in the past five years, which resulted in  on-site or off-site impacts as defined by EPA's RMP criteria.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe RMP regulation specifies that covered processes at all facilities  must be classified as Program Level 1, 2 or 3 processes. The PPGAF Batavia DC aerosol storage process is classified as a Program Level 1 process because the Worst-Case Scenario has no off-site impact and because there were no accidental releases in the past five years that meet RMP criteria. Submission of specific prevention program information for Program Level 1 processes is not required by RMP. \n\nEmergency Response Procedures\n\nPPGAF coordinates emergency response activities with the local fire department. \n\nAdditional Information\n \nFor additional information, contact Mr. Ron Kosinski at (630) 406-1684."
