Huntsman Port Neches Tank Farm is committed to achieving excellence in environmental, health and safety.  The Huntsman Port Neches Tank Farm implements a series of steps to prevent potential hazards associated with the facility and assures a well-trained work force.   The program further implements its policies with onsite procedures and manuals.  Huntsman Port Neches Tank Farm participates with the Jefferson County Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC), Port Neches Fire Department and the Sabine Neches Chiefs Association to develop emergency response plans and participates in cooperative training with these agencies. Huntsman participates in the Responsible Care. initiative at the Chemical Manufacturer's Association and are committed to the responsible management of chemicals. The Plant Manager of the A&O Plant is responsible for implementation of the risk management program (RMP) for the Huntsman Port Neches Tank Farm.\n\n2.\tRegulated Substances. The Port Neches Tank Farm consists of five (5) storage tanks owned by Huntsman, but operated by and on property leased from MOTIVA ENTERPRISES LLC (MOTIVA) and is located in Port Neches, Texas.   The site stores naphtha unloaded from barges or ships and is used as feedstock for Huntsman's A&O Plant in Port Arthur.\n\nThe sixteen (16) flammable regulated substances are:\n\n7 Propane - Raw material recycled to manufacture propylene and ethylene and is an ingredient in natural gas.\n7 2-Methyl Propene, Butane, 1-Butene, 1,3-Butadiene, 2-Butene cis and trans - Products used as raw materials in the manufacture of synthetic rubber for tires, and butyl rubber for films, coatings and carpet.\n7 Isopentane, Isoprene, 1-Pentene, 1,3 Pentadiene, 2-Pentene (E) and (Z), 2-Methyl-1-butene, 3-methyl-1-butene, Pentane - Raw and recycled materials used as feed stocks for the manufacture of ethylene and propyl"

This OCA includes the development of worst and alternative release scenarios for the release of toxic and flammable substances.  At this facility, there exists no toxics.  The OCA allows for the consideration of administrative controls in estimating potential scenario impacts.  EPA's computer program, RMP Comp, Ver. 1.06, was used to model the release scenarios\n\nFlammable Release Scenarios  \n\t\n\tThe Flammable Worst Case Scenario is based on EPA required assumption and is highly unlikely and has never occurred at this facility.\n\nThe flammable worst case scenario involves the complete failure of a storage tank containing a hydrocarbon mixture.  The volume of RMP chemicals in the tank is assumed to vaporize, ignite, and result in a vapor cloud explosion.   A rigorous inspection program complying with industry codes and standards, effective operator and maintenance training using procedures consistent with safe operation, and adherence to the Process Safety Management reduce the risk of releasing the entire contents of these tanks. \n\nOverfilling the tank has been considered and safeguards implemented to reduce the chance of this scenario.  The administrative control for the tank is the maximum fill level which is maintained by procedures and level alarms at below 95% full and gives approximately a 2-hour response time.  The storage tank has redundant and independent level alarms and procedures in response to these alarms. The tanks are diked to contain a spill or leak. The representative flammable alternative release scenario is naphtha leaking from a 3/4 drain resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  This scenario has a potential offsite impact.\n\t\n4.

This includes information pertaining to: \n7 Hazards of regulated substances:  For each regulated substance, there is a Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) which discusses the physical properties of the chemicals, exposure hazards, the required personal protective equipment and the appropriate first aid and emergency treatment for exposure.\n7 The technology of the process:  Includes a discussion of process chemistry, safe upper and lower limits of temperature and pressure and analysis of consequences of deviation.\n7 Equipment in the process:  Includes such information as materials of construction, diagrams of the piping and instrumentation, safety systems and design codes.\n\n7 Process Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n \t\tMOTIVA has performed initial process hazard analysis (PHA) with review and participation from Huntsman to identify the potential hazards, the adequacy of the engineering and administrative controls and the ways to minimize those hazards.  The A&O Plant utilizes the HAZOP methodology, a recognized and generally accepted method for identifying and evaluating hazards in the process.  The A&O Plant assigns employees to the HAZOP team who are knowledgeable in the HAZOP methodology and the specific process.  The HAZOP team develops recommendations to reduce the potential hazards which, if approved, are implemented within a reasonable period of time.  Hurricanes and inclement weather are not investigated in the PHAs; however, Huntsman does have a Hurricane Procedure and implements this proc"

The procedures address steps for all operating phases, safety systems, control measures and precautions to prevent exposures to process hazards.  The procedures are reviewed and revised periodically to ensure their accuracy and completeness.\n \n7 Training\n \t\tMOTIVA provides initial training as well as refresher training to employees to assure that the required level of skills and knowledge are maintained.  The training emphasizes safety and health hazards, emergency operations, and safe work practices.  All operators receive periodic refresher training.  \n \n7 Mechanical Integrity\n \t\tHuntsman has developed written procedures for maintaining the operating components of the process (including pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown system controls, and pumps) through the mechanical integrity program.  The program is comprised of well-trained personnel who follow maintenance, testing and inspection procedures that ensure proper function of process equipment.\n \n7 Management of Change\n \t\tHuntsman has established and implemented written procedures to manage changes to process chemicals, technology, equipment, procedures, and any changes to the facility that affect a covered process.  The procedures assure that, prior to any change, the following issues are considered:  the technical basis for the proposed change, its impact on safety and health, any  modification to operating procedures, the necessary time period for the change, and any authorization requirements.  Employees involved in operating a process, as well as maintenance and contract employees whose job will be affected, are informed of and trained in the change.  If necessary, the p"

The pre-startup safety review confirms, prior to the introduction of highly hazardous chemicals, that construction and equipment is in accordance with design specifications; safety, operating, maintenance and emergency procedures are in place; and training of employees affected by modifications is complete.\n \n7 Compliance Audit\n \t\tHuntsman and MOTIVA performs audits of its compliance with the provisions of its Process Safety Management Program.  Teams comprised of employees, with appropriate knowledge of audit techniques, process safety and operating experience, conduct audits every three years to verify that the procedures and practices developed are adequate and being followed.  The findings of the audit team are reviewed and appropriate corrective actions are implemented and tracked until resolved.  \n \n7 Incident Investigation\n \t\tHuntsman and MOTIVA investigates any incidents that resulted in, or could reasonably have resulted in, a catastrophic release of covered chemicals.  The investigation is promptly conducted, commencing within 48 hours of any incident.  To perform the investigation, Huntsman and MOTIVA has established an incident investigation team consisting of persons with the appropriate knowledge and experience to thoroughly investigate and analyze the incident.  A report is prepared at the conclusion of the incident investigation that addresses the incident, the factors that contributed to it, and recommendations resulting from the incident investigation.  Huntsman and MOTIVA has established a system to promptly address and resolve the incident report findi"
