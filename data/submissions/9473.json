Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA)  \nThe RMP Rule requires that offsite consequence analysis (OCA) be performed to estimate the potential for an accidental release of a regulated substance to affect the public or the environment.  This OCA includes the development of worst and alternative release scenarios for the release of toxic and flammable substances.  At this facility, there exists no toxics.  The OCA allows for the consideration of administrative controls in estimating potential scenario impacts.  EPA's computer program, RMP Comp, Ver. 1.06, was used to model the release scenarios\n\nFlammable Release Scenarios  \n    \n    The Flammable Worst Case Scenario is based on EPA required assumption and is highly unlikely and has never occurred at this facility.\n\nThe flammable worst case scenario involves the complete failure of a storage tank containing a hydrocarbon mixture.  The volume of RMP chemicals in the tank is assumed to vaporize, ignite, and result in a vapor cloud explosion.   A rigorous inspection program complying with industry codes and standards, effective operator and maintenance training using procedures consistent with safe operation, and adherence to the Process Safety Management reduce the risk of releasing the entire contents of these tanks. \n\nOverfilling the tank has been considered and safeguards implemented to reduce the chance of this scenario.  The administrative control for the tank is the maximum fill level which is maintained by procedures and level alarms at below 95% full and gives approximately a 2-hour response time.  The storage tank has redundant and independent level alarms and procedures in response to these alarms. The tanks are diked to contain a spill or leak. The representative flammable alternative release scenario is naphtha leaking from a 3/4\" drain resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  This scenario has a potential offsite impact.\n    \n4.

Following is a brief summary of the elements that Huntsman's A&O Plant has implemented to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements outlined by EPA as well as with the Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.\n \n7 Process Safety Information\n         Huntsman and MOTIVA maintain a compilation of current and accurate written safety information to identify and understand the hazards of the process.  This includes information pertaining to: \n7 Hazards of regulated substances:  For each regulated substance, there is a Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) which discusses the physical properties of the chemicals, exposure hazards, the required personal protective equipment and the appropriate first aid and emergency treatment for exposure.\n7 The technology of the process:  Includes a discussion of process chemistry, safe upper and lower limits of temperature and pressure and analysis of consequences of deviation.\n7 Equipment in the process:  Includes such information as materials of construction, diagrams of the piping and instrumentation, safety systems and design codes.\n\n7 Process Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n         MOTIVA has performed initial process hazard analysis (PHA) with review and participation from Huntsman to identify the potential hazards, the adequacy of the engineering and administrative controls and the ways to minimize those hazards.  The A&O Plant utilizes the HAZOP methodology, a recognized and generally accepted method for identifying and evaluating hazards in the process.  The A&O Plant assigns employees to the HAZOP team who are knowledgeable in the HAZOP methodology and the specific process.  The HAZOP team develops recommendations to reduce the potential hazards which, if approved, are implemented within a reasonable period of time.  Hurricanes and inclement weather are not investigated in the PHAs; however, Huntsman does have a Hurricane Procedure and implements this proc"
