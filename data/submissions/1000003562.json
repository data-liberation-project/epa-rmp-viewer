      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nAccidental Release Prevention And Emergency Response Policies \n\nAt the Martin Underground Storage, Inc. facility, we handle substances considered hazardous by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  It is necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling these substances to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and state rules and regulations.  Safety depends on the manner in which we handle these substances, the safety devices inherent in the design of the facility, the safe handling procedures that we use, and the training of our personnel.\n\nWe at Martin Underground Storage, Inc. are strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Arcadia Fire Department, and other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment. \n\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program And The Specific Prevention Steps\n\nMartin Underground Storage, Inc. complies with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)'s Process Safety Management (PSM) rules, EPA\u00c2\u00bfs Chemical Accident Prevention Risk Management Plan (RMP) rules, and with all applicable state codes and regulations.  Our facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements under 40 CFR 68.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of th"

The entire contents of the tank are assumed to release as a vapor cloud, which finds an ignintion source.  Ten percent of the released quantity is assumed to participate in the resulting explosion.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario would result in a release of 297,122 pounds of iso-butane from a 60,000 gallon storage tank.  To evaluate the worst-case release scenario, we have utilized the EPA recommended software call RMP*Comp.  Based on 297,122 pounds of iso-butane released, the distance the affects of a vapor cloud explosion is expected to have no serious harm to the general public 0.5 miles from the location of the tank.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario for propane would result in a release of 145,709 pounds of propane from a 30,000 gallon storage tank.  To evaluate the worst-case release scenario, we have utilized the EPA recommended software call RMP*Comp.  Based on 145,709 pounds of propane released, the distance the affects of a vapor cloud explosion is expected to have no serious harm to the general public 0.4 miles from the location of the tank.\n\nThe alternative release scenario deemed most likely to occur is the failure of a flexible transfer hose while transferring iso-butane or propane from a truck transport to a temporary storage tank.  The flexible hose has a nominal diameter of 2-inches.  Excess flow valves at the truck transport function to stop the flow of iso-butane or propane out of the truck transport.  RMP*Comp was used to calculate the release rate of iso-butane through a 2-inch opening as 29,712 pounds/minute, and the release rate of propane through a 2-inch opening as 14,571 pounds/minute.  Each scenario was modeled using a release duration of 1 minute.  RMP*Comp calculated"

Process operators, maintenance personnel, or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\n\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at Martin Underground Storage, Inc.  The reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating, and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operations.\n\nCompliance Audit\n\nOur personnel conduct audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  These audits are carried out at least every three years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nMartin Underground Storage, Inc. promptly investigates any incident that resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of our hazardous substances.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All investigation reports are retained for a minimum of five years.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nIt is our belief at Martin Underground Storage, Inc., that process safety management and accident prevention are a team effort.  Our company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.\n\nContractors\n\nOccasionally, Martin Underground Storage, Inc. hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance or construction activities.

Contractors are also informed of emergency response procedures should an accidental release of our hazardous substances occur.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nThe facility has an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last five years.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies, there has been no accidental release of the hazardous substances during this period that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage onsite, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nMartin Underground Storage, Inc. has a written emergency action plan, in accordance with the PSM rules.
