      "SummaryText": "in the process of performing an annual preventative maintenance on a compressor, when saturated ammonia gas (liquid / gas combination) leaked from an area of the unit that had already been pumped down. The facility determined that the release came from the manhole area of the compressor oil separator where the bolts had been removed in order to begin service on the coalescing filters. It was determined that the release occurred after the technician missed a step in the SOP that would have had him address a check valve.  Re-training on the maintenance procedures was conducted to ensure that maintenance department personnel were aware of the safe and proper steps.\n\n5. Emergency Response Plan\n\nDanone North America maintains an Emergency Action Plan in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38.  In the event of a release requiring evacuation of the building, local emergency response agencies will be contact to assist with rescue, firefighting, first-aid, medical treatment, and other response functions.  The facility has an emergency action plans in place to address evacuation procedures and responding agency contact information.  As needed and in a timely manner, the plan is updated as necessary.\n\nThe Dallas County LEPC is the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) with which our emergency action plans have been coordinated and verified. The Dallas Fire Department is the primary emergency response agency for all facility emergencies, including ammonia releases.\n\n6. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe facility has implemented the components of the Program Level 3 RMP and associated PSM program, which has resulted in improved safety at our facility. Some of these components include ammonia refrigeration system safety training, employee training, management of change policy & procedure, standard and emergency operation procedures, incident investigation policy and procedures, RMP compliance audits, etc.  \n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA) studies and Three-Year Compl"

All reports are retained for a minimum of five (5) years.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nDanone North America believes that Process Safety Management (PSM) and accident prevention is a team effort. Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements. In addition, our employees have access to all information related to PSM and RMP implementation, including Process Hazard Analyses (PHA) information.\n\nContractors\n\nOn occasion, our company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and/or construction activities related to the ammonia refrigeration system. Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out. Danone North America has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related to the contractor's work with the ammonia systems. Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of ammonia occur.\n\n4. Five-year Accident History\n\nThe RMP regulation defines an RMP Accident as the following:\n\nThe release must be from a covered process and involve a regulated substance held above its threshold quantity in the process.\n\nThe release must have caused at least one of the following:\n\n\u00bf\tOn-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage (\u00a768.42(a)); or\n\u00bf\tKnown offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place (\u00a768.42(a)).\n\nBased on the above definition and an investigation into the facility's accident history, there have been no significant releases of ammonia that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 100 pounds in the last five years (November 2011 - November 2016) for the Five-Year Accident History at the facility.\n\nHowever, a near-miss occurred on April 12, 2016.

Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nDanone North America became the legal owner of the property in 2017.  Prior to that date the property was previously owned and operated by WhiteWave Foods for the production of dairy products.  Since the purchase of the property, Danone North America has completely renovated the building and its anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system.  This RMP submittal represents our first submission based on the 5 year renewal requirements. \n\nDanone North America is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent to our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operation procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with our regulated ammonia refrigeration system. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If such a release does occur, we are completely coordinated with the Dallas Fire Department and the Dallas County LEPC for emergency response support.\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThis facility is primarily used for the production and storage of plant and dairy based products.  The only RMP regulated substance present at our facility is ammonia, utilized as the primary cooling media in our closed-loop refrigeration system. Refrigeration is a critical part of our business, providing cold storage capabilities for products per Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations.  The new ammonia system contains approximately 75,000 pounds of ammonia between two separate systems onsite.\n\nDue to the  and characteristics of our ammonia system, as well as Process Safety Management (PSM) applicability, this facility is covered under Program 3 of the"
