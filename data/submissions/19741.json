The same properties that make Propylene Oxide valuable as a commodity also makes it necessary to observe certain safety perecautions in handling Propylene Oxide to prevent unnecessary human exposure, and to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as that of our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community. It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State rules and regulations. Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle Propylene Oxide, the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility, the handling procedures that we use, and the training of our personnel.\n\nOur emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of the local fire authority and notification of any potentially affected neighbors.\n\n\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Sandled.\n\nWe use tapioca as a raw material, which is treated with chemicals including propylene oxide to manufacture modified starches. Propylene Oxide is delivered by truck, to our plant in Department of Transportation approved ISO-tankers and used in the process. Once connected, the Propylene Oxide is kept under a nitrogen blanket to reduce the risk of fire. Only authorized plant employees, management personnel and contractors are allowed access to the plant. The total inventory of Propylene Oxide stored at this plant is 85,000 lbs.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario and the alternate release scenario include administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario.\n\nWorst-case Scenario: An instantaneous failure of a storage tanker causing the release of the entire contents of Propylene Oxide into the containment area within a ten-minute period. The distance to the endpoint of 0.59 mg/L (248 ppm) is 643 feet from the storage. The effected di"

The distance to the endpoint has the potential to extend past our plant's boundary.\n\n\nAccidental Release and Prevention:\n\nNational starch and Chemical Company, Island Falls complies wjth the environmental Protection Agency's Accidental Releas Prevention Rule and with all applicable State codes and regulations.\n\n\nFive-year Accident History:\n\nThere has been no accidental release of Propylene Oxide at this facility.\n\nEmergency Response Program:\n\nWe have discussed our program with the local volunteer fire department and the Local Emergency Planning Committee.\n\n\nPlans for Improved Safety:\n\nSince the introduction of Propylene Oxide to the Island Falls Facility in 1987, NSCC has continued to properly handle this chemical. Island Falls conducts audits of the process and implements applicable handling recommendations in accordance to our supplier and Responsible Care guidlines. General inspections, refresher training, emergency response drills and employee awareness are just a few of the ways we continue to protect our empoyees and commuinity."
