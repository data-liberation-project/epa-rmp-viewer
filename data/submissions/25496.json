Facility Policy.\n\nThe owner, Cargill Fertilizer, Inc., is committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of aqueous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the people and the environment. \n    \n    2.    Facility Information.\n\nAqua ammonia is stored at this facility for use in the formulation of various fertilizers.  Aqua ammonia serves as a Nitrogen source and a neutralization product when it is mixed with phosphoric acid and potassium hydroxide (KOH).  Aqua ammonia is stored in one 21,328 gallon storage tank.  The maximum quantity stored would be 100,000 lbs.\n\n\n3.    Worst-Case Scenario and Alternate Release Scenario\n\na.    The worst-case scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as liquid over a period of 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 100,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the end point (point of dispersion to 200 parts per million, or ppm) is 0.52 miles.  \n\nb.    The alternate release scenario does not need to be explored, since the worst-case scenario doesn't effect any residential areas.  \n\n4.    Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe facility has been reviewed for general compliance with the provisions of the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia\". \n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.    Five-Year Accident History.        \n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that: have caused any deaths, injuries or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in off-sit"

Emergency Response Program.\n\n    The facility has:\n\n    a.    a written action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\nb.    provided state and local authorities with the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA);\n\n    c.    a written emergency response program, in accordance with OSHA standard \n29 CFR 1910.120, including pre-emergency planning and employee training.\n\n7.    Planned Changes to Improve Safety.\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  \n\n    There are no additional specific safety recommendations regarding storage or use of aqua ammonia for implementation at this time."
