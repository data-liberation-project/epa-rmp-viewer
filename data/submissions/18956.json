Anhydrous ammonia (NH3) is a gas at ambient \nconditions.  The ammonia refrigeration system is used to control the \nprocessing and room temperature for plasma-derived and related \nproducts.  It is a closed system that contains approximately 80,000 pounds \n(i.e., 15,123 gallons) of ammonia in various physical states (gas, liquid, and \nsaturated vapor).  The vessels, which can contain the largest volume of \nammonia, are the dual high-pressure (HP) receivers.  The HP receivers are \nconsidered one vessel since they are interconnected and equalized such \nthat liquid and vapor is equally distributed between them.  The vessels \noperate at approximately 150 to 180 pounds per square inch gauge (psig) \nand can contain as much as 29,624 pounds of liquid ammonia.  However, \nduring typical operation, the vessel holds only about 10,000 pounds.  Most \nof the ammonia equipment is located indoors.  The HP receivers, \ncondensing towers, some chillers, and most piping runs are located \noutdoors.\n\nAmmonia is the oldest and most common refrigerant in general industrial \nuse throughout the world.  It is a high capacity refrigerant that operates at \nreasonable pressure.  At this facility, personnel exposure to more than a \nsmall leak is rare because ammonia operates within a closed system of \nvessels, piping, and equipment and its self-alarming properties allow for \nimmediate detection and response.\n\n1.2    PROCESS DESCRIPTION\nCenteon's ammonia refrigeration system is a two-stage system consisting"

The Building No. 4 \nchillers operate on the low side (i.e., low pressure) to quickly chill alcohol \nor cool room air.  Ammonia suction from the Building No. 4 equipment at \nabout -10 psig passes through the low side accumulator before entering \nthe low-back compressors.  Liquid ammonia in the low side suction is \ntrapped in the low side accumulator and returned to the high side \naccumulator.  The booster compressor discharge is desuperheated in the \nhigh side accumulator before entering the high side compressors.\nThe high side compressor suction draws from the high side suction \naccumulator at about 20 psig.  This accumulator receives suction from \nvarious chiller units.  Excess ammonia liquid that collects in the high side \naccumulator is removed and returned to the system.\n\nThe major discharge from the high side compressors (hot gas), at 150 to \n175 psig, is vented to four condensing towers.\n\nThe condensed liquid is returned to the HP receivers where it is fed to the \nlow and high side equipment, including the chillers and room coolers.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is well protected by the existence of \nspecific safety systems and hardware, including safety relief valves, \nengine room ventilation, and system safety interlocks.  Safety relief valves \nprotect the HP receivers, compressor discharge, condensers, suction \naccumulators, oil pots, and pump-out system from the hazards associated \nwith overpressure.  Safety interlocks include HP and high temperature \nalarms and cutouts for the compressors, as well as high level floats and \nsensors for vessels.\n\n2.0    POTENTIAL RELEASE SCENARIOS\nCenteon's refrigeration system is a totally closed system.

This \nendpoint represents the maximum airborne concentration below which \nnearly all individuals could be exposed for up to 1 hour without \nexperiencing or developing irreversible effects or symptoms that could \naffect their ability to take protective action.\n\nThe release scenarios analyzed are based upon the guidance contained in \nthe USEPA's Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration \n(the \"Model Plan\"), dated November 1998.  This guidance document used \nthe SACRUNCH atmospheric dispersion model to construct \"lookup\" \ntables that relate the quantity and rate of ammonia released to the \nendpoint distance.\n\n2.1    WORST-CASE RELEASE\nThe worst-case release is considered to be defined (according to the RMP \nRule) by the catastrophic rupture and complete loss of the maximum \ncontents of the HP receivers (approximately 29,624 pounds of ammonia) \nover a 10-minute period.  Using the specified worst-case meteorology \ncontained in the Model Plan, the distance to the endpoint for a worst-case \nrelease was estimated to be 10,507 feet or 1.99 miles.\n\nAlthough the worst-case consequence analysis is required by the RMP, it \nshould be considered a highly unlikely event.  Design, construction, and \noperation of the HP receivers is such that worst-case failure is extremely \nremote.  The receivers were designed and constructed in accordance with \nthe American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Boiler and Pressure \nVessel Code (Section VIII), and were certified and stamped by the National \nBoard of Pressure Vessel Inspectors (National Board).

Such pressures could not be generated internally.  The only logical \nexternal cause of HP would be flame impingement or surface heat from a \nhigh challenge fire adjacent to the vessels.  If this were to occur, the vessels \nare equipped with safety relief valves (SRVs) set to relieve internal \npressure at 250 psig.  A HP excursion would not occur as long as the SRVs \ncontinued to function.  Actuation of the SRVs would result in an ammonia \nrelease similar to that described in Section 2.2 for the alternative-release \nscenario.  The SRVs are on a 5-year replacement schedule, in compliance \nwith the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidance \ncontained in IIAR Bulletin Number 109, Minimum Safety Criteria for a Safe \nAmmonia Refrigeration System, in an effort to ensure that they will function \nproperly when required.\n\nFurthermore, inadvertent vehicular contact with the vessel is unlikely \nsince the unit is protected with substantial barrier protection designed to \npreclude this occurrence.
