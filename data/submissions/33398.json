      "SummaryText": "Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n     At the Fruita facility, Fruita Consumers Cooperative, stores anhydrous ammonia which is considered a regulated toxic substance by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  The properties that make anhydrous ammonia a valuable fertilizer source also makes it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling it.  It is the policy of the Cooperative and it's employees to adhere to all of the Federal and state rules and regulations, so as to prevent unnecessary human exposure and to reduce the threat to the community.  Safety depends upon the competent training of our personnel, the manner in which we handle anhydrous ammonia and the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility.\n     \nThe stationary source and regulated substance handled:\n     The primary purpose of this facility is to repackage and distribute anhydrous ammonia to our customers as a nitrogen source, with it's primary use being for crop land fertilization.  Anhydrous ammonia is received by truck (transports) and is stored in two (2) storage tanks.  Anhydrous ammonia is distributed from this facility by nurse tanks.  The facility has the necessary equipment to safely load and unload transports, railcars and nurse tanks.\n     Access to the tank controls and hoses are restricted to authorized employees and management personnel, along with authorized contractors that may work on the facility.\n     The only regulated substance handled at this facility is anhydrous ammonia.  The maximum amount stored at the site is 62,050 gallons or 362,993 pounds.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program:\n     This facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule, with OSHA's requirements and with other applicable Federal and state codes, standards and regulations.  The facility design and construction is in accordance with the ANSI K 61.1 and the OSHA 1910.111 standards.  It is formally inspected a minimum of on"

Corrective and routine maintenance is performed at the facility to maintain compliance with the appropriate standards.  Employees of the crop production department at the cooperative receive training to meet Federal and state requirements to handle hazardous materials along with additional training using industry training programs and schools.\n\nFive-year accident history:\n     This site has not experienced a reportable accidental release of anhydrous ammonia in the five years prior to the date of submitting this report.\n\nThe emergency response program:\n     This facility relies on the local emergency response unit and does not have it's own emergency response program.  However, employees are familiar with the North American Emergency Response Guidebook, and the local fire department is familiar with the plant.  \n\nPlanned changes to improve safety:\n     This facility utilizes the ANSI and OSHA standards as guidelines for the safe storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.  At this time there are no further plans to modify or change the facility."
