The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to plant facilities or to the chlorine storage and feed process, or when improvement benefits are recognized. Affected personnel are informed about, and trained on, the changes.\n\nThe overall emergency response program for the plant is coordinated with the KPEPC - the local emergency planning committee (LEPC) having jurisdiction in Kanawha and Putnam Counties - and with Kanawha County and City of Charleston, West Virginia, emergency management officials. This coordination includes periodic meetings of the KPEPC, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives. We have around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate emergency response organizations (e.g., contracted chlorine emergency response [HAZMAT] teams, local fire department, police department). This provides a means for notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident. In addition to participating in periodic KPEPC meetings, we conduct periodic walk-around orientation tours of the plant facilities with key representatives of local emergency response organizations. During such tours we discuss and review the source of chlorine at our site, the hazards of a chlorine release, release mitigation features, and emergency response actions involving the chlorine system. Thus, our emergency response plan is fully coordinated with the community emergency response plan.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nAt the West Virginia-American Water Company Kanawha Valley Treatment Plant we constantly strive to improve the safety of our operations through periodic safety reviews, our incident investigation program, and a program for soliciting safety suggestions from our facility workers.

During the past 5 years we have not had any releases involving chlorine from the RMP-covered process that had any reportable onsite or offsite effects. Our facility has instituted procedures that require formal investigation of incidents involving chemical releases, regardless of chemical identity or listing by the EPA RMP rule. For each incident, we conduct formal incident investigations to identify and correct the root causes of the events.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe West Virginia-American Water Company's Kanawha Valley Treatment Plant maintains an integrated contingency plan, which consolidates all of the various federal, state, and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning.  Our program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, contractors, the public, and the environment during emergency situations. The program consists of procedures for responding to a chlorine release. The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including (1) proper first aid and emergency medical treatment for human exposures, (2) facility evacuation plans and accounting for facility personnel after an evacuation, (3) notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and (4) post-incident follow-up requirements. Procedures are in place governing the establishment of the plant's Emergency Operation Center where management personnel can direct and control emergency operations on an as-needed basis.\n\nIn addition, we have procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment.

A break in a pigtail connecting one of the containers to the piping manifold will permit both connected containers to vent their respective contents (about 2000 lbs each) through the open ends of the severed pigtail. Credit is taken in accordance with EPA's simplified approach for the partial containment of chlorine vapor by the room/building enclosure, which mitigates the release. Such building confinement reduces the release rate of chlorine vapor directly to the outdoors. Since this facility is located in a populated area, the toxic cloud formed by the evaporating chlorine would reach offsite end points and nearby public receptors.\n\nAs in the WCS, we have taken a very conservative approach to determining the ARS end-point distance offsite. Therefore, in determining the ARS end-point distance we have not taken credit for active mitigation provided by engineered safeguards that include chlorine monitors/detectors that automatically activate a specially designed chlorine removal and neutralization (scrubber) system. This works in tandem to (1) safely remove chlorine vapor that may be released to the chlorine storage room and (2) neutralize the chlorine before much of it can escape from the room to the outdoors. The chlorine leak detection system is calibrated to initiate alarms at very low concentrations of chlorine (i.e., lower than industry recommended settings).

Our RMP-regulated chlorine process is also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM) standard. We have extended the PSM program at this facility, where necessary, to satisfy EPA's Program Level 3 accident prevention program requirements.

Additionally, we adhere to chlorine industry (i.e., the Chlorine Institute) and American Water Works Association guidance and recommended practices for PSM and RMP programs, including facility and chlorine system design and safety practices.  \n\nOur accidental release prevention programs and our contingency planning efforts help us effectively manage the hazards that are posed to our employees, contractors, the public, and the environment by our use of chlorine in treating drinking-quality water.

The paragraphs below briefly describe the scenarios we have included in our risk management plan (RMPlan), including information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures we have put in place to limit the exposure distances for each scenario.\n\t\nWorst-case Release Scenario for Chlorine\n\nThe worst-case scenario at our water treatment facility involves a failure of a ton container holding approximately 2000 lbs of liquefied chlorine gas under pressure, resulting in release and vaporization of the entire contents of the container. In this scenario, the chlorine is released as a vaporizing liquid inside a completely enclosed chlorine storage room in our water treatment building. The containment provided by the building mitigates the release. Such building confinement reduces the release rate of chlorine vapor directly to the outdoors. Since this facility is located in a populated area, the toxic cloud formed by the evaporating chlorine would reach offsite end points and nearby public receptors.\n\nA sump tank is provided with floor drains under the storage room floor to collect and contain portions of a liquid release that do not immediately vaporize. In reality, the sump could serve to reduce the vaporization rate of chlorine to the storage room air, and likewise reduce the rate at which chlorine gas is released from the room directly to the outside air. However, because we based our analysis on a very conservative approach, we did not take credit for the sump tank as a form of mitigation in reducing the end-point distance reached offsite.  \n\nNumerous administrative controls are in place to prevent a release of this type and, should one occur, to provide for effective emergency response.

The container storage room can hold up to 26 ton containers. Two containers are connected to the same feed piping manifold at a time. An alternate supply arrangement consists of two additional ton containers connected to a parallel, but normally isolated, feed piping manifold. Chlorine is stored as a liquefied gas under pressure, fed as a liquid to chlorine evaporators, and injected as a vapor at the outlet of the chlorinators into the water stream. The chlorine process is classified as a Program Level 3 process, and we implement a complete accident prevention program.      \n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis\n\nWe performed an offsite consequence analysis to estimate the potential for an accidental release of chlorine from our facility as a regulated toxic substance that could affect the public or the environment. The offsite consequence analysis consisted of evaluating both a worst-case scenario (WCS) and an alternative release scenario (ARS) following identification of the appropriate ARS. We do not expect a worst-case release scenario to ever occur. An ARS represents a release that might occur during the lifetime of a facility similar to our water treatment plant. ARSs can be used to help the Kanawha Putnam (local) Emergency Planning Committee (KPEPC) improve and prepare an effective community emergency response plan.\n\nWe have submitted release scenario analyses to EPA and have shared that information with KPEPC and other organizations involved in emergency response activities.
