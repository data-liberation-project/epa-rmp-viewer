Yearly training on all phases of safety pertaining to chlorine gas.This will include using the chlorine \"B\" kit, utilizing the self contained breathing apparatus (SCBA), and safe handling procedures of the chlorine ton cylinders.\n2. Cross training with area rural fire departments, the City of Mena Fire Department, and law enforcement departments.The cross training is for the education of these departments which will be utilized for the evacuation and isolation of possible contaminated areas within the evacuation area.\n3. Working with the City of Mena Fire Department, which has a first responder team and has had training in hazardous chemicals.This team will assist the Mena Water Department in the event of a hazardous chemical leakage. They will not be responsible for the containment or elimination of the leakage.\n4. Creating a first responder team consisting of personnel from the Mena Water Department.This team will be responsible for the containment and elimination of the chlorine leak.\n5. Attending any safety meetings that may be presented.For example, State meetings, District Meetings,Arkansas Rural Water Association Meetings, and American Water Works Association Teleconferences and other related training events which may confront the safety concerns and issues of chlorine gas leakage.\nYOUR FACILITY AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED.\nThe Irons Fork Water Facility is the potable water treatment facility for the City of Mena Arkansas, and Rural Water Associations which are connected to "

These chemicals include only one chemical that would impose immediate health threats if leakage occurred. This chemical is chlorine gas, liquified by pressure.Chlorine gas is stored at the treatment facility in two thousand pound (ton) cylinders.This chlorine gas is compressed by pressure to form a liquid; the bottom section of the cylinder is liquid, while the top section is gas. It is the top section (gas) which injects chlorine into our water treatment process, pressure is lowered within the cylinder. This allows more of the liquid chlorine to be \"decompressed into chlorine gas\", which then can be fed into the treatment process by our chlorine feeders.The maximum qauntity of chlorine of one ton is connected to the chlorine feeder, while the other two are used for storage until needed.\nTHE WORST CASE SCENARIO(S) AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO(S)\nA worst case scenario and a general accidental release of chlorine will be treated the same way. It is not known if it will be a worst case scenario until the feed valve on the cylinder is completely closed.If the valve is completely closed and leakage still occurs, the operator will then decide if the leak is large enough to initiate the worst case evacuation plan, or if it will be an alternative release with only the alternative evacuation release area being evacuated.As soon as this determination is made, the operator will evacuate the site and call 911 from a neighborhood residential house and notify operators of a chlorine leakage and either worst case or alternative release. This will allow those responsible for evacuation to t"

The 911 operator would then dispatch the first responder team and notify the rural fire departments, the Mena Fire Department, and Local Law Enforcement Offices in order to begin evacuations. 911 would then notify the chlorine institute (Chemtrek), who will then notify Curtis Thomas of Harcross Chemical ( Chlorine Response Leader ). The Mena Water Department will notify Curtis Thomas as well, as soon as 911 has been notified. Only trained personnel, who are equipped with self contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) should investigate or work to contain or eliminate any leakage that may occur; all other persons should be kept away from the contaminated area. Any leakage from the feeding system can be easily remedied by closing the feed valve on the ton cylinder and isolating the leak to a minimal incident.Yearly maintenance will replace any old or worn feed tubing and will replace parts on the chlorine injector which will wear out or dry rot which could produce the possibility of leakage.Daily inspection of ton chlorine cylinders and testing feed valves for any possible signs of leakage will be a priority of daily duty requirements.This will allow action to be taken before the leak would become a major risk factor.The Mena Water and Sewer Department will be working closely w"
