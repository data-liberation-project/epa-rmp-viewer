              "Description": "The prevention program begins with the design of the systems.  Both the chlorine and sulfur dioxide systems have redundant or backup systems.  In actuality, there is only one way to handle a leak of either system.  That is to shut off and isolate the system and fix the leak.  So this is the way we handle any possible leak.  In additon, the systems are inspected annually for possible weakness.  This was done in 2003 and will be done every three years.  SOP's are in existence for each operation that is required.  These SOP's are reviewed and updated every year. A work order system is in place that notifies us of the items to be checked annually and updated.",

This plant was put on line 1988 to replace five old, existing, out dated plants that were having trouble meeting their permits.  This plant was mandated by the EPA to improve the wastewater treatment in the Salt Lake Valley.  Since the Central Valley Water Reclamation (CVWRF) was organized in 1980, it has been faced with meeting stringent standards with facilities that were old and near the end of their operative life.  Chlorination of the plant effluents is part of the treatment.  In the old plants, this was accomplished with liquid chlorine brought on plant site in ton containers. With the advent of the new regional plant, the chlorine is brought on plant site in tank truck quantities and transferred to a 90 ton rail tank car stored permanently on site.  However, the most that is ever on plant site is about 50 tons.In, addition,new regulations required the addition of sulfur dioxide to eliminate the chlorine residual being discharged to the receiving waters.  This requirement added another hazardous chemical to be handled.  Sulfur dioxide is brought on plant site in tank truck quantities and transferred to a rail tank car stored permanently on site.  Since the start of the new plant, CVWRF has had one reportable incident with chlorine.  In spite of the fact that these hazardous materials is stored on plant site, the use of rail cars and bulk quantities have made the process more safe than ever before.\n\n          CVWRF's policy regarding the safety of plant personnel and surrounding population is that we intend to comply with all safety rules and agencies to make this a safe plant and good neighbor.  CVWRF has a team that is trained in handling both chlorine and sulfur dioxide and is ready to deal with whatever emergency may arise.  Safety equipment to cap leaks at the tank car.  Regular exercises are held to rehearse the procedu"
