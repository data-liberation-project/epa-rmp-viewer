A key requirement of this rule is the preparation and submission of an RMP Plan, contained herein.  The contents of the RMP Plan are prescribed by EPA, including this Executive Summary.\n\nCORPORATE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE APPROACH\n\n1. Prevention Program\n\nProcesses that are subject to OSHA's Process Safety management (PSM) standard AND are regulated under EPA's RMP rule are subject to the Program 3 Prevention program.  UNIVAR USA Inc. has documented the Prevention Program in its Process Safety Management Manual.  Briefly, this program includes provisions and requirements for:\n\n* Process Safety Information\n* Process Hazard Analysis\n* Operating Procedures\n* Training\n* Mechanical Integrity\n* Management of Change\n* Pre-Startup Review\n* Compliance Audits\n* Incident Investigation\n* Employee Participation\n* Hot Work permits\n* Contractors\n\n\n\n2. Emergency Response Approach\n\nUNIVAR USA Inc. has an Emergency Contingency Plan in place.

Joint emergency exercises are conducted when possible.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Chemical Storage & Distribution.  We have four RMP regulated substances present at our facility.  The substances are Aqueous Ammonia 30%, Sulfur Dioxide and Chlorine and Formaldehyde 37% . Listed below is the way the RMP regulated substances are stored/handled on site and the maximum inventory present at any one time.\n\n1. Formaldehyde 37% is received in 55 gal drums which are stored in our warehouse for distribution to end use customers. The estimated maximum inventory of Formaldehyde 37% onsite at any one time will be 45000  Pounds.\n\n2. Aqueous Ammonia 30% is received in 330 gal portable tanks which are stored in our warehouse for distribution to end use customers.The estimated maximum inventory of Aqueous Ammonia 30% at any one time will be 56,000 pounds.\n\n3. Chlorine is received in 150 and 2000 pound cylinders which are stored at the Fayetteville facility for distribution to end use customers. The estimated maximum inventory of Chlorine onsite at any one time will be 30,000 pounds.\n\n4. Sulfur Dioxide is received in 150 and 2000 pound cylinders which are stored at the Fayetteville facility for distribution to end use customers.The estimated maximum inventory of Sulfur Dioxide onsite at any one time will be 15,000 pounds.  \n\nWORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO & ALTERNATE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\n(including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario.)\n\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the look-up, tables and equations provided by the EPA in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.

Worse Case Scenario release of 2000 lbs Chlorine,the maximum distance of 1.3 miles(.0087 mg/l Toxic End Point) is obtained using Class F stability and 1.5 m/s wind speed.\n\n2. Alternate Case Scenario release of 693 lbs Aqueous Ammonia 30%, the maximum distance of 0.1 miles (.14 mg/l Toxic End Point) is obtained using Class D stability and 3m/s wind speed.\n\n3. Alternate Case Scenario release of 150 lbs Chlorine at 1 pound per minute for 150 minutes,the maximum distance of 0.1 miles(.0087 mg/l Toxic End Point) is obtained using Class D stability and 3m/s wind speed.\n\n4.

The methodology used to carry out these analyses is       the \"What-If\" technique. The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of five years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, UNIVAR USA Inc maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\n\nUNIVAR USA Inc has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every year and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nUNIVAR USA Inc carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.
