All applicable procedures of the EPA Prevention Program are adhered to.  Dole Fresh Vegetables' emergency response policy involves the preparation of response plans which are tailored to the facility and to the emergency response services available in the community.  It is also in compliance with the EPA Emergency Response Program Requirements.\n\nThis facility is divided into two sections.  The Value Added Facility is prepared to cool, clean, and package fresh vegetables, primarily for salads.  This facility utilizes anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant for the cooling process.  It also uses liquified chlorine gas for bacterial control of the processed salad.  The Cooler Facility primarily provides for general cold storage of the produce.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia and chlorine are stored at this facility.  The Value Added Facility uses 30,000 lbs of anhydrous ammonia for refrigeration and 12,000 lbs of liquified chlorine gas for disinfectant.  The Cooler Faciity uses 14,000 lbs of anhydrous ammonia for refrigeration.  These facilities and systems are not connected in any way.  The ammonia systems for both facilities are considered separate processess.  The chlorine system with the Value Added Facility is a separate process as well.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program is based on the following key elements:\n-High level of training of the operators.\n-Preventative maintenance program.\n-Use of state-of-the-art process and safety equipment.\n-Use of accurate and effective operating procedures, written with the participation of the operators.\n-Performance of a process hazard analysis of equipment and procedures.\n-Implementation of an auditing and inspection program.\n\nChemical specific prevention steps include availability of self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA), worn by the operators during conne"
