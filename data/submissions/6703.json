Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Polices\n\nHeinz Frozen Food Company s (HFFC) manufacturing sites comply with applicable federal, state\nand local regulations.  As with all HFFC manufacturing locations, this food processing facility has\na formal worker safety program.  All employees are informed of hazards in the workplace. \nEmployees who work with potentially hazardous substances receive proper training in the\nhandling of those substances.  This facility has procedures in place to safely remove employees\nfrom areas in the unlikely event that a hazardous substance release were to occur, and to put in\nplace emergency notification and response procedures.\n\n2.   Facility and Regulated Substances\n\nThis Heinz Frozen Food Company food processing facility is located at 5521 Division Street, Fort\nMyers, Florida.  Frozen prepared foods are produced at this location.  Food ingredients are\nreceived, blended, mixed, cooked, baked, assembled, frozen and packaged.  The regulated\nsubstance at this facility, anhydrous ammonia, is used in a closed-loop refrigeration system for\nproduct cooling and freezing.\n\n3.   Worst-Case and Alternate-Case Release Scenarios\n\nThe worst-case scenario consists of the release of ammonia from the largest vessel over a period\nof ten minutes.  The maximum quantity of ammonia in the vessel is limited to 50-percent of the\ntotal volume of 23,700 pounds via written administrative controls, resulting in a release of\napproximately 12,000 pounds of ammonia.  There are off-site impacts under this worst-case\nscenario.\n\nThe alternate-case scenario consists of the release of ammonia vapor from a safety relief valve due\nto an overpr"

The relief valve is\ndesigned to vent ammonia to the atmosphere when its pressure rating is exceeded, preventing\npotential damage to other components in the refrigeration system.  The scenario results in a 142-\npound ammonia release over a period of 23 minutes.  There are no off-site impacts under the\nalternate-case scenario.\n\n4.   General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Ammonia Specific Prevention\n\nAll Heinz Frozen Food Company manufacturing locations comply with the OSHA Process Safety\nManagement for Highly Hazardous Chemicals (PSM) standard relative to anhydrous ammonia. \nTherefore, this facility has programs to ensure proper operation and maintenance of the ammonia  \nrefrigeration system.  Further, refrigeration system operators have been trained and are\nknowledgeable in the safe operation of the refrigeration system.\nThe ammonia refrigeration system at this facility has been designed and constructed using good\nengineering practices and to conform to industry standards.  The system includes ammonia\ndetection devices, an emergency shutdown switch located outside the main mechanical room,\nhigh- and low-level switches in pressure vessels, and safety relief valves to avert serious system\noverpressure.  Periodic maintenance on the refrigeration system is ensured via the use of a\ncomputerized maintenance management system.  Annual physical system audits are performed by\nan external refrigeration contractor to ensure system integrity. \n\n5.   Five Year Accident History\n\nDuring the past five years this facility has had no releases that resulted in deaths, injuries, or\nsignificant property damage on site or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in\nplace, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6.   Emergency Response Program\n\nAt this facility the primary emphasis is to safely evacuate all employees in the event of an\naccidental release, pursuant to the requirements of OSHA "
