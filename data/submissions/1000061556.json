ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n\n\nThe facility is located in Fresno, California, and utilizes refrigeration for cold storage and freezing of peaches, nectarines, plums, and strawberries.\n\n\n\nSenior management at the facility is not only committed to offering superior service, but also to maintaining a safety and environmental program to promote a safe environment for all employees and the surrounding communities.  Senior management administer the safety and environmental policies and programs.  These programs include but are not limited to forklift safety, hazard communications, lockout/tagout, Hazardous Materials Emergency Business Plan, employee safety manuals, manufacturers documentation, Emergency Response, as well as the Risk Management Plan.\n\n\n\nWawona Frozen Foods has independently coordinated emergency response efforts with the local Fire Department.  In the case of an ammonia-related emergency, it is the policy of Wawona to evacuate the employees and to allow the fire department/HazMat team to respond to the emergency.  If an ammonia release involved could potentially impact the local community, a Shelter-In-Place plan would go into effect.\n\n\n\nThe refrigeration systems are closed loop systems similar to a residential refrigerator.  There are no emissions or planned releases of ammonia.\n\n\n\nB. STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\n\nWawona Frozen Foods maintains two separate ammonia refrigeration systems that cycle the refrigerant, or ammonia, from liquid to gas and back again.  The systems have a low pressure or low side, where the refrigerant absorbs heat as it evaporates, and a high pressure or high side, where the refrigerant vapor gives off heat as it is condensed back into a liquid.  (In operation the system basically moves heat from the low side to the high side.)  Refrigeration is maintained by isolating the low side in some form of insulated enclosure where goods are chilled or frozen.  \n\n\n\nAmmonia is the regulate"

The Cling system is not subject to the RMP rule as it contains less than the threshold quantity of ammonia.  However, the RMP elements have been implemented facility wide.  There is a total of 38,266 pounds of ammonia in the two refrigeration systems.   \n\n\n\nC.  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nThe Wawona Frozen Foods ammonia refrigeration systems have many safety features.  Much of the safety of the systems is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system. \n\n\n\nThe Process Safety Management program ensures that all security and safety procedures are addressed.  Staff are trained in operation, maintenance and emergency procedures related to the operation of the ammonia refrigeration system.  All refrigeration equipment and ammonia vessels are equipped with automatic pressure safety relief devices to prevent pressure build-up beyond safe equipment operation levels.  A preventative maintenance program assures that equipment is maintained and serviced on a regular schedule and that worn, ageing, or defective components are replaced as required to maintain equipment in good operating condition.  Controls and safety devices are tested regularly to ensure proper operation.\n\n\n\nD.  FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThe CalARP Program defines \"accident\" as the following:\n\n\n\n\"An unanticipated emission of a regulated substance or other extremely hazardous substance into the ambient air from a stationary source.\"\n\n\n\nThe release must have caused at least one of the following:\n\n\n\n?    On-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage (19CCR2750.9(a)); or\n\n?    Known offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place (19CCR2750.9(a)).\"\n\n\n\nOn 2/24/2020 Wawona Frozen Foods (NAICS 311411) had an accidental release of ammo"

      "SummaryText": "nia. The accident occurred at approximately 1:00 pm. The accident occurred when an employee used a float column drain leg for leverage, which resulted in a partial break in the pipe. The vessel was already isolated and mostly pumped out, but still had residual ammonia. The employee smelled ammonia and immediately flushed his eyes and face while onsite and then was taken to a clinic for further treatment. The employee returned to work two (2) days later. This was the only onsite impact and there were no known offsite impacts. Emergency responders were called and responded. Contributing causes were human factors, corrosion, and inadequate maintenance. Since the vessel was already pumped out and isolated, the residual ammonia was released almost immediately. The vessel was at 70 PSIG with no liquid level, so the amount of ammonia released was estimated to be approximately 4 lbs. An investigation was performed and the following recommendations were made and have been completed:\n\n\n\n1. Inspect all components associated with the Cling Chiller system.\n\n2. Replace all necessary piping associated with the Cling Chiller system.\n\n3. Reinsulate all necessary piping associated with the Cling Chiller system.\n\n4. Train employees on working with ammonia piping and dangers of piping stress.\n\n\n\n\n\nE.  EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nWawona Frozen Foods' Emergency Response Plan was designed to ensure a safe and healthy working environment.  The policy at Wawona Frozen Foods is to identify and correct unsafe conditions and work practices before an incident can occur.  The Emergency Response Plan outlines the company safety policy, responsibilities, accident investigation, and proper safety training procedures required to provide a safe work place.  \n\n\n\nWawona Frozen Foods' Emergency Response Plan is outlined in the PSM/RMP documentation and focuses on responding to ammonia releases.\n\n\n\nAll ammonia leaks, regardless of size, are reported to the Fresno Fire Department.

This is upwind of the release and typically at the northwest corner of the facility.  \n\n\n\nMitigation Measures\n\nA group response team will be established to assess the situation and be available to assist the Fire Department.  All personnel are required to evacuate the facility in the event of an ammonia release.  Certain trained personnel are authorized to shut down the ammonia refrigeration system while exiting the area; however, the ammonia sensors are the primary mitigation measure for shutting down the system.\n\n\n\nF.  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nWawona Frozen Foods is planning to complete several items over the next year as their continued effort to provide a safe work environment for their employees.  These changes include the following items:\n\n\n\n1.  Continue to train all employees in PSM/RMP/CalARP and safety programs.\n\n\n\n2.  Continue to have employee involvement in updating and refining PSM/RMP/CalARP and the facility's safety programs.\n\n\n\n3.
