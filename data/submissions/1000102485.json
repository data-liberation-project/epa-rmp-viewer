Plymouth Tube Company is committed to ensuring that Hydrofluoric Acid is stored and handled in a safe manner. We have conducted hazard reviews of the Hydrofluoric Acid process to ensure that our installations are in compliance with Federal, state and local codes, standards, and generally accepted good engineering practice and reviewed maintenance and operating procedures to enhance safety. Employees and contractors who are involved in storing and handling Hydrofluoric Acid have been trained in safe storage and handling procedures.\n\nIn case of an accidental release of Hydrofluoric Acid, it is Plymouth Tube Company's policy to notify the Village of East Troy Emergency Services and Veolia and/or Safety Kleen (for spill response) so that they can respond to the emergency.  Plymouth Tube Company has procedures in place to notify the appropriate emergency services in case of an accidental release. Plymouth Tube Company has an on-site HazWoper certified team that will help contain the spill until a third party arrives on-site.\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED:\nThe primary purpose of the Plymouth Tube Company, Trent facility is to manufacture stainless steel tube of varying diameters and lengths. Stainless steel sheets are formed and welded into tubing. In order to pickle the finishing tube, lengths of tubing are dipped into a solution of Hydrofluoric Acid (2%-7%), Nitric Acid, and water. After pickling, the tubing is inspected, rinsed, and bundled for shipping. There is one Hydrofluoric Acid (70% by weight) storage tank at the site which is 6,300 gallons in capacity. The storage tank is located outside the building.\n\nThe RMP regulated substance at the Plymouth Tube Company, Trent facility is Hydrofluoric Acid (70% by weight).\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PR"
