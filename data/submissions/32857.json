The Union Carbide facilities at South Charleston, Institute, Technology Park, Massey Yard, and New Yard share leveraged support and management and are collectively called West Virginia Operations (\u00bfWVO\u00bf).\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nWVO is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. If such a release should occur, our highly trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  We are also an active member of the Kanawha/Putnam Emergency Planning Committee which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe New Yard is used to temporarily store rail cars for eventual processing at the Institute site.  The rail yard is managed by the Institute site management, but is not considered contiguous with the Institute site.  No chemical loading or unloading takes place at the New Yard.  Several changes have occurred to the Union Carbide RMP covered source including a name change from the \u00bfInstitute Marshalling Yard\u00bf to the \u00bfNew Yard.\u00bf  In 1999, three separate processes were listed for the yard.  Following administrative changes, all rail cars are now managed together and have therefore been combined into one process in the RMP.  In addition, one Union Carbide RMP chemical is no longer stored in this facility becau"

Key elements include:\n\nProcess Safety Information\nWe maintain detailed records of safety information that describe the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all covered processes. Examples include, but are not limited to, Material Safety Data Sheets for all the hazardous chemicals, equipment design specification sheets, and reactive chemicals test results. This information is maintained up-to-date and is available to operating personnel.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified, evaluated, and controlled efficiently.  The methodologies used to carry out these analyses may include: Checklists, What If/Checklists (combined), Hazard and Operability Studies (HAZOP\u00bfs), Reactive Chemical/Process Hazard Analyses, Chemical Exposure Index, Fire & Explosion Index, and Layers of Protection Analyses. The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at regular intervals.  Any findings related to t"

These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nWVO has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided on a continuing basis.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nWVO carries out a documented Planned Preventative Maintenance Program (PPM) which provides checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes, but is not limited to: pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls, pumps, and compressors.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\nWVO facilities require management of modifications to process equipment, procedures, raw materials, and processing conditions other than like for like, by identifying, documenting, and reviewing them prior to implementation of changes.   Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and receive training prior to the modification.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in establis"

Audits are conducted using established schedules and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\nWVO promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a significant release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation\nWVO believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  WVO employees and contracted Bayer CropScience employees working in UCC Institute plants are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees and Bayer CropScience employees have access to all information created as part of the facility\u00bfs implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses in particular.\n\nContractors\nWVO hires contractors to perform some specialized maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is performed.  WVO has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related to the contractor\u00bfs work and the processes he/she may encounter while on site.

Detailed emergency response plans are developed and coordinated with the Kanawha/Putnam Emergency Planning Committee and the community.\n\nThe Institute site has a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.  The plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, quarterly emergency drills are conducted to enhance skills and tactics for responding to an accidental chemical release.  Critiques are held on drills and actual events.  Emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced. \n\nKanawha/Putnam EPC is the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) with which Institute's emergency plan has been coordinated and verified.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nPursuant to American Chemistry Council (\u00bfACC\u00bf) standards, the WVO Site has conducted vulnerability assessments and identified opportunities have been implemented.  An independent review of the completed improvements was performed in March 2004."
