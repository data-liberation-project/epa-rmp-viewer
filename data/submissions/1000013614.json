      "SummaryText": "a. The City of Pembroke Pines Water Utilities Department accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices.  All applicable procedures of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Prevention Program are followed.  The City of Pembroke Pines Utilities Department is included in the Emergency Response Plan for District XI Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC).  The emergency response policy includes this plan, and procedures for evaluating and mitigating minor on-site releases.  The response policy is in compliance with the EPA Emergency Response Program requirements.\n\nb. The City of Pembroke Pines Water Treatment Plant includes a chlorination system, which serves to disinfect the water supply for the City of Pembroke Pines.  The system delivers chlorine from one-ton liquid chlorine containers through vacuum-type chlorinators.  A vacuum-type chlorinator has a built-in automatic system shut-down in the event of a vacuum pipe leak, thereby minimizing the amount of chlorine released to the atmosphere.  Pressurized lines of the system are limited to flexible connections (pigtails) on the one-ton containers and a short run of carbon steel piping.  The chlorination system is housed in a chlorination room and an instrument room, and includes a flow recorder, electrical panels, and safety equipment.  A total of twenty, one-ton containers of chlorine may be on-site at any one time; however, only four, one-ton containers are on-line at any one time.  A utility shift supervisor and an operator typically are responsible for all plant operations. The facility is staffed 24 hours per day 365 days per year.\n\n\nc.The general accidental release prevention program is based on the following key elements:\n\nA?High level of training of the operators\nA?Preventive maintenance program\nA?Use of state-of-the art process and safety equipment\nA?Use of accurate and effective operating procedures, written with"

These changes are currently being evaluated."
