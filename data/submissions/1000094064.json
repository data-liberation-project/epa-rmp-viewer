The facility has a training program, of what to do in various emergency situations, including an ammonia release.\n\n\n\nThe emergency action procedures at this facility ensure emergency response coverage 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. There are also adequate provisions for coordination with outside agencies, such as the Coshocton Fire Department, HAZMAT Team and the LEPC in the event of an emergency.\n\n\n\n2.0 Process Description and Regulated Substance\n\n\n\nThe Kraft Heinz Foods Coshocton facility produces pork bacon products. The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for the primary process at this facility is 311612. The ammonia is utilized as a refrigerant for the processing and storage of bacon products and raw materials (pork bellies) and is located in various locations in the facility. Ammonia is the only Kraft Heinz Foods Coshocton regulated substance under 40 CFR 68.\n\n\n\nKraft Heinz Foods Coshocton exceeds the 10,000 pounds threshold according to 40 CFR 68.\n\n\n\nAmmonia is classified as a Group B2 refrigerant per ASHRAE Standard 34-1989. Its distinctive pungent odor is very noticeable to most people, even in small quantities. Ammonia is flammable in a very narrow and high range of concentration with a high ignition temperature. Ammonia is not toxic, but can be corrosive to the human tissue. Ammonia is readily absorbed into the moisture of the skin and at high concentrations can cause burns. The potential risks to people exposed to an accidental ammonia release include irritation of respiratory tract, burning of the skin and other tissue when contacted by ammonia vapor and freezing of skin and other body tissue when contacted by liquid a"
