The McGinness Hills facility actively manages all operational permits and safety programs such as Nevada Division of Environmental Protection's Air Quality, Chemical Accident Prevention Program, Underground Injection Control programs as well as OSHA's Process Safety Management program. In addition, Ormat is ISO 14000 and 9001 certified and undergoes several audit processes to ensure all facilities are aggressively pursuing the highest quality, safety and environmental standards. Ormat is committed to handling the n-pentane systems in a safe manner to protect the environment. Copies of emergency response, process hazard analyses, Chemical Accident Prevention and process safety management plans and all technical drawing (P&IDS) for process equipment are maintained onsite for reference.\r\n\r\nFacility Description\r\nThe McGinness Hills Geothermal Power Plant (McGinness Hills) is wholly owned by Ormat Nevada, Inc (Ormat), which is a division of Ormat Technologies, Inc., a publicly traded company. The McGinness Hills Project is located in Lander County and encompasses approximately 7,680 acres of public and private lands. The physical plant is located on approximately 16 acres about 11 miles northeast of Austin, Nevada on Grass Valley Road. The leased acreage covers the defined geothermal resource area and receptive injection zones.\r\n\r\nThe physical address is: \t1350 Grass Valley Road\r\n\t\t\tAustin, NV   89310\r\n\t\t\t\r\nThe McGinness Hills Plant will be a geothermal electric power generation facility with two, Integrated Two Level Unit (ITLU) air-cooled OEC units and one, level 3 air-cooled OEC.

Spent geothermal fluid will be injected back into the subsurface reservoir via three injection wells.\r\n\r\nMcGinness Hills will be operated by Ormat's Eastern Nevada Operations Group (ENOP). The Eastern NV-Operations Group (ENOP) is comprised of management, administration, maintenance, engineering and operations personnel. ENOP operates three eastern Nevada power generation facilities owned by Ormat.\r\n\r\nThe McGinness Hills facility will operate continuously, 24 hours per day and 365 days per year (excluding scheduled maintenance downtime or plant upsets).  It will initially be staffed full time, but will eventually be operated remotely from a site central to all ENOP-operated facilities in Elko, NV.\r\n\r\nRegulated Substance Handled\r\nMcGinness Hills stores n-pentane (CAS # 109-66-0) as the motive fluid used in the Ormat Energy Converter (OEC) units. In addition to the inventory present in the OECs, the plant will have three n-pentane storage tanks.  Two tanks will have a nominal capacity of 30,000 gallons each (maximum fill capacity of 27,000 gallons) and one will have a nominal capacity of 12,000 gallons (maximum fill capacity of 10,800 gallons). The maximum total projected amount of n-pentane to be stored on site is 759,710 pounds (reflects the inventory in three operational OECs and one storage tank filled to the maximum). The use of n-pentane in a process in a quantity greater than 10,000 lbs requires compliance with PSM (29CFR1910.119), RMP (40CFR68) and CAPP (Nevada Administrative Code 459.952 to 459.95528).  The n-pentane is projected to first be stored on the site in mid-May, 2012.\r\n\r\nWorst Case Scenario: Worst case scenario assessment has been made and potential off-site consequence\r\nanalysis (OCA) was undertaken. However, in conformance with Office of Emergency Management guidance, the OCA for worst-case and/or alternative release scenario(s) has not been included in"

These safe work practices apply to both employees and contractors.\r\n\r\nMaintenance Procedures: A Mechanical Integrity Program (MIP) has been initiated at the McGinness Hills\r\nfacility. The MIP adopted a maintenance concept for periodic preventative and corrective maintenance of the OEC system at McGinness Hills. The preventative maintenance tasks include visual inspection, lubrication of rotating parts, system cleaning, replacing liquids and filters, and periodic tests to verify that the system is in proper operating condition. Preventative maintenance tasks and procedures are scheduled to be undertaken over a series of maintenance intervals.\r\n\r\nAlarm system maintenance is determined using a combination of regulatory requirements, manufacturer's recommendations, plant operating experience and best practices. Standard Safety Procedure #23, and the Standard Maintenance Procedures (SMP's) will identify system maintenance procedures, frequencies and recommended spare parts.\r\n\r\nTraining: Initial training for personnel is given before that employee is allowed to either handle n-pentane,\r\noperate or work on the facility's process area or on process equipment. Initial training shall be completed\r\nwith Emergency Services Personnel including a tour of the site, gas and fire detection system operations, and familiarization with the motive fluid characteristics.\r\n\r\nRefresher training is conducted on an annual basis, at a minimum, and when review of the chemicals or\r\nprocess reveals a need for additional training.

Training will include the following items, but is not limited to: (a) Location and sounds of the stand down, and evacuation alarms; (b) Expectations of response to injuries and emergencies by personnel on site; and (c) Evacuation routes and locations. Refresher training for all personnel shall be conducted annually at a minimum.\r\n\r\nSafety Training: Some equipment at the McGinness Hills Geothermal Power Plant poses potential fire, explosion, and electrical hazards that could cause serious personal injuries and costly property damage if safety procedures are not followed correctly. Safety training, conducted monthly and required of all employees, identifies the different hazards to be found on the sites. These subjects include Emergency Action Plan (EAP), motive fluid hazards, fire prevention and hot work, lock out and tag out procedures, hazard communication, confined space, hearing conservation, personal protective equipment, accident, injury and incident reporting. Safety training is supplemented by the use of the Standard Safety Procedures.\r\n\r\nn-Pentane system: Deviation from the design limits of operation for the n-pentane transfer system will not normally occur since the individual components are rated beyond the highest achievable values of pressure, temperature, and flow within the system.\r\n\r\nOEC Units: The OEC units are controlled and monitored by their own dedicated HMI Programmable Logic\r\nController (PLC).

Deviation from the operating parameters will immediately be detected by the PLC and the PLC will initiate correction or automatic shutdown of the related OEC unit. Under normal circumstances, no releases or other dangerous situations are expected to result from these automatic actions. Appropriate manual override is provided.\r\n\r\nRelief system design: Relief valves are located on the n-pentane storage tanks and on the OEC vaporizers and condensers. Each pressure relief valve relieves directly to atmosphere, and some installations have extension pipes installed to direct the relief valve discharge away from critical machinery. Additionally, each pressure relief valve is installed immediately above a rupture disk designed to fail at the relief pressure of its corresponding relief valve. Individual relief valve locations are equipped with \"telltale\" gauges in between the relief valve and its rupture disk to allow easy identification of leaking or blown rupture disks. The following list summarizes the system relief set points:\r\n\r\n  n-Pentane Storage Tank Relief: 120 psig\r\n  Condenser: 120 psig\r\n  Vaporizer: 350 psig\r\n\r\nVentilation System Design: All components of the n-pentane transfer and storage systems and the OEC units are located outdoors.\r\n\r\nSafety Systems: Beyond the relief system the McGinness Hills, the OEC units have extensive fire protection, gas and flame detection, and alarm systems.

The recommendations of the PHA were integrated into the facility and facility operations. The PHA will be updated and revalidated at least every 5 years to ensure the study is consistent for the life of the pentane processes.\r\n\r\nFive-Year Accident History\r\nThe McGinness Hills power plant is a new facility and there have been no accidents associated with pentane and no accidental releases of pentane.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\nThe Emergency Response Program is intended to identify and coordinate personnel in the event there is an emergency. The EAP procedures apply to all personnel working at the McGinness Hills facility or monitoring the McGinness Hills plant from the Elko monitoring facility. The EAP is submitted to the local fire department and LEPC for review and their concurrence when changes are made to the plan.
