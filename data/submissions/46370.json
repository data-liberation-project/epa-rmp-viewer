The large majority of products stored are refrigerated foods for human consumption and inherently pose no known environmental or safety risks.  Ammonia, a regulated substance, is the commonly used refrigerant in industrial grade refrigeration systems that maintain low storage temperatures and can be safely managed by trained operators.  The ammonia refrigeration process functions within a closed piping network serving the facility operations.  The refrigeration system in this facility contains approximately 57,500 pounds of ammonia inventory for this process.\nWe follow the federally required process safety management program(29 CFR 1910.119) tp prevent anhydreous ammonia leaks and other refrigeration system accidents. We coordinate our emergency plans with City Of Chicago Fire Department and Cook County Emergency Management Department, and local police through an offsite emergency plan, onmsite tours, and discussions. Alternative and wors case release scenarois have been completed for anhydreous ammonia. Contact us if you would like to review or discuss these scenarios or any other concern you have. No ammonia leaks that rae reportable under the EPA's Risk Management regulation (40 CFR 68.42) have ocuured in the last five yearsx. We are continuously reviewing and upgrading oue safetyu, health and environmental programs."
