              "Description": "\n \n\nPREVENTION PROGRAM DESCRIPTION  \n\nThe Atlas Cold Storage( Previous owner of the facility)hazardous material release Prevention Program is built on the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard for ammonia refrigeration systems, which is still in place.  The first element in the safe function of ammonia refrigeration equipment is in the design itself. All components in the system were designed and installed in compliance with ANSI, ASHRAE, ASME,  Pressure Vessel Codes and all other applicable design safety standards in effect at the time of construction.  In order for this system to function safely and effectively over a long period of time, it must be properly maintained and monitored for system integrity and functional efficiency.  Maintenance and monitoring is accomplished by employees trained to follow safe procedures when operating the equipment from normal start-up to running and emergency shut-down. Also built into the system are automated and manual safeguards that monitor and maintain pressures, temperatures, liquid levels and warning systems that alert operators to respond early to operational deviations before they  become emergencies.\n\nOperator training also includes participation in hazard analysis studies and emergency response procedures that permit hands-on practice in the use of personal protection equipment in an emergency scenario.  The hazard analysis (\"what-if\") study helps operators and emergency responders understand how to evaluate and manage an emergency situation safey and effectively in order to mitigate the potential releases.  Lock-out/tag-out procedures are very important for preventing further hazards around malfunctioning equipment or when making even minor repairs on the system.\nSpill containment and clean-up training is important so that effects of a spill are minimized.  \n\nGeneral employee training involves a knowledge of ammonia hazards, warning systems and evacuation procedures.  \n\nAnnual Internal Corporate Safety Audits include evaluations and recommendations for updating and improving the program.",

The large majority of products stored are refrigerated foods for human consumption and inherently pose no known environmental or safety risks.  Ammonia, a regulated substance, is the commonly used refrigerant in industrial grade refrigeration systems that maintain low storage temperatures and can be safely managed by trained operators.  The ammonia refrigeration process functions within a closed piping network serving the facility operations.  The refrigeration system in this facility contains approximately 57,500 pounds of ammonia inventory for this process.\nWe follow the federally required process safety management program(29 CFR 1910.119) tp prevent anhydreous ammonia leaks and other refrigeration system accidents. We coordinate our emergency plans with City Of Chicago Fire Department and Cook County Emergency Management Department, and local police through an offsite emergency plan, onmsite tours, and discussions. Alternative and wors case release scenarois have been completed for anhydreous ammonia. Contact us if you would like to review or discuss these scenarios or any other concern you have. No ammonia leaks that rae reportable under the EPA's Risk Management regulation (40 CFR 68.42) have ocuured in the last five yearsx. We are continuously reviewing and upgrading oue safetyu, health and environmental programs."
