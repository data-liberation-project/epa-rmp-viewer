Public and employee safety, as well as environmental protection, are primary issues of concern to Continuum Midstream, LLC (Continuum).  Accidental release prevention is a key factor in the design, construction and operation of all Continuum facilities.  Continuum facilities are constructed in accordance with applicable codes/standards and are evaluated to ensure that the equipment complies with recognized and generally accepted good engineering safeguards (i.e.: pressure relief valves, shutdowns, alarms, etc.) that are designed to prevent situations that would require an emergency response.  This plan is provided to applicable outside agencies that might be called upon for assistance in an emergency situation (i.e.: police department, etc.).\n\n\n\n(b)  Stationary Source and Regulated Substances.  The Foss Compressor Station is a stationary source as defined in 40 CFR 68.3.  The regulated substance at the facility is a flammable chemical mixture, Natural Gas Liquids (NGL), which is an aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbon mixture.  The mixture includes N-pentane, isopentane, N-butane, isobutane, propane, ethane and methane.  These chemicals have a RMP regulated threshold quantity of 10,000 lbs individually, and a 1 wt% threshold if in a 10,000 lbs NFPA 4 flammable mixture.  NGL is considered NFPA 4 and some RMP flammable chemicals are present at concentrations > 1 wt%.  The facility has one aboveground storage tank for NGL that has a maximum capacity of 18,000 gallons.  With administrative controls, the capacity is limited to 14,400 gallons.\n\n\n\n(c) Worst-Case Release Scenario and Administrative/Mitigative Controls.  The worst-case release scenario (WCRS) would be a rupture of the NGL Product Storage Tank.  Such a release has the potential of the formation of a vapor cloud that could explode when exposed to an ignition source.  Using the EPA's Ris"

      "SummaryText": "k Management Program of Offsite Consequences Analysis, the WCRS distance/endpoint was calculated to be 0.3 miles from the tank.  Based on this distance and using EPA's MARPLOT software, it was determined that there are no public receptors within the WCRS endpoint.  The facility is defined as Program 1.  Though not required for a Program 1 facility, an alternate release scenario was also evaluated, arriving at a 0.2 mile endpoint.  Various administrative and mitigative (engineering) controls have been implemented/installed as safeguards to prevent deviations outside safe operating limits.  Administrative controls include limiting the maximum fill level of the NGL storage tank and utilizing a well-trained operation and maintenance staff that periodically visits and inspects the facility.  Mitigative (engineering) safeguards include such things as high pressure shutdowns, high temperature shutdowns, high level shutdowns, etc.\n\n\n\n(d)  Hazard Communication Program.  Continuum has developed and implemented a Company Hazard Communication Program that ensures: (1) an MSDS is on file for all hazardous chemicals used or stored in the facility; (2) all applicable containers of hazardous chemicals are properly labeled/marked; and (3) employees receive annual training on the Company's Hazard Communication Program.\n\n\n\n(e)  Five Year Accident History.  The Foss Compressor Station has not had a regulated flammable chemical release in the previous five years.\n\n\n\n(f)  Planned Changes to Improve Safety.  Continuum is always looking for ways to improve their safety program.  Continuum believes the effectiveness of the safety program is directly proportional to employee involvement and senior management support.  Two tasks are being performed:  (1) current training programs are being evaluated and (2) monthly safety inspection performed by the people who operate and maintain the facility is being implemented.\n\n"
