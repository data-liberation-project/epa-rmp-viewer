Corporate Prevention  and Emergency Response Approach\n\nThe Stanton Energy Center is a division of Orlando Utilities Commission, headquartered in Orlando, Florida.  Corporate policy requires each site to develop and maintain accident prevention programs and an emergency response plan appropriate to the site.  The Corporate environmental organization provides support to the sites in the form of advise and direction on regulatory compliance issues, training for site employees, budgeting and procurement of environmental services, and assistance in the development of new programs.\n\n2. Description of Stationary Source\n\nThe Stanton Energy Center is a two unit coal- fired power generating facility that supplies 420 MW electric power from each unit to the greater Orlando metropolitan area and distributes excess capacity.\n\nThe Stanton Energy Center adds chlorine to the water in the cooling tower basins as a biocide. Liquefied chlorine gas is stored in up to ten one-ton containers at the Units 1&2 Circulating Water Chemical Feed facility.  Five containers are always connected to the system, and five are on standby.  The total chlorine inventory in the Unit 1&2 process is 20,000 lbs. Liquefied chlorine gas is also stored in up to six one-ton containers for supply to the cooling tower at Unit B.  Three containers are always connected to the system, and three are on standby.  The total chlorine inventory in the Unit B process is 12,000 lbs. Both processes exceed the 2,500 lb. threshold quantity.\n\nThe Stanton Energy Center also stores liquefied anhydrous ammonia in two 30,000 gallon tanks for addition to the Selective Catalytic Reduction System at Units 1&2.  Although the tanks have a total capacity of 60,000 gallons, the Ammonia Unloading, Storage and Supply procedure limits the tank levels to 85% of capacity, or a maximum total inventory of 51,000 gallons.  This is equivalent to approximately 256,000 lbs. of ammon"

      "SummaryText": "ia at Units 1&2. Similarly, Unit B also stores liquefied anhydrous ammonia in one 15,000 gallon tank for addition to it's Selective Catalytic Reduction System.  This tank is also administratively limited in its fill capacity. At 85% of capacity, the anhydrous ammonia storage tank at Unit B contains approximately 13,000 gallons, or 65,000 lbs. of ammonia. Both processes exceed the 10,000 lb. threshold quantity.\n\n3. Prevention Program\n\nThe Stanton Energy Center has a program in place to comply with the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard, 29 CFR 1910.119.  The PSM Program also serves as the RMP prevention plan.  The PSM Program was established in 1994 for the chlorine process and was extended to cover the ammonia process when the SCR system was constructed in 1996. Improvements have been made to the program as a result of audits performed in July of 1997, May of 1999, March of 2003, and June 2007.  The Stanton Energy Center PSM Program receives full support of plant management and involvement of employees at all levels.  \n\n4. Accident History\n\nThe Stanton Energy Center has had no accidental releases of chlorine or ammonia in the past five years.\n\n5. Emergency Response Program\n\nThe Stanton Energy Center has an emergency response plan in place that complies with  29 CFR 1910.38.  Additionally facility employees are trained to respond defensively to small releases of chlorine and ammonia.  The plan has been coordinated with the Orange County Fire Department, and the District 6 Local Emergency Planning Committee.  Notification is made locally by dialing 911, and by notifying Florida State Warning Point at (800) 320-0519 or (904) 413-9911."
