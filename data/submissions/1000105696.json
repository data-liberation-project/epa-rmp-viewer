Both walls allow for the containment of the full capacity of liquid ammonia. This\u201d tank-within-a-tank\u201d design greatly reduces the probability of a potential leak.\nThe anhydrous ammonia storage tank is equipped with automatic shut-off and relief devices have been installed to handle fluctuations in temperature and pressure. Warning alarms, leak detectors, regular equipment inspections, and pressure monitoring in pipes and vessels provide layers of protection for employees and the community.\n\nFive Year Accident History:\nThe anhydrous ammonia storage is new and therefore has not had any releases of anhydrous ammonia over the past five years which meet the reporting criteria.\n\nEmergency Response Program:\nEmergency response programs are in place for both internal preparation and coordination with the community. The Facility is coordinating with the Local Emergency Planning Committee to ensure community safety. Drills are coordinated with the community and the community warning sirens are tested weekly.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\nFacility processes will be routinely changed to improve safety as a result of employee suggestions, process hazard analyses, and incident investigations. All changes will be controlled and reviewed through a management of change process to ensure that they are safe."
