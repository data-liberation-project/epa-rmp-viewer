Anitox, and its products, are dedicated to consumer food safety, which begins with animal production.\n\nA primary goal for senior management at Anitox, as well as all employees, is to eliminate, or control, both known and potential safety and health hazards that exist in the work place.  Anitox goes to great lengths to accomplish this goal including the use of proper equipment, materials, manufacturing procedures and trained employees.  Anitox is committed to do all that is reasonable to protect our employees, our customers and the public from results of chemical releases or fire.  Anitox has not experienced any accidents in the last five years or since the last revision of the Risk Management Plan. \n\nIn preparation for an emergency, Anitox insures that all public service agencies responsible for emergency response are kept informed and updated on the Anitox emergency response plan.  These agencies include, but are not limited to, the Russellville Fire Department, the Dover Fire Department and the Pope County Emergency Services.  Anitox has conducted facility tours, product training and issued copies of the emergency response plan to these agencies.  The National Response Center and the State of Arkansas Emergency Response Commission must be notified immediately in the event of a chemical release.  \n\nAnhydrous Ammonia is used in the manufacturing facility at Anitox to produce animal feed additives.
