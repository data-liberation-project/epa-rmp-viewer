The City has two obligations under EPA's Risk Management Program Rule (RMP Rule, Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act):\n\n1. A?112(r)(1) - Purpose and General Duty Clause A? An entity that stores and uses hazardous chemicals in any quantity has a fundamental obligation to ensure a safe operation, and to have plans in place in the event of an accident to appropriately manage the situation. \n\n2. Risk Management Plan - The WWTP stores and uses chlorine and sulfur dioxide in excess of thresholds specified in the RMP Rule. \n\nChlorine is used to treat and disinfect municipal wastewater, and sulfur dioxide is used to remove the chlorine from the water. Chlorine and sulfur dioxide are delivered as compressed gases in one-ton cylinders by a local contractor. There are a maximum of four full cylinders, or 8,000 pounds, of chlorine and three full cylinders, or 6,000 pounds, of sulfur dioxide onsite at the WWTP at any one time (a few empty cylinders may also be stored as they await transport off site).\n\nThe RMP rule requires one hypothetical worst-case scenario (WCS) to represent all regulated toxic substances in what it refers to a A?Program 2A? processes. Additional WCSs are required if a release from a process could impact different offsite receptors. A WCS for the sulfur dioxide process does not have to be reported since the impact of such a release would fall within that of the chlorine process system. This WCS is reported in this updated RMP plan.\n\nIn addition to the WCS, the RMP rule requires one alternative release scenario (ARS) for each regulated toxic substance in Program 2 processes. Therefore, two ARSs (one each for chlorine and sulfur dioxide) are included in this updated RMP. \n\nThe City has implemented safety precautions to prevent and mitigate any chlorine"

The City has coordinated with local emergency responders, including the Lake Jackson Fire Department.  City management is committed to:\nA?    Preventing accidents;\nA?    Training employees in correct response procedures in the event of an accident;\nA?    Providing leadership to the community with respect to emergency preparedness;\nA?    Addressing any citizen concerns by fully explaining potential hazards associated with facility operations and all steps being taken to prevent and mitigate accidents; and\nA?    Demonstrating good corporate citizenship in Brazoria County.\n\nWith these objectives in mind, this RMP summarizes information about the City's management of the risks associated with the chlorine disinfection process and subsequent sulfur dioxide removal process, but more importantly stresses the commitment to ensuring a safe operation for employees, visitors, and community.\n"
