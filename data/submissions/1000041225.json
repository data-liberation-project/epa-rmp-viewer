Plains\u00c2\u00bf management philosophy goals are achieved through the implementation of the environmental, health and safety management systems, by the personal commitments of employees and contractors, and by open communication with employees, customers, neighbors, and regulators.  \n\nThe purpose of this Risk Management Plan (RMPlan) is to provide information about operations at the terminal, programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, emergency response plans in the event an accidental release should occur, the five-year accident history of the terminal, and planned changes to improve safety at the terminal.\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\nThe Tulsa Truck Terminal is owned by Plains LPG Services, L.P. and operated by Plains Midstream Canada, L.P.  At the terminal, propane is received via pipeline.  It is then dehydrated and stored in pressure vessels.  From these pressure vessels, propane is loaded into tanker trucks for distribution.  Propane is the only flammable substance regulated under the Risk Management Program (RMP) that is present at the Tulsa Truck Terminal in amounts above threshold quantity.  Ethyl mercaptan is stored at the terminal; however, the amount stored is below threshold quantity.  The terminal is classified as Program Level 3 under the regulation.\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs in place at the terminal are part of the high standards striven for by Plains.  These high standards include:\n\n\u00c2\u00b7 Operating in compliance with required environmental permits and regulations.\n\u00c2\u00b7 Operating and maintaining the assets in such a manner that unintentional releases are minimized.\n\u00c2"

Ongoing analysis of the potential hazards of the process, detailed training of employees, and emphasis on safety has helped avoid any serious chemical release accidents over the last 5 years.  Part of this program has also involved identifying and taking steps to avoid potential accidental chemical releases.  A few examples of the prevention features implemented at this terminal include:\n\n\u00c2\u00b7 Emergency shutdown devices at four locations within the terminal in order to shutdown the entire terminal during emergency situations.\n\u00c2\u00b7 Level alarms on storage tanks and bullets to help prevent overfilling.\n\u00c2\u00b7 A hydrocarbon gas detection system consisting of 8 gas detectors located throughout the terminal.  The hydrocarbon gas detection system will sound an alarm at low gas concentrations and will trigger the emergency shutdown system at high gas concentrations.\n\u00c2\u00b7 A fire detection system consisting of four fire-eyes, which will trigger the emergency shutdown system when activated.\n\u00c2\u00b7 Motion detectors at main load pumps, the office, and regeneration skid will ESD the terminal.\n\u00c2\u00b7 Excess flow valves on the inlet lines and outlet lines for each storage tank to shut-off the tank during large release situations.\n\u00c2\u00b7 Reverse check valves on each storage tank liquid outlet line, which can be activated by fusible links, hitting the emergency shutdown button or by the gas or fire detectors.\n\u00c2\u00b7 Automated trailer volume and weight monitoring system at the truck loading bays to help prevent overfilling of the trucks.\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nNo incident resulting in ons"

Also involved in emergency response for the terminal would be the Tulsa City Fire Department and Police Department, Tulsa County LEPC, and as appropriate, the Tulsa Ambulance Service, St. John\u00c2\u00bfs Hospital, St. Francis Hospital, Hillcrest Hospital, and the Oklahoma State Highway Patrol.  The terminal operator is responsible for coordinating the notifications required to initiate an emergency response.  A specific Emergency Response Plan for the terminal is in place and that plan has been coordinated with local officials, along with evacuation procedures, and training.  The Emergency Response Program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nCompliance with the RMP Prevention Program coupled with the environmental, health and safety management systems, forms the framework for continuous safety improvement.  Some of the key components of the safety program are:\n\n\u00c2\u00b7 The Management of Change provisions ensure that the potential safety and health impacts of any change made to process chemicals, technology, equipment or procedures are considered.\n\u00c2\u00b7 The Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) provisions serve as a tool to ensure timely evaluation of potential hazards, thereby leading to continual improvements in safety standards.\n\u00c2\u00b7 The Mechanical Integrity provisions ensure that process equipment and instrumentation are designed, constructed, installed and maintained to minimize the risk of hazardous releases, thereby s"
