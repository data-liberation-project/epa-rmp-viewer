      "SummaryText": "Jakson Farmers Inc is a retail agriculture company that primarly stores grain and sells agricultural chemicals to local farmers.  The primary activity at this facility is storage and tranfer of anhydrous ammonia.\n\nThe maximun quanity stored would be 132,000 pounds in two storage  tanks.\n\nThe worse case senerio would release as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quanity released would be 79,000 pounds, which represents the volume of one tank at 85% capacity as a limit by design standards.  The distance to enpoint is 1.89 miles.  The alternative release senario based on  the five year history, is a release from a 3 inch tranfer line failer.  Would be 13319 pounds released in 2 minutes The distance to endpoint is .50  miles (point of dispertion to 200 ppm).\n\nThere has been no accidental release  of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years, that has caused death, injury.  Nor has there been a relaese on or off site that has lead to the evacuation.  Our company  maintains an accident free workplace by following proper ammonia handleing guildlines set forth be the Kansas State Board of Agriculture.  Our employee train annually on the handleing and safety of the product.\n\nThis facility has a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA and we report our regulated materials to the Community Right to Know program, the local fire department and county LEPC.  Our safety efforts go beyond what rule require; we do this for good business.  Our goal is to effectivly serve the community we operate in and deliver quality to our farmer owners."
