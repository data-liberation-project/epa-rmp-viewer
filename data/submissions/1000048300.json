The Terminal is using the Guaynabo Puma dock facilities to receive and ship product. Puma is required to comply with United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) regulations under 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68 because the facility stores propane and butane on-site in quantities exceeding the rule threshold quantity for these substances.  The following executive summary is provided in accordance with the requirements of 40 CFR 68.155.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nPuma is committed to operating and maintaining its butane and propane operations (generically referred to as liquefied petroleum gas or LPG) in a safe and responsible manner.  Puma has developed and implemented accidental release prevention and emergency response provisions at the facility, including those required under the USEPA RMP rule and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.  The facility is also subject to other emergency plan regulations such as those under the Oil Pollution Act (OPA) of 1990, state Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (ECPRA), and United States Coast Guard (USCG) rules.\n\n\n\nDescription of Facility and Regulated Substances\n\nPuma operates a petroleum product terminal located in Bayamon, Puerto Rico, which handles butane and propane, which are regulated flammable substances "

Puma's butane and propane terminal loading activities consist of:\n\nButane transfer from barges to pressurized bullet tanks or spheres; \n\nButane transfer from pressurized bullet tanks or spheres to truck loading terminal;\n\nPropane transfer from barges to pressurized bullet tanks; \n\nPropane transfer from pressurized bullet tanks to truck loading terminal;\n\nPropane transfer from pressurized bullet tanks to dock terminal;\n\nButanizer skid to add butane to gasoline to increase the gasoline octane.\n\n\n\nThe following transfer rates are currently expected at the facility (for Phase 1):\n\nThe LPG (Propane & Butane) facility consists of a total of 25 bullet tanks, and one Sphere. \n\nThe propane bullets facilities for Phase 1 consist of 10 bullet tanks located at north area of the plant. The total storage capacity of the bullets is 20,000 BBLS.\n\nThe LPG Facility has the capacity of trucks being loaded from the bullet tanks or sphere at a rate of 200 to 2,271.74 liters per minute.\n\nThe butane bullets facilities consist of 15 bullet tanks, and one Sphere, located at south area of the plant. Also, the 10 bullet tanks located at north area of the plant facilities can be used for butane storage. The total storage capacity of the bullets is 36,899 BBLS. \n\nEach bullet is connected to the dock's 10-inch pipeline for filling purpose and connected to butane pumps' 10-inch suction header. The sphere is connected also to the dock's 10-inch pipeline for filling purpose and connected to butane bullets filling pipe line for filling the butane bullets purpose. \n\nButane is transferred from the bullets to the truck loading terminal and, eventually, to tank trucks for distribution to customers.\n\nButane and propane transfer rate from barges to bullet tanks or sphere is 1,000 gal/min.\n\n\n\nPuma revised the existing RMP to include additional tanks and lines at the facility (Phase 2A) for the handling of butane and propane.

Key elements include the following:\n\nProcess Safety Information - Information regarding butane and propane hazards, process technology, and process equipment is complied, updated, and made available to operating personnel.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis - Analyses are conducted every five years with the objective of identifying, evaluating, and controlling the process hazards, and findings and recommendations are promptly addressed.\n\nOperating Procedures - Procedures are developed and maintained up to date to provide instructions for safe operations of process equipment during various phases of operation.\n\nTraining - Initial and recurring training is provided to all employees involved in operating a regulated process.\n\nMechanical Integrity - Procedures are developed and implemented to maintain the on-going integrity of vessels, process piping, transfer hoses, and other process equipment. These include procedures for maintenance, training of maintenance employees, and inspection and testing.\n\nManagement of Change - Written procedures are used to manage changes to pro"
