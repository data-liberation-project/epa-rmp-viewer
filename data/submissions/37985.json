To ensure our commitment, we adhere with all applicable federal, state, and local laws. The facility has coordinated emergency response activities with the Atchison Fire Department.\n\nThis facility produces gluten, starch, and alcohol products. Propylene oxide is the only risk management program regulated substance processed at the facility in excess of threshold quantities. Propylene oxide is used in the process for manufacturing starch. The system includes a storage tank, a day tank, pumps, piping, and valves. The tanks are provided with secondary containment. Safety systems associated with the system include pressure relief devices, a nitrogen purge system, a vapor detection system, a sprinkler/deluge system, and a tank dump system. \n\nThe facility complies with the EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations. In addition, the facility complies with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management regulation. Our prevention program includes written operating and mechanical integrity procedures, safe work practices, a contractor safety program, management of change, and pre-startup safety reviews. In addition we have implemented a training program to ensure that our employees are knowledgeable in the hazards of the process and in their specific job functions. If an accident does occur, it is thoroughly investigated and the findings of the investigation are communicated to all affected employees. We believe our prevention program is key to minimizing the risk to our employees, the public, and the environment.\n\nIn the past five years, we have not had an accident involving propylene oxide that resulted in any on-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage; or that resulted in any offsite deaths, injuries,"
