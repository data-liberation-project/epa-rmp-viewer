The facility receives, stores, and transfers a wide variety of bulk liquid materials including food grade oils, fuels, solvents, and industrial chemicals.  Bulk products are stored in aboveground storage tanks surrounded by secondary containment sized to contain a complete failure of the largest tank and rainfall associated with the 25 year, 24 hour storm event within the containment area.\n\n\n\nRegulated Substances Handled \n\n\n\nStolthaven handles more than the threshold quantities of 1,3-Pentadiene (10,000 pounds), Toluene 2,4-diisocyanate (10,000 pounds), and Toluene 2,6-diisoycyanate (10,000 pounds). Stolthaven is regulated under the Program 2 requirements of 40 CFR 68.10.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies \n\n\n\nStolthaven New Orleans, LLC is committed to operating in a safe and compliant manner. \n\nEmployees involved in operating the 1,3-Pentadiene and Toluene diisocyanate (mixed isomers) handling facility are trained to identify and understand the hazards posed during the storage and transfer process.  Training includes the review of information pertaining to the hazards of 1,3-Pentadiene and Toluene diisocyanate (mixed isomers), process technology, process equipment, and emergency response procedures. The facility maintains written process safety information to enable employees involved in handling 1,3-Pentadiene and Toluene diisocyanate (mixed isomers) to identify and understand the hazards posed by these processes.  Written training information includes the physical properties of 1,3-Pentadiene and Toluene diisocyanate (mixed isomers), the health risks associated with chemical exposures, and material safety data sheets.  Process safety and emergency response materials are kept on site a"
