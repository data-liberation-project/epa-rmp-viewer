Dock Unloading: Unload TDI containing materials (KonnateT-80) from Dock 3 and transfer to storage tanks or loading racks. Dock 3 Flex hose connections from ship; D/E manifold; Piping to Truck Rack T-1, Piping/loading to Storage tanks and then to Rail Racks R-1 (Track 1, Spots 5&7, Track 2, Spots 5&7); Piping to Storage Tanks T-E12.5-8 & T-E12.5-10; Includes vapor line to site flare from marine unloading.\n\n2 ?  Truck Loading: Load TDI containing material (Konnate T-80) into tank trucks for customers; Truck Loading operations at Truck Rack T-1; Flex hose connections; Includes vapor line to site flare from truck loading.\n\n3 ? Car Loading: Load TDI-containing material (Konnate T-80) into tank cars for customers; Rail car loading operations at Rail Rack R-1 including Track 1, Spots 5&7 & Track 2, Spots 5&7; Includes vapor line to site flare from car loading\n\n4 ? Tanks: Store TDI-containing material (Konnate T-80) unloaded from ships at Dock 3 prior to transfer to another tank, loading a tank truck, or loading a tank car.  This includes clean-out operations for Hurricane preparation or prior to product change. Utilize carbon bed to treat breathing losses from TDI-containing tanks; Tanks T-E12.5-8 and T-E12.5-10; Includes vapor line to site flare from tank breathing and working losses.\n\n5 ? Flare: Combust process loading and transfer emissions in site flare.\n\n\n\nEverything in this prevention program applies to all five operations/units for both 2,4- and 2,6-TDI isomers.",

The facility receives, stores, and transfers a wide variety of bulk liquid materials including food grade oils, fuels, solvents, and industrial chemicals.  Bulk products are stored in aboveground storage tanks surrounded by secondary containment sized to contain a complete failure of the largest tank and rainfall associated with the 25 year, 24 hour storm event within the containment area.\n\n\n\nRegulated Substances Handled \n\n\n\nStolthaven handles more than the threshold quantities of 1,3-Pentadiene (10,000 pounds), Toluene 2,4-diisocyanate (10,000 pounds), and Toluene 2,6-diisoycyanate (10,000 pounds). Stolthaven is regulated under the Program 2 requirements of 40 CFR 68.10.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies \n\n\n\nStolthaven New Orleans, LLC is committed to operating in a safe and compliant manner. \n\nEmployees involved in operating the 1,3-Pentadiene and Toluene diisocyanate (mixed isomers) handling facility are trained to identify and understand the hazards posed during the storage and transfer process.  Training includes the review of information pertaining to the hazards of 1,3-Pentadiene and Toluene diisocyanate (mixed isomers), process technology, process equipment, and emergency response procedures. The facility maintains written process safety information to enable employees involved in handling 1,3-Pentadiene and Toluene diisocyanate (mixed isomers) to identify and understand the hazards posed by these processes.  Written training information includes the physical properties of 1,3-Pentadiene and Toluene diisocyanate (mixed isomers), the health risks associated with chemical exposures, and material safety data sheets.
