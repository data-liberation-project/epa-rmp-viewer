      "SummaryText": "by an independent contractor.  The independent contractor performs the batch reactor operations using a mobile pipe reactor.  The batch operations consist of unloading the anhydrous ammonia from the rail car into the reactor and mixing it with water and phosphoric acid to produce ammonium phosphate fertilizer.  The contractor is responsible to OSHA for Process Safety Management compliance. Helena Chemical Company does not own or operate the formulation processes at the facility.\n\nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\n\nWorst case and alternative consequence analysis were completed for the ammonia storage process. The worst-case scenario release for the Hartley Facility assumed that all the contents in the largest single storage tank (a railcar) were released.  The release was modeled as if the ammonia tank was punctured on the side.  The resulting release of ammonia was modeled as a ground level horizontal jet.\n\nThe alternative (or more likely to occur) scenario assumes a rupture of a 3-inch line caused by an impact from a vehicle or some other source on the liquid ammonia transfer line during a major loading or unloading operation.  Although this event is classified as an alternative scenario, even an accident of this type is unlikely to occur due to the safety equipment operated by the independent contractor, and operating procedures that Helena uses to safeguard ammonia transfer operations.\n\nBoth the worst case and alternative scenario are overly conservative because even a 2-minute release is unlikely to occur because excess flow valves on the system should close immediately upon increased flow resulting from the severed transfer line.\n\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe Fertilizer Manager implements the risk management planning process at this Helena facility.  The Fertilizer Manager is assisted by other Helena staff, as directed.  The fertilizer handling process is implemented by an independent contractor.  \n\nTo ensure that its contractor is responsible to Helena for com"

Standards codified by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration at 29 CFR 1910.119 are not applicable to the operations at this facility because the facility is operated as a retail operation and is exempt from the OSHA standards. This electronic submittal provides conservative estimates of the offsite consequences of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia from the Hartley Facility located at 410 4th Street, Hartley, TX 79044.  The electronic RMP summarizes the policies and procedures implemented by the Hartley Facility to minimize the likelihood of an accident.  The electronic RMP also summarizes the actions that the Hartley Facility has taken to ensure that a response to a release (even though a release is unlikely) will be implemented in a proper and timely manner.\n\nPURPOSE FOR UPDATING RMP\n\nHelena is submitting this electronic RMP as its 5-year update.  As required for the 5-year update, the Hartley Facility has (1) reviewed its Registration Information, (2) verified the latitude and longitude coordinates, (3) confirmed the appropriate NAICS, (4) reviewed and updated its worst-case and alternative-case off-site consequence analysis scenarios, (5) revised the affected population estimates using the Landview\u00ae version 6 software, (6) updated its 5-year accident history, (7) reviewed its contingency plan to satisfy the emergency response requirements, (8) reviewed its Prevention Program as related to its training, compliance audits, maintenance procedures, and operating procedures.  \n\nFACILITY\n\nThe Hartley Facility is a retail agricultural chemical facility.  Anhydrous ammonia is unloaded from a railcar and batch processed through a reactor.  The process operations conducted at this facility are performed"
