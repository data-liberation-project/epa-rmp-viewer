The Air Liquide Galva facility is a food and beverage grade liquid carbon dioxide and dry ice manufacturing facility consisting of a CO2 purification and liquefaction (?CO2 Liquid?) process and a solid CO2 (?Dry Ice?) manufacturing process.  Contained within the CO2 Liquid process is a closed loop anhydrous ammonia refrigeration unit.  The closed loop anhydrous ammonia refrigeration unit provides the needed heat sink to remove heat from the CO2 process side\nAnhydrous ammonia is a hazardous chemical and subjected to federal and state laws.   Air Liquide Industrial has established policy and procedures to manage industrial systems and processes that contain anhydrous ammonia in accordance with applicable regulations in particular OSHA?s PSM (26CFR1910.119) and EPA?s RMP (40CFR68) regulations.  \n\nThe Galva facility Risk Management Program contains the technical and process information required to safely maintain and operate the anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system and minimizing the risk of an accidental release of ammonia to the environment.  The integrity of the ammonia refrigeration system was recently upgraded with the installation of a new ammonia refrigerant condenser.  Further, Air Liquide has completed its own update and revalidation of the Galva facility anhydrous ammonia refrigeration Process Hazard Analysis.   The results of the PHA will serve as the basis to improve the facility?s Risk Management Program.  Inspections and audits are also an integral part of Air Liquide?s Process Safety Management procedure and corporate safety oversight and compliance program. The Galva facility is now subject to inspections and audits by Air Liquide?s Health Safety and Environmental departments.  \n\nAir Liquide has reviewed and revised the Galva emergency action plan.
