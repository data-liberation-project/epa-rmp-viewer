Accident Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe Mosaic Fertilizer, LLC, Faustina Facility has a long standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training, emergency equipment, participation in St. James Parish emergency drills, meetings with other companies and the St. James Parish emergency operations center, and meetings with the Ascension Parish emergency response organizations.\n\nThis commitment is also consistent with the corporation's environmental, health and safety policy which provides that:\n\n1)  All facilities will be designed, operated, and managed to protect the health and safety of the employees and the public; \n2)  All employees will be educated on the applicable environmental, health and safety standards, and procedures; \n3)  Sufficient human and financial resources will be allocated to sustain these goals; \n4)  Audits will be conducted regularly to verify compliance with this policy.\n\nThese corporate policies also emphasize the importance of complying with OSHA's Process Safety Management standard, so that all employees and the surrounding community will be adequately protected from potential fire, explosion and /or toxic hazards associated with catastrophic releases.\n\nIt is Mosaic Fertilizer, LLC's policy to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated and hazardous substances.  If an accidental release does occur, Mosaic Fertilizer, LLC trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.  Mosaic Fertilizer, LLC has a comprehensive program for complying with safety and environmental regulations for all regulated and other hazardous substances handled.\n\n\n2.

The raw materials used in this process include molten sulfur, phosphate rock, natural gas mixtures (flammable), air and steam.  In the ammonia plant, a catalytic reaction involving natural gas, steam and air is used to manufacture anhydrous ammonia with carbon dioxide as a by-product.  Some of the anhydrous ammonia produced is then separated and stored for use in the granulation plants. In the granulation plants, phosphoric acid is reacted with the anhydrous ammonia to produce granular monoammonium phosphate and / or diammonium phosphate.  \n\nThe regulated toxic substance involved in these processes is anhydrous ammonia, which exceeds the threshold quantities at the Faustina facility. Regulated flammable substances involved in these processes that exceed threshold quantities include the flammable gas mixtures reacted and generated in the ammonia plant. \n\nAnhydrous ammonia is stored in a large refrigerated storage tank surrounded by a dike.  In addition to the anhydrous ammonia manufactured in the facility's ammonia plant, the Faustina facility also receives anhydrous ammonia via an underground commercial pipeline, as well as by ship and barge at the facility's river dock on occasion.   Natural gas is received at the facility by an underground commercial pipeline that is connected by piping to the ammonia plant.\n\n\n3. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nAnhydrous ammonia and flammable mixtures are regulated as highly hazardous chemicals under OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.  Based on the quantities of these substances present at the Faustina facility, the Faustina facility is subject to OSHA's PSM requirements, and therefore, the Faustina facility satisfies the eligibility requirements for a Program 3 Prevention Program under EPA's RMP.  The Faustina facility has fully implemented OSHA's PSM standard requirements and is using this program as its"

      "SummaryText": "lity has incorporated a number of redundant safety features to prevent and / or minimize releases of regulated substances: \n\nThe large refrigerated anhydrous ammonia storage vessel is actually double-walled.  The storage vessel is constantly monitored by operators for ammonia leaks and has continuous monitoring electronic leak detection equipment with control room alarm monitoring the annular space between the double wall for ammonia leaks.  Typically, the vessel operates significantly below maximum capacity.  In the event of a long-term compressor outage, the anhydrous ammonia could be flared; sent to another ammonia producer in nearby Ascension Parish; or consumed in the granulation plants.  In the event of a vessel rupture, there is a dike completely surrounding the vessel sufficiently high to contain its entire contents with a margin of safety.  There is also an internal dike within the main dike that would keep smaller spills from spreading out to the maximum area of the dike thus reducing spill evaporation.  A series of relief valves connected to a flare also protect the tank from overpressure.\n\nOther smaller pressurized anhydrous ammonia storage vessels in the ammonia plant have relief valves that are piped directly to a flare system or vented to atmosphere.  Other ammonia relief valves are placed such that a discharge is elevated and would be significantly diluted before reaching areas affecting people.  There are also automated shutdown systems for the anhydrous ammonia manufacturing plant at the site.\n\nMeasures to prevent the accidental release of the flammable gases in the ammonia plant and to minimize the effects of any accidental releases include: redundant instruments, backup systems, and water deluge systems.\n\n4. Five -Year Accident History\n\nThe five-year accident history includes a review of all accidental releases of regulated substances held above threshold quantities in covered processes that resulted in on-site deaths, injuries, or significant pr"

On October 11, 2006, the Ammonia Plant experienced an explosion and fire incident resulting from a process vessel failure.  The vessel and associated piping contained 16,450 lbs of process gas which included 2405 lbs of ammonia.  It is conservatively estimated that 5% - 15% of the released ammonia remained unburned, resulting in 120 lbs - 361 lbs of ammonia being released into the atmosphere.  No injuries resulted from this incident.  St. James EOC was contacted by local citizens indicating property damage.  A follow-up investigation into the calls and/or complaints as a result of the incident was conducted.  The accident resulted in approximately $3,500,000 of onsite property damage.\n\n\n5. Emergency Response Program\n\nMosaic Fertilizer, LLC, Faustina facility maintains a written emergency response program that is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The program consists of procedures for responding to releases of regulated and other substances, including the possibility of ammonia releases and fire or explosion.  \n\nMosaic Fertilizer, LLC, Faustina facility is located in St. James Parish Louisiana and is also very close to Ascension Parish.  When an emergency situation arises requiring outside assistance, Faustina's overall emergency response program is coordinated with the St. James Parish Emergency Operations Center (St. James EOC).  Via this organization, Faustina works closely with other emergency response organizations including the sheriffs of both parishes, St. James and Ascension Parish emergency response personnel, Louisiana State Police and Prevost Memorial Hospital in Donaldsonville.  Faustina has 24-hour capability to communicate with these organizations.  Faustina uses an Incident Command System for emergency response. \n\nMosaic Fertilizer, LLC, Faustina facility is an active member of the St."
