Accidental release prevention and Emergency response policies\n\n\n\n   The City of Newton Water Plant is committed to insuring public, employee, and environmental safety.   This is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that cover such things as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee participation in prevention of any gaseous release of chlorine.  In the unlikely event of a gaseous release we are coordinated with the Newton Fire Dept., our chlorine supplier, and water plant operators in written procedures to follow in the event of a small leak or a large one. Public and employee safety are our paramount concerns.\n\n\n\n2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances handled.\n\n  \n\n The Water Plant has only Chlorine as a regulated substance.\n\n    We have a maximum inventory of 8000 lb. This is in 4 separate cylinders of 2000 lb. each.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Worse Case Release Scenario(s) and The Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario.\n\n   \n\n   To perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the look-up tables and equations provided by EPA and RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\n\n\n  Toxic Worse case analyses:\n\n\n\n  The Worse Case scenario involves the catastrophic release of 2000 lb. of gaseous chlorine during the chlorination process.  The scenario involves this release in a 10 minute time period.  The Release rate is 200 lb./min.  A distance to endpoint of 1.3 miles is obtained which affects a residential population of 2572 persons within this distance. \n\n\n\n  Toxic Alternative-case analyses:\n\n\n\n  The Alternative Case Scenario involves a catastrophic release from Chlorination.  The scenario involves the release of 2.5 lb. of chlorine in a gaseous form in a 10-minu"

The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and The Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:\n\n  \n\n    The Newton Water Plant has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  A number of processes at our facility are subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.  Our plant is also subject to EPCRA  Section 302 notification requirements.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\n Process Safety Information 3/27/2004\n\n   Newton Water Plant maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, SDS sheets, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\n\n\n Process Hazard Analysis:\n\n\n\n   Our facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is What-if.  A team of qualified personnel undertakes the studies with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at regular intervals.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis is addressed in a timely manner.\n\n\n\n Operating Procedures:\n\n\n\n   Newton Water Plant maintains written procedures for the safe conducting of all plant activities and has designated personnel and safety equipment specifically for the use with chlorine.  Also included are procedures for the startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The processes are constantly discussed with any"

This ensures that all operators are current and competent in plant operations.  New employees are trained extensively in school and on-the-job training before being allowed to operate the plant.  Also all employees are certified by the State and hold certification degrees in water plant operations.  They are also required to obtain 6 hrs. Of certification schooling credits per year.  Any new operation or procedures are discussed and training done as needed.\n\n\n\n\n\n Mechanical Integrity:\n\n\n\n   Newton Water Plant carries out a documented repair record and maintenance schedule to ensure that equipment will operate as needed and at it working capacity. There are daily inspections of equipment and daily logs showing not only plant operations; chemicals received, chemicals used, and plant repairs.\n\n   Certain operators with an aptitude for mechanical equipment are schooled and the city has specialized maintenance personnel for heavy repairs and motor changing.  Any equipment needed to be repaired is evaluated as to priority and then repaired as quickly as possible.  The Newton WTP has installed new  vacuum regulators on the cylinder heads and eliminated the possibility of a pigtail failure (4/05/2000), also on 4/14/2003 new wiring was installed that in the event of any detectable leak two high volume fans would start automatically and disperse any chlorine before it could be a hazard.  On Dec.20,2002 the WTP, Newton Fire Dept., Newton Police Dept., and Catawba county Fire Marshal conducted a  simulated release of chlorine using Nitrogen.  The results were impressive,  the high volume fans  immediately dissipated any gas cloud.\n\n\n\n Management of Change:\n\n\n\n   The WTP has written lab procedures, operation procedures issued to all employees, any changes are no"

Teamwork is paramount in safe and  efficient operation of the plant.\n\n\n\n Pre-startup Reviews: \n\n\n\n   Any changes in plant procedures are relayed to all operators and put on the bulletin board for any and all employees to note and comment on.  Experience is a major factor in assuring smooth, efficient, and safe operation of all plant parameters.\n\n\n\n Compliance Audits:\n\n\n\n   Newton Water Plant conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  These audit are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions are undertaken in a safe manner.  Any plant operation problems are acted on very promptly and corrected or revised immediately.\n\n\n\n Incident Investigation:\n\n \n\n   Any release or even a possible release of a regulated substance is acted on immediately and operations are suspended till corrected.  Backups set up by the ORC can get the plant back on line and regulated substance problems are corrected in a timely fashion so as not to rush, but to do the job properly.\n\n\n\n\n\n Employee Participation:\n\n\n\n   All employees of the Newton WTP are strongly encouraged to participate in any and all plant operations. Their valued input helps keep the plant operating as a team and makes all employees feel as a valued employee and a functioning part of a well oiled operation.  No information concerning the plant or operations are kept from any operator.\n\n\n\n   Contractors:\n\n  \n\n   Contractors are hired A?told , and given MSD sheets on any chemical they may contact.  All Contractors are responsible to maintain a safety program while on City property and in the event of being around or working on a regulated substance they are required to have a WTP operator supervise any work as it is being done.  This is usually the ORC or senior operators.  Safet"

Five-year Accident record:\n\n  \n\n The Newton WTP has had one release of a regulated substance in the last 5 years.  The leak was small, less than the reportable limit. The source of the leak was identified, and prompt repairs made. Due to the stringent release prevention policies and the equipment available no further releases are expected."
