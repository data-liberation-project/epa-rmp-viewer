      "SummaryText": "The purpose of the Risk Management Program (RMP) is to comply with and provide documentation demonstrating compliance with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) rule for chemical accident prevention provisions as outlined in Part 68 of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations(CFR).  This rule applies to hazardous and/or flammable substances as identified in the CFR stored in an amount above the \"threshold quantity\" specified for that substance.  Dothan Utilities receives shipments of 150 lb. chlorine gas cylinders and stores all cylinders in a chemical storage facility located at the Little Choctawhatchee Waste Water Treatment Plant at 563 Clearwater Drive. This is a new storage building at a new location.  The location has changed also to a more secure facility.  The maximum quantity stored is 13,500 lbs.  This exceeds the \"threshold quantity of 2,500 lbs for chlorine as set by EPA.  Therefore in an effort to comply with the EPA's rule, Dothan Utilities implemented the first Risk Management Program in 1999.  This edition is an update to the 1999, 2004, 2007, 2009, 2012, and 2017 Risk Management Plans previously submitted and approved by EPA.\n\n\n\nDothan Utilities strives to keep abreast of the issues involving the safe handling of chlorine by providing training to employees pertaining to chlorine safety.  In the event of a chlorine gas release, Dothan Utilities has emergency response procedures in place; however, Dothan Utilities is a non-responding facility and as such is required to coordinate with local response agencies who will respond to the emergency at the chlorine storage facility."
