Figure 1-1 identifies the key positions within the corporate structure that will provide this support.  The Director of the Generating Station and the Environmental Health & Safety Specialist will provide overall guidance and recommendations in support of Process Safety Management Program and Emergency response support personnel.\n\n ? \n\n \n\n \n\n2.0   PROCESS AND SUBSTANCE SUBJECT TO 40 CFR PART 68\n\n\n\nThe Homer City generating station includes three coal-fired electrical generating units with a total capacity of 1,884 megawatts. A Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) system controls oxides of nitrogen (NOx).  The SCR system is capable of reducing NOx emissions by approximately 25,000 tons per year during the 12 months of continuous operation.  This NOx reduction provides a substantial benefit to the ambient air quality in terms of reduced ground level ozone concentrations.  An integral part of the SCR system is the storage and on-site transfer of anhydrous ammonia used as a reagent that reduces NOx emissions.  Anhydrous ammonia is regulated under U.S. EPA's Accident Release Prevention Program (40 CFR Part 68). Because anhydrous ammonia will be present in the SCR process in quantities well in excess of the 10,000 lb. threshold, the SCR process is subject to ARP regulations. \n\nThe Homer City generating station also utilizes relatively small quantities of anhydrous ammonia in the electrostatic precipitators (ESP) to enhance the control of particulate matter. The ESP process is capable of being supplied anhydrous ammonia from the main anhydrous storage tanks and therefore is subject to the risk management regulation.  \n\nAnhydrous ammonia is a colorless liquid or gas which is readily detectable by its extremely pungent odor.  In sufficient concentrations, an"

For this reason, anhydrous ammonia is regulated under the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management Standard at 29 CFR Part 1910.119 and the U.S. EPA risk management rule at 40 CFR Part 68.\n\nFor ammonia processes, the threshold quantity for coverage under 40 CFR Part 68 is 10,000 lbs.  Anhydrous ammonia is delivered to the site via tank truck and stored above-ground in three horizontally oriented cylindrical pressure vessels, with a combined storage capacity of 656,600 lbs (each filled to a maximum 85% of vessel volume).  Shipping and transfer of ammonia to the pressure vessels is carried out by trained qualified personnel provided by the vendor, using standard operating procedures that have been thoroughly reviewed for safety.  The unloading process is monitored from the boiler control rooms and plant security facility via video cameras.  The procedures minimize routine release of residual ammonia in the transfer hose by purging ammonia from the transfer hose back into the transport trailer. Ammonia is pumped from the storage area to the SCR area where it is vaporized, mixed with heated air and injected into the flue gas, which is then immediately passed through a catalyst material.  The reaction in the presence of the catalyst reduces the nitrogen oxide (NOx) and ammonia (NH3) mixture to nitrogen (N2) and water vapor (H2O).  \n\nThe U.S. EPA Risk Management Regulation identifies three levels of requirements for industrial processes.  Program 1 can be applied to any process which has not had a \"significant\" release of a regulated substance over the five year period prior to the RMPlan submittal date and for which the worst-case release does not affect \"public receptors\" (e.g., residences, parks and recreation areas, commercial/industrial facilities, hospitals).

Program 3 applies to processes, such as those present at the Homer City facility, which are subject to the OSHA PSM. Because the accident prevention elements of Program 3 are virtually identical to PSM, compliance with U.S. EPA Risk Management regulations also constitutes compliance with PSM. \n\n\n\n?\n\n \n\nFigure 2-1.    Layout of the Homer City Generating Station\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n3.0  OFF-SITE HAZARDS ASSESSMENT\n\n\n\nFor the purposes of developing and maintaining adequate RMPlans, the U.S. EPA has defined in its governing rules and guidance a series of modeling methods and assumptions which are to be utilized as administrative guides for planning purposes.  In order to standardize and simplify to a practical level the many factors that can potentially occur in an accidental release situation, some of these assumptions may not take into account the available preventive measures or mitigation methods that would diminish or even eliminate the implied risks that are suggested by \"worst-case\" analyses.  For that reason, both the results for the standardized \"worst-case\" defined by the U.S. EPA methods and an alternative case, which is considered by Homer City Generation LP  to be more realistically represent situations that may possibly, but rarely, occur within the lifetime of the facility, are presented and described.  \n\nAs noted, the Homer City Generation Station has used anhydrous ammonia in the ESPs since 1998.  No accidental release of ammonia has resulted in reportable on-site injury, off-site injury, Emergency response, or damage to property or the environment.  To ensure that mitigation measures and Emergency response plans are appropriate, potential release scenarios are considered.  Thus, the sections of the RMPlan which discuss both the worst-case and the alternative case, believed to be somewhat more probable, are meant to provide t"

The worst-case release scenario for the Homer City facility is a gaseous release from the anhydrous ammonia storage tank dispersed under stable meteorological conditions. The possibility of a worst-case type of scenario is extremely remote and virtually prohibited, given the design of the ammonia storage system and inspection and maintenance measures that Homer City Generation LP has taken as part of its ARP.   The alternative release considers more typical events and accounts for both passive and active mitigation measures.  However, automatic shutoff valves are not considered \"passive\" in the present case, and the water deluge system requires Emergency response actions from site personnel, so no credit for these mitigation measures has been taken in the calculation of potential maximum impact areas.   \n\n \n\n\n\nIn accordance with revised Risk Management Plan requirements promulgated on April 9, 2004 and in deference to the concerns of the Department of Homeland Security, this executive summary does not include a detailed description of the release scenarios and their consequences.
