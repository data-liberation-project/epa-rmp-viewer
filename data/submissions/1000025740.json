      "SummaryText": "It is the policy of City of Naples to operate a safe water treatment facility, reducing to the greatest extent possible any hazards associated with our processes and reducing any subsequent risk to the surrounding community, employees and the environment. It is our policy to promote a spirit of cooperation and team work among the employees at the Water Treatment Plant; it is also our policy to work with the surrounding community and local emergency response agencies, to promote a spirit of cooperation and teamwork to provide an effective contingency plan in the unlikely event that a process incident occurs at the facility. \n\n\n\nRegulated Substances\n\n\n\nThe primary activity at the Water Treatment Plant (WTP) is municipal water treatment. Chlorine is the only 40 CFR 68 regulated substance at the facility. Chlorine is used primarily as a disinfectant. The maximum amount of chlorine at the facility was  increased to 24 tons on 02/14/2007 to allow for additional supply in preperation for disasters.  The average amount of chlorine at the facility will remain at 20 tons.\n\n\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario (WCS)\n\n\n\nThe Worst-Case release scenario according to EPA's Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance document is \"the greatest amount held in a single vessel.\" The worst-case scenario is the complete release of chlorine from a one-ton container damaged during moving inside the storage building. The worst-case scenario may not consider the use of active mitigation such as emergency scrubbers.\n\n\n\nThe chlorine toxic enpoint defined by 40 CFR Part 68 is 0.0087 mg/l which is equivalent to 3 parts per million by volume (ppm). According to the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) Emergency Response Planning Guidline (ERPG)-2, this toxic end point is specified as \"the maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms "

      "SummaryText": "which could impair an individual's ability to take protective action.\"\n\n\n\nThe EPA's RMP*COMP? computer model was used to simulate the worst-case scenario. The maximum distance to toxic endpoint is 1.03 miles. This distance considered the mitigation provided by the building but did not include the use of active mitigation measures such as the emergency scrubber.\n\n\n\nA worst-case release is unlikely due to the materials of construction of the chlorine container. In addition, a comprehensive risk management program has been developed to prevent accidental releases.\n\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenario\n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario is a leak at the tank valve during change out of a cylinder with the emergency scrubber in operation. It is assumed that a one-ton container releases all of its contents within the Process/Chemical building. When the release is detected, the emergency scrubber is activated. There is no off-site impact for the alternative release scenario; all the chlorine gas was neutralized through the emergency scrubber. According to the instructions in the EPA's RMP*Comp? any distiance to endpoint less than 0.1 mile be reported as 0.1 miles.  This alternative release scenario is not likley to occur; however, it demonstrates that off-site impacts do not occur even for a complete release of a one-ton container when the active mitigation system is used.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nCity of Naples is in compliance with 40 CFR 68. The City has conducted a comprehensive review of the chlorine system as well as administrative, technical, operating and maintenance procedures, in addition to the other required program elements of the regulations.\n\n\n\nThe City has both passive mitigation, an enclosed building, and active mitigation, an emergency scrubber, to minimize the consequences of an accidental release. The Risk Management Program addresses actions to minimize the likelihood of an accidental release and to minimize the impact if one occurs.\n\n\n\nFi"

      "SummaryText": "ve-Year Accident / Incident History\n\n\n\nThe WTP has not had a reportable accident within the past five years; however there have been 2 incidents, none of which caused an injury or had a reportable quanity release of chlorine.  A brief discription of each follows: \n\n\n\n04/06/2010 while changing a one-ton container the employee had a minor leak at the regulator which was stopped immediately.  Investigation determined an incorrectly installed valve gasket; discussed SOP with employee, retrained in proper procedures.\n\n\n\n03/30/2009 while changing a one-ton container the employee had a minor leak at the valve stem and safety cap. Investigation determinded that cylinder valve was not completely closed by vendor. Discussed incident in safety meeting with all personnel, vendor changed internal inspection procedures due to incident.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\n\nThis facility has an emergency response program that is coordinated with the Collier County Comprehensive Emergency Response Plan (ERP) that has been prepared in accordance with all local, state and federal regulations.\n\n\n\nContinued training and practices documented in the RMP will continue to improve safety at the facility."
