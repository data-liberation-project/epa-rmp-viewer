      "SummaryText": "INTRODUCTION\n\nReliant Energy owns and operates a coal-fired, electric power generating station near Shawville, Pennsylvania.  This 1158-acre facility, known as Shawville station, is located 10 miles northeast of Clearfield, PA on the west branch of the Susquehanna River near state routes 879 and 970.\n\nShawville station employs approximately 98 full-time staff and a considerable number of contract employees during times of facility maintenance.  The secondary economic impact of the facility on its many material and services suppliers is significant.  For example, the station provides employment for many coal miners and trucking firms.\n\nThe facility generates 597 MW of power from two identical, 175 MW units and two other units rated at 122 and 125 MW respectively.  Each unit has a state-of-the-art pollution control system for particulate and special low Nitrous Oxide burners to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides.\n\n1.    ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES AT THE STATIONARY SOURCE\n\nReliant Energy?s policy is to comply with all applicable regulatory requirements, including those for accidental release prevention and emergency response.\n\n2.    THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\na.    PRIMARY ACTIVITIES ? The facility is a coal-fired, electric power generating station.\n\nb.    USE OF REGULATED SUBSTANCES ? Anhydrous ammonia is used at the Shawville Station as a fluegas conditioner.  The ammonia improves the ability of the electrostatic precipitators (ESPs) to remove particulate from the flue gas.  In this process, the ammonia is converted to ammonium sulfate and removed from the flue gas as particulate.\n  \nNo other toxic or flammable materials are stored at the facility in quantities above the regulatory threshold.\n\nc.    QUANTITIES HANDLED OR STORED ? The anhydrous ammonia is transported, stored and conveyed as a liquid up to evaporators.  A single 10,600-gallon storage tank for the anhydrous ammonia is located outdoors, adjacent to the ma"

Administrative controls are used to ensure that the tank is not filled above the 85% capacity level.\n\n3.    GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS \n\nIn order to minimize the potential for the accidental release of anhydrous ammonia at the facility a number of release prevention program initiatives and prevention steps have been instituted, including:\n\n-    A comprehensive OSHA Process Safety Management Program.\n-    The registration, installation and maintenance of the anhydrous ammonia pressure vessel in accordance with regulatory requirements and industry standards.\n-    The development of off-loading procedures for the receipt of anhydrous ammonia. These procedures require: each shipment to be physically monitored by an employee fully trained in process safety; the utilization of an off-loading checklist prior to and during each shipment received; and the requirement that all shipments of ammonia are received during weekdays, and daylight hours.\n-    The use of administrative controls to ensure that the tank is not filled above the 85% capacity level.\n-    The routine inspection and testing of the ammonia system and components to ensure system integrity and performance.\n-    The placement of the tank in an area between several structures, which provides a wind block to increase plume dispersion in the event of a release (although this is not accounted for in present RMP Comp distance calculations.\n-    A comprehensive training program for all plant personnel with regards to Process Safety Management and the hazards associated with the use, storage, and release of anhydrous ammonia.\n\nFIVE -YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe facility has not experienced any accidents as defined in 40 CFR Part 68 during the last five-years.\n\nTHE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe facility has prepared a detailed written emergency response plan that has been in place for many year"

The facility routinely conducts release related drills and the review of scenarios to ensure proper response activities in the unlikely event of release from the anhydrous ammonia system.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nAll of the facility?s safety programs and related initiatives, including the facility emergency response program, are reviewed periodically for improvement opportunities."
