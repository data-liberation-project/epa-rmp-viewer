The Plan includes an analysis of the potential offsite consequences of an accidental release, a five-year accident history, and a release prevention and emergency response program.  \n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nWilbur-Ellis has implemented release prevention and emergency response procedures to minimize the potential for accidental releases of hazardous materials.  Emergency response procedures including evacuation procedures and notification procedures have been implemented by Wilbur-Ellis.  In addition, Wilbur-Ellis has developed operating procedures and preventative maintenance activities to reduce the likelihood of accidental releases.\n\n\n\nThis Plan and the emergency response procedures document the accidental release prevention, safety, and emergency policies in place at Wilbur-Ellis.\n\n\n\nDescription of Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nWilbur-Ellis is located at 21450 County Road J in Fayette, Ohio (the \"facility\").  Wilbur-Ellis is a retailer of fertilizer in the form of anhydrous ammonia stored under pressure.  There are two anhydrous ammonia storage tanks located at the facility with capacities of approximately 18,000 gallons each.  The anhydrous ammonia is transferred from the storage tanks into 1,000-gallon nurse tanks.  A maximum total of 33 nurse tanks containing anhydrous ammonia are stored at the facility at any given time.  The contents of the nurse tanks are sold to the local farming community for use as fertilizer.  \n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\n  \n\nWilbur-Ellis has developed and implemented this Plan with the objective of complying with the requirements and guidelines set forth by the Federal Risk Management Pla"

The Plan's purpose is to enhance the facility's existing safety programs implemented at the site to reduce the possibility of accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia that could cause harm to employees, the public and the environment.  The emergency response program, documented in the emergency response procedures, includes accidental release prevention and chemical specific prevention steps.\n\n\n\nWilbur-Ellis ensures that equipment meets the appropriate industry standards prior to use.  Wilbur-Ellis implements operating procedures and maintenance procedures in accordance with manufacturer and industry specifications to prevent accidental releases at the facility.  Chemical specific prevention steps implemented at the site include excess flow valves, pressure relief valves, emergency shut off valves with cables that run along the length of the horizontal storage tanks for quick access, and ammonia training for personnel.\n\n \n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThere have been no qualifying accidents involving ammonia in the five-year period prior to the completion of this Plan.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\n\nThe facility coordinates with the Archbold Fire Department (\"fire department\") regarding specific actions to be taken in response to an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  The facility has established emergency evacuation procedures to evacuate the site and notify the appropriate agencies regarding a release.  The facility's emergency response program is documented in the facility's Emergency Response Procedures.  The emergency procedures contain the following key elements:\n\n\n\n1.    Procedures for informing local agencies responsible for responding to accidental releases.\n\n2.    Information on emergency health care.\n\n3.

Recommended actions include the following:\n\n\n\n1.    Evaluate potential installation of additional barricades around piping, tanks, and risers to prevent impact from vehicular traffic. \n\n2.    Ensure shipper safety compliance and maintenance are conducted and maintain records onsite.\n\n3.    Ensure disconnected valves are bleed into water tank for transfer hose. \n\n4.    Verify tabs are installed on saddles for anhydrous ammonia storage tanks.\n\n5.    Develop a complete approved equipment list with specifications and maintain documentation.\n\n6.    Seal the leaks observed in the vicinity of the pump and risers.\n\n7.    Evaluate potential installation of a fenced perimeter for added security.\n\n8.    Mitigate rust on anhydrous storage tank and nurse tanks and apply an approved coating.\n\n9.    Modify the existing storage tank saddles to extend to one-third of the circumference of the tank.\n\n10.    Ensure all underground piping is tested for leak tightness using a hydrostatic leak test.\n\n11.    Conduct periodic inspection to ensure valves and fittings and connections are free of leaks.\n\n12.    Ensure that piping used in the anhydrous ammonia system is of seamless construction.\n\n13.    Evaluate design or engineering data to confirm that bulkheads are constructed to withstand the force exerted in the event of a pull-away and are designed to \"shear\" and protect the plumbing..\n\n14.    Ensure that chock blocks are present and ready for use at the site.\n\n15.    Ensure that incoming trucks are checked to confirm the transfer hose provided is constructed of materials that are compatible and approved for use with anhydrous ammonia.\n\n16.    Evaluate venting ammonia to a container with water when bleeding the ammonia system.\n\n17.    Ensure that nurse tanks are locked and secured when not attended or in use.\n\n"
