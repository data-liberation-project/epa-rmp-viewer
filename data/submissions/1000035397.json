MWDSC provides approximately 60 percent of the drinking water used by nearly 16 million people living on the southern California coastal plain between Ventura County and the Mexican border.\n\n\n\nDisinfection is a critical process used by MWDSC in the treatment of its drinking water.  Disinfection helps to protect public health by killing pathogens in the water and preventing the spread of waterborne diseases.  The use of chlorine as a disinfectant in the treatment of drinking water and wastewater has been the dominant disinfection method in the United States since it was introduced, around the beginning of this century.  MWDSC currently utilizes bulk chlorine for disinfection at all of its water treatment plants, including the Robert A. Skinner Water Treatment Plant (Skinner Plant).\n\n\n\nAs one might expect from its superior disinfection properties, chlorine is a hazardous substance.  Thus, storing and handling chlorine can present a risk to employees and the public without proper precautions.  MWDSC regards safe practices in the storing and usage of chlorine to be of primary importance and has an excellent safety record with chlorine.  To further safe practices, MWDSC has constructed a Chlorine Containment and Handling Facility to contain all chlorine inside a building which is protected by vapor scrubbers.\n\n\n\nSkinner Plant's chlorine storage and usage process is subject to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program Rule (RMPR) and also to the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program regulation.  Both of these regulations require submission of a Risk Management Plan (RMP).  An integral part of the RMP is a summary of policies and procedures followed to safely operate the facility, including a description of the possible consequences in case of an accident and t"

The CCHF, which is equipped with two chlorine vapor scrubbing systems, was made to further enhance safety and mitigate offsite consequences of an accidental chlorine release.  \n\n\n\nThe information required in the RMP Executive Summary is provided below for the Chlorine System at the Skinner Plant.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nThe MWDSC accidental release prevention policy for chlorine involves a unified approach that integrates proven technology, trains staff in operation and maintenance practices, and uses tested and proven management system practices.  All applicable procedures of the State of California and EPA's RMP Prevention Program are adhered to, including key elements such as training, systems management, and emergency response.

Skinner Water Treatment Plant (Skinner Plant) is located at 33740 Borel Road in Winchester, California.  The plant is situated northeast of the I-15 and 215-freeway junction.  The facility was constructed in 1976 and covers 345 acres adjacent to Lake Skinner.  The plant is designed to treat drinking water, including disinfection with chlorine.  The facili"

Liquid chlorine is transferred by its own vapor pressure from an on-line storage vessel in each storage bay to one or more evaporators in each evaporator room.\n\n\n\nEach evaporator uses an electrically heated water bath to vaporize the liquid chlorine.  The chlorinators regulate the flow of chlorine gas (under vacuum) through venturi eduction to the ejectors.

Chlorine leak detectors are provided in the storage bays, evaporator rooms, chlorinator room and pipe tunnels.  Based on the concentration and location of chlorine detected, the leak detection system will activate a succession of safety measures, beginning with visual and audible alarms, the start-up of the chlorine neutralization system and shut down of the normal ventilation system, and finally, automatically closing storage vessel liquid chlorine angle valve.  The alarms are annunciated at the chlorine alarm panel as well as at the operator's console in the control room.  Once alerted, fully trained personnel will respond to assess the chlorine leak.  In addition, each storage vessel valve connecting to the process is provided with a remotely actuated (pneumatic) emergency shutoff system.  In case of a major chlorine leak, chlorine supply can be stopped almost instantaneously by closing the shutoff system, automatically or manually from any of three control panels: unloading platform, chlorine maintenance room, or control room.  Emergency showers and eyewash stations are also provided throughout the Chlorine Containment and Handling Facility including the scrubber system.\n\n\n\nA packed-bed chlorine gas scrubber system, consisting of two parallel scrubber units, is provided to neutralize an accidental release of chlorine gas from either storage bay, evaporator room, or the chlorinator room.

Information found during the investigation is reviewed by affected staff and added or used to revise operating and maintenance procedures.  \n\n\n\nFive-year Accident History Summary\n\n\n\nOne chlorine release that resulted in an injury occurred at the Skinner Plant during the last five years.  On February 2009, an incident occurred resulting in a minor release of chlorine gas from the Chlorine System.  The release occurred due to an insufficient seal between the gas angle valve and the manway cover plate on the chlorine cargo trailer.  An employee was exposed to chlorine gas as a result of the release.  The employee was not wearing proper PPE during the operation, which is required by safety policies and the operating procedures.  After initial advanced first aid from emergency responders, the employee was transported to the hospital for observation and was released after several hours with minor work restrictions.  Skinner employees and responding agencies worked in conjunction to tighten the valve and stop the release.  The release was within containment and there were no offsite impacts.\n"

      "SummaryText": "\n\n\nAll MWDSC water treatment plant managers and staff were immediately informed of this incident, the need to wear proper PPE and follow operating procedures during cargo trailer connection and disconnection was reaffirmed and all remaining chlorine cargo trailers in the MWDSC fleet were inspected to ensure proper angle valve installation.  In addition, operating and maintenance procedures and PPE instructions were reviewed and clarified and enhanced as needed. \n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program Summary\n\n\n\nSkinner Plant is a non-responding facility and, as such, does not have an emergency response plan. Skinner Plant has Operational Level HAZWOPER-trained plant employees who can handle incidental chlorine releases and will respond to emergency releases only to assess.  Skinner Plant also includes employees trained in Incident Command System, who can coordinate with and provide technical assistance to outside emergency responders.  Depending on the severity of the accidental release, external hazardous materials response agencies, such as the Riverside County Fire Department, will be called to handle a chlorine release.  Skinner Plant coordinates with local response agencies (Riverside County Fire Department) to help ensure that they are familiar with the Skinner Plant Chlorine System and its emergency requirements and that it is reflected in their Area Plans.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nNumerous changes to improve safety (recommended actions) were identified, evaluated and resolved for the chlorine process as a result of Process Hazard Analyses (PHAs) conducted prior to implementation of the new Chlorine Containment and Handling Facility, a significant additional safety enhancement and risk reduction measure. Further changes were identified in June 2006 and September 2007, when the process hazard and seismic risk analyses were updated to include the new chlorine containment and scrubbing system modification.  Finally, additional recommendations were develope"
