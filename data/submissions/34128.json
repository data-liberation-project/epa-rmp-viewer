The correction was necessary due to RMP program changes amended by the EPA on April 9, 2004 (69 FR 18819).  This correction supersedes a revision previously submitted on February 13, 2003.\n\nLast, the following executive summary has been reviewed and brought to current as of 06/15/2004. \n\n1.0  Facility Background\n\nWeyerhaeuser Co. owns and operates a fully integrated pulp and paper mill located in Marlboro County along the Great Pee Dee River about five miles west of Bennettsville, SC.  The location of the mill is in a rural, agricultural setting with a low population density in the vicinity of the mill.  The topography of the surrounding countryside is generally flat.  The largest nearby town or city is Bennettsville, SC located five miles east of the mill.  Bennettsville has a population of about 10,000.  \n\nThe mill employs both technically advanced processes as well as a non-traditional, highly educated, non-union work system.  In most ways, the mill is considered to be state of the art.  The mill produces grades of hardwood and softwood market pulps as well as various grades of printing, copier, and writing papers.   \n\n2.0  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nWeyerhaeuser  is committed to the safety of Weyerhaeuser  employees and the general public, and to the preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  Weyerhaeuser implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances.  In the event of an accidental release, Weyerhaeuser controls and contains, to the extent possible, the release in a manner that will be safe for employees and will help prevent injury to the public or the environment.  In addition, Weyerhaeuser will investigate incidents soon after they occur to determine the root cause(s) for t"

The four processes include a Lurgi R-6 process which manufactures chlorine dioxide (ClO2), a Sterling R-10 process which also manufactures ClO2, a chlorine (Cl2) railcar unloading and distribution system, and two identical raw water Cl2 treatment processes.  The Lurgi R-6, Sterling R-10, and Cl2 railcar unloading systems all support the bleaching operations of the pulp mill, while the raw water treatment processes serves to disinfect incoming river water from the Great Pee Dee River.  The following table serves to summarize the covered processes in use at Weyerhaeuser's Marlboro Paper Mill.\n\nProcess               Program Level               Regulated Substance               Process Qty               RMP TQ\nLurgi R-10                       3                            Chlorine Dioxide                       4,970 lbs.                1,000 lbs.\nSterling R-10                   3                            Chlorine Dioxide                     11,684 lbs.                1,000 lbs.\nChlorine Railcar               3                                  Chlorine                         180,000 lbs.                2,500 lbs.\n   Unloading\nRaw Water (no. 1 & 2)     3                                  Chlorine                           16,000 lbs. ea           2,500 lbs.       \n\n4.0 Overview of Covered Processes \n\nThis section exams the five RMP covered processes and provides details on each specific process.

      "SummaryText": "he Bleach Plant.  The Lurgi process uses three subsystems to accomplish the task of ClO2 manufacture.  The three process are the chlorate electrolysis process, HCl synthesis, and ClO2 generation.  The product of the three processes is ClO2, although none of the three processes in itself contains ClO2 over the threshold quantity listed in RMP regulations.  ClO2 is stored in two large storage tanks which results in this process being included in RMP.  It is important and significant to note, however, that in addition to the storage tanks, the entire Lurgi process is covered in the process hazard analysis (PHA).  Weyerhaeuser did not differentiate between the process and the storage tanks with regard to ClO2.  This position is a very conservative position with respect to RMP applicability.  In addition, the entire Lurgi process is included in all aspects of the mill's RMP/PSM prevention program.  The solution manufactured by the Lurgi process contains 0.085% pure ClO2. \n\n4.2.1  Sterling R-10 ClO2 Process\n\nThe Sterling process produces ClO2 liquid from a closed recirculating reactor.  In this case, sodium chlorate and sulfuric acid are added together in a closed dynamic reactor to produce ClO2 gas.  Methanol is also added to the reactor to serve as a catalyst.  ClO2 gas is drawn off the top of the reactor and routed to a chilled water absorption column where the chilled water strips the ClO2 out of the gas stream to form liquid ClO2, which is 0.01% pure ClO2.  This process was installed in 1998 and was subjected to pre-start up safety reviews as well as a pre-start up PHA.  Like the Lurgi ClO2 process, ClO2 is a product of the system and is stored in two 140,000 gallon tanks.  The entire Sterling process, though, was subjected to the safety reviews and PHA and is currently subjected to all facets of RMP/PSM programs.\n\n4.3.1 Chlorine (Cl2) Railcar unloading and Distribution System\n\nThe Marlboro Mill receives chlorine in 90 ton railcars for use in the process.

      "SummaryText": "chlorine is used as a make up chemical in the Lurgi ClO2 process and as a bleaching agent in the mill's pulp bleaching operations.  While the use of chlorine is anticipated to significantly decrease due to process changes, the receipt of 90 ton chorine railcars is not expected to end.  This system includes 90 ton railcars, two steam vaporizers, and associated distribution piping.  This system is covered under both RMP and PSM.\n\n4.4.1  Chlorine Raw Water Treatment, systems no. 1&2\n\nRaw River Water is pumped from the Great Pee Dee River through a treatment system for use as process water in the mill.  Part of the treatment system includes disinfection of the river water through the use of gaseous chlorine.  In this system, sixteen (eight in one system and a second eight in a second system) one ton chlorine cylinders are used to provide chlorine for disinfection.   The sixteen cylinders are divided into two systems and each system further divided into four such that at least four cylinders are connected together and are on-line at any time.  The sixteen one-ton cylinders are housed in their own buildings which provide shelter from weather elements.  System no. 1 contain eight cylinders adjacent to the raw water clarifier and system no. 2 contains eight cylinders near the intake structure.\n\n5.0  General Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nWeyerhaeuser's  Marlboro Mill takes a proactive view of preventing incidents related to releases of hazardous chemicals.

The policy manual is reviewed and revised as necessary to ensure that the mill complies with both rules.\n\n\n5.1 Process Safety Information\n\nProcess Safety Information consists of many different types of information related to hazardous chemicals and the processes that contain them.  Types of information that are available to all employees and contractors include MSDSs, Chemical Control Information, PSM/RMP files,  Engineering files, process specific safety information, and Weyerhaeuser Engineering standards.  \n\nMSDSs are available on the mill's intranet web site and therefore available to all mill employees.  In addtion MSDS hard copies are also located locally in Bennettsville at the Fire Department, LEPC, Hospital, and local company Doctor.  MSDSs are updated periodically.    The master MSDS files are kept in the Technical Servics Department.  In addition, information from MSDSs is entered in a chemical control spreadsheet where all pertinent safety, hazard, and disposal information is kept.  The chemical control information is located in the Technical Services Department. Special designated PSM/RMP files have been established to house all relevant information regarding PSM/RMP.  This includes all documentaion regarding incident investigations, PHA's, MOC's, PSI, and all other prevention areas.  Engineering files are updated as projects are implemented or changes made to the process.  All engineering files and vendor equipment files and information is located in a central mill engineering library.  The library is accessible by all mill personnel.  In addition, Weyerhaeuser has implemented corporate engineering standards to be used during the design phase of projects. \n\n5.2  Process Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nPHAs are conducted on all covered RMP/PSM processes at least every five years.

The teams which comprise PHA teams meet the requirements of PSM/RMP both in terms of quality and quantity of personnel.  PHAs are filed in the mill PSM/RMP file system.\n\n5.3 Standard Operating Procedures\n\nThe mill has implemented SOPs in every operating area, including the four RMP covered processes.  In every way, SOPs are a part of the Marlboro Mill culture and not just part of RMP.  SOPs consider the correct operating procedures and techniques for equipment and processes, consider safety risks and precautions, include  job safety analyses (JSAs), establish normal operating ranges and targets, incorporate start up and shut down procedures, and are established for maintenance activities.  SOPs are routinely updated through the Technician review process.  This frequent review results in SOP continual improvement.  Knowledge and demonstration of skills required by SOPs is a part of a Technician's promotion process.  Many  SOPs consider safe work practices such as fall protection, hot work permit requirements, confined space entry requirements, lock out/ tag out procedures, and hole watch responsibilities.  \n\n5.4  Training\n\nAll new Marlboro Mill employees go through PSM/RMP training as part of their new employee training process.  In addition, all Marlboro Mill employees have refresher training at least every three years for RMP and PSM systems.  In the PSM/RMP affected processes, employee training can occur on an annual basis.  In addition, training for all affected teams occurs after an incident investigation is completed in their business unit.  The objective is to ensure that all teams receive and understand the outcome of the incident investigation.  All training events are documented and filed with the mill's training coordinator who then archives all training activities.  In addition, writt"

This ensures employees retain information presented during the training sessions.\n\n5.5  Mechanical Integrity\n\nThe Marlboro Mill uses a computer based maintenance system, called Impac, to manage maintenance and mechanical integrity activities.  All response maintenance work orders as well as preventive maintenance inspection work orders are entered through Impac.  In addition, after the work order is completed, the results of the work, particularly for PM inspections, can be stored in the Impac system.  This allows for a good mechanical integrity history to be compiled for all equipemnt.  In addition, the Impack system is able to rate the priority of work requests by the priority rating which has been assigned to each process.  By using this system, all PSM/RMP covered processes receive the highest rating allowing prompt response to mechanical and maintenance issues as they arise.  Last, the Impac system is able to generate inspection work orders for covered processes based on  frequency originally inputted into Impac.  This allows for vendor required routine inspections to take place on the prescribed frequency.\n\n5.6 Management of Change (MOC)\n\nThe Marlboro Mill has implemented an MOC system for all covered processes such that any proposed change or modification to a covered process must first be reviewed for process safety considerations.  A team comprised of operating, engineering, maintenance, and process control personnel meet periodically to review MOC requests.  Changes to the process can only occur after the MOC team approves the request.  All MOC requests are documented and filed in the RMP/PSM file system.   In addition, any PSI or engineering documentation change required because of an approved MOC are noted on the MOC form for follow up.\n\n5.7  Pre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSR)\n\nPSSRs are conducted for any startup of projects that occur within the boundary of a covered proce"

The PSSR is conducted by operating, maintenance, engineering, and process controls personnel to ensure that all systems are verified safe prior to starting up.  PSSR forms are used to facilitate the PSSR as well as document the PSSR.  PSSR will verify that the physical system is as engineering drawings indicate, that valving and physical controls are set according to SOPs, and that process controls are operating per the design.\n\n5.8  Compliance Audits\n\nFormal compliance audits are conducted on an every three year basis per the requirements of PSM and RMP.  These audits are third party audits and are used to uncover and correct program deficiencies.  The last third party audit was conducted in 2000.  Recommendations stemming from the audit were categorized, prioritized, and assigned to individuals to complete.  A task group of technical support personnel met monthly tracking the status of work against audit recommendations until all recommendations were completed.   In addition, internal audits are conducted on a frequent basis to uncover soft spots in the program.   The same task group continues to meet on at least a semi-monthly basis to review implementation of the PSM/RMP program.\n\n5.9  Incident Investigation\n\nAfter each incident or near miss in a covered process, a formal incident investigation will occur.  The incident investigation uses a team approach where a technical facilitator (the Tech Services Manager) will facilitate a group of persons investigating the incident.  The group will always include operating technicians and managers associated with the incident, process controls personnel, process and project engineers, and maintenance personnel.  \n\nThe investigation objective is to identify incident root cause(s) as well as surface causes and to develop a list of recommendations designed to prevent reccurrence.  The list of recommendations is presented to mill management for reconciliation.  In addition, the investi"

Employee participation minimizes the consequences of releases of toxic, reactive, flammable, or explosive chemicals.  Communication is encouraged between and among all levels of the organization.  To promote and incorporate safety as a part of our business culture, at a minimum, monthly safety meetings are required for all mill employees.  These safety meetings are documented for each employee.  In adddition, the mill has implemented a central safety committee with millwide representation to set goals for safety performance as well as implement safety initiatives.  Next, each mill business unit has its own safety committee which develops safety goals and expectations for that business unit.  The business unit's safety goals support the mill's goals while tailored to meet specific department needs.    In addition, daily safety meetings and discussions are held within each operating and support team in the mill on a daily basis.  Millwide goals and safety results are communicated on a broad and frequent basis ensuring that all employees are aware of mill and department safety results.  \n\n5.11  Hot Work Permits\n\nThe mill has in place a hot work permit system for all cutting and welding acitivities within the mill, including the four RMP covered processes.  Hot work permit refresher training occurs on an annual basis for all mill and contractor personnel.    \n\n5.12  Contractors\n\nContractors are an integral part of our business success.
