Facility Policy: The owners, management and employees of Farmer's Cooperative Company are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia and propane. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department or other authorities to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the people and the environment\n\n2. Facility Information: The facility is a country grain elevator which stores and blends fertilizers and sells propane on a retail basis. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for both direct application and for blending into mixed-grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients. It is stored at the facility in one 18,000 gallon and 0ne 26,000 gallon storage tanks. The maximum quantity stored would be 187,000 pounds. Propane is stored at a separate site in one 18,000 gallon tank and is used for grain drying. The maximum quantity stored would be 56,600 pounds.\n\n3. The worst case scenario would be the release of the total contents of the largest storage tank as a gas over a period of 10 minutes. Anhydrous ammonia: The maximum quantity released would be 110,500 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest tank at 85% capacity as limited by design standards. the distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 parts per million, ppm) is 2.2 miles. Propane: The maximum quantity released would be 56,600 pounds. The distance to the endpoint (point of 1.0 psi overpressure) is 0.3 miles or 1,580 feet.\n\n4. The alternate release scenario, based on the five-year accident history, or the most likely potential incident, is a release from a break in a transfer hose. Anhydrous ammonia: the maximum quantity released would be 26,640 pounds. The distance to the endpoint would be 1.2 miles. Propane: The maximum quantity released would be 69 poundds. The distance to the endpoint would"

The ANSI Standard, K-61.6, Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia has been adopted by reference by Iowa Administrative Code Part 21 - Chapter 43 - Rule 43.6 (200).\n\n6. Five Year Accident History: The facility has had no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia or propane in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries or significant property damage at the facility, nor to our knowledge, have resulted in any off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\n7. Emergency Response Program: The facility has: a written action plan, in accordance with OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.38; provided state and local authorities with the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA) and a written emergency response program in accordance with OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.120, including pre-emergency planning and employee training.\n\n8. Planned Changes to Improve Safety: Safety improvement is an ongoing process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions. There are no additional specific safety recommendations regarding storage or use of anhydrous ammonia or propane for implementation at this time."
