Specific information such as storage quantities, hazard assessment data, training dates, Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) dates, etc. is included in the Section 1.22 Audit Report.  This information is updated every three years when Tighe & Bond performs the mandatory RMP audit.  The executive summary also includes the RMP electronic submittal forms.  The RMP electronic submittal form must be re-submitted to the EPA within five years of the initial submission or sooner under the following conditions:\n\n\n\n?    No later than three years after a newly regulated substance is first listed by the EPA\n\n\n\n?    No later than the date on which a newly regulated substance is first present in an already covered process above a threshold quantity\n\n\n\n?    No later than the date on which a regulated substance is first present above a threshold quantity in a new process\n\n\n\n?    Within six months of a change that requires a revised PHA\n\n\n\n?    Within six months of a change that requires a revised offsite consequence analysis and defined as a decrease/increase to endpoint by a factor or two\n\n\n\n?    Within six months of a change that alters the program level that applied to any covered process\n\n\n\nNOTE:  If a facility is no longer subject to the regulation, the owner or operator shall re-submit a revised registration to the EPA within six months indicating that the facility is no longer covered.  \n\n\n\nTighe & Bond will notify you at your five anniversary to perform the RMP re-submittal.  In the interim, the Risk Management Program Coordinator or their designees (RMPC) periodically reviews the above criteria to determine if a re-submittal should be made at a shorter time interval.  \n\n\n\nThe photographs found in the executive summary represent conditions at the time of the initial RMP development.

Please note that the RMPC is a collective term which refers to the overall RMP program manager as well as anyone this individual may designate to assist them with the implementation of this program.\n\n\n\nThe RMPC reviews the assignments found below with the Facility and assigns responsibilities accordingly.  Management recognizes assigned responsibilities and provides adequate resources to help ensure compliance.\n\n\n\nSeveral positions and responsibilities are identified in this section.  In addition, the tasks are further detailed in each section write-up of this document.  The RMPC assigns general responsibilities as shown in the Section 1.22 Audit Report.\n\n\n\n1.3    HAZARD ASSESSMENT\n\nAs discussed in Section 1.0 (executive summary) of this RMP, the hazard assessment is periodically reviewed and re-submitted to the EPA as necessary.  This hazard assessment in Section 3 of the RMP also includes maps which delineate the off-site consequence analysis.   This information is provided to the Local or State Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC) and the local fire department or HAZMAT response team.   The local agencies should also receive a copy of the emergency response plan and Tier II forms.\n\n\n\nThe RMP regulation requires facilities to conduct a public meeting on the facility hazard assessment; information released to the public must also be reported to the Federal Bureau of Investigation.  \n\n\n\n1.4    PROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION\n\nImportant health and safety information is readily available for the chemical and processes for a variety of reasons (e.g. emergencies, equipment maintenance, etc.).  A significant amount of this information is found primar"

However, the facility reviews the list found in Section 4.4 of the RMP, as well as the written compliance programs, and provides additional information when necessary (e.g. equipment manuals, inspection records, etc.).  \n\n\n\n1.5    PROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS\n\nA Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) has been performed at the facility and is included in Section 5.5 of the RMP.   Appropriate facility employees and outside contractors were involved in this process.  \n\n\n\nThe PHA has identified a number of action items which need to be addressed along with priority codes.  Upon completion of these activities, the corrective actions are documented and the information is filed with the process safety information.  As previously discussed, photo-documentation of corrective actions (when applicable) is included in the Executive Summary.\n\n\n\n1.6    OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS\n\nStandard Operating Procedures either existed or were developed for the facility.  These include programs such as lockout/tagout, confined space, hot work permit, chemical procedures, etc.  A number of these programs have standard operating procedures and checklists which are requisite for documenting regulatory compliance, particularly for the regulated process.  The instructions for completion of the forms are included in the RMP document.\n\n\n\nFor example, the Safe Work Permit Procedure found in Section 6.0 of the RMP is used to ensure that work in the process areas complies with a variety of standard operating procedures.  Whenever work is performed in the process areas, a safe work permit is completed.\n\n\n\nThe use of other standardized permits/checklists is documented in accordance with the procedures outlined in the programs.  For example, documentation is maintained for procedures such as confined space entry.  As previously discussed, the facility may use the existing forms or substitute an equivalent"

Individuals who have been certified in the process are included in the training certification document found in Section 7.0 of this RMP or the Section 1.22 Audit Report.  Any new employees who are expected to operate or work on this process should be first provided with specific operational training and included in the training certification list.\n\n\n\nAll other affected employees or contractors receive awareness level training in accordance with Section 7.0 of this RMP (e.g. emergency procedures, hazard communications, etc.).\n\n\n\n1.8    MECHANICAL INTEGRITY\n\nThe facility ensures the integrity of process equipment by determining that the equipment is maintained, designed installed and operating properly.  The primary emphasis behind mechanical integrity is preventative maintenance.  The majority of process equipment has standard operating manuals and maintenance procedures that are kept in the office file.\n\nThe facility ensures that recommended maintenance is performed on process equipment in accordance with manufacturer's recommendations.  In addition, modifications to existing systems are performed in accordance with manufacturer's recommendations.  The facility then uses a preventative maintenance file system to update and document compliance.\n\n\n\n1.9    MANAGEMENT OF CHANGE\n\nThe facility establishes and implements written procedures to manage any change to the facility or to the process chemicals (e.g. introduction of new chemicals).  This procedure is implemented by using the Management of Change forms (MOC) found in Section 9.0 of the RMP.\n\n\n\nThese forms provide a system which evaluates potential changes to the system and potential effects on the process safety operation.  The forms are completed any time there is a change to the process which could affect the overall saf"

All RMPC designees are familiar with this process.\n\n\n\n1.10    PRE-STARTUP SAFETY REVIEW\n\nThe facility performs a pre-startup safety review (PSSR) as necessary for new or modified facilities.  The checklist found in Section 5.0 (PHA) of the RMP provides the necessary information to review and evaluate potential modifications to the existing process.  This PSSR process is started as soon as possible in the conceptual design of the project.\n\n\n\nIf there are any renovations or facility changes which would impact the process systems, it is required that the forms found in Section 10.0 (Action Item Documentation) of the RMP be completed and that any action items be incorporated into the project.  Appropriate changes may also be necessary in standard operating procedures (e.g. lockout/tagout, emergency plan, operating procedures, etc.).  These can be made through Section 9 (Management of Change Procedures) of the RMP.\n\n\n\n1.11    COMPLIANCE AUDITS\n\nComprehensive compliance audits are performed at least every three years, while some specific programs (e.g. operating procedures, lockout/tagout, etc.) are reviewed annually by the RMPC or his designees.  One of the key points of the RMP is ensuring that actual written procedures are implemented.  The audit process evaluates whether written procedures are actually implemented.  The level of detail in the audit will vary depending upon the operation.  The results of the audit are documented and incorporated into the facility RMP Plan. \n\n\n\n1.12    INCIDENT INVESTIGATION\n\nThe facility investigates every incident that results in, or could have reasonably resulted in, a catastrophic release of highly hazardous chemicals within 48 hours of the incident.  We recommend that all accidents be investigated.  The standard investigation system for evaluating these types of accidents is included in Section 12.0 or the RMP.  This includes an investigation form which must be completed at the time of the accident.\n\n\n\nUpon comp"
