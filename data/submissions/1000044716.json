The facility has approximately 87 full time plant employees and operates 24 hours/day, 7 days/week, 52 weeks/year.\r\n\r\nThe facility operates an ammonia refrigeration system as part of the process to keep products and raw materials fresh.  40 CFR 68.130 lists anhydrous ammonia as a hazardous chemical subject to RMP regulation with a threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds.  The current capacity of the system exceeds 10,000 pounds.\r\n\r\nAmmonia is recirculated in the system as a liquid and gas depending on system operating pressures and temperatures.  The refrigeration system is designed, installed and operated in accordance with the applicable guidelines and standards of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), the American National Standards Institute (ANSI), the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR), the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-conditioning Engineers, Inc. (ASHRAE).  \r\n\r\nFive Year Accident History\r\n\r\nThe facility has not experienced an accidental release of ammonia during the previous five years that resulted in deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\r\n\r\nRelease Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nThe facility has evaluated and reported one worst case scenario and has evaluated alternate scenarios and reported one which will result in an offsite impact that is more likely to occur than the worst case scenario.\r\n\r\nThe system is monitored and inspected by technicians that are trained, qualified, and experienced in ammonia refrigeration in accordance with the facility's PSM program.
