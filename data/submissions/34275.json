      "SummaryText": "Per the requirements of Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 as codified in Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68, this Risk Management Plan (RMP) is submitted to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) in a timely manner for the Boise Cascade St. Helens, Oregon facility, which handles one or more regulated substances listed in Appendix A of Part 68.\n\n1.1 STATIONARY SOURCE & REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\nBoise Cascade owns and operates a pulp and paper mill located in St. Helens, Oregon, which is an existing major stationary source per the requirements of Title V of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.  The regulated substances handled by this facility is chlorine dioxide, which is considered hazardous by the US Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA).\n\nThe St. Helens mill produces pulp and paper from wood chips and sawdust using the Kraft process.  Chlorine dioxide are used in the bleach process to remove lignin from the fibers and to whiten the pulp.\n\nChlorine dioxide is generated on site by the R-8 process which uses sodium chlorate, methanol, and sulfuric acid as a raw materials; these chemicals are not regulated under the risk management plan.  The generated chlorine dioxide is absorbed into water stored as a dilute aqueous solution (11.5 g/l).  The maximum quantity of chlorine dioxide that can be stored or handled at this facility is 39,713 pounds.\n\n1.2 ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION & EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAMS\nBoise Cascade takes a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  The St. Helens mill uses several management systems and adheres to industry and national standards to meet this goal.\n\nThe use and storage of chlorine dioxide at the St. Helens mill is covered by the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29 CFR 1910.119).  Boise Cascade adheres strictly to the PSM standard and focuses many of its safety efforts around PSM.  The PSM program"

      "SummaryText": "requires Boise Cascade to take specific efforts to identify and mitigate process hazards, including:\n* Providing process and chemical safety information to employees,\n* Performing process hazard analyses,\n* Writing and implementing written operating procedures,\n* Training process operators on the safe operation of equipment,\n* Identifying and maintaining critical process safety equipment,\n* Managing and communicating process changes,\n* Performing pre-startup safety reviews,\n* Performing internal audits of compliance with the PSM standard,\n* Investigating accidents to find root causes and preventing future accidents,\n* Involving employees in the PSM process,\n* Requiring permits for hot work, and\n*  Implementing a safety program for contractors.\n\nAlthough an accidental chemical release is unlikely, Boise Cascade prepares for releases and other emergencies.  The St. Helens mill has developed a written response plan which is discussed is detail in Section 1.5.  Boise Cascade employees routinely practice responding to simulated releases and emergencies, and coordinates with community responders such as the St. Helens fire department.\n\n1.3 FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThe Boise Cascade St. Helens facility has had three releases of a regulated material that resulted in an injury in the last five years.  There have been no releases of regulated materials which have resulted in deaths, significant property damage, or any known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage in the last five years.\n\n1.4 EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nIn addition to the prevention program, Boise Cascade has developed and implemented a written emergency response plan to effectively respond to accidental chemical releases.  This plan identifies roles for plant personnel in the event of a number of different scenarios.  The plan includes specific tasks for key personnel during responses, emergency plant shutdown procedures, steps to contain and hand"

      "SummaryText": "le releases of specific materials, specific information on how to contact community response agencies and the public, and information on training employees and community responders in safe response techniques.\n\nThe St. Helens mill trains regularly on its emergency plan.  This training includes general mill employees, members of Boise Cascade's response team, and community responders.  Training exercises are evaluated, and the plan is updated when deficiencies are identified.\n\nBoise Cascade maintains an emergency response team that is trained to respond to many different types of emergencies.  The team is made up of workers from different shifts and is always ready to respond.  The team regularly conducts response drills, often including community responders.\n\n1.5 PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nBoise Cascade has identified no major unresolved process hazards in the chlorine or chlorine dioxide systems.  No major revisions to those processes are currently planned.  However, Boise Cascade follows a policy of continuous process safety improvement."
