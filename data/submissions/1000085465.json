Anhydrous ammonia is received by a tanker truck delivery and is transferred into the high-pressure receivers into one (1) of the three (3) systems at the facility.  System 1, referred to as the main system, has a high pressure receiver located on the southwest corner of the facility and is designed to store a maximum of thirteen thousand (13,000) pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  The facility also has two smaller systems referred to as the 300-ton system and the 150-ton system.  The 300-ton system is designed to store a maximum of nine thousand (9,000) pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  The 150-ton system current is designed to store a maximum of three thousand (3,000) pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  Three (3) systems were designed, installed, and maintained so that a catastrophic failure of one (1) system will not affect the other two (2) systems.\n\n\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n\n\nEmpire Kosher Poultry, Inc. is committed to operating all of its' facilities in the safest possible condition to protec"
