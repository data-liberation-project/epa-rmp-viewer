Should an accident occur, the facility has orientated the local fire department so they can plan for response to any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\nFacility Information\n\nThe primary activity at the RLCD Water Plant is producing and distributing potable water for several communities and satellite water districts.  In conjunction with the treatment of the raw water supply, RLCD personnel handle and store liquid chlorine used for disinfection purposes.  The maximum quantity stored on-site, in the chlorine room, is 26,000 pounds (13 full ton cylinders).\n\nWorst Case Scenario\n\nThe worst case scenario would be the release of the total contents of one 1-ton cylinder over a 10-minute period.  The maximum quantity released would be 2,000 pounds, which represents the volume of one storage cylinder.  The distance to the endpoint of dispersion based on RMP*Comp is 2.2 miles.\n\nAlternative Case Scenario\n\nThe alternative case scenario is assumed to be a release from a <-inch hole in one 1-ton cylinder.  The estimated release rate is 65 pounds per minute over a 15-minute period.  The distance to the endpoint of dispersion based on RMP*Comp is 0.3 miles.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of chlorine for the covered process in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site.  To our knowledge, no accidental releases have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environment"

      "SummaryText": "al damage.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe RLCD Water Plant has a written emergency action plan in accordance with OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.38 and provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III of EPCRA.  Our emergency response action plan has been reviewed with the local fire department for coordination efforts in the event of an emergency.\n\nSafety Improvements\n\nSafety improvements are an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe practices and procedures.  There are no additional specific chlorine safety recommendations for implementation at this time.\n\nFuture Upgrade to the Chlorination System\n\nThe RLCD Water Plant is currently in the process of switching to alternative disinfection techniques.  It is anticipated that by the end of 1999 the facility will no longer store or use a 112r chemical above the EPA RMP threshold."
