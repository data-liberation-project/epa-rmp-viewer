      "SummaryText": "San Sebastian Filtration Plant is located at the Carretera 449, Km 0.4 Sector Los Tanques Bo Calabazas, San Sebastian, Puerto Rico, 00685.  This water treatment plant is owned by Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority (PRASA) which is a Government Agency.\n\nPRASA has developed the RMP following the Program #3 for the Management and Prevention of Risks associated with the storage and handling of the toxic substance used as for water disinfection: Chlorine. The RMP was prepared in compliance with EPA 40 CFR Part 68. The prevention program was prepared in accordance with OSHA Process Safety management (PSM) regulation as established in 29 CFR Part 1910.119.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release:\n\nIt is PRASA policy to comply with EPA and OSHA Federal and State applicable requirements. Chlorine is a toxic substance regulated by EPA, for that reason San Sebastian Filtration Plant is already observing required engineering controls.  Changes have been put in place to improve security and as a part of the Prevention Plan implanted to protect the wellness of workers, employees, contractors, visitors and immediately surrounding areas and inhabitants.\n\n\n\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated Substance handled.\n\nSan Sebastian Filtration Plant is located close to the area where the plant supplies the potable water.  The chlorine is used as a disinfectant to destroy the microorganism that could cause illness in humans.  The chlorine is delivered from the PRASA Storage center in Puerto Nuevo to the plant in 1 ton containers. Two containers have flexible connection that are connected to the vacuum operated chlorinator valves and through one of them, the dosified chlorine flows to the ejectors where the chlorine is combined with water and then sent to the injections points in the process of the plant. \n\n\n\nWorst Case Scenario:\n\nThe Worst Case Scenario was determined as indicated in the EPA Wastewater Treatment Plant, as per Appendix F, Supplemental Risk Management Program Guidance for Wastewater Trea"

      "SummaryText": "tment Plants. This guidance considers the release of the Chlorine Gas of the entire container (2,000 pounds) during 10 minutes and other specifications related to the weather conditions and a radio of 1.3 miles, for a chlorine concentration equal or higher than 3 ppm.\n\n\n\nAlternative Case Scenario:\n\nThe more realistic scenario was also simulated as per EPA Wastewater Treatment Plants parameters, as a release of the total content of a 2,000 pounds container, but throughout a pipe leak.  \n\n\n\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention Program: \n\nDifferent Standard Operational Procedures (SOP) are already in place to comply the OSHA and PROSHO requirements in order to keep all the involved parties aware of the hazardous and risk related to the Chlorine.  List of all SOP?s are indicated in the PSM report and are located in the plant.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program:\n\nPRASA has various SOPs to manage emergency programs associated to a release of the chemical and also related to the emergency actions to be taken before and after hurricanes and other atmospherics events.\n\n\n\nFive years Accident History:\n\nNo mayor release of chlorine in excess of ten (10) pounds has been reported during the last five years. \n\n\n\nAudit:\n\nThe last compliance Audit was conducted on october 16,2012. But during the past two years we have conducted internal metrics evaluations. With each internal metrics evaluation, we request an action plan to correct the findings. PRASA has develop these metrics evaluation to establish the level of compliance of our facilities with RMP/PSM Program."
