THE FACILITY POLICY\n\nTHE OWNERS, MANAGEMENT, AND EMPLOYEES OF MANSFIELD STORE ARE COMMITTED TO THE \nPREVENTION OF ANY ACCIDENTAL RELEASES OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA AND PROPANE. IF AN ACCIDENTAL RELEASE SHOULD OCCUR, THR FACILITY IS PREPARED TO WORK WITH THE LOCAL FIRE COMPANY, OR OTHER AUTHORITIES TO MITIGATE ANY RELEASE AND MINIMIZE THE IMPACT OF THE RELEASE TO PEOPLE AND THE ENVIRONMENT.\n\n2.  FACILITY INFORMATION\n\nTHE PRIMARY ACTIVITY AT THE FACILITY IS THE STORAGE AND BLENDING OF FERTILIZER FOR  \nSALE TO FARMERS AND PROPANE SALES AND DELIVERY.  ANHYDROUS AMMONIA IS USED FOR CROP PRODUCTION NUTRIENTS.  PROPANE GAS IS RECEIVED, STORED, AND DISTRIBUTED FOR DELIVERY FOR HOME HEATING FARM AND COMMERICAL BUSINESS USES.\n     \nTHE MAXIMUM QUANTITY OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA STORED WOULD BE 264,000 POUNDS IN OUR\n18,000 GALLON STORAGE TANK AND NURSE TRAILORS.  THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY HANDLED WOULD BE THE UNLOADING OF A TANK TRUCK HOLDING 40,000 POUNDS.\n\n     THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY OF PROPANE GAS WOULD BE 108,000 POUNDS IN OUR ONE 30,000\n      GALLON STORAGE TANK. THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY HANDLED WOULD BE THE UNLOADING\n      OF A TANK TRUCK HOLDING 40,000 POUNDS.\n\n\n3.  THE WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO.\n \nA. THE WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO FOR ANHYDROUS AMMONIA WOULD BE THE RELEASE\n     OF THE TOTAL CONTENTS OF A STORAGE TANK RELEASED AS A GAS OVER TEN MINUTES. THE\n    MAXIMUM QUANTITY RELEASED WOULD BE  120,000 POUNDS, WHICH REPRESENTS THE VOLUME\n    OF THE STORAGE TANK AT 85 PERCENT CAPACITY AS LIMITED BY DESIGN STANDARDS. THE\n    DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT (POINT OF DISPERSION TO 200 PPM) IS 1.09 MILES.\n\n A. THE WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO FOR PROPANE GAS WOULD BE THE FAILURE OF ONE 30,000 GALLON STORAGE TANK WHEN FILLED TO 85 PERCENT CAPACITY (108,000 POUNDS) RESULTING IN A\n      VAPOR CLOUD EXPLOSIO"
