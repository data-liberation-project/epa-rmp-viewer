      "SummaryText": "The accidental release prevention policy at this facility is proper employee training and tank handling procedures during transfer, connection and disconnection of cholorine stroage tanks; also training in proper maintenance of storage and process equipment. The emergency response policy at the facility is to immediately notify the Acadia Parish Office of Emergency Preparedness through 911.\r\n\r\nThe stationary source consist of two(2) one (1) ton cylinders of chlorine.\r\n\r\nThe worst case release scenario would consist of a rupture of the one ton cylinder allowing all of the cholirine inside to be relesed in ten minutes, which would create a cloud of chlorine with a radius of 1.3 miles and an affected population of 7,986 people.  There are no passive mitigation measures in place to affect the severety of the release.\r\n\r\nThe alternative release scenario consist of a fusible plug blowing out of the chlorine cylinder.  It will take approximately an hour for offsite responders to respond to the release.  It will have a release rate of 2 lbs/min and will have a radius of effect of 0.1 miles and effect 90 people.  There is no active or passive mitigation in place at the facility.\r\n\r\nProper training of operators and maintenance personnel prevents accidental release and chemical specific hazards.\r\n\r\nThere has been no accidentents at the facility in the past ten (10) years. \r\n\r\nThe emergency response at this facility is handled by offsite personnel (fire department, police, etc.).  The Acadia Parish Office of Emergency Preparedness will be responsible for notification of the public and evacuation/sheltering in place of people within the radius of effect.  Clean Harbors will be responsible for repairing any leak to a chlorine tank that caused an accidental release.\r\n\r\nSome changes that have been planned to improve safety are labeling all process equipment that contains chlorine."
