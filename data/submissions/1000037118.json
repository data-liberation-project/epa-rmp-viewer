This Risk Management Plan (RMP) summarizes the management, administrative, procedural, and technological controls that work together to minimize the risk to site personnel, contractors, visitors, and the community and environment at large of hazardous chemical releases. This RMP has been updated to correspond with specific U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) RMP, Program 3 of 40 CFR 68, definitions and requirements of Subpart G, including: \r\n\u00bf\tIntroduction;\r\n\u00bf\tBridge Western policies to protect health, environment, and safety;\r\n\u00bf\tFacility identification and regulated substances covered processes;\r\n\u00bf\tHazard Assessment;\r\n\u00bf\tPrevention Program;\r\n\u00bf\tFive-Year Accident History;\r\n\u00bf\tEmergency Response Plan; \r\n\u00bf\tEmergency Communications;\r\n\u00bf\tSpill Reporting / Environmental Release Procedures;\r\n\u00bf\tPlanned changes to improve safety; and\r\n\u00bf\tManagement Program\r\n\r\nII.\tBridge Western Policies To Protect Health, Environment, and Safety\r\nRisk management and safety are important concerns at Bridge Western; this RMP formalizes and documents these activities. Bridge Western is committed to conducting its operations in a safe and responsible manner and to reducing risks to human health and to the environment. It is Bridge Western's policy to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local rules, and regulations.\r\n\r\nThis RMP update has identified potential hazards and has taken steps to design and maintain a safe facility in order to prevent releases, and minimize the consequences of accidental releases, which could occur. RMP addresses potentially catastrophic chemical releases that could result in immediate harm and acute health effects to offsite receptors (public and environmental).

The facility is refrigerated warehouse that is utilized for refrigerating and freezing a variety of food products. The NAICS code for the facility is 49312. \r\n\r\nThe facility uses anhydrous ammonia for refrigeration, and is regulated under 40 CFR Part 68, the EPA RMP Rule. There is one refrigeration system onsite that is used for refrigerating and freezing a variety of food products. The total amount of ammonia onsite is approximately 20,000 pounds, which is above the minimum threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds.\r\n\r\nThe refrigeration system provides the mechanical refrigeration required for maintaining temperatures in the freezer, blast freezers, holding coolers, product re-pack area, and the inspection areas.\r\n\r\nAn area map identifying the site location is included as Appendix A. \r\n\r\nIV.\tHazard Assessment - Worse Case Scenarios (WCS)\r\nAppendix B contains the RMP*Submit Printout and includes additional information on the worst-case scenario.  Appendix B contains the offsite consequence analysis data and maps for the worse case release scenario. \r\n\r\nV.\tHazard Assessment - Alternative Release Scenarios (ARS)\r\nAppendix B contains the RMP*Submit Printout and includes additional information on the alternative release scenario.

In addition, the employee participation program will ensure employees and their representatives have access to process hazard analyses and all other information required to be developed under PSM/RMP.  \r\n \r\n\u00bf\tProcess Safety Information - Bridge Western maintains a site specific PSI program that ensures information pertaining to the hazards, technology, and equipment of the process are properly developed and maintained.\r\n\u00bf\tProcess Hazard Analysis - Bridge Western has developed a site specific process hazard analysis (PHA) program that ensures a PHA is conducted initially, and at a minimum, every five (5) years, and whenever required by the written Management of Change program.  In addition, this program ensures PHA's are conducted in accordance with OSHA and EPA regulations and ensures findings and recommendations of PHA's are properly documented.  Bridge Western completed the most recent PHA revalidation study on  August 27, 2013.\r\n\u00bf\tOperating Procedures - Bridge Western has developed a site specific procedure that ensures operating procedures provide clear instruction for different phases of process operations and ensures they are properly maintained.  Bridge Western completed the most recent review of the standard operating procedures on October 29, 2013. \r\n\u00bf\tTraining - Bridge Western has developed a site specific training procedure that ensures employees operating the ammonia process have the knowledge to safely operate the process, are aware of the potential hazards of the process, and understand the causes of process problems.\r\n\u00bf\tMa"
