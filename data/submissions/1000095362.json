The plan is designed to meet the following objectives:\n\nTo save lives\n\nTo protect the environment\n\nTo minimize property damage\n\n\n\nSnoTemp's Emergency Response Team are the designated emergency coordinators.  The Plan provides response organization, ammonia health hazards, evacuation routes and mitigation procedures to respond to emergency situations at the facility.  The Plan is reviewed once a year or as needed to ensure compliance with PSM and RMP regulations or for facility changes.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nSnoTemp maintains thermal environments for human food item storage and integrity of these products.  The system consists of an ammonia refrigeration system which includes compressors, condensers, evaporators, vessels and piping.  Controls consist of a secure computerized system which follows user defined set points and provides text alarms to multiple operators if any preset parameters are breached.  Text alerts start with a warning and if not addressed will go into alarm and shut systems down.  Ammonia the refrigerant, is changed from liquid to vapor as it absorbs heat then changed back to a liquid through pressure increases and heat dissipation.  This process of removes heat from insulated storage rooms and expels the heat outside the system.  Typical operating pressures range from 0 psig to 140 psig across this process.\n\n\n\nAnyrdrous ammonia (CAS 7664-41-7) is the refrigerant used in this system.\n\n\n\nThe total ammonia quantity of this system is above the 10,000 pound threshold quantity for reporting.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL SP"

Team members have all had 40 hour or 24 hour HAZWOPER training with annual 8 hour refresher training with third party trainers.  We only respond to levels below 300 ppm.  We have a great capability to respond remotely to alerts and make changes through our refrigeration control system from remote computers or cell phones.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nWe continue to seek improvements in our training of operators through LITMOS training scheduler.  We just purchased a web based PSM/RMP program to have better insight to our PSM/RMP compliance standing and allow other select people to see our performance, all as a means to be better and safer as an ammonia refrigeration facility.\n\n"
