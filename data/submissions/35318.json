We use a combination of an accidental release prevention\nprogram and an emergency response planning program to help ensure the safety of our employees and\nthe public, as well as protection of the environment.

In our treatment process, we use the following chemical the EPA\nhas identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequences in the event of a substantial\naccidental release:\n\nToxics:  Chlorine\n\nChlorine is used as a disinfectant to inactivate disease causing organisms and to maintain high quality potable\nwater during distribution.  The maximum inventory of chlorine stored at the plant site is 220,000 pounds.\n\nFlammables:  There are no RMP-regulated flammable chemicals used or stored at this facility.\n\nOur accidental release preve"

The\nprevention programs in place include:\n\n1.     Regular review of safety information such as Materials Safety Data Sheets (MSDS), daily\n         documentation of chlorine inventory, and regular updating of safety information to assure\n         accuracy and completeness.\n2.     Hazard review of the chlorination system using industry recommended checklists to assess\n         potential problems that could result in an accidental release, determine the safeguards needed\n         to control hazards or prevent equipment malfunction.\n3.     Written operating procedures that address initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations,\n         emergency shutdown, emergency operation, normal shutdown, startup following a normal or \n         emergency shutdown or a major change, consequences of deviations and steps required to correct\n         or avoid deviations, and routine equipment inspections.\n4.     Regular employee training to assure that each plant operator has the required knowledge, skills,\n        and abilities to safely carry out the duties and responsibilities assigned.\n5.
