This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable release of substances.  However if a release does occur, gas plant trained personnel will respond to control, and contain the release.  The Midland Gasoline Plant uses refrigeration and fractionation to separate natural gas liquids (NGL) into saleable Liquefied Petroleum Gases (e.g. Ethane, Propane & Butane) and Natural Gasoline (Pentanes Plus).  As a result of this operation, those EPA regulated flammable substances are processed, recovered, and stored at the facility. The plant does not use or store any regulated toxic substances above the EPA set threshold levels.  \r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nThe Midland Gasoline Plant, located near Midland, Texas, uses refrigeration and fractionationrefrigerationrefrigerationrefrigerationfractionationfractionationfractionation to separate natural gas liquids (NGL).

Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling process safety information to participation as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the plant\u00bfs PSM and accidental release prevention programs. These programs are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the plant and addresses each element of PSM and the accidental release prevention programs.  In addition, the plant has a number of initiatives under way, addressing process and \r\nEmployee Participation (cont\u00bfd.)\r\n\r\nemployee and safety issues.  These initiatives include plant safety meetings and safety training to promote both process and personal safety.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\n\r\nThe Midland Gasoline Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safety operation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Plant management in conjunction with plant personnel are assigned the responsibility for maintaining up-to- date process safety information.\r\n\r\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDS).

This information includes material of construction of process equipment.  This information also includes material of construction, design pressure, design temperature, and electrical rating of equipment. This information, in combination with trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised. \r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA) \r\n\r\nOnce staffing is completed the Midland Gasoline Plant will have a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled. Within this program, each process will be systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards. \r\n\r\nThe Midland Gasoline Plant will primarily use the Haz-op methodology and What-if/Checklist analysis technique to perform these evaluations. The Haz-op methodology and What-if/Checklist technique is recognized by OSHA and the EPA as an approved method for conducting PHAs.  Plant PHAs will be conducted using a team of people who have operating, maintenance, engineering, and safety experience. The team will identify and evaluate hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. \r\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA) (cont\u00bfd.)\r\n\r\nThe PHA team findings will be forwarded to company\u00bfs Safety Department for resolution, implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings bas"

All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings will be tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding will be documented and retained.\r\n\r\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the plant will periodically revalidate the hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews will be conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The results and findings from these updates will be documented and retained.  The team findings will be forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings will be documented and retained. \r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\n\r\nThe Midland Gasoline Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, (6) initial startup of a new process, and (7) consequences of deviations.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures will be periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate. The procedures will be revised as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process and annually to verify technical accuracy. \r\n\r\nIn addition, Midland Gasoline Plant\u00bfs Operating Procedures provide guidance on how to respond to specific process or equipment parameters that exceed the parameter upper or lower limits.

New employees receive basic training in gas plant operation and are paired with senior operators to learn process-specific duties and tasks. After operations demonstrate having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years. All training is documented for each operator, including this means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\r\n\r\nContractors\r\n\r\nThe Midland Gasoline Plant uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the gas plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their work place, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform gas plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work. This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) Information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work. In addition, PATRIOT NGL, LP evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.

If the deficiency can not be remedied at that time, Maintenance personnel coordinate with Safety, Engineering and Operations to place temporary safeguards in place to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\r\n\r\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance. The Midland Gasoline Plant incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repair. This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\r\n\r\nSafe Work Practice\r\n\r\nThe Midland Gasoline Plant has safe work practices in to help ensure worker and process safety. Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout-tag out procedure to insure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous substances before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work), and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space. These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\r\n\r\nManagement of Change \r\n\r\nThe Midland Gasoline Plant has a comprehensive system to manage changes to all covered processes. This system requires that any and all changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes to be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented. Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Affec"
