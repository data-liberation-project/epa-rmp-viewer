Foster Farms purchased the plant from Zacky Farms in October 2001.\n\nFoster Farms prepared a Chemical Risk Management Program and Process Safety Management Program (RMP/PSM) in general accordance with state and federal regulations. The state risk management regulations, also referred to as the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) program, are codified in California Code of Regulations (CCR), Title 19, Section 2735.1, et. Seq.  The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) also regulates facilities with certain toxic and flammable substances.  The federal regulations are codified in Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 68.  Finally, both the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and the California Occupational Safety and Health Administration (CalOSHA) regulate facilities with certain acutely hazardous materials under the PSM regulations, as defined in CCR Title 8 Section 5189 and CFR Title 29 Part 1910 Section 119, respectively.\n\nFoster Farms has updated the RMP/PSM to satisfy regulatory requirements and to demonstrate a commitment to evaluate and improve anhydrous ammonia handling systems and practices at the facility. Many state-of-the-art safety features were incorporated into the ammonia refrigeration system at the facility as part of the original system construction and system modifications.  In the unlikely event that a chemical release does occur at the facility, Foster Farms personnel are trained in the appropriate response measures, relying on backup support services provided "

      "SummaryText": "by the local fire department and/or hazardous materials response team.  Foster Farms will continue to improve ammonia-handling safety through the implementation of the prevention program elements of the RMP/PSM.\n\nThe Fresno Poultry facility is located immediatey north of Belgravia Avenue in Fresno, CA.  The facility is located on approximately 20 acres.  The Site is bordered by Channing Avenue to the west, Florence Avenue to the north, , and Delno Avenue to the east.  The area surrounding the facilities consists of industrial and commercial businesses.  Highway 99 is approximately 1.5 miles to the northeast.  \n\nThe facility was constructed in 1978-2000 for Zacky Farms.  Foster Farms purchased the plant in October 2001.  Operations at the facility consist of the slaughter, processing, storage, and packaging of poultry products.  The facility is surrounded by chain-link fencing and has a secured entrance that is staffed by security personnel 24 hours per day, 365 days per year.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is used in a refrigeration system at the facility.  The ammonia refrigeration system, which is a closed system, contains approximately 20,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia. The system provides cooling for production areas, product, water chilling, and ice making.  A central computer system monitors and controls the refrigeration system.  The desired temperatures are maintained by controlling the flow of ammonia with manually and electrically operated valves, float switches, transfer pumps, and compressor controls.  \n\nThe RMP/PSM regulations require a review of the five-year accident history at the regulated facility.  Zacky Farms reported no accidental releases at the facility within the past five years and Foster Farms has not experienced any accidental releases at the facility since purchasing it in October 2001.\n\nThe RMP regulations require facilities to identify and evaluate chemical release scenarios resulting from potential failures of the chemical handling systems covere"

      "SummaryText": "d by the RMP.  Foster Farms has updated the scenarios originally submitted by Zacky Farms in June 1999 as part of their compliance effort.  Program 3 requirements of the RMP apply to the Foster Farms facility due to the quantity of ammonia used.  Program 3 facilities are required to evaluate a worst-case release scenario (release parameters are defined by the regulations) and an alternative release scenario. The regulations define a worst-case release scenario as ??the greatest amount held in a single vessel?released as a gas over 10 minutes.?  An alternative release scenario is identified as a release that is more likely to occur at the facility.\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis for our facility was completed by Condor Earth Technologies Inc., using the EPA Model Risk Management Program and Plan for Ammonia Refrigeration, November 1998 (EPA Model Program).  Consequence modeling was conducted to determine the release distances from the site.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario (WSC) selected was a release from the high pressure receiver (the vessel containing the largest amount of ammonia), over a 10-minute release period.  This resulted in a release of 17,029 pounds of ammonia.  Release distances were calculated using Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, and toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/l or 200 parts per million (ppm).  Results for the WSC were based on a toxic gas release that has been liquefied under pressure, and is located in an open space.  This resulted in a toxic endpoint distance of 1.58 miles.\n\nThe alternative scenario selected was of an ammonia release occurring due to failure of a pimp seal leak or gasket failure with a ?? effective diameter office leading to an airborne release.  The scenario results in a release rate of 100 lbs/minute.  The duration of the release is assumed to be 10 minutes, and the total quantity released 1,000 pounds.  This time frame would be consistent with a typical accidental release, allowing time for the leak to be"

Using the weather conditions described in the EPA Model Program (wind speed of 3 meters per second and an atmospheric stability class D) and interpolating the tabulated values from Exhibit 4-5 of the same EPA Model Program, the predicted distance to the toxic endpoint is 0.10 mile.\n\nThe RMP/PSM regulations require a review of the accidental release prevention program and chemical specific prevention steps used by the facility.  Foster Farms has incorporated many safety features in the ammonia refrigeration system to prevent system failures and to mitigate potential releases.  The predominant safety concern with closed-loop ammonia systems is an inadvertent buildup of pressure exceeding pressure ratings or capacities of equipment due to ammonia expansion.  The Fresno Poultry ammonia system is continuously monitored by automated control systems that shut down components if deviations from normal operating conditions occur.  The high pressure receiver is connected to a diffusion panel and ammonia from the vessel can be mixed with water (neutralized) and discharged to the sewer system to prevent over-pressurization of the vessels.  Additionally, all pressure vessels in the system are equipped with pressure relief valves.\n\nOther safety features at the facility include: \n?Emergency shutdown systems\n?Component specific safety shutdowns\n?Safeties are tested annually\n?Pressure relief valves on all vessels, compressors, and several other areas in the system where trapped ammonia could build pressure\n?The high pressure receiver is connected to a fire diffusion panel\n?Many of the ammonia pipes, valves and components are labeled\n?Pressure relief valves are replaced at least every five years\n?A fire sprinkler system is installed in the plant\n?A central computer system monitors the refrigeration system and alarms when safety set-points are exceeded\n?Operators receive ongoing training in operations, maintenance and emergency response\n\nIn addition to the phy"

Administrative controls include, but are not limited to, formal training programs for system operators and mechanics, emergency response training, a hot work permit program, a lockout/tagout program, a contractor safety program, incident investigation program, mechanical integrity program, management of change program, pre start-up safety review program, and a RMP/PSM auditing and inspection program.  Written standard operating procedures (SOPs) have been prepared for the ammonia system at the facility.  The SOPs provide a basis for site specific operator training and a ready reference for operating and trouble-shooting the systems.\n\nFoster Farms is committed to maintaining the mechanical integrity of the ammonia refrigeration system.  A preventive maintenance system is utilized to manage the maintenance of the refrigeration system.  Preventive maintenance at the facility includes daily, weekly, and periodic inspection; calibration; testing; and overhaul of ammonia system equipment.  The system is used to track equipment performance and to create reports that are used by maintenance personnel to monitor the frequency of repairs and deviations from normal operating parameters.\n\nChanges to improve safety at the facility are ongoing.  Many of the mitigation measures suggested by the process hazard analysis teams have already been implemented.  Others will be implemented during the next eighteen months.  The status of significant mitigation measures is as follows: \n?Staffing levels have been increased to assure proper maintenance\n?A formal training program has been developed and is utilized for all refrigeration mechanics\n?PSM and related ammonia system operator safety training has been completed\n?Emergency Response Plan now includes Bomb Threat procedures\n?A formal preventive maintenance program has b"
