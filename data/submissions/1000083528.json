Its accidental release policy is an integrated approach, involving employee participation, management practices, written procedures, and training. NGL has developed a comprehensive Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) accident prevention program considering all aspects of process operation and maintenance. The accident prevention program includes compliance with ongoing mechanical integrity inspections, which includes the API RP 510 Pressure Vessel Inspection Program and API RP 570 Piping Inspection Program.  In addition, the facility conducts 3 year PSM Compliance Audits.  If an emergency were to occur, it is NGL's policy to notify the City of Vancouver Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency. The Vancouver Terminal also maintains incipient stage firefighting equipment on site. Additionally, the facility has been equipped with fire suppression cannon nozzles along the facility perimeter. This facility complies with NFPA-58 requirements for LP-Gas storage, and it is NGL's policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws. The facility came online new in 2011 and is annually inspected for compliance by the City of Vancouver. \n\n\n\nA description of the West Vancouver Terminal facility and the regulated substances handled: \n\n\n\nThis facility is a bulk terminal storing LPG for resale to retail butane and propane dealers.
