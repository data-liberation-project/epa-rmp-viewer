The general public would most likely encounter products made from these wafers in integrated circuits found in automobiles, pace makers, telecommunication equipment, and endless forms of electrical switches and controls, both consumer and industrial.   \n\nIn brief and greatly simplified, silicon wafers are made by a process in which crystal silicon ingots are polished to create a defect-free surface.  Then hydrogen chloride is introduced in the Epitaxail Silicon process as a wafer-cleaning agent, followed by trichlorosilane, which deposits another layer of silicon onto the wafer.\n\nIn response to the regulations enumerated by the Clean Air Act (CAA), as specified in the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) rules on May 24, 1996, Sumitomo Sitix Silicon, Inc. submits its Risk Management Plan (RMP).  This RMP complies with the requirement to publish its plans to prevent accidental releases of regulated substances and to reduce the severity of the releases that do occur.  \n\nThe Process Safety Management team at Sumitomo Sitix Silicon (SSAC) has determined that the following chemicals and processes are subject to compliance with the EPA Risk Management Plan:\n\n7 Hydrogen chloride (HCl), bulk storage and delivery\n7 Trichlorosilane (TCS), bulk storage, delivery, and reclaim\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe prevention of accidental release of hazardous substances is of major concern for Sumitomo employees.  The objectives of SSAC's training programs are the preparation of employees to operate equipment properly and safely and to be alert to evidence of accidental chemical leaks and releases. \n\nEvery person working at Sumitomo Sitix Silicon, Inc.

The ERT Chief, upon receiving notification of an emergency, assesses the situation and determines if the ERT can handle the situation or if outside help needs to be requested.  \n\nThe ERT Chief works with the Safety and Health Manager in planning, developing, and holding training sessions for ERT members.  He/she supervises emergency response drills for SSAC employees and ERT members.\n\nAfter every ERT response to an incident, the ERT Chief completes the ERT Incident Report Form and participates in the post-response critique, in which SSAC management and local responders participate.\n\nImproving Safety at SSAC\n\nSSAC is continually looking for ways to improve safety conditions and to prevent the accidental release of hazardous substances at its manufacturing facility.  The Preventive Maintenance program, in conjunction with SSAC's Mechanical Integrity procedures, provides for continuous, regular inspection of the plant's physical equipment, and for replacement of equipment as necessary.\n\nFuture enhancements include improvements in engineering controls to limit the maximum flow of HCl that can flow through the HCl piping manifold.\n\nThe computer-based Preventive Maintenance (PM) program triggers the routine inspection of all regulated systems' equipment, including systems valves, gauges, flanges, piping supports, connectors, etc.  The PM program also schedules the replacement of specified components as determined by the life-expectancy of the particular component.  \n\nSSAC maintains a c"

SSAC complies with all preventative safety programs as defined by OSHA's Process Safety Management regulations.\n\nManagement is committed to employee safety and the implementation of safe procedures.
