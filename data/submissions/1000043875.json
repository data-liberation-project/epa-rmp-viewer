The Water Department is committed to providing a safe work environment for its employees. Section Safety Supervisors are tasked with the implementation of the safety programs and policies at the pump station. In addition, the Department has an Accident Review Committee that is responsible for reviewing all incidents and near misses that occur at the facilities. This group is responsible for collecting all necessary information from employees (and contractors as necessary) regarding a reported incident through interview sessions. Following the data collection, the Accident Review Committee will meet to hypothetical potential causes and develop mitigation measures to prevent future occurrences.\n\n\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\n\nThe chlorine system at Glorietta Park Pump Station of City of Glendale Water and Power is used for the chlorination of drinking water.  The Glorietta Park Pump Station uses chlorine for odor control, filamentous control, and disinfection of water from Glorietta Reservoir.  The maximum quantity of chlorine that can be stored for the chlorination process is 4,000 pounds.\n\n\n\nThe Glorietta Park Pump Station's chlorine system is operated under vacuum conditions.  In the chlorine storage room at the Glorietta Park Pump Station, two one-ton chlorine containers are maintained on-line.  The on-line containers each reside inside a TGO ChlorTainer, an air-tight enclosed vessel and are each placed on a scale to allow the City of Glendale Water and Power to monitor usage and plan ahead for ordering more chlorine.  Each one-ton container is positioned so that the valves are vertically aligned.  The vacuum regulator/heater assembly is placed on the top container valve to ensure that chlorine gas is pulled from the"

      "SummaryText": " container.  The chlorine gas is pulled from the one-ton container to the chlorinator through the vacuum regulator.  A vacuum is created when process water is pumped through the injectors.  This flow generates a vacuum (approximately 1-3 in. Hg) which opens the vacuum regulator.  Upon loss of vacuum in the line from any one-ton container, a diaphragm in the vacuum regulator will close, stopping any chlorine from escaping. Any chlorine gas in the tubing upon loss of vacuum, downstream of the regulator, will be drawn through the ejectors and into solution.  \n\n\n\nAfter passing through the vacuum regulator, the chlorine gas is sent to a chlorinator.  The chlorinator is equipped with a rotameter to monitor and regulate the amount of chlorine that flows to the injectors.  Still under vacuum from the chlorinator, the chlorine gas is drawn to the injector located in the chlorinator room and is mixed with water to produce chlorine solution.   At the mixing point of chlorine and water, the solution becomes sufficiently diluted to no longer merit concern.\n\n\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nThe City of Glendale Water and Power has a Process Safety Management program in place to manage the handling of chlorine.  In addition, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed.  This includes common practices outlined by the Chlorine Institute.\n\n\n\nThe chlorine system at Glorietta Park Pump Station employed by the Glendale Water & Power is equipped with various system controls and status indicators intended to minimize potential chlorine related accidents and to allow operators to monitor system operations.  This monitoring system is comprised of excess flow valves, pressure indicators, as well as other system safeguards and methods for allowing facility operators to effectively monitor and control operations.\n\n\n\nThe Glendale Water & Power maintains tight control of its chlor"

In the event that the primary engineering or administration controls at the facility fail and result in a release of chlorine, there are three mechanisms in the plant to minimize the impact: 1) chlorine sensor / detector, 2) alarms, and 3) ChlorTainers.\n\n\n\nThere are two chlorine detectors where one is located at the Chlorine Storage Room and the other is located at the Injection Room.  At 1 ppm, the chlorine sensors will trigger a visual alarm located in the chlorine storage room and the chlorinator room. Once a chlorine concentration of 3 ppm is detected by the sensors, the chlorine alarm system will notify operators of the chlorine leak through the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system.  The chlorine alarm system also will circulate the air in the building.\n\n\n\nAn automatic switchover function on the vacuum regulator allows only one of the two containers to feed chlorine at a time.  When the vacuum regulator detects high vacuum from one of the containers, it opens to supply chlorine from the other container. The heater is used to ensure that chlorine does not condense.  All empty tanks connected to the system are replaced with a full tank delivered from the vendor.  This replacement is done by City of Glendale Water and Power operators using a monorail hoist.\n\n\n\nTGO Technologies, Inc. is the developer and manufacturer of the \"ChlorTainer,\" a vessel designed to contain the accidental release of liquid chlorine or chlorine gas.  The ChlorTainer is designed in accordance with ASME requirements and is capable of containing pressure releases of up to 250 psig and 300?F.  In the event of a failed container, the system will protect the operator as well as the external environment from exposure to chlorine gas or toxic levels of chlorine gas. The ChlorTainers use nitrogen to power the fail-safe actuator that will automatically close the chlorine supply valve in the event of a chlorine leak outs"

Since the gas is totally contained, it satisfies the code requirement as a treatment system and provides an alternate to the conventional method of mechanical scrubber systems. If there was a small leak from any of the threaded connections, the paint on the ChlorTainer fittings will change color (from yellow to purple), alerting the operator on his daily inspection of a leak.  \n\n\n\nFuse plugs on the one-ton containers are the main relief system for the chlorine equipment.  Fuse plugs are designed to yield and melt between 158 F and 165 F to relieve pressure and prevent rupture of the container in case of fire or other exposure to high temperature.\n\n\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nEPA's RMP regulation defines \"accident\" as the following:\n\n\n\n\"The release must be from a covered process and involve a regulated substance held above its threshold quantity in the process.
