      "SummaryText": "Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\nThe  facility located in Piedmont, South Carolina contains one RMP covered process which is a vinyl acetate polymer emulsions manufacturing plant.  The plant maintains greater than 10,000 pounds of vinyl acetate monomer (VAM) to safely and efficiently manufacture polyvinyl acetate copolymer emulsions.  In the quantities handled by our facility, vinyl acetate monomer is considered to be hazardous by the EPA.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state and local rules and regulations as well as our internal EH&S policies and practices.\nThe facility manages safety of the process by designing for a safe operation, operating and maintaining the plant properly and by auditing our operations.  Our accident prevention program is based on OSHA\u00bfs Process Safety Management regulation and our emergency response program is based on OSHA\u00bfs HazWOPER regulations.\nThe Plant is a member of the American Chemical Council and subscribes to the Responsible Care\u00ae Program.  The Piedmont Plant is actively involved in the community through its work with the local Greenville County CAER Group, the Piedmont Fire Department, the Greenville County LEPC and the Piedmont Community Advisory Panel.\n\n\nFacility description and regulated substance handled:\nThe polyvinyl acetate copolymer emulsions manufacturing facility is located at 410 Old Pelzer Road, Piedmont, South Carolina.  To produce polyvinyl acetate copolymer an emulsion, vinyl acetate liquid is polymerized with other monomers in reactors to form the emulsion product.  The emulsion product is a non-hazardous, water based liquid.  The product is shipped via railcars, tank truck, totes and drums to industrial customers for the production of paint products, paper coatings and adhesives.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and specific prevention steps:\nThe Piedmont Plant\u00bfs RMP Accidental Release Prevention Program is based on OSHA Process Safety Manage"

The facility has implemented the following:\n(1) Process Safety Information\n(2) Process Hazards Analysis\n(3) Operating procedures\n(4) Training\n(5) Mechanical Integrity\n(6) Management of Change\n(7) Pre-startup Review\n(8) Compliance Audits\n(9) Incident Investigation\n(10) Employee participation\n(11) Hot Work Permits\n(12) Contractor Safety\n\nThe five-year accident history:\nThere have been no accidents involving or accidental releases of vinyl acetate that resulted in any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\nThe emergency response program:\nThe facility\u00bfs emergency response program is based upon OSHA\u00bfs HazWOPER standard.  At a minimum, all employees are trained to OSHA\u00bfs First Responder Awareness level.  Employees are trained to recognize emergencies and to initiate an emergency response from outside agencies.  The facility also has a core group of employees who are trained to the Technician Level of HazWOPER.  Employees receive refresher training in emergency response procedures.  \nEmergency response activities have been coordinated with the Piedmont Fire Department for awareness on potential hazards and location of hazardous materials.  Drills are also conducted periodically in order to assure the effectiveness of the response procedures.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety:\nThere are no current plans to install new mitigation, control equipment or to change technology.  The plant does strive to continuously improve its performance in safety.  Process Safety Management elements are evaluated periodically for effectiveness."
