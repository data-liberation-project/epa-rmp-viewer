The prevention program provides a structured approach to preventing accidents. Some of the specific activities in the prevention program include:\r\n\r\nA\u00b7 Process safety information is accessible to employees at all times.\r\nA\u00b7 A hazard review was conducted as part of the preparation for RMP compliance.\r\nA\u00b7 Computerized process controls prevent unsafe conditions in the sterilizers.\r\nA\u00b7 Written operating procedures are used for training and guiding the work of operators.\r\nA\u00b7 Training is provided to all employees that operate the system.\r\nA\u00b7 A program is in place to properly maintain the system and equipment.\r\nA\u00b7 Incidents are investigated and actions are taken as part of a continuous improvement effort.\r\nA\u00b7 Routine audits are conducted to assure that safe practices are being followed.\r\nA\u00b7 A thorough Preventative Maintenance program helps ensure equipment is in proper working condition.\r\n\r\nThe sterilization process subject to the Risk Management Program at the Sterigenics US, LLC - Santa Teresa facility is designed with extensive safeguards to protect against the accidental release of ethylene oxide. Examples of safety equipment in place include pressure relief devices, leak detection and alarm systems, electronic interlock safety systems for sterilization chambers, and explosion-proof electrical systems.  \r\n\r\nIn addition, process operators receive extensive training in the safe operation of the process, and are required to follow detailed operating procedures to help ensure safety.
