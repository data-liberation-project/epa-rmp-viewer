Health, Safety and Environmental Policies: The Henry Plant is governed by a commitment to excellence as it pertains to Health, Safety, and Environmental performance.  Emerald  conducts its operations and business activities in a manner that protects our employees, our communities and the environment.  Emerald is committed to compliance with the requirements of all applicable laws and regulations and the implementation of Synthetic Organic Chemical Manufacturers Association (SOCMA) principles for continuous improvement of its health, safety, and environmental performance.  All employees of Emerald are committed to carrying out these principles.\n\nII.Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled: The Henry Plant is located approximately two miles northeast of the City of Henry, Illinois.  It is located on a 250-acre tract adjacent to The Poly One Company and the City Of Henry Waste Treatment Facility.  The plant manufactures industrial organic chemicals used primarily to support the manufacturing of tires and synthetic plastics and the stabilization of products such as jet fuels.  The plant employs approximately 63 employees.  \nAt this location the toxic chemicals subject to the threshold quantity of the RMP regulation include:  (1) Carbon Disulfide.  The flammable chemical subject to the threshold quantity of the RMP regulation was Isobutylene, however, this has now been eliminated from plant usage. The toxic chemicals subject to the threshold quantity had been chlorine and carbon disulfide. Chlorine has been eliminated from our process reducing our hazard to our employees and the community. As reflected in the above HSE Company policy, the company has ongoing procedures and activities that address the overall RMP regulation to prevent serious accidents and to plan emergency"

Nevertheless, we welcome the EPA's RMP initiative and see it as an opportunity to continue and expand these activities and to insure our good performance.\n\nIII. The Accidental Release Prevention Program and Emergency Response Policies at the Stationary source\nThe Henry Plant's policy has been to meet or exceed requirements established by applicable safety, health and environmental regulations promulgated by Federal and State agencies.  Our safety policies and practices have historically preceded the regulation of such practices under, for example, the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard and the EPA Risk Management Program Rule.  Our policy is to strive for zero OSHA Recordable injuries, Lost Time Injuries, Serious Operational Incidents and Releases to the Environment.  These measurements are tracked on a continuous basis.  The plant also works with on site employees, contractors, suppliers, local emergency responders and the general public to maintain contingency plans and systems to minimize or mitigate an accidental chemical release.   \nThe plant has participated in Responsible Care&reg; under the CCA, and is certified under the ISO-9000 international quality standard.  It is currently a member of SOCMA and will be using their measurements and priniciples to comply with HSE regulations and laws.\n\nIV. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nThe plant has an ongoing program of process safety management (PSM). This program calls for implementation and maintenance of procedural and engineered safeguards to minimize the occurrence of a significant release of a hazardous chemical, and to eliminate or reduce the effects of such releases.  Substantial effort and capital have been invested to maintain and improve these programs.   \n \nOther day to"

SA-56 Process Hazard Analyses is an established procedure outlining the overall plant program.\n\n(2) Process Design:  All process equipment and systems are designed for safety in accordance with applicable Industry Standards and Best Engineering Practices.  Designs include, where applicable, automatic emergency shutdown systems, pressure relief devices, ventilation systems, release monitoring systems, and appropriate electrical classifications. Many processes are computer-controlled with operator backup including internal limits and checks for abnormal conditions, emergency shutdowns and alarms.  All storage vessels containing hazardous/flammable chemicals are contained in concrete dikes or protected with similar secondary methods of containment. Appropriate flammable storage tanks have fire water deluge systems installed to control any fire situation. These systems are maintained through special procedures identified in SA-53 Mechanical Integrity.\n\n(3) Training:  Plant operating personnel are thoroughly trained on their specific job tasks,  procedures, and processes  initially and continuously.   Also, contractors working in the plant are initially and annually evaluated for safety performance and receive annual Safety and Hazard Communications Training.  MFG-01 and SA-02 are established procedures defining the overall plant program.  All procedures in the plant are specifically controlled and maintained to insure accuracy and proper authorization.  ADM-01 and ADM-03 are established procedures defining this program.\n\n(4) Maintenance:  The plant has a corrective maintenance, a preventive maintenance, and a predictive maintenance program along with a maintenance training program to insure that process system integrity is maintained.

Changes to Safety Critical Equipment can not be performed without proper authorization and review.  This program is identified in SA-54 Management of Change procedure and incorporates an electronic database to manage changes plant-wide.\n\nV.The Five Year Accident History\nThe plant has not had any events at the  Henry plant that would qualify for inclusion in the RMP 5-year accident history.\n\nVI. The Emergency Response Program\nThe plant has a series of procedures dealing with emergency response within the facility.  Additionally, it has an Integrated Emergency Plan (SA- 62) that incorporates all of the individual procedures.  The plant maintains an active Fire Brigade of 20+ individuals who are trained, confined space rescue and spill activities.  Periodic training is provided for this brigade throughout the year.  This program is identified in SA-53.\n\nVII. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\nThe plant safety program is ongoing through periodic auditing functions conducted by Plant and Corporate Auditing protocols (See SA-57).  Through these mechanisms, improvements are identified and implemented.  Additionally, the plant works closely with the community to provide equipment and training for emergency organizations.  The plant has helped the City of Henry to identify and install a more effective emergency notification system.  Funding by the company was part of this activity.  \n   \n\nVIII. The Worst-Case Release Scenario and Alternative Release Scenarios:\nThe worst-case and alternative release scenarios, including a discussion of administrative and engineering measures used to minimize the affects of the release are described below.

Toxic Worst Case Scenario: The worst-case scenario for the Plant involves the complete failure of a 90 ton Carbon disulfide car which is used to deliver and store carbon disulfide on site.  The distance to the release endpoint would impact beyond our fence line, reaching our industrial neighbors and having the potential of reaching many public receptors.\n\nC. Alternative Release Scenarios(ARS):  ARS's for the Henry Plant include the following.  These releases although unlikely are considered to be more probable than the WCS's listed above.\n\n1. Carbon Disulfide (CS2): The process line from the pump leaks beyond the immediate area of the storage tank while MBT-C process is activating the pump.  The release would not be contained and the leakage would be in the pipe rack located between the tank farm and the process building.  The rate of the leak is estimated at 25 gallons/minute for a period of  15 minutes.  Safeguards: Safeguards include an operator in attendance when pumping carbon disulfide; monitoring of Tank Farm pipe racks twice a day for SPCC check; a trained Hazwoper team; and process procedure established to stop pumping at a specified time and investigate cause of excessive fill time and lined, slightly diked pipe racks.  Impact Area: The release is calculated to extend beyond the property line but would not affect any residential or industrial areas."
