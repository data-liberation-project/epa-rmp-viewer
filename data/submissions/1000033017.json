The property surrounding the Rudd Company, Inc. is urban on the south and west side and mixed residential and urban on the north and east side of the facility.\n\nLPG System Description\n\nThe LPG storage tanks are designed to be filled by a tanker truck at a dedicated loading station.  The LPG is piped to a gas house building and injected into the aerosol cans.\n\nProcess Hazard Assessment (PHA)\n\nProcess hazard assessments were performed using a 'What If' type analysis for the LPG system.  This analysis utilizes a brainstorming approach, in which a team of people familiar with the process asks questions about possible undesirable events.  The What If analysis results in a listing of undesirable events with their consequences, safeguards, and recommendations for risk reduction.  Comments and recommendations are summarized in the Process Hazard Assessment section of the Risk Management Program.\n\nPrevention System\nRudd Company, Inc. has operation, maintenance and inspection procedures for the LPG system. Personnel receive training before being allowed to work on the systems.\n\nThe LPG system is visually inspected on a periodic basis.  Standard operating procedures (SOPs) for startup, shutdown, normal operation and emergency operation of the LPG system are in place. Personnel are trained annually on safety concerns and general operation procedures as well as emergency procedures. \n\nLPG sensors and alarms are in place to detect an LPG release.  \n\nEmergency Response Plan\n\nRudd Company, Inc. will respond to LPG-related emergencies by notifying the Loca"
