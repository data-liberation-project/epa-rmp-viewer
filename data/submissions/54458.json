To assist with ongoing compliance, a \"Chemical Accident Prevention Compliance Manual\" has been prepared.  An Operations and Maintenace Manual prepared by Domingue-Szabo & Associates will be kept on site.  Concerning the emergency response policy at the facility, the owner has made the decision that employees will not respond to accidental releases of regulated substances and will instead evacuate.\n\n\n\nThis facility is a Water treatment plant.  Treatment includes chlorination of the Water with chlorine cylinders located at the facility.  The process basically involves continuous mixing of chlorine with the Water whereby the final mixture contains less than 1 % chlorine by weight.  The treated Water is then released.  The storage cylinders and mixing equipment are subject to the RMP requirements since it contains threshold quantities of regulated substances.  \n\n\n\nThis facility has one worst case release scenario which involves the release of all substance contained in the single largest chlorine cylinder when full.  This scenario yields a distance to the endpoint of 3.0 miles.  Section 3.1 of this RMP shows the calculations used for this scenario.\n\n\n\nThis facility has an alternative release scenario.  The scenario involves a puncture of the largest diameter chlorine cylinder when full.  The scenario yields a distance to the endpoint of 0.3 miles.  Section 3.2 of this RMP shows the calculations used for this scenario.\n\n\n\nThe worst case and alternate release scenarios use the maximum capacity of the single largest vessel without administrative controls or mitigation measures to limit the volume or reduce the distance to the endpoint.\n\n\n\nSince this facility is a Program 2, a documented prevention program is required.  This program is discussed in a \"Chemical Accident Prevention Compliance M"

The prevention program does discuss chlorine which is the specific chemical contained in an amount above the threshold quantity.   \n\n\n\nAs documented in Section 4.0 of this RMP, the facility has not experienced a release as defined in the regulation within the past five years.  \n\n\n\nSince this facility is a Program 2, a written emergency response program is required.  This program is contained in Section 5.0 of the \"Chemical Accident Prevention Compliance Manual\" prepared for the facility.  Further, emergency response procedures have been developed and are contained at the front of this RMP and these procedures will be implemented in the event of an accidental release or the threat of such a release.  Basically, the instructions are to evacuate the facility and then notify the proper authorities.\n\n\n\nAt present time, there are no planned changes to improve safety."
