Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\n\nWe at the Grimmway/Malaga Plant are strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program and our process safety management program that addresses such critical safety issues as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the hazardous processes at our facility.  It is our goal to implement appropriate control measures to prevent accidental releases of regulated substances.\n\n2. The Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled:\n\nOur facility?s primary activities encompass Carrot processing and storage.  We have 2 regulated substances present at our facility.  Substance one is Ammonia (anhydrous) and is used as a refrigerant in our plant.  Substance two is Chlorine gas which is used for water treatment in our plant.\n\nThe maximum inventory of Ammonia (anhydrous) at our facility is 235,628.80 lbs.\n\nThe maximum inventory of Chlorine (gas) at our facility is 79,900.90 lbs.\n\n3. The Worst Case Release Scenarios and the Alternative Release Scenarios, including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario:\n\nTo evaluate worst case scenarios, we have used the EPA?s OCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equations, the EPA?s RMP Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration Reference Tables or Equations, and the RMP-COMP calculation program.  For alternative release scenarios we have employed the EPA?s RMP-COMP calculation program.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 3 toxic substances involving Ammonia (anhydrous) involves a catastrophic release from the ammonia refrigeration system in Building C.  In this scenario, 22,000 lbs. of Ammonia (anhydrous) is released "

The entire pool is estimated to evaporate over 10 minutes.  Passive mitigation systems such as an enclosure are also taken into account to calculate the scenario.  At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 1.8 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Ammonia (anhydrous) involves a release of ammonia from the refrigeration system in Building C.  The scenario involves the release of 2750 lbs. of Ammonia (anhydrous).  The liquid is assumed to be released to form a 1-cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to evaporate over 10 minutes.  Passive mitigation systems such as an enclosure are also taken into account to calculate the scenario.  At Class D atmospheric stability and 3.0 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 0.2 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 3 toxic substances involving Chlorine (gas) involves a catastrophic failure of a one ton chlorine cylinder.  In this scenario, 2000 lbs. of Chlorine gas are released with the entire contents having been released within ten minutes.  At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 3.0 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of  0.0087 mg/L.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Chlorine (gas) involves a release of chlorine from the water treatment system.  The scenario involves the release of 3 lbs. of Chlorine (gas) from a ruptured vacuum line.  The entire volume of gas is estimated to be released over 10 minutes.  At Class D atmospheric stability and 3.0 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 0.1 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L.\n\n4.
