The prevention program provides a structured approach to preventing accidents.  Some of the specific activities in the prevention program include: Process Safety Information is available at all times.  A hazard review has been conducted as part of the preparations for RMP compliance.  Written operating procedures are used for training and guiding the work of operators.  Training is provided to all employees who operate a system.  A program is in place to properly maintain the system and equipment.  Incidents are investigated and actions are taken as part of a continuous improvement effect.  Routine audits are conducted to assure compliance and safe practices are followed.  The sterilization process subject to the Risk Management Program is designed with extensive safeguards to protect against the accidental release of ethylene oxide.  Examples of safety equipment in place include, pressure relief devices, leak detection and alarm systems, door interlock system, electronic interlock safety systems for sterilization chambers, and explosion proof electrical systems.  In addition, process operators receive extensive training in the safe operation of the process; and are required to follow detailed operating procedures to ensure safety.  Sterigenics also has implemented a mechanical integrity program to monitor the physical condition of process equipment before it fails.  In the unlikely event of a spill or release involving ethylene oxide, Sterigenics has developed an emergency response plan providing procedures to be followed to minimize the potential impacts of a fire or release from the facility.",

The RMP consists of several elements, including an evaluation of potential accident scenarios and a comprehensive program to prevent accidental releases of regulated chemicals. \n\n\n\nThe RMP summarizes the management, administrative, procedural, and technological controls that work together to minimize the risk of hazardous chemical releases to the community.  The RMP includes the following information:\n\n? Introduction;\n\n? Facility identification and regulated substances;\n\n? Policies to protect health, environment, and safety;\n\n?

The facility is engaged in the sterilization of medical equipment and spices using ethylene oxide.  Ethylene oxide is listed as a regulated toxic substance under U.S. EPA's Risk Management Program regulations (40 CFR 68). \n\n\n\nPolicies to Protect Health, Safety and the Environment\n\n\n\nRisk management and safety are important concerns at Sterigenics - Salt Lake City.
