Accidental release prevention and emergency policies \n\nIn this wastewater treatment facility, we handle chlorine, which is considered hazardous by EPA.  The same properties that make chlorine valuable as a agent to reduce harmful pathogens also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions In handling chlorine to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as that of our co-workers and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and state rules and regulations in the handling of chlorine.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle chlorine, the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility, the safe handling procedures that we use and the training of our personnel. \n\nOur emergency response program is based on the Chlorine Institute's Pamphlet 64, Emergency Response Plans for Chlorine Facilities. The emergency response plan Includes procedures for notification of the local fire authority and notification of any potentially affected neighbors. \n\n2.  The stationary source and regulated substances handled \n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is the collection and treatment of wastewater from the surrounding community.  Chlorine is used in the treatment process to disinfect the treated plant effluent prior to discharge to disposal.  Chlorine is received by one-ton cylinders at the facility.  The facility has equipment for unloading tractor trailers containing one-ton cylinders of chlorine.  Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.  The regulated substance handled at this wastewater treatment plant is chlorine.  The total inventory stored at this facility is 4,000 pounds. \n\n3.  The general accidental release prevention program and the specific prevention steps \n\nThis wastewater treatment plant complies with EPA's Accidental"

Five-year accident history \n\nThere have been no accidental releases of chlorine within the past five years at this facility.  There have been no offsite damage or emergencies caused by chlorine stored at this facility. \n\n5.  Emergency response program \n\nThis facility's emergency response program is based on upon the Chlorine Institute's Pamphlet 64 and 162, Emergency Response Plans for Chlorine Facilities.  We have discussed this program with local district of State Emergency Response Team (SERT), local Emergency Planning Committee and the local Fire Department.  A representative of the local fire department visited this facility on June 1, 2006. \n\n6.  Planned changes to improve safety \n\nThis facility was constructed in 1981 and is in the process of going through a major upgrade to the facility.  As part of the upgrade to this facility it has been proposed to use liquid sodium hypochlorite as the disinfectant agent In place of gas chlorine thereby removing the risk of a hazardous release of chlorine gas.  Until the upgradeA?s are complete this facility will continue to follow Chlorine Institute guidelines and continue to improve our operations by following the appropriate programs.\n"
