      "SummaryText": "Gladieux Processing LLC owns and operates a petroleum processing facility in Huntington, IN.  Unlike large crude oil refining facilities, Gladieux's Huntington facility processes a petroleum product known as 'transmix.'  Transmix is a mixture of finished  products that forms when transported in pipelines.  The mixture is typically a combination of gasoline, diesel, and/or jet fuel, but as a mixture, do not meet approved specifications for fuels.  The process at the Huntington facility uses distillation to separate the products, including treatment to product saleable gasoline and diesel.\n\n\n\nIn order to meet Federal US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) mandates for  ultra-low sulfur fuel, Gladieux has invested in a significant expansion at its Huntington facility.  Gladieux has employed state-of-the-art technology in further processing transmix to meet mandated ultra-low sulfur fuel requirements.  This technology, called hydrotreating, and subsequent processing, requires the use of several chemicals regulated under USEPA's Accidental Release Prevention Program.  The regulated chemicals include sulfur dioxide, anhydrous ammonia, and hydrogen.  \n\n\n\nUSEPA's Accidental Release Prevention Program requires regulated facilities to develop and implement a Risk Management Program (RMP).  Likewise, the US Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA) requires facilities handling these chemicals to develop a Process Safety Management (PSM) program.  RMP/PSM is targeted to ensure that programs and procedures are in place to prevent accidental releases that could injure workers or impact the community.   \n\n\n\nGladieux's use of the RMP/PSM regulated materials includes product receipt, bulk storage, and transfer to processing equipment.  Gladieux has developed a RMP/PSM program including procedures targeted to hazard identification, accident prevention, and emergency response.  Gladieux's RMP/PSM program includes:\n\n\n\n?    Process hazard analysis reviews\n\n?    Written operating "

Mechanical integrity (i.e., preventive maintenance)\n\n\n\nThe program includes a compilation of documentation that describes the hazards of the chemicals handled, process technology, the design of process equipment, and safety systems employed.  Development of these prevention programs included participation of facility employees (including operators) knowledgeable in plant operations.  The RMP/PSM program includes procedures for managing change as well as pre-startup review.  Safe work practices include, but not limited to, hot work, lock-out/tag-out, confined space entry, line/vessel opening, and others.  These programs are targeted to enhance safety and  accident prevention.\n\n\n\nGladieux's management team, along with all of its employees, is committed to providing a workplace free of accidents.  For example, during the early stages of process design, the facility conducted a comprehensive hazard and operability (HAZOP) study geared to identifying potential hazards related to the hydrotreating process and use of sulfur dioxide, anhydrous ammonia, and hydrogen.  The HAZOP included evaluation of engineering and administrative controls to prevent, detect, or mitigate hazards.  The HAZOP identified recommendations for improved process safety that were incorporated into the final design.  A second HAZOP was then conducted to review the status of previous recommendations, and included identification of additional risk reduction measures.  The HAZOP study teams included Gladieux plant personnel, engineering process design personnel, and technology providers. \n\n\n\nThe hydrotreating process, including equipment involved in the handling of sulfur dioxide, anhydrous ammonia, and hydrogen, was designed in accordance with applicable engineering codes and standards.  Applicable engineering codes and standards include:\n\n\n\n?    National Electric Code\n\n?    American Society of Mechanical Engineers Code B31.3\n\n?    ASME Code Section VIII ,Div. 1, Unfired Pressu"
