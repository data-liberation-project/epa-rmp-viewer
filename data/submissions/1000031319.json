      "SummaryText": "The CHS Propane Terminal - Biddeford complies with NFPA 58 requirements for LP-Gas storage.  It is CHS' policy to comply with all applicable laws and regulations and to conduct business in a manner which protects the environment, Company employees and the general public.  If an emergency were to occur, we would notify the Biddeford Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.\n\n\n\nThe CHS Propane Terminal - Biddeford is a bulk terminal storing LPG for resale to propane marketers in the area.  The facility consists of three 60,000 gallon storage tanks.\n\n\n\nOur worst-case scenario is failure of one 60,000 gallon storage tank when filled to the greatest amount allowed (88% at 60 degrees F), resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  The resulting distance to the endpoint extends offsite, and public receptors are within the distance to the endpoint.  Our alternative scenario is a pull-away of the two transport hoses, leading to a release of the contents of two 2 inch hoses.  The resulting distance to the endpoint extends offsite; however, no public receptors are within the distance to the endpoint.\n\n\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule, the OSHA PSM standard and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.  The propane system is designed, installed and maintained in accordance with NFPA 58, state law and company policies.\n\n\n\nWe have never had an accident involving propane that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations or sheltering in place.\n\n\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving our propane system, it is our policy to notify the Biddeford Fire Department and request that they help respond to the emergency.  We have coordinated our response plans with the fire department and the deputy chief has been onsite to review our construction and systems.  Upon startup, members of the fire department will be trained and walked through the facility.\n\n"
