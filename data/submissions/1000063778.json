This Program summarizes the management, administrative, procedural, and technological controls that work together to minimize the risk to site personnel, contractors, visitors, and the community and environment at large of hazardous chemical releases. The Risk Management Plan (RMP) is organized to correspond with specific U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) RMP, Program 3 of 40 CFR 68, definitions and requirements of Subpart G, including: \r\n\u00bf\tIntroduction;\r\n\u00bf\tOSI's policies to protect health, environment, and safety;\r\n\u00bf\tFacility identification and regulated substances covered processes;\r\n\u00bf\tHazard Assessment;\r\n\u00bf\tPrevention Program;\r\n\u00bf\tFive-Year Accident History;\r\n\u00bf\tEmergency Response Plan; \r\n\u00bf\tEmergency Communications;\r\n\u00bf\tSpill Reporting / Environmental Release Procedures;\r\n\u00bf\tPlanned changes to improve safety; and\r\n\u00bf\tManagement Program\r\n\r\nII.\tOSI's Policies To Protect Health, Environment, and Safety\r\nRisk management and safety are important concerns at OSI; this RMP formalizes and documents these activities. OSI is committed to conducting its operations in a safe and responsible manner and to reducing risks to human health and to the environment. It is OSI's policy to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local rules and regulations.\r\n\r\nThis RMP has identified potential hazards and has taken steps to design and maintain a safe facility in order to prevent releases, and minimize the consequences of accidental releases, which could occur. RMP addresses potentially catastrophic chemical releases that could result in immediate harm and acute health effects to offsite receptors (public and environmental). The RMP includes the Facility's Emergency Action Plan (EAP) that contains procedures, which are designed to maximize the safety of all employees, contractors, and vi"

The facility processes ready to cook and fully cooked bacon and ground beef and processes and packages chili, beans and other kettle cooked specialties. The NAICS code for the processes at the facility is 311612.  Many areas of the plant are refrigerated to maintain temperature in the production and storage areas.\r\n\r\nThe facility uses ammonia for refrigeration, and is regulated under 40 CFR Part 68, the EPA RMP Rule. There is one RMP regulated refrigeration system onsite that is used for refrigerating meat products. \r\n\r\nAn area map identifying the site location is included as Appendix A. \r\n\r\nIV.\tHazard Assessment - Worst Case Scenario (WCS)\r\nAppendix B consists of the RMP*Submit Printout and contains additional information on the worst-case scenario.  Appendix C consists of the offsite consequence analysis data and maps for the worst case release scenario. \r\n\r\n\r\nV.\tHazard Assessment - Alternative Release Scenario (ARS)\r\nAppendix B consists of the RMP*Submit Printout and contains additional information on the alternate scenario.

This prevention program covers those processes that handle ammonia above the threshold quantity for both PSM and RMP rules. An audit of the PSM program was conducted in March of 2012 and the next audit take place on, or before, March 27, 2015 in compliance with the requirement to conduct PSM audits every three years.

OSI recently conducted an audit of their Process Safety Management Program and has dutifully implemented the recommendations from that audit. Continuous improvement in safety is an important goal for Otto & Sons. In addition to the facility ERP, the plant is included in a community emergency response plan developed by the Cook County Local Emergency Planning Committee. \r\n\r\nXI.\tManagement Program\r\nOtto & Sons has developed a management system to oversee the implementation of the risk management program elements.  This includes assigning a qualified person (or position) to have overall responsibility for the development, implementation, and integration of the risk management program elements.  If any portion of the program is delegated to others, the names or positions of those individuals need to be documented and the lines of authority defined through an organization chart or similar document.
