The RMP was developed following U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) guidance documents and 40 CFR Part 68 (Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions). \r\n\r\nThe RMP describes and details the evaluation in determining Lehigh's process per \u00a768.3, Program Level assignment (\u00a768.1) and various applicable site level prevention programs (\u00a768 Subpart C).  The Plant Registration Form is presented in Section 2.0.  Section 3.0 provides the results of the hazards assessment, Section 4.0 describes the Plant's prevention program, and Section 5.0 presented the Plant's emergency response program. \r\n  \r\nThe result of the Plant's risk management evaluation is summarized below:\r\n\r\n\u00bf\tStorage of 24 percent aqueous ammonia in a 40,000 gallon AST triggers RMP,\r\n\u00bf\tProcess is \"storage\" of aqueous ammonia solution (CAS Nos. : 1336-21-6 and  7664-41-7), and\r\n\u00bf\tResults of worst case scenario (\u00a768.25) provides a Program 2 designation.\r\n     \r\nPer \u00a768.155, the Executive Summary of the Risk Management Plan (RMP) is required to include a brief description of the following: \r\n\r\n\u00bf\tThe stationary source and regulated substances handled; \r\n\u00bf\tThe five-year accident history;\r\n\u00bf\tThe accidental release prevention and emergency response policies; \r\n\u00bf\tThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps; \r\n\u00bf\tThe emergency response program; and\r\n\u00bf\tPlanned changes to improve safety.\r\n\r\nDescribed below are the required elements listed above.  \r\n\r\n\u00bf\tThe Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nThe Plant will store a 24 percent concentration aqueous ammonia in a 40,000 gallon above-ground storage tank (AST) located at the base of the PH/PC kiln system.

As a result, the Plant is required to develop a Contingency Plan and to implement the Contingency Plan during a fire, explosion, or hazardous waste release (COMAR 26.13.03.05(E)).  The Contingency Plan was developed based on requirements found in 40 CFR 262.34(a)(4); 40 CFR 265 Subpart D; the Code of Maryland Regulations (COMAR) 26.13.05.02 General Facility Standards; COMAR 26.13.05.03 Preparedness and Prevention; and COMAR 26.13.05.04 Contingency Plan and Emergency Procedures.  Also included in the Contingency Plan are additional requirements outlined in 40 CFR 262.34(d)(5)(i).\r\n\r\nAs part of preparing the Contingency Plan, the Plant also developed an Emergency Response and Disaster Control Plan that describes the actions that will be taken in the case of small or large fires, explosions, sudden or non-"
