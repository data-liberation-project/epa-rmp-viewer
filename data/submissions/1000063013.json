The RMP was developed following U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) guidance documents and 40 CFR Part 68 (Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions). \n\n\n\nThe RMP describes and details the evaluation in determining Lehigh's process per ?68.3, Program Level assignment (?68.1) and various applicable site level prevention programs (?68 Subpart C).  The Plant Registration Form is presented in Section 2.0.  Section 3.0 provides the results of the hazards assessment, Section 4.0 describes the Plant's prevention program, and Section 5.0 presented the Plant's emergency response program. \n\n  \n\nThe result of the Plant's risk management evaluation is summarized below:\n\n\n\n?    Storage of 24 percent aqueous ammonia in a 40,000 gallon AST triggers RMP,\n\n?    Process is \"storage\" of aqueous ammonia solution (CAS Nos. : 1336-21-6 and  7664-41-7), and\n\n?    Results of worst case scenario (?68.25) provides a Program 2 designation.\n\n     \n\nPer ?68.155, the Executive Summary of the Risk Management Plan (RMP) is required to include a brief description of the following: \n\n\n\n?    The stationary source and regulated substances handled; \n\n?    The five-year accident history;\n\n?    The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies; \n\n?    The general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps; \n\n?    The emergency response program; and\n\n?    Planned changes to improve safety.\n\n\n\nDescribed below are the required elements listed above.  \n\n\n\n?    The Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nThe Plant will store a 24 percent concentration aqueous ammonia in a 40,000 gallon above-ground storage tank (AST) located at the base of the PH/PC kiln system.  This AST has secondary containment."

As a result, the Plant is required to develop and submit to the U.S. EPA, per 40 CFR 68, a Risk Management Plan (RMP) since aqueous ammonia at a 20 percent or greater concentration will be stored in a 40,000 gallon AST that exceeds the threshold storage limit of 20,000 gallons as stipulated in Table 1 of 40 CFR 68.130.\n\n\n\n?    Five-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThe Plant has had no accidents, including spills, associated with the operation of the 40,000 gallon aqueous ammonia AST in the last five years.  The tank was commissioned in March 2011.\n\n\n\n?

Spill Prevention, Control, and Countermeasures (SPCC) Plan\n\n\n\nThe Plant episodically generates refractory material which is classified as a hazardous.  As a result, the Plant is required to develop a Contingency Plan and to implement the Contingency Plan during a fire, explosion, or hazardous waste release (COMAR 26.13.03.05(E)).  The Contingency Plan was developed based on requirements found in 40 CFR 262.34(a)(4); 40 CFR 265 Subpart D; the Code of Maryland Regulations (COMAR) 26.13.05.02 General Facility Standards; COMAR 26.13.05.03 Preparedness and Prevention; and COMAR 26.13.05.04 Contingency Plan and Emergency Procedures.  Also included in the Contingency Plan are additional requirements outlined in 40 CFR 262.34(d)(5)(i).\n\n\n\nAs part of preparing the Contingency Plan, the Plant also developed an Emergency Response and Disaster Control Plan that describes the actions that will be taken in the case of small or large fires, explosions, sudden or non-"
