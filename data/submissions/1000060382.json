The facility uses a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of its employees and the public, as well as protection of the environment.  It is a facility policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent releases of regulated substances where possible.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that have been designed and implemented, including the following:\n\n\n\n?    A description of the facility and use of substances exceeding threshold quantities, in a single process, which are regulated by the EPA's RMP Rule;\n\n?    A summary of the potential off-site consequences from possible accidental chemical releases;\n\n?    An overview of accidental release prevention programs;\n\n?    A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by the RMP Rule;\n\n?    An overview of the Emergency Response Program; and,\n\n?    An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting employees, the public, and the environment.\n\n\n\n3.1  Regulated Substances\n\n\n\n    PCC manufactures nitrogenous fertilizer.  The facility consists of an anhydrous ammonia plant, two nitric acid plants, two liquid ammonium nitrate plants, a CO2 plant, and two liquid urea plants.  Anhydrous ammonia (ammonia) is produced from processing natural gas, and chlorine is used as a disinfectant in the facility's cooling towers. Ammonia and chlorine are the only substances at the facility that are listed on the RMP Rule Toxic Substances list and stored or maintained above threshold quantities, causing them to be subject to the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68.

Also, PCC parallels the RMP Rule by complying with Process Safety Management (PSM) requirements, as specified by OSHA in 29 CFR 1910 119.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program in place at the facility.\n\n\n\n    3.2.1  Process Safety Information\n\n\n\nPCC maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\n\n\n    3.2.2  Process Hazard Analysis\n\n\n\n    PCC conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with facility processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is the \"HAZOP\".  These analyses are conducted by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are validated at regular intervals.  Findings related to the process hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n\n\n    3.2.3  Operating Procedures\n\n\n\n    For the purpose of safely conducting activiti"

PCC also strives to create a culture within the facility that encourages environmental excellence.\n\n\n\n3.4  Five-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThe following is a brief summary of significant accidental chemical releases involving materials covered under EPA's RMP Rule during the previous five years.\n\n\n\n    3.4.1  Anhydrous Ammonia\n\n\n\n    The only release that resulted in on-site/off-site impacts occurred on February 6, 2014, where a work order was issued to cut out and replace a water line damaged due to freezing water. The damaged water line was directly connected to an ammonia transfer line, which was used for water injection in the ammonia truck loading process.  Due to human error, the ammonia transfer line containing ammonia under pressure was not isolated or cleared prior to conducting the repairs on the damaged water line. \n\n    When work began on the damaged line, pressure was released through a valve, resulting in a backflow of ammonia into the water line and through the valve.  The event resulted in a release of over 400 pounds of ammonia, which came in contact with and caused facial chemical burns on one of the personnel performing the repairs.  The employee was transported to a medical center; however, after arrival, medical professionals determined that the employee's injuries were not as serious as initially thought, and the employee was released the following day.\n\n    The release of ammonia from the event also impacted a nearby highway by causing traffic to be temporarily brought to a halt; however, no evacuations of "

      "SummaryText": "any neighboring facilities were warranted, and no other known off-site impacts occurred. \n\n\n\n    3.4.2  Chlorine\n\n\n\n    During the past five years, PCC has not had an accidental chlorine release, resulting in on-site or off-site site consequences, including deaths, injuries, significant property damage, environmental damage, off-site evacuation, or sheltering in place.\n\n \n\n3.5  Emergency Response Programs\n\n\n\nPCC maintains a written Emergency Action Plan, which provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting the workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  The plan contains procedures for emergency response, such as first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification to local emergency response agencies and the public, and post incident measures.  Emergency response activities are coordinated with the Pryor Fire Department and Mayes County Local Emergency Planning Committee.  The latest emergency response drill was conducted on December 4, 2013 and was audited by an outside contractor. \n\nThe facility also utilizes a plant wide emergency notification system consisting of a remote wireless activated rotating siren centered in the facility and hand held radios to assist with employee notification and communications during emergency situations.\n\n\n\n3.6  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nPCC continues to improves and enhance the safety programs and culture established at the facility.  The facility is continually allocating funds for a full Digital Control System (DCS) in all major units to improve control of safety and shut down devices.  This system will allow for more computer-based decision making, which will reduce the risk of human error.  PCC has recently expanded the fall protection systems throughout the facility and is currently continuing expansion of the fire protection systems throughout the facility.  In addition, PCC has recently implemented the Milliken Safety Process at the facility and is integrating a"
