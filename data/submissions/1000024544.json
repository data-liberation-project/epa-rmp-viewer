Refrigeration is maintained by isolating the low side in some form of insulated enclosure where goods are chilled or frozen.  \r\n\r\nAmmonia is the regulated substance of concern.  The Facility has two engine areas that use a combined total of 11,168 pounds of ammonia in this single process.\r\n\r\nC.  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nThe Wawona Frozen Foods Ranch ammonia refrigeration system has many safety features.  Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system. \r\n\r\nThe Process Safety Management program ensures that all security and safety procedures are addressed.  Staff are trained in operation, maintenance and emergency procedures related to the operation of the ammonia refrigeration system.  All refrigeration equipment and ammonia vessels are equipped with automatic pressure safety relief devices to prevent pressure build-up beyond safe equipment operation levels.  A preventative maintenance program assures that equipment is maintained and serviced on a regular schedule and that worn, aging, or defective components are replaced as required to maintain equipment in good operating condition.  Controls and safety devices are tested regularly to ensure proper operation.\r\n\r\nD.  FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nThere have been no significant releases of ammonia that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 100 pounds or the state requirement mandating immediate reporting of any release or threatened release of a hazardous material in the past five years (December 2006 - December 2011).  \r\n\r\nHowever, there was a minor release of 0.5 pounds of ammonia in June 2010.  A malfunction of the 1/4 valve on top of the side column of the liquid transfer vessel caused a 1.5-minute release of ammonia.  An employee working on the valve got a small burn on his arm and was sent to th"

EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\n\r\nWawona Frozen Foods' Emergency Response Plan was designed to ensure a safe and healthy working environment.  The policy at Wawona Frozen Foods is to identify and correct unsafe conditions and work practices before an incident can occur.  The Emergency Response Plan outlines the company safety policy, responsibilities, accident investigation, and proper safety training procedures required to provide a safe work place.  \r\n\r\nWawona Frozen Foods' Emergency Response Plan is outlined in the PSM/RMP documentation and the IIPP and focuses on responding to ammonia releases.\r\n\r\nEvacuation Routes and Procedures\r\nIn the event of an emergency requiring evacuation, personnel will be instructed to vacate the premises to the designated assembly area.  This is upwind of the release and typically at the northeast corner of the facility.  \r\n\r\nMitigation Measures\r\nA group response team will be established to assess the situation and be available to assist the Fire Department.  Certain trained personnel are authorized to shut down the ammonia refrigeration system while exiting the area.  SCBAs are maintained and personnel are trained for response with assistance from the Fire Department.\r\n\r\nF.  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nWawona Frozen Foods is planning to complete several items over the next year as their continued effort to provide a safe work environment for their employees.  These changes include the following items:\r\n\r\n1.  Continue to train all employees in PSM/RMP/CalARP and safety programs.\r\n\r\n2.  Continue to have employee involvement in updating and refining PSM/RMP/CalARP and the facility's safety programs.\r\n\r\n3.  Continue employee involvement through the Employee Participation program.\r\n\r\n4.  Continue internal and external safety audits/inspections and implement changes as needed."

Senior management administer the safety and environmental policies and programs.  These programs include but are not limited to forklift safety, hazard communications, lockout/tagout, Hazardous Materials Emergency Business Plan, employee safety manuals, manufacturers documentation, Emergency Response, as well as the Risk Management Plan.\r\n\r\nWawona Frozen Foods has independently coordinated emergency response efforts with the local Fire Department.  In the case of an ammonia-related emergency, it is the policy of Wawona Frozen Foods to evacuate the production area and to allow the HazMat team to respond to the emergency.  If an ammonia release could potentially impact the local community, a Community Notification Plan would be activated.  This plan has been developed and implemented with input from local fire, police, and medical officials.  If an ammonia release were to extend into the neighboring community, a Shelter-In-Place plan would go into effect.\r\n\r\nThe refrigeration system is a closed loop system similar to a residential refrigerator.  There are no emissions or planned releases of ammonia.\r\n\r\nB. STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\r\n\r\nWawona Frozen Foods Ranch facility maintains one ammonia refrigeration system that cycles the refrigerant, or ammonia, from liquid to gas and back again.
