The plant uses chlorine to disinfect the water during the treatment process.  Typically, the plant has four (4) 1-ton containers on-site in order to meet their monthly chlorine needs.  \n\nFour (4) operators work at the plant.  Each operator works a 12-hour shift, 7-days on and 7-days off.  Each operator has state certification at various levels for water treatment.  \n\nMaterial Safety Data sheets for chlorine are posted at the plant.  Operation and maintenance data from the manufacturer of the chlorinator are also available to the operator at the plant.  \n\nThe only regular task that the operators perform on the chlorine containers is to change the chlorinator when a container is empty.  The procedure that the operators follow when the chlorinator needs changing includes reviewing the manufacturer's instructions, and having a second operator present.  The chlorinators are equipped with an automatic shutoff valve that seals off the chlorine in the container upon loss of vacuum.  This prevents a chlorine leak from occurring in the event that the mounting stem completely breaks off during the transfer process.\n\nThe worst case scenario indicates that a complete release of one (1) 1-ton container with a wind speed of 1.5 m/sec and an atmospheric stability class of F will result in an endpoint distance of 3.0 miles.  With the automatic shutoff valve, a complete release is very unlikely. No accidents have occurred in the past five years.\n\nThe Town of Many does not provide emergency response for toxic releases.  In the event of a chlorine release on-site, the operator has an oxygen tank and mask available for his use.  After putting on the oxygen tank and mask, the operator would secure the plant and notify the Sabine Sheriff's Office of the release.  The Sheriff's O"
