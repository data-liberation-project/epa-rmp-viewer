      "SummaryText": "Albemarle Corporation Process Development Center, Baton Rouge, Louisiana 70805\n\n2694 LDEQ Facility ID Number\n\nThe Albemarle Process Development Center is a production facility which supports R&D efforts for conducting laboratory, pilot plant, and market development scale research to develop chemical processes for new fine chemical products.  At this site, Albemarle produces sample quantities (1 kg level) to semi-commercial quantities of various catalysts, flame retardants, agricultural intermediates, and pharmaceutical products.  Additionally, Albemarle has truck unloading facilities to receive and store elemental bromine.  This bromine has been supplied via pipeline to an adjacent external facility and to processes within the plant for nearly a decade, with an exceptional safety record.\n\nCurrently Albemarle has on site RMP covered levels of one toxic chemical, bromine, and one flammable, diethyl ether.  Isopentane had previously been listed as a covered flammable.  Isopentane inventory on site has been reduced to below the covered level.  Ammonia was previously listed as a toxic on site in 1999, however, ammonia storage has been eliminated and inventory reduced below the RMP covered level. Bromine is used extensively in two processes, 1) the Bromine supply terminal, and 2) manufacture of a polymeric flame retardant, HP-7010.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies - In its operations, Albemarle is committed to the safety of the surrounding community, as well as protection of the environment.  With a strong Process Safety Management program in place, Albemarle combines both passive and active mitigation systems to prevent offsite consequences in the event of a spill of bromine.  In addition, our highly trained Emergency Response team is always available to respond to any incident, and bring it quickly under control. Emergency responders are trained annually and a trained Incident Commander is on site at all times to coordinate response efforts"

      "SummaryText": ". Periodic drills are conducted to make sure that all affected personnel are trained and aware of emergency response procedures.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety - Albemarle is committed to an ever improving safety program to maintain its rating in the top 5% in the chemical industry.  An increased emphasis is being placed on Process Hazards Analyses (PHA) of all chemical operations including bench scale processes for new projects.  Training in 2000 focused on schooling a large percentage of our wageroll and technical force in PHA techniques and developing additional technical PHA leaders to ensure that processes started up at our R&D Process Development Center are evaluated with regard to safety, health, and environmental aspects.  We have ongoing efforts to improve the quality of PHA studies on new processes in 2001 to ensure thoroughness and effectiveness. \n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program - Albemarle employs the latest technology in its process controls, and monitoring and mitigation systems to ensure that accidental releases are prevented or the risks associated with them are minimized.  Process documentation for covered processes are in compliance with OSHA 1910.119 requirements for Process Safety Management (PSM).  Equipment inspections are scheduled and documented to ensure vessel integrities.  Bromine storage and handling equipment are either glass-lined carbon steel, kynar lined piping, or nickel lined piping and vessel. Area monitors are maintained to detect bromine.\n\nWorst Case Scenario (Toxic) - A thorough Risk Management Program Hazard Analysis was performed for the site, showing the following worst-case scenario: \n\nComplete rupture of the 5,000 gallon bromine storage tank, causing an immediate pooling of bromine in the curbed concrete containment area.  At an evaporation rate of 125 pounds per minute, with a wind speed of 1.5 meters per second, an offsite impact distance of 4.1 miles is seen.  Approximately 1,000 persons live in reside"

In the event of a spill or even a tank rupture, the bulk of the spilled bromine would enter the sumps and sink below the water, thereby preventing evaporation and minimizing any offsite impact.  The most credible scenario for such an incident has shown that only 65 pounds of bromine would be released offsite, given a wind speed of 3.0 m/s, producing an impact distance of only 0.34 mile, or 1,800 feet.  Approximately 142 persons live in residential areas within the impact distance.  There are no hospitals, schools or recreation areas within the impact distance.\n\nAlternate Case Scenario (flammable) - Albemarle has a solvent storage process tank with diethyl ether which is used  in various Research & Development for making new catalysts for polyolefin plastics.  A thorough Risk Management Program Hazard Analysis showed the following worst-case scenario:\n\n- A rupture of the diethyl ether storage tank, releasing 15,000 pounds of material which then ignites to produce a vapor cloud explosion.  Under this scenario, the distance to a 1 psi overpressure is 0.2 miles.  There are no residential areas within this impact distance, nor are there hospitals, schools or recreational areas.\n\nFurther analysis of the most credible scenarios for releases of diethyl ether gave the following scenario:\n\nA leak from a transfer line during transfer of diethyl etherfrom the storage tank, releasing 500 pounds which then ignites in a vapor cloud explosion.  Under this scenario, the distance to a 1 psi overpressure is 0.06 mile, or 317 feet.  There are no residential areas, hospitals"
