The process is regulated by the OSHA Process Safety Management Program of Highly Hazardous Chemicals, Title 29 CFR 1910.119.  This is an RMP Program Level 3 facility.  The facility is in the process of implementing a prevention program described below.\n\nThe Baltimore Terminal has a commitment to employee and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases.  However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release. \n\nThompsonGas Propane Holdings, LLC entered into a lease agreement with United Leasing in the latter months of 2009.  \n\nThe prevention program exceeds the requirements of this regulation and includes the following: Employee Participation, Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Contractor Evaluation, Contractors and Visitor Orientation, Pre-Job Start-Up Review, Mechanical Integrity, Code of Safe Work Practices (Hot Work Permit, Confined Space Entry, Control of Hazardous Energy), Management of Change, Incident Investigation, Emergency Planning and Response, and Compliance Audits. \n\nTraining includes employee responsibilities in the process safety management program, National Propane Gas Association-certified employee training program, hotwork permit procedure, code of safe work practices, and operating procedures.  All visitors onto the property must undergo a site safety orientation and check in prior to each visit. Planned changes to improve safety have been established based on compliance with the process safety management audits every three years and revalidation of the process hazard analysis every five years.

      "SummaryText": "s revalidation was March 1999. \n\nThe facility receives, stores and distributes liquefied petroleum gas (LPG).  There are 9 tanks with a capacity of approximately 30,000 gallons each.  The tanks are administratively controlled to hold liquefied petroleum gasoline at 85% of maximum capacity (25,370 gallons each tank).  \n\nThompson Gas maintains an emergency response plan in compliance with local emergency response agencies.  The Baltimore Terminal has established a relationship with the Baltimore City Fire Department and has allowed them access to the terminal for training purposes.  \n\nIn the event of an accidental release, the facility operators are trained to shut off the source from a safe location or activate one of the emergency shutdown devices, contact 9-1-1 and secure the area.  The 9-1-1 system is used to notify the Fire Department.\n\nBased on the criteria set forth in 40 CFR 68.10, medical treatment was administered 2/24/99 to an employee for a freeze burn from propane.  This information was verified by reviewing internal records.  \n\nThe worst case release scenario is based on a version of the Baker-Strehlow vapor cloud explosion model created by Wilfred Baker Engineering, Inc.  The worse case release simulation of 107,234 pounds of propane resulted in a 1 psi explosion overpressure distance of 0.07 miles.  This simulation assumed medium fuel reactivity, medium obstruction and a 3-dimensional expansion. This distance impacts public receptors of adjacent industrial areas and no resident population.  In addition, although there are numerous controls in place, none were taken into account for evaluating the worst case scenario.  The alternative release scenario for this process is a hose rupture while pumping propane.  This scenario was modeled using CANARY by Quest Consultants, Inc., which includes a momentum jet (Ooms) model appropriate for simulating this type of release.  This scenario assumed the pump continued to operate at a rate of 400 gallons per minute"

In addition, a 3 meter/second wind speed, an atmospheric stability of D (neutrally buoyant), a 70% relative humidity and an ambient temperature of 80F were assumed.  The simulation calculated that 15,918 pounds of material were released in the assumed time frame.  The resulting simulated vapor cloud traveled 0.10 miles downwind to reach the lower flammable limit (LFL) for propane (2.10%).  Mitigation measures were taken into account when evaluating the alternative release scenario.  In general, the process does have mitigation measures consisting of relief valves, check valves, manual shutoff valves, automatic shutoffs, startup and operating procedures, grounding equipment, and excess flow devices.  The facility operator and truck driver are also in attendance during transfer operations.\n\nThe engineering and administrative controls in place have been established to reduce the risk of an accidental release of identified hazards.  Thompson Gas is committed to operations that are safe for employees and the surrounding community."
