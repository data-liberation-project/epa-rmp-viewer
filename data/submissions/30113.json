This emergency response policy and response plan is written specifically for the Water Treatment Division, utilizing all emergency response resources available in the community.\n\n         The Roundtop Water Treatment Plant is no longer treating surface water and is being scheduled for demolition. Currently well water is periodically chlorinated there during the summer months as water demand dictates. The chlorine room of the plant can contain up to four one ton containers, two vacuum regulators, a chlorine leak detector, and a vent fan. This equipment is used for the periodic disinfection of well water pumped to the finished water storage tank. The plant is now unmanned, however there are two security checks performed daily. The leak sensor and building door alarms have all been installed on the SCADA system and remotely read out at the new treatment facility.\n\n        The general accidental release prevention program and chlorine specific prevention steps have outlined by the OSHA PSM rule. There is close attention paid to mechanical integrity or maintenance of equipment, operating procedures, management of change, and startup procedures after a change or shutdown. All aspects of PSM are trained on at least annually with evaluation done by demonstration and observation. All procedures were written with the participation of the employees. A state of the art leak detection system is in place to notify personnel of a chlorine leak via SCADA system. All contracotrs are trained on emergency procedures. No visitors are allowed on the plant site anymore.\n\n        There have been no incidents to report on the last five years.\n\n        The facility has an emergency response plan that has been coordinated with local emergency responders.

In case of an emergency an operator is to notify 911 where upon they will notify emergency responders.\n\n        The addition of the chlorine leak detector and perimeter door alarms to the SCADA  system now allows remote readout of alarms at the new facility. The implementation of OSHA PSM and EPA RMP has lead operations staff and management to be more safety conscious and be safety proactive instead of reactive."
