We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public, as well as protection of the environment. \n\nThe stationary source and regulated substances handled [40 CFR 68.155(b)]:\nThe facility manufactures flexible polyurethane foam, using a pre-polymer blend of toluene diisocyanate (TDI) mixed isomers as one of the raw materials. The maximum inventory is over the 10,000-lb threshold quantity of TDI, and includes the TDI pre-polymer unload tank, storage tank, and day tank. The TDI pre-polymer is received in tank trucks which pressure unloads the material into an unload tank. The unload tank is filled only when empty. The pre-polymer is transferred to a storage tank on an as-needed basis. If a foam formulation calls for the addition of the pre-polymer, the line operator enters that information into the process controller. The line operator must then enable an auto-fill feature of the run tank and an automatic valve on a recirculating loop will open so that the pre\u00ad polymer can fill the run tank. From there, the pre-polymer is chilled and pumped to the mixing head station on the foam line. The TDI pre-polymer reacts with other components and is deposited on a carrier as polyurethane foam.\n\nRelease scenarios: In accordance with RMP reporting requirement changes, our Worst Case and Alternate scenarios are contained within Sections 2 & 3.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps [40 CFR 68.155(c)]:\nThe facility takes a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.

All safety information is reviewed prior to the completion of the hazard review.\n\nHazard review [40 CFR 68.50]\nComprehensive analyses ensure that hazards associated with the process are identified and controlled efficiently. The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of 5 years. Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating procedures [40 CFR 68.52]\nTo ensure safe operations, the facility maintains detailed written operating procedures. These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations and normal shutdown. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining [40 CFR 68.54]\nThe facility has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating plant processes are competent in the applicable operating procedures. Refresher training is provided at least every three years and more frequently as needed.\n\nMaintenance [40 CFR 68.56]\nThe facility carries out documented maintenance checks on the process equipment to ensure proper operations. Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices. Maintenance is completed based on RAGAGEP and manufacturer recommendations.\n\nCompliance audits [40 CFR 68.58]\nThe facility conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the US EPA RMP regulations are being implemented.

These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring. All reports are retained for a minimum period of 5 years.\n\nThese individual elements of our prevention program work together to prevent accidental chemical releases. Our company and our employees are committed to the standard that these management systems set for the way we do business, and we have specific accountabilities and controls to ensure that we are meeting our own high standards for accident prevention.\n\nThe five-year accident history [40 CFR 68.155(d)]:\nWithin the past five years, the process has had no accidental releases of TDI that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site; or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\nThe emergency response program [40 CFR 68.155(e)]:\nIn the event of an emergency involving our pre-polymer TDI, the on\u00adsite trained Hazwoper Team will respond to small spills. In the event of a larger spill, it is the facility policy to notify our contract emergency spill response company and request that they respond to the situation.\nPlanned changes to improve safety [40 CFR 68.155(f)]:\nThe facility has recently conducted a hazard review of the TDI process and is regularly reviewing the hazard review recommendations to ensure they are resolved in a timely manner.
