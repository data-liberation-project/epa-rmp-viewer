We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n?    A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulation\n?    A summary of results from our assessment of the potential off site consequence from accidental chemical releases\n?    An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\n?    A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule\n?    An overview of our emergency response program\n?    An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment\n?    The certifications that EPA's RMP rule requires us to provide\n?    The detailed information (called data elements) about our risk management program\n\n\n2.0    STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\nOur facility produces polyurethane foam using a variety of chemicals and processing operations.  Crest Foam uses a listed chemical Toluene Diisocyanate in its manufacturing operation to make flexible polyurethane slab stock foam.  In our processes, we use the following chemicals that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release:\n\nToxics:\n\nAttached is a copy of Crest Foam's Tier II report for TDI.\n\nFlammables:\n\nNone.\n\nOur accidental release prevention programs and our contingency planning efforts help us effectivel"

Our management systems address each of the key features of successful prevention programs including:\n\nProcess safety information\nProcess hazard analysis\nOperating procedures\nTraining\nMechanical integrity\nManagement of change\nPre-startup review\nCompliance audits\nIncident investigation\nEmployee participation\nHot work permit\nContractors\n\nThe key to preventing accidental chemical releases is the Standard Operating Procedures that are in Appendix D.\n\nThese individual elements of our prevention program work together to prevent accidental chemical releases.  Our company and our employees are committed to the standard that these management systems set for the way we do business, and we have specific accountabilities and controls to ensure that we are meeting our own high standards for accident prevention.\n\n4.0    FIVE-YEAR ACCIDNT HISTORY\n\nWe keep records for all significant accidental chemical releases that occur at our facility.  The following is a brief summary of the accidental chemical releases involving materials covered under EPS's RMP rule during the past five years:\n\nThere was a release on August 16, 1999.\n\n5.0    EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nWe maintain an integrated contingency plan, which consolidates all of the various federal, state, and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning.  Our program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  Furthermore, we coordinate our plan with the community emergency response plan.\n\n6.0  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe following is a list of improvements that we are planning to implement at the facility to "
