In this way we promote overall plant, worker, and public safety.  These programs enable our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents.  Overall, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses, and avoid physical property damage.\n\nOur safety programs are applied to any activity involving hazardous chemicals including any use, storage, manufacturing, handling, or the on-site movement of such chemicals, or combination of these activities.  Any group of vessels which are interconnected and separate vessels which are located such that a hazardous chemical could be involved in a potential release shall be considered a single process. \n\nOur safety programs prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices that govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment.  These rules are detailed and improved as necessary.  They are also communicated to and accepted by all employees at the facility.\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration process at the facility consists of various pumps, compressors, and condensers that are used to change the state of NH3 from a gas to a liquid and is an open system.  This means that the motor and compressor are separate entities, and can be worked on should repairs be needed.  The total ammonia inventory on site includes 40,000 pounds.  The ammonia is used in freezing of corn, cob corn, peas, and pasta.\n\nWORST-CASE SCENARIO\n\nFail"

      "SummaryText": "ure of the high-pressure receiver containing 40,000 pounds of ammonia would result in a ten-minute release.  Under worst-case weather conditions, ammonia could travel 2.3 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public or the environment.  This scenario is unlikely for the following resons:  worst-case weather conditions are uncommon; the vessel is enclosed in a building that would help to contain such a release; industry standards for the manufacture and quality control of pressure vessles; ammonia is not corrosive in this service; pressure safety valves limit operating pressure in this vessel; the accident prevention program in place at the facility including the mechanical integrity program for regular maintenance; inspection and testing, and replacement of equipment, if necessary; installed ammonia sensors in the system to warn of leaks; alarms and a monitoring board in place to warn operating personnel of process upsets; and the emergency response plan and equipment (including a King valve/main shut-off) in place at the facility.\n\nALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO(S)\n\nFailure of a 1/4 inch diameter pipe would result in the release of approximately 6,000 pounds of ammonia over a time period of 60 minutes.  Under common weather conditions, ammonia could travel 0.1 mile before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public or environment.  The 1/4 inch pipe was chosen because it is used to temporarily bleed off a pump so that maintenance activities can be conducted.  This scenario is unlikely to occur due to the following reasons:  the pump is isolated with valves in the closed position so that only a few pounds of ammonia would be released; the valves in the pump would have to fail completely; the facility has an accident prevention program in place during operational procedures that includes having personnel present at all times during maintenance of the pumps; mechanical integrity program for regular maintenance of the pump at the"

The key prevention steps at the facility consist of the following:\nEmployee Participation\nProcess Safety INformation\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOperating Procedures\nTraining\nContractor Requirements\nPre-startup Safety Review\nMechanical Integrity Audits\nHot Work Permits\nManagement of Change\nIncident Investigation\nEmergency Planning and Response\nCompliance Audits\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no reportable accidents in the last 5 years.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe Waseca facility's emergency response program is based on the OSHA requirements for Emergency Action Palns (29 CFR 1910.38).  We have trained employees for emergency response and maintain a written emergency response plan.  This plan is coordinated with the Waseca Fire Department.  We conduct annual drills for implementation of the emergency response plan at the facility."
