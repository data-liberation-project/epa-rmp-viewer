Compliance is maintained for all applicable Federal and state rules and regulations.  This facility is ISO 9001 certified for the quality of the process and is re-audited every six months.  Employees help incorporate safe work practices through extensive health and safety training.  The facility is also an American Chemistry Council (ACC) Member and is Responsible Care Management System (RCMS) Certified.\n\n\n\nThis facility's emergency response program is compliant with OSHA's HAZWOPER regulation.  This facility communicates regularly and works closely with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC)and the Community Awareness & Emergency Response (CAER) Committee for Iberville Parish, the Iberville Parish Office of Emergency Preparedness (OEP), and other community responders.  Detailed emergency response plans incorporating the OEP, the local police and fire departments, are in place at this facility.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.Hazardous Chemicals Used and Produced in Quantities Greater than the EPA Threshold Limit:\n\n\n\nThe Taminco US LLC St. Gabriel Plant is a highly automated manufacturing facility of alkyl-based amines, located on approximately 160 acres 12 miles south of Baton Rouge, LA.  Anhydrous ammonia, and alcohols are reacted to produce amine products, such as ethylamines and isopropylamines.  These amines are then used by other companies to produce a variety of products, such as pharmaceuticals, detergents, automobile coatings, carpet fiber, particle board, plastics, clothing dyes, latex rubber gloves, herbicides, and pesticides. \n\n\n\nAmmonia, ethylamine,isopropylamine, dimethylamine, ethylene oxide, monomethylamine and acrylonitrile are stored in quantities gr"
