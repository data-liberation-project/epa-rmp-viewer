Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nWe at The Mapleton Metal Organics Plant are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, our highly trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release. We are also completely coordinated with Timber Hollis Fire department  and the Peoria County Emergency  Planning Coordinator, providing additional emergency response expertise. \n\n2.The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nOur facility's primary activities are:.  The manufacture and distribution of aluminum alkyls. We have 2 regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances are ethylene and ethyl chloride.  The regulated substances are used in the manufacture of aluminum alkyls.  The maximum inventory of ethylene  at our facility is  60,000lbs. while ethyl chloride  is  present at our facility in quantities up to 120,000 lbs. \n\n3.The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario have been documented .  In addition, alternate release scenarios listed in 68.28(b)(2)(i) through v have been considered.\n\nTo perform the required off-site consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the look-up tables and equations provided by the EPA in the RMP Off-site Consequence Analysis Guidance.  \n\n4.The General Accidental Release Prevention "

      "SummaryText": "Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with State Building Codes.  A number of processes at our facility are subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.  Our facility is also subject to EPCRA Section 302 notification requirements.    The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe Mapleton Metal Organics Plant maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all covered processes.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is, generally, a modified what if checklist.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of five years or whenever significant process changes occur.  Representative employees from the floor are always included. Any findings related to the hazard analysis are subsequently addressed.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, The Mapleton Metal Organics Plant maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to affected operators.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\nThe Mapleton Metal Organics Plant has a comprehensive training "

Refresher training is provided at least every three years and more frequently as needed. In addition, safety training in all topics relevant to our operation is performed annually.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe Mapleton Metal Organics Plant. carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change\n\nWritten procedures are in place at the Mapleton Metal Organics Plant to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and provided training to deal with the modification.\n\n\n\nPre-startup Reviews\n\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted at The Mapleton Metal Organics Plant.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation. \n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nThe Mapleton Metal Organics Plant conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are completed.\n\n\n\nI"

These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from recurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nThe Mapleton Metal Organics Plant believes process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses in particular. Employees participate in engineering design reviews, Pre Start Up Safety Inspections, PHA's, attend regular meetings where incidents are discussed.\n\n\n\nContractors\n\nOn occasion, our company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, safety performance of the contractor is evaluated.  The Mapleton Metal Organics Plant. has a strict policy of informing contractors of known potential hazards related to the contractor's work and site processes through a comprehensive safety orientation prior to beginning work on site.  Part of the orientation includes familiarizing contractors with emergency response procedures should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\n\n\n\n5.Five-year Accident History\n\nThe Mapleton Metal Organics Plant has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies, the number of accidental releases has been reduced to a minimum.\n\n\n\nThere have  been no  accidental releases  of a regulated substances from our facility within the last "

The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.\n\n\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.\n\n\n\nPeoria  County is the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) with which our emergency plan has been coordinated and verified, primarily through the county Emergency Coordinator.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nFrom time to time, findings result from the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program.  Consequently, The Mapleton Metal Organics Plant continuously improves and updates operating and maintenance procedures, replaces and/or maintains equipment to original - or higher - specifications and/or design codes and develops and implements both capital and expense projects to improve both plant automation and EHS performance. Such improvements are part of our continuous improvement efforts at the site.\n\n"
