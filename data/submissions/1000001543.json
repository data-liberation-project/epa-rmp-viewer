Sara Lee-Zeeland operations include the processing of meat products (hot dogs, lunchmeat, sausage patties) for public consumption packaged under the familiar brand names such as Sara Lee, Jimmy Dean, and Ball Park Franks.  Sara Lee has been in operation at this location since 1936 providing quality meat products and over 850 jobs to the local community.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy\n\nSara Lee is committed to protecting the health of its employees, the surrounding community, and the environment. It is Sara Lee's policy to maintain a safe and healthy workplace, protect the environment, and comply with all applicable regulations, including 40 CFR 68 and, as applicable, Occupational Safety and Health Organization (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations promulgated as Title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 1910, Section 119 (29 CFR 1910.119), and OSHA's Hazardous Operations and Emergency Response regulations (29 CFR 1910.120).\n\nStationary Sources and Regulated Substances\n\nSara Lee is required to maintain low temperatures in the food processing areas of the plant that are within standards required by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) to ensure quality in the final products. Sara Lee also operates freezers and coolers for product storage. The facility uses anhydrous ammonia (the 112(r) regulated substance) as a refrigerant to maintain the 550,000 sq.ft. facility within the required range of operating temperatures and to operate the freezers and coolers. The refrigeration system consists of receivers, compressors, evaporators, condensers, and piping.  Anhydrous ammonia is present in the facility refrigeration system in a quantity gre"

Both a worst case scenario and an alternate case scenario were developed.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nTo prevent and mitigate accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia, Sara Lee has implemented certain precautionary measures, including process / equipment controls, procedures, preventative maintenance programs, employee training and auditing.  In addition, the Sara Lee ammonia refrigeration system is designed and constructed in accordance with accepted industry standards and good engineering practices. \n\nSara Lee has also developed and implemented a PSM program pursuant to OSHA regulations and as such, has evaluated the system for the potential of anhydrous ammonia releases.   Some of the controls installed to prevent catastrophic releases of ammonia are process equipment (vents, pressure relief valves, backup pumps, and manual shutoffs) and automated controls (automatic shut-offs, ammonia leak detection system, and electrical distribution system grounding).  \n\nSara Lee has developed standard operating procedures for all employees and contractors that have contact with the ammonia refrigeration system that incorporate safety measures into the procedures.  These safety procedures were developed by refrigeration system operators and are reviewed periodically by the operators during regularly scheduled PSM training sessions.  Process safety information for the refrigeration system is reviewed during these meetings as well.  Sara Lee encourages employee participation in development of the control measures used at the plant by means of meetings and training sessions.  Pursuant to written management of change procedures established by Sara Lee, any changes to the operating procedures are to be communicated to affected employees.\n\nSara Lee understan"

The preventative maintenance program is scheduled, documented and managed using a computer maintenance management software system to ensure that regular maintenance occurs on the system.  Also, to ensure the mechanical integrity of critical refrigeration system components, regular inspections and testing is conducted.\n\nTo ensure that Sara Lee's control measures are effective in maintaining the safe operation of the plant, regularly scheduled audits are performed on the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\nIn accordance with the PSM program, Sara Lee conducts detailed PSM compliance audits at least every three years that incorporate review of process safety information, process hazard analysis, operating procedures, training programs, system mechanical integrity, management of change, pre-start up review procedures, compliance audit procedures, incident investigation procedures, employee participation programs, hot work permit procedures, and contractor safety procedures.\n\nSara Lee's insurance carrier also conducts independent audits on a regular basis.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nOver the last five years, Sara Lee has not experienced an accidental off-site release of anhydrous ammonia from the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nSara Lee has documented emergency response procedures in a document entitled Offsite Response Plan for Sara Lee Corporation - Zeeland, MI Facility (Plan)in order to facilitate response efforts in the event of an off-site anhydrous ammonia release.  Included in the Plan are measures to be taken internally by Sara Lee as well as measures to be taken by off-site response agencies.\n\nSara Lee has trained approximately 45 on-site personnel to respond to accidental ammonia releases.  These personnel are trained in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.120, "

As an additional training exercise, a simulation of an emergency release with off-site effects was conducted with the entire emergency response system.  This involved coordination between Sara Lee's Hazmat team and the Olive Township fire department.  The simulation was critiqued and changes made to the Plan as appropriate.   \n\nTo assure that the local governmental response agencies are familiar with Sara Lee's emergency response procedures, Sara Lee has submitted copies of the Plan for review and approval by the local agencies.  The following local agencies have reviewed and approved Sara Lee's Plan:\n\nOlive Township Supervisor,\nOlive Fire Department,\nOttawa County LEPC\nState Emergency Planning Commission (SERC) \n\nTo plan for an ammonia release with off-site effects, Sara Lee's Plan includes procedures/equipment to mitigate the release, procedures to inform local response agencies, transportation maps for response agencies, evacuation route maps, and procedures for public communication.\n\nIn the event of an anhydrous ammonia release with off-site effects, the general public will be warned using the following methods:\n\nGRAIL (Grand Rapids Area Information Link) System\n\nBroadcast message via the Ottawa County Central Dispatch\n\nPolice and fire vehicles equipped with public address systems, and\n\nDoor-to-door notification of residents by emergency response agencies (if deemed necessary).\n\nAs backup measures, Sara Lee has arranged emergency response assistance with a local clean-up contractor.
