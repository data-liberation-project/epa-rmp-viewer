As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible and updated as necessary. To accomplish this, Valley Ag has elected to use PSMWriter, software developed and distributed by Resource Compliance, Inc. This software will assist us with updating, maintaining, scheduling, and tracking RMP related activities. \n1.1 Valley Ag, Risk Management Program\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that Valley Ag has developed their unified RMP Program. This program has been prepared to address the risks involved in operating and maintaining the following process which have the presence of hazardous chemicals above threshold quantities:\nAmmonia Storage - Anhydrous Ammonia - 130,000 lbs.\nOur RMP Program promotes overall plant, worker, public, and environmental safety. The program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of hazardous chemicals. Overall, the program is designed to prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, illnesses, and physical property damage.\nOur company has many policies and procedures in place to promote overall plant, worker and public safety. We have: \nPrepared a unified program based on the RMP obligations as well\nOrganized the program so that it meshes closely with general business practices\nUtilized PSMWriter software to ensure that all necessary employees have access to relevant information (SOPs, PHAs, audits, etc.)\nThe RMP Program sets forth rules, procedures, and practices that will help our employees and neighbors protect themselves.\n1.2 Process Description\nFacility Overview\nValley Agronomics operates an ammonia fertilizer storage and retail l"

From there it is stored until a sale is made, at which time a Valley Agronomics employee transfers ammonia from the storage tank into a smaller trailer-mounted nurse tank. The nurse tanks are towed by trucks off-site for the fertilizer application.\nFacility Location\nValley Agronomics is located at Road F NW and 1st Road NW, Waterville, WA 98858. The latitude and longitude of the ammonia storage tank is 47.623166, -119.878247. The facility is located approximately 0.7 miles north of U.S. Route 2 in a rural area.\nA review of United States Geological Survey (USGS) fault maps revealed that there are no faults in close proximity to the site. The USGS 2018 One-Year Model revealed that Valley Agronomics had a 1-2% chance of experiencing \u0093potentially minor-damage\u0094 due to ground shaking in 2018.\nThe USGS 2023 50-State Long-term National Seismic Hazard Model revealed that Valley Agronomics has a 75-95% \u0093chance of slight (or greater) damaging earthquake shaking in 100 years\u0094.\nSafety Systems\nPressure Relief Valves\nPressure relief valves are installed on the ammonia storage vessel and the ammonia pump is configured with a bypass valve. The relief valves have a set pressure of  250 psig and discharge to the atmosphere. Refer to the Relief System Design and Design Basis documentation for more information.\nAnalog Gauges\nVarious analog gauges are installed on the ammonia storage. The gauges provide the ability for operators to monitor vessel pressure and fill percentage.\nExcess Flow / Emergency Shutoff Valves\nThe ammonia storage tank is configured with three (3) internal \u0093jet bleed\u0094 valves which serve as emergency shutoff valves and excess flow valves. Ball valves are installed downstream of each internal jet bleed valve and are used for normal shutoff. The cables are connected to each jet bleed valve handle so that the valves can be closed remot"

As such, the ammonia process at Valley Agronomics is treated as a single process.\n1.3 General Accident Release & Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n1.3.1 General \nWe inform our employees engaged in process operations of the dangers of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia in annual safety meetings. During these meetings we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\nValley Ag has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the ammonia fertilizer process. These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release. The results of the analyses are reported in PSMWriter and hard copy binders. \n1.3.2 Anhydrous Ammonia\nThe ammonia fertilizer process at the Valley Ag facility is an integral part of the overall business and operates most of the year. It is extremely important that this process is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner. Management is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.\nOur field personnel monitor the ammonia fertilizer process and keep active records of all procedures and transactions that pertain to ammonia.\n1.4 Five Year Accident History\nValley Ag has had no accidental release within the last five (5) years.\n1.5 Emergency Action and Response Plan\nValley Ag\u0092s emergency action and response program has been developed to"
