Among the products handled, is one Extremely Hazardous Substance (EHS) \u00c2\u00bf anhydrous ammonia.  Anhydrous ammonia is the most economical source of nitrogen fertilizer available.  In order to serve the customer\u00c2\u00bfs need for this product, Arcadia Agronomy has storage vessels capable of holding more than 90,000 gallons of product.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\tThe anhydrous ammonia system is designed, installed and maintained in accordance with ASME codes.  Arcadia Agronomy complies with the ANSI K 61.1 standards (1989), OSHA (29 CFR 1910.111), EPA\u00c2\u00bfs Accidental Release Prevention Rule, and all applicable federal, state and local codes and regulations.\n\tThe system is protected from major releases by internal excess flow valves, check valves, relief valves, manual shutoffs, and emergency shutoff valves.  The load out riser used for the purpose of filling the nurse tanks is protected by excess flow valves and fill line breakaways to immediately stop the flow of ammonia if a line or a hose fails.  All main storage tank valves and riser valves are locked when not in use.\n\tOur ammonia system is inspected on a regular basis with maintenance and preventive maintenance scheduled and documented.  Liquid and vapor valves, hoses, excess flow valves, gauges and pressure relief valves are replaced when necessary and according to the guidelines in the ANSI standards and enforced by the Ohio Department of Agriculture.\n\tTraining is provided to all employees at least annually, whenever there is a change in the process, or whenever competency with the regula"

Special attention is made with the employees of Arcadia Agronomy in understanding the peculiarities of unloading rail shipments of anhydrous ammonia.\n\tThe branch manager of Arcadia Agronomy is held accountable for implementing proper procedures for handling hazardous materials.  He insures that employees are provided with personal protective equipment and training for handling these materials.  He also makes an effort to have the local fire department, along with the county Emergency Management Agency director, conduct a walk-through of the facility every year.  This is a means of gaining familiarity with our facility by our emergency responders.  Recommendations from the fire chief and the director are acted on in a timely manner.\n\tThe General Manager has assigned \u00c2\u00bfSafety\u00c2\u00bf as a portion of his annual evaluation of branch managers.  Regulatory compliance is a large part of that safety evaluation and has an impact on salary and advancement.\n\tThe Board of Directors has established a portion of their annual planning meeting to safety and invites the Risk Coordinator to update them on the various issues related to safety.

The training consists of classroom lecture, current videos, Powerpoint presentations, testing (oral and written), certification of completion and on-the-job training.  Supervisors are instructed to verify competency through observation of employees handling of the product. \n\nFive-year Accident History\nThere have been no accidents involving anhydrous ammonia that caused death, injuries, property or environmental damage, including evacuations on or off-site.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\tIn the event of an emergency involving our ammonia system, it is our policy to notify the local fire department and request that they respond to the emergency.  In preparation for this, we have coordinated with all of the local response agencies by providing information and facility tours to ensure that they are familiar with and properly prepared for an incident at our facility.  This will help to make certain that our community has the strategy for responding to and mitigating the threat posed by an ammonia release.  This complies with the requirement for our facility to be included in the community emergency response plan prepared under EPCRA and coordinated with the Hancock County Local Emergency Planning Committee.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nThere are no plans to make any changes to the physical site.  Arcadia Agronomy will continue to provide our employees with ongoing annual training, to make sure that they are current with safe ammonia transfer and handling procedures.  We will also provide regular inspection and maintenance on all of the ammonia equipment."
