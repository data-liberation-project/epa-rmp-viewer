This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the Ammonia Injection System.  Cogeneration Facility 42's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. \n\n\n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance \n\n\n\nThe Cogeneration Facility 42 is located at 25121 North Sierra Highway, Newhall, California 91321.  The regulated substance at the Facility is anhydrous ammonia\n\nThe maximum intended inventory of anhydrous ammonia is 9750 gallons (55,575 pounds [lbs]) and it is stored in a pressurized horizontal storage vessel (V-511) at ambient temperature in liquid form.  When ambient conditions do not significantly promote the vaporization of liquid ammonia, a vaporizer is utilized to heat the liquid to its boiling point to produce vapor.  The vapor ammonia is sent to a mixing chamber where it is mixed with air.  The resulting vapor ammonia / air stream is then injected into the Heat Recovery Steam Generator (HRSG).  This, in conjunction with the catalyst within the HRSG, allow for the reduction of NOx and other unwanted materials being sent to the environment.  The exhaust gas containing a lower concentration of NOx is then sent from the HRSG to an exhaust stack. \n\n\n\n\n\nHazard Assessment Summary/Offsite Consequence Analysis \n\n\n\n?    Worst-Case Release Scenario Results Summary:\n\nPer CalARP Regulations and US EPA RMP Regulations, one worst-case analysis has been defined and modeled for the Ammonia Injection System.

Alternative Release Scenario Results Summary:\n\nAn alternative release scenario was modeled.  The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment documentation located behind the Hazard Assessment tab of the 2014  CalARP/RMP/PSM Program 3 Five Year Update Binder.\n\n\n\n\n\nRisk Considerations\n\n\n\nAlthough the storage and use of anhydrous ammonia has inherent potential risks, and worst-case release scenarios can potentially reach the community; Cogeneration Facility 42 has recognized these potential risks and structured its safety programs to make the worst-case type of event non-credible.  In addition to the safety practices of the company and plant personnel to make this worst-case event non-credible, it should also be recognized that there are inherent analysis assumptions that make the results of the atmospheric dispersion analysis appear worse than what would actually be expected during such an event (e.g., In the event of a release, sudden rupture and flashing of ammonia would be highly turbulent.  Turbulence causes entrainment of air and the released vapor dilutes much more quickly than is shown in the model).\n\nIn addition to the use of conservative analysis assumptions that over-predict the effects of a potential release, other characteristics of the facility and site serve to minimize the potential risks associated with an ammonia release, including the following:\n\n\n\n?    Automatic / Manual Shutdown\n\n?    Ammonia sensors in the process area\n\n?    Automatic Deluge System\n\n?    Well Designed Relief System\n\n?    Safety showers/eye wash stations are available for Operators, if exposed to ammonia and at the ammonia fill station and barrel dock.\n\n?    Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) is used by plant personnel, as necessary.\n\n?    The system undergoes periodic maintenance to reduce the likelihood of catastrophic failures.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program \n\n\n\nAs part of the implementation of this CalAR"

The amount of anhydrous ammonia corresponds to the 65% capacity of V-511, as the facility implements administrative controls that limit the maximum filling of the tanks to 65% of the capacity. \n\nTherefore, the covered process has over the 10,000-lb threshold quantity for US EPA RMP and Cal/OSHA PSM threshold quantities, and over the 500-lb state threshold for CalARP Program.
