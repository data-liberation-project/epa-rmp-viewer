This submission is a 5 year update. There have been only minor changes at HMC Cold Storage since the last update. One additional cold storage room and associated evaporator was added in 2006 to the South Cold Storage. No refrigeration system expansion was needed. Both of these facilities do post harvest processing of fruits and vegetables seasonally in a rural industrial area of Central California.\n\nThere are 2 separate cold storages and independent Ammonia refrigeration processes at this site. The larger and oldest Facility #1 was completed in 1988 and expanded in 2003. A new storage facility and independent NH3 refrigeration system was completed in June 2000 located 500\u00c2\u00bf south of the existing cold storage. Since they are totally separate facilities with no interconnection of refrigeration systems they are treated as separate processes. Facility #1 is a larger system with NH3 operating capacity of 25,287 lbs.. Facility #2 has an NH3 operating capacity of 12,900 lbs.. Facility #1 is used for the Worst Case scenario and the Alternate release scenario of a compressor shaft seal failure would apply to either system.\n\nExternal Events analysis was part of the 2008 PHA revalidation. The rural location does not present any unusual external events. All of the NH3 charge is stored in the High Pressure Receivers in locked mechanical rooms during the seasonal shut-down. The facility is staffed year round, has security and is fenced. Remote monitoring, operation and call-out alarms operate continuously. All facility storm drains collect in a ponding basin on-site. Pressure Relief valves discharge to diffusion tanks for neutralization and emergency ventilation fans provide non-hazardous classification for the mechanical rooms.

This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Packing and storage of fresh produce.  We have 1 regulated substance present at our facility above threshold minimums.  This substance is Ammonia (anhydrous) used as a refrigerant in a closed loop refrigeration system.\n\n\n3.\tThe Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s) details have been eliminated from this Executive summary as directed in RMP April 2004 changes. The Worst case scenario is not considered feasible and has minimal impacts due to the rural location. The alternate case selected reaches the property line and surrounding orchards as required.\n\n4.\tThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  Both facilities meet or exceed 1997 building, mechanical and fire codes including applicable seismic. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nHMC Cold Storage maintains a detailed re"

The methodology used to carry out these analyses is What If/Checklist (combined).  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of 5 years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  The most recent PHA revalidation was performed in 2008. All possible conditions that could upset the system and natural disasters like fire and earthquake were considered.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, HMC Cold Storage maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nHMC Cold Storage has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every 3 years and more frequently as needed. Tests or demonstrations are provided to insure understanding and competence.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nHMC Cold Storage carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, ammonia detection system, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.
