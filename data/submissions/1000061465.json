Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nEquistar is committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at Equistar.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, our trained emergency response personnel are stationed at the plant at all times to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  \n\n\n\n2.  The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nEquistar's primary activity at the Matagorda site is the production of high density polyethylene.  High density polyethylene is utilized in making a variety of plastic products such as grocery bags, plastic cups and plastic containers.  We utilize four (4) regulated substances at Equistar; ethylene, butene, hydrogen, and titanium tetrachloride.  \n\n\n\n3.  This section has been left blank intentionally. Please contact site for details on worst case and alternative release analysis.  \n\n\n\n4.  The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nEquistar has taken the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with strict engineering standards and the facility is subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.\n\n\n\nThe following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program in place at Equistar.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nEquistar maintains a record of written safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment de"

The methodology used to carry out these analyses is referred to as a unit Process Hazard Analysis (PHA).  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated on an as needed basis, but at a minimum every five years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting operations activities, Equistar maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved with the processes.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\nEquistar has a training program in place to ensure that employees that are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  New employees receive basic training in process operations followed by on-the-job supervision until they are deemed competent to work independently.  Refresher training is provided at least every three years and more frequently as needed.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nEquistar carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper functions.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance is carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in"

Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and are trained to deal with the modification.\n\n\n\nPre-startup Reviews\n\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at Equistar.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nEquistar conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nEquistar investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in, an employee injury or a catastrophic release of a hazardous material.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  Investigation reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nEquistar believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation to the RMP rule, particularly information resulting from process hazard analyses.\n\n\n\nEquistar is a member of the OSHA Voluntary Protection Program.

Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out.  Equistar has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related the contractor's work and the processes.  Contractors are also informed of the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.  The date of the last program review was June 14, 2012 and the date of the last field audit was May 3, 2014.\n\n\n\n5.  Five-year Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of substances regulated by the RMP rule during the last five years.\n\n\n\n6.  Emergency Response Plan\n\nEquistar carries a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes many aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.  The facility's emergency response plan has been coordinated with the Matagorda County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).\n\n \n\nTo ensure proper functioning, emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  In addition, the plan is updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our process that would require a modified emergency response.\n\n\n\n7.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nA capital project is planned for 2017 to improve the hydrocarbon detection system. The system will have additional detectors placed throughout the plant.\n\n\n\n"
