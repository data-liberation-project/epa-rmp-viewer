The Emergency Action Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the PSM/RMP document, which is maintained at the facility and updated as necessary.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n  1.)  To save lives.\n  2.)  To minimize and avoid injuries.\n  3.)  To protect the environment.\n  4.)  To minimize property damage.\n\nBashas' Distribution Center maintains a safety committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated as needed.\n\nBashas' Distribution Center has coordinated emergency response efforts with the local fire department and with the contracted refrigeration operation and maintenance firm.  In the case of an ammonia-related emergency, it is the policy of Bashas' Distribution Center to evacuate and to allow the fire department to respond to the emergency.  The refrigeration contractor will be available for guidance and assistance.\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe facility including the ammonia refrigeration system at Bashas' Distribution Center was constructed in 1991.  Expansions of the facility have occurred in 1998 and 2003, with the most recent expansion incorporating a second ammonia refrigeration system at the facility.  The Bashas' Distribution Center is located at 200 South 56th Street in Chandler, Arizona 85226.  The system was constructed in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations including the Uniform Fire and Mechanical Codes.\n\nThe Bashas' Distribution Center facility receives and distributes food and fo"

The initial system maintains an inventory of approximately 12,800 pounds of ammonia, and the second refrigeration system (scheduled to startup in January 2003) is designed for an inventory of 19,900 pounds of ammonia.\n\nEach refrigeration system utilizes a separate engine room in which most of the refrigeration equipment, including vessels, pumps, and compressors are housed.  Condensers are mounted on the roof of each engine room and the evaporators are located in their respective cold storage rooms/areas.\n\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY\n\nThe Hazard Assessment was updated based on the installation of the new refrigeration system scheduled to startup in January 2003.  Since the ammonia inventory in the new system is designed to be 19,900 pounds, the Worst Case Scenario was updated to account for the potentially greater risk versus the first refrigeration system.  The potentially-impacted population for each scenario was re-estimated using the most recent data from the 2000 census.  The population and environmental receptors were also investigated and documented based on current information.\n\n*  Worst Case Release Result Summary\n\n      Scenario Description:  Release of the maximum quantity of ammonia that can be stored in a vessel (Low Stage Suction Accumulator) - 19,900 pounds in 10 minutes.  The enclosure of the ammonia engine room provides a passive mitigation that limits the release rate to the atmosphere.  The most pessimistic meteorological conditions were used: 1.5 meters per second wind speed, and F stability.  The Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration reference tables were used to determine the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 200 ppm in urban conditions.

Further details regarding the Worst Case Scenario can be found in the Hazard Assessment report maintained in Volume IV of the PSM/RMP at the facility.\n\n\n*  Alternative Release Result Summary\n\nTo ensure conservative results, the reported Alternative Release Scenario was not changed from the initial RMP submittal in 1999, as the impacts were from the previous scenario were potentially greater.\n\n     Scenario Description: A release of ammonia from resulting from a 1/4 inch diameter hole in a pipe.  The release rate of ammonia due to the pressure of the tank is 134 pounds per minute.  The meteorological conditions used were 3 meters per second wind speed, and D stability.  The Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration reference tables were used to determine the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 200 ppm in rural conditions.  This release reaches off site and may impact population receptors.  No environmental receptors were affected by this potential release.\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe Bashas' Distribution Center ammonia refrigeration systems have many safety features.  Much of the safety of the systems is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of each system.  For example, the Bashas' Distribution Center facility operates in accordance with OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation.\n\nBashas' maintains an on-going contract with a professional refrigeration service firm.  The refrigeration contractors make regular preventive maintenance visits to the facility, ensuring the refrigeration equipment is maintained in a good state of repair.  Major repairs are completed on a priority basis, ensuring safety is a top priority.\n\nThe Bashas' Distribution Center facility including the ammonia refrigeration systems were designed and constructed in accordance with the Uniform Mechanical Code which speci"

These safety features in each system include a water diffusion tank, ammonia sensors in the machine room as well as sensors in selected cold storage areas, and automatic shut down systems.  In addition, the majority of the ammonia is maintained inside the engine room and just outside of the machine room (condensers).  All pressure vessels are equipped with pressure relief valves to protect the vessel's integrity during extreme pressure conditions.\n\nIn addition to the Uniform Mechanical Code, the facility operates in accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines.  In particular, the IIAR Bulletin 110, \"Startup, Inspection, and Maintenance of Ammonia Refrigeration Systems\" is used as basis for the facility's maintenance program.\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no ammonia accidents at the facility, including any reportable releases during the previous 5 year period (since 1998).\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe Bashas' Distribution Center has an emergency action plan in effect at the facility.

The refrigeration contractor will be available for guidance and assistance.\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nA three year compliance audit was completed in April 2002 resulting in multiple recommendations to improve safety and the implementation of the Risk Management Programs.  A Process Hazard Analysis study was also completed to evaluate the design and safety procedures associated with the new ammonia refrigeration system to be started up in January 2003.  This study also provided recommended actions to improve safety.  All of the mitigation measures listed below are scheduled to be complete no later than January 2004.\n\nThe recommendations from the audit included updating the written safety information, implementing the annual SOP review, modifying the ammonia awareness training materials, revising the written maintenance schedules to match the maintenance contract, ensuring that emergency evacuations are completed, in addition to others.\n\nThe recommendations from the PHA study include managing the refrigeration contractor records,  updating the written PSM/RMP programs to include the new refrigeration system, completing a daily log to record system parameters, creating maintenance procedures, labeling refrigeration piping and valves, among others."
