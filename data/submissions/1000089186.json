As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible and updated as necessary. To accomplish this, Sun Pacific Ducor has elected to use PSMWriter, software developed and distributed by Resource Compliance, Inc. This software will assist us with updating, maintaining, scheduling, and tracking RMP-PSM related activities. \n\n\n\n1.1 Sun Pacific Ducor, Risk and Process Safety Management Program\n\n\n\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that Sun Pacific Ducor has updated/developed their unified RMP-PSM Program. This program has been prepared to address the risks involved in operating and maintaining the following process which have the presence of hazardous chemicals above threshold quantities: \n\n\n\nProcess Name           | Process Chemical           | Process Quantity(lbs.)\n\nAmmonia Refrigeration    Anhydrous Ammonia            30,000\n\n\n\nOur RMP-PSM program promotes overall plant, worker, and public safety. The program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of hazardous chemicals. Overall, the program is designed to prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, illnesses, and physical property damage.\n\n\n\nOur company has many policies and procedures in place to promote overall plant, worker and public safety. We have: \n\n1. Prepared a unified program based on the PSM regulation to meet CalARP and RMP obligations as well\n\n2. "

During these meeting we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\n\n\n\nSun Pacific Ducor has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the ammonia refrigeration process. These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release. The results of the analyses are reported in PSMWriter and hard copy binders. \n\n\n\n1.3.2 Anhydrous Ammonia\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration process at the Sun Pacific Ducor facility is an integral part of the overall business and operates most of the year.It is extremely important that this process is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner.

When a RMP-PSM program requirement is completed (i.e. mechanical integrity inspection, process hazard analysis, compliance audit, etc.) any specific action items related to that event are entered into PSMWriter, assigned a responsible person, and given a due date. Once the action item has been completed, the resolution can be documented using PSMWriter as well. A list of current or past due action items can be accessed at any time by those with access to PSMWriter.\n\n\n\nIn addition to utilizing PSMWriter to create, schedule, track, and document events, Sun Pacific Ducor has also entered into a contract with Resource Compliance to obtain help with RMP-PSM program implementation.\n\n\n\nFor the future, Sun Pacific Ducor now thinks of the RMP-PSM program as a \"living document\".
