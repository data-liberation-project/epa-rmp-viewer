Executive Summary\n\n\n\nThis program is intended to meet the spirit and intent of the following regulations:\n\n- California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program - Title 19 CCR, Chapter 4.5\n\n- Federal EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) - Title 40 CFR ?68\n\n- California Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 8 CCR ?5189\n\n- Federal Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 29 CFR ?1910.119\n\n\n\nHereafter this program will be referred to as the RMP-PSM program.\n\n\n\nThis program is intended to be a \"living document\". As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible and updated as necessary. To accomplish this, Milk Specialties Global has elected to use PSMWriter, software developed and distributed by Resource Compliance, Inc. This software will assist us with updating, maintaining, scheduling, and tracking RMP-PSM \n\nrelated activities. \n\n\n\n1.1 Milk Specialties Global, Risk and Process Safety Management Program\n\n\n\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that Milk Specialties Global has updated their unified RMP-PSM Program. This program has been prepared to address the risks involved in operating and maintaining the following processes which have the presence of hazardous chemicals above threshold quantities: \n\n\n\nProcess Name                     | Process Chemical                    | Process Quantity(lbs.)\n\nAmmonia Refrigeration Process      Anhydrous Ammonia                     11,000\n\n\n\nOur RMP-PSM program promotes overall plant, worker, and public safety. The program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of hazardous chemicals. Overall, the program is designed to prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, illnesses, and physical property damage.\n\nOur company has many policies and procedures in place to promote overall plant, worker and public safety.

      "SummaryText": "ws: high pressure liquid from the high pressure receiver is piped to each heat exchanger, where it passes through an expansion valve into low temperature and pressure surge drum mounted above the heat exchanger. From the surge drum, low pressure liquid is circulated through the heat exchanger. As heat is absorbed, the liquid ammonia vaporizes to form low temperature and pressure gas which is returned to the surge drum. The suction gas is returned from the surge drums through a suction return line to the main suction accumulators.  From the main suction accumulators, ammonia is piped to the suction inlet on the compressors. The high pressure discharge from the compressors is sent to water-cooled evaporative condenser where the high pressure gas ammonia is cooled, liquefied and returned to the high pressure receiver.\n\n\n\nThe system contains numerous safety devices including sensors which stop the compressors if temperatures or pressures exceed or drop below established limits, and pressure relief valves which vent to the atmosphere if the pressure in the system exceeds their set point. \n\n\n\nThere are two ammonia detectors installed inside the refrigeration machinery room. One sensor is set at the California OSHA permissible exposure limit of 25 ppm, which will activate the mechanical ventilation system and activate an audible alarm and strobe. The second sensor is set at 200 ppm, which will shut down all refrigeration machinery inside the refrigeration machinery room and activate an audible alarm and strobe.\n\n\n\nAn emergency control box is installed on the north exterior wall of the refrigeration machinery room, which contains four valves. The high and both low sides of the system each have a valve that would discharge to atmosphere. The connecting pipe between the high and low sides have one equalizer valve that would equalize the system.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system at Milk Specialties consists of vessels, equipment, and valves which are interconnected by piping.

It is unclear which \n\ncodes and standards were followed in the original design and construction of the refrigeration system. The pressure vessels are equipped with nameplates which span the years 1994-2002. Due to the fact that the system is not equipped with an ammonia diffusion tank, it is the judgment of the PHA team that the system most closely aligns with the 1991 Uniform Mechanical/Fire Codes.\n\n\n\n1.3 General Accident Release & Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\n1.3.1 General \n\n\n\nWe inform our employees engaged in process operations of the dangers of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia in annual safety meetings. During these meeting we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\n\n\n\nMilk Specialties Global has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the ammonia refrigeration process. These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release. The results of the analyses are reported in PSMWriter and hard copy binders. \n\n\n\n1.3.2 Anhydrous Ammonia\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration process at the Milk Specialties Global facility is an integral part of the overall business and operates year-round. The ammonia process contains a total charge of approximately 11,000 lbs. It is extremely important that this process is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner.

When a RMP-PSM program requirement is completed (i.e. mechanical integrity inspection, process hazard analysis, compliance audit, etc.) any specific action items related to that event are entered into PSMWriter, assigned a responsible person, and given a due date. Once the action item has been completed, the resolution can be documented using PSMWriter as well. A list of current or past due action items can be accessed at any time by those with access to PSMWriter.\n\n\n\nIn addition to utilizing PSMWriter to create, schedule, track, and document events, Milk Specialties Global has also entered into a contract with Resource Compliance to obtain help with RMP-PSM program implementation.\n\n\n\nFor the future, Milk Specialties Global now thinks of the RMP-PSM program as a \"living document\". It is an interactive framework that guides safe action for Milk Specialties Global employees, but allows for feedback and continual improvement. Through the RMP-PSM program Milk Specialties Global will continue to maintain overall plant worker and public safety.\n\n"
