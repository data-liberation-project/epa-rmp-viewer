Given the quantity handled, anhydrous ammonia is considered a hazardous substance by the EPA.  Many of the properties that make ammonia valuable as a refrigerant also requires that precautions and procedures be in place to protect employee and public health and safety during a chemical emergency.  It is the policy of Vaughan Foods to be in compliance with all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.  \n\n\n\nSafety at our facility is inherent on the manner in which anhydrous ammonia is handled.  While the design of the facility incorporates a multitude of safety devices, safe handling procedures combined with appropriate training of our personnel are key aspects to maintaining safety at our facility.  \n\n\n\n1.11 Process Safety Management Program\n\n\n\nWe have a written Process Safety Management (PSM) plan that complies with state and federal regulations.  A crucial component of this plan is the Emergency Response Plan, developed in compliance with the Emergency Response provisions.  The Emergency Response Plan includes pre-emergency planning and coordinating with outside agencies.  This enables those who deal with emergencies to have a course of action to effectively deal with unplanned events.\n\n\n\n1.20 Facility Description and Substances Handled\n\n\n\nThe Reser's Fine Foods-owned, Vaughan Foods (Moore, OK location) is a cold food storage facility that stores and distributes refrigerated foods.  Distributions of safe refrigerated foods require the use of a refrigeration system to preserve the integrity of processed foods.  This refrigeration process uses ammonia as a refrigerant.  Access to the facility is restricted to authorized employees and visitors, management personnel and contractors.\n\n\n\nThe regulated substance handled is anhydrous a"
