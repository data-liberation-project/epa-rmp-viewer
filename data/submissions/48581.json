Given the quantity handled, anhydrous ammonia is considered a\nhazardous substance by EPA. Many of the properties that make ammonia valuable as a refrigerant also requires\nthat precautions and procedures be in place to protect employee and public health and safety during a chemical\nemergency. It is the policy of Kenyon Zero Storage to be in compliance with all applicable federal and state rules\nand regulations.\n\nSafety at our facility is inherent on the manner in which anhydrous ammonia is handled. While the design of the\nfacility incorporates a multitude of safety devices, safe handling procedures combined with appropriate training of\nour personnel are key aspects to maintaining safety at our facility.\n\nWe have a written Process Safety Management (PSM) plan that complies with the regulations stipulated by WAC\n296-67-017. A crucial component of this plan is the Emergency Response Plan, developed in compliance with\nthe Emergency Response provisions of WAC 296-62-3112. The Emergency Response Plan includes pre-\nemergency planning and coordinating with outside parties. This enables those who deal with emergencies to\nhave a course of action to effectively deal with unplanned events.\n\n1.20 Facility Description And Substances Handled\n\n- Kenyon Zero Storage is a facility that stores refrigerated and frozen foods. Production requires the use of a\nrefrigeration system to preserve the integrity of processed foods. This refrigeration process uses ammonia as a\nrefrigerant. Access to the facility is restricted to authorized employees, management personnel, and contractors.\n- The regulated substance handled at this facility is anhydrous ammonia.\n- The ammonia refrigeration system maximum inventory is 12,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.

Offsite receptors were defined using the\nLandView lll (Version 1.0) system. This system estimates residential population within the circle defined by the\nendpoint of the worst-case and alternative release scenarios. In addition, it lists whether certain types of public\nreceptors and environmental receptors are within the circles.\n\n-Worst-Case Scenario. Catastrophic failure of the High Pressure Receiver, located in the engine room, when\nfilled to the greatest amount would release 12,000 pounds of liquid ammonia. This scenario presumes that the \nentire contents are released.\n\nThe distance to the toxic endpoint for the worst-case scenario is 1.5 miles from the point of release. This\ndistance extends beyond the facility fence line, and would encompass a population of 1,190 with the closest\nresidence approximately 1,000 feet from the site. A school is 1 1/4 miles away and a hospital is about one mile\naway, inside of this release zone. A freeway is about 1,000 feet to the west, south and east; the Yakima River\nand industrial facilities are within close proximity. No other public or environmental receptors are located within\nthis zone.\n\nThis worst-case scenario would not likely occur unless an act of nature(e.g., earthquake) physically\ncompromised the tank. The structural integrity of the tank is safeguarded by periodic inspection  for mechanical\nintegrity to prevent a rupture due to tank degradation. The tank is also safeguarded from rupture from over-\npressurization. It is a rated pressure vessel hydro-tested to 375 psi and equipped with 250 psi pressure relief\nvalves. The design spec"

During high demand, the High Pressure Receiver may only be filled to a \nfraction (-30%) of capacity.\n\n-Alternative Scenario. Several alternative scenarios can generate the equivalent of a 1 opening in a high\npressure liquid line. Alternative scenarios could include an opening created  by a valve sheared off, a large\ngasket leak, or a pressure relief valve release. These scenarios presumes a release duration of 10 minutes\nresulting in a loss of 12,000 pounds of liquid ammonia. This scenario was selected because a release of this \ntype would occur outdoors resulting in the highest potential exposure to offsite receptors.\n\nThe distance to the toxic endpoint for the alternative scenario is 0.6 miles from the point of release. This\ndistance extends beyond the facility fence line, and would encompass a population of 240 with the closest\nresidence approximately 1,000 feet from the site, inside of this release zone. A school is 1 1/4 miles away and a\nhospital is about one mile away, outside of this release zone. A freeway is about 1,000 feet to the west,south,\nand east; the Yakima River and industrial facilities are within close proximity. No other public or environmental\nreceptors are located within this zone.\n\nThe severity of release from this scenario would likely be less since safety system provisions are in place to limit\nthe release duration to less than ten minutes through the use of appropriately placed isolation valves.\n\n1.40 General Accidental Release Prevention Program And Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nKenyon Zero Storage complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state\ncodes and regulations.
