The facility is owned and operated by the Genesee County Drain Commissioner's Division of Water and Waste Services (GCDCDWWS).  The Drain Commissioner and GCDCWWS management and employees are committed to safety and ensuring safe operating procedures for these processes.  GCDCWWS also operates similar disinfection processes at its wastewater treatment facility which has operated safely for over 25 years with no significant releases of disinfection process chemicals. The new Water Treatment Plant's disinfection process was constructed to incorporate the latest technology in safe handling of chlorine.  Important features incorporated to increase safety in handling of chlorine include:\n\n1)    Fully enclosed and isolated chlorine container storage/handling and chlorinator rooms.\n\n2)    Chlorine scrubber, capacity 2600lbs.\n\n3)    The storage and handling room is equipped with independent monitoring, alarms, automated or manual operation scrubber evacuation systems.\n\n4)    All cylinders are equipped with automatic shut off valve systems activated by chlorine gas detectors with battery back-up in case of power failure.\n\n5)    All safety systems read at the DCU in the plant control room.\n\n6)    The system operates by utilizing chlorine vapor drawn under vacuum which minimizes the potential and severity of leaks as compared to systems drawing liquid under pressure.\n\n7)    The process building is secured with keyed access only and has 24/7 surveillance operations for security purposes.\n\nThe general program incorporates these safety features and is subject MIOSHA's Process Safety Management standard to provide effective process management and prevent the incidents of accidental release. The Emergency Response Plan required under this standard was developed with the inclusion of and incorporated resources from the"
