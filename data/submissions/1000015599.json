              "Description": "Risk Management Plan\nPrevention Program\nAbbott Nutrition\nColumbus Plant\n\nProcess Description\n\nThe facility has a single, closed-loop ammonia system used to cool water to 33 to 40 A?F.  The frigid water is circulated throughout the plant to cool various processes and storage tanks.  The ammonia does not come into contact with the water.  All of the ammonia handling equipment is located within the siteA?s Energy Center areas.\n\nThe ammonia system is comprised of 37000 pounds of ammonia, two ammonia compressors, four chill plates (heat exchangers), three condensors, one high pressure receiver, one low pressure receiver, control systems, relief vents, safety equipment (including leak detection and ammonia monitors) and associated piping.  The compressors are differently sized for efficient energy use.  The smaller is rated at 270 tons of cooling power; the larger at 435 tons. (ton = 12000 BTU/hour).  Operation of the system is monitored and controlled 24 hours per day, 365 days per year from the Energy Center control room.\n\nThe ammonia side of the process acts as two systems.  On the low pressure side, liquid ammonia is pumped from the Low Pressure Receiver through the chill plates while water is circulated over the outside of the chill plates.  The liquid ammonia absorbs energy from the water through the chill plates and is turned into a low pressure gas.  The water temperature is reduced from the loss of energy.  This water is circulated throughout the plant for cooling.  The set pressure of the ammonia in the chill plate determines the temperature of the water leaving the chill plate.  Chill plates can be added or subtracted depending on the cooling load.  The low pressure gas is then returned to the low pressure receiver.\n\nThe second side uses the ammonia compressors to turn the ammonia vapor back into a liquid.  The low pressure gas is drawn from the top of the low pressure receiver into the ammonia compressors and is compressed into a high pressure gas.  The high pressure gas then travels through the ammonia condensors.  The condensers use fans and water circulated over ammonia-containing pipes to remove the heat from the ammonia and return it to a liquid.  The liquid then drains by gravity into the high pressure receiver.  The liquid stored in the high pressure receiver is used to maintain the proper liquid level in the low pressure receiver.\n\nThe compressors are located in adjacent rooms, each having exhaust fan.  Both fans normally run in low speed at all times.  The fans are regularly tested through our Preventative Maintenance (PM) system to assure that they continue to work properly.  Each compressor room has tow ammonia detectors which are tied into a monitoring system.  One detector is set at 50 ppm and the other at 100 ppm.  If a level of 50 ppm of ammonia is detected, an alarm sounds in the control room and both exhaust fans will switch to high speed.  The fans are programmed such that in the event of a leak in either room, both exhaust fans switch to high speed.\n\nAll safety valves are piped into a common relief piping system that has a rupture disk and an ammonia detector in the piping at the discharge point.  The detector is tied into our computer monitoring system and will sound if a reading of 50 ppm is detected.  All safety valves are replaced every five years.  Safety valves allow the system to relieve over-pressurization in a controlled manner, avoiding a catastrophic failure.\n\nEach piece of ammonia equipment is on the preventative maintenance program.  The PMs are generated automatically at the required frequency from a computer database.  In addition to the regular PM checks, a certified ammonia contractor performs a complete inspection of the system during the annual plant shutdown.\n\nEach valve is numbered to correspond to our process and instrumentation drawings (P&Ids) for the ammonia system.  All difficult to reach hand valves have been equipped with chain operation for ease of operation and faster response in event of an ammonia release.\n\nEmployee Training\n\nAll energy center operators are certified Hazardous Materials Technicians per federal OSHA requirements, found at 49 CFR 1910.120 and received annual refresher training.  Additionally, each employee receives a variety of required safety training courses including: LOTO, Confined Space Entry, Hazard Communication, Compressed Gas Handling, Process Safety Awareness and Ammonia system operation certification.  The resulting workforce is able to assist in response to an emergency or release involving the ammonia system.\n\nThe site has an Emergency Response Team (ERT) which is staffed on all three shifts.  These individuals receive training in first aid/CPR/AED, basic spill response, emergency scene management.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nA What-If analysis was performed on the system in 1995. Updates to the PHA were performed in 1999, 2003 and 2008.  These analyses will continue to be performed to identify potential risks and establish appropriate actions to address those risks.  The ammonia system is also governed by a Management of Change program that ensures that any changes to the system will be subject to thorough engineering and safety reviews.  The goal of these analyses is to ensure a continued safe operation and prevent failures anywhere in the system.\n\nPersonnel Safety Controls Overview\n\nAt various key locations in and around the system, devices monitor system function and operation.  These locations include:\nA?    Ammonia compressor room 1 and 2\nA?    Exhaust fan operation\nA?    Room Dampers\nA?    Chill Plates\nA?    Ammonia Piping System Vent Stack\n\nSeveral alarm levels indicate to energy center personnel the current conditions in the ammonia system.  These alarms include visual and audible alarms at low and high levels or ammonia.\n\nThe exhaust fans work in conjunction with the dampers to provide fresh air exchange throughout both ammonia compressor rooms.  The dampers are mounted in the ammonia compressor room 2 area.  These four dampers are open to provide fresh air intake when ammonia is not detected in the room and close if ammonia is detected to protect surround personnel from exposure.   The vent stack also has an ammonia detector.\n\nOperator Controls\n\nOperators have the ability to put the exhaust fan into high speed via a key switch outside the compressor room.  There is also a stop button located at the west entrance to the compressor room.  This button closes SV55-64, which shuts off liquid ammonia flow from the High Pressure Receiver to the Low Pressure Receiver.  Emergency stops for both compressors are located in the Energy Center control room.\n",

Abbott manufactures infant formula and adult medical nutritional products.  This facility also houses pilot plant and division offices.\n\nNone of the materials used in the manufacture or packaging of these food products are considered to be regulated substances under Risk Management Program (RMP) regulations.  The sole regulated chemical at the facility is ammonia which is used in a closed loop refrigeration system to produce frigid water.   \n\nThe facility operates a single, closed-loop ammonia system.  All of the ammonia handling equipment and piping is located in the site's Energy Center.  The ammonia system is used to chill water to 33 - 40 degrees F.  The frigid water is circulated throughout the plant to cool equipment and storage tanks.  At no time does the ammonia come in contact with the water.  A detailed description of the ammonia refrigerant process is included in Section 7, under the \"Prevention Program Description.\" \n\nSince the system received its initial charge, very little ammonia has been added.  Ammonia deliveries and releases are rare occurrences.  There has been one minor accidental ammonia in the past five years; the release had no off-site impacts and no injuries occurred.  This may be attributed to the facility's accidental release prevention program that combines the newest equipment technologies with detailed operational procedures, training and system management practices.  \n\nIn-plant emergency response procedures have been developed that incorporate both Abbott resources and emergency response services available within Columbus and Franklin County.  The site maintains a highly trained work force that is extremely familiar with the ammonia system and able to respond to any contingency.  \n\nThe site also has an Emergency Response Team (ERT) on site which is staffed on each of the three shifts.  \n\nImplementation and maintenance of syste"

      "SummaryText": "ms and programs discussed in this report have the full support of Abbott management.  Abbott has a global environmental, health & safety policy that applies to all Abbott locations worldwide.  The policy explicitly requires all locations to: \"maintain a safe and healthy workplace and environment;\" and, \"comply with all applicable laws... designed to protect human health, safety and the environment.'   \n\nThe site's general accidental release prevention program is based on the following key elements:\n    High level of training for the operators;\n    Preventive Maintenance Program;\n    Process and safety equipment;\n    Accurately written operating procedures, written with the participation of the operators;\n    Regular hazard reviews of equipment and procedures; and\n    Ongoing auditing and inspection program.\n\nAmmonia-specific exposure prevention steps include: the availability of self-contained breathing apparatus for operators; controlled access to the ammonia equipment rooms; ammonia detectors; and a  Process Safety Management program.  \n      \nTo ensure continuing proper operation, each piece of ammonia equipment is monitored through the facility's Preventative Maintenance (PM) program. The PMs are generated automatically from a computer database. Equipment is inspected and serviced during these PMs.  Equipment condition is documented.  In addition to the PM system, each year during the plant shutdown a certified ammonia contractor performs a complete inspection of each compressor.  The certified contractors also check other pieces of ammonia equipment such as alarms and control systems.\n\nIncluded in the ammonia system's list of safety features are relief valves.  Safety relief valves allow the system to relieve over-pressurization in a controlled manner avoiding a dangerous buildup of pressure.  All safety valves are piped into a common relief piping system that has both a rupture disk and an ammonia detector in the piping at the discharge point. The detector is tied into the site's "

All safety valves are replaced every five years.\n\nA \"worst-case scenario\" using conditions predefined by U.S. EPA requires dispersion modeling to reflect all of the following assumptions: all control devices fail; the Energy Center building collapses; the entire contents of the ammonia system are released into the environment in ten minutes; and atmospheric conditions are selected that minimize downwind mixing.  It is Abbott's strong contention that equipment design, rarely opening the system to add or remove ammonia, frequent inspection and maintenance, and high level of training provided to site personnel make the actual probability of a \"worst case\" release an extremely remote occurrence.\n\nThe results of the worst-case scenario would result in an off-site impact.  Depending on wind direction, a long narrow plume could reach one or more of the following potential receptors: residences, schools, recreational areas, industrial and office areas, a hospital or a correctional facility.  Modeling and results are summarized in Section 2.  The modeling software used was RMPComp.\n\nAn alternate release scenario for the Cleveland Avenue facility involves a break in a liquid level sight glass.  The subsequent ammonia release, contained inside of the Energy Center building and promptly corrected by site personnel, would result in a much smaller off-site impact.  This scenario was selected based on an actual incident that occurred once in site history (but more than five years ago).  \n\nThe alternate scenario results in a much smaller release that dissipates more quickly under average weather conditions.  Depending on wind speed and direction, this scenario could affect a school or industrial and office areas. \n\nAbbott is proud of its overall safety and environmental compliance records.  Our careful operation of the ammonia system is an integral part of the site's safety and spill prevention planning."
