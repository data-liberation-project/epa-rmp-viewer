The Brady\n\nGeothermal facility actively manages all operational permits and safety programs such as Nevada\n\nDepartment of Environmental Protection Air Quality, Chemical Accident Prevention Program,\n\nUnderground Injection Control as well as OSHA's Process Safety Management. Ormat is committed to handling the flammable motive fluid systems in a safe manner to protect the environment. Copies of emergency response, process hazard analyses and all other process safety management is maintained onsite for reference or is available electronically.\n\n\n\nFacility Description\n\nThe Brady Geothermal Power Plant is wholly owned by Brady Power Partners. The Brady\n\nGeothermal facility is located in Churchill County. The physical plant is located at 7042 Old Highway\n\n40, east of Fernley, Nevada. The leased acreage covers the defined geothermal resource area and reinjection zones.\n\n\n\nPrior to this RMP resubmission, the Brady facility consisted of three, steam-powered turbines and one OEC (Ormat Energy Converter), aka existing OEC.  With this resubmission, Ormat has added one new OEC and is in the process of revamping the existing OEC.  The new OEC process is named OEC-1 and the existing OEC process is named OEC-2.  The three, steam-powered turbines are being decommissioned.\n\n\n\nThis RMP submission reflects the new process, OEC-1.  OEC-2 is under reconstruction and the pentane fluid previously registered has been removed from the process and the Brady facility.  Consequently, the registered quantity of pentane in OEC-2 is 0 pounds.  This is reflected in the registration for Process 1.  After construction and prior to charging a new flammable liquid, this RMP will be resubmitted to reflect the quantity of a new flammable liquid in OEC-2.  \n\n\n\nUnder the current co"

      "SummaryText": "nfiguration, Brady OEC-1 is supplied hot geothermal brine from six, pumped production wells.  The OEC processes the brine through a closed loop, binary Rankine Cycle.  The hot brine circulates through the tube side of shell and tube heat exchangers to preheat and vaporize the normal butane motive fluid.  In the binary Rankine Cycle, the butane exits the shell side of the heat exchangers at high pressure, expands across a turbine to drive a 13.2 MW generator, is condensed in air cooled condensers, and is recirculated to the heat exchangers via vertical turbine pumps.  Geothermal brine exiting the OEC is re-injected, via re-injection pumps, into a different part of the geothermal reservoir in six wells.  \n\n\n\nThe Brady Power Plant is operated by Ormat's Western Nevada Operations Group. The WNVOperations\n\nGroup (WNVOPS) is comprised of management, administration, maintenance, engineering and operations personnel.  WNOPS operates the Western Nevada power generation facilities owned or operated by Ormat.\n\n\n\nBrady is a remotely operated facility.  Remote operations are conducted out of the Galena 3 control room located in Reno, NV.  On site staff will typically consist of one plant operator, two maintenance personnel and two electrical personnel which are shared between the Desert Peak II facility and the\n\nBrady facility.  Additional operational, maintenance, management and administrative support is provided to the Brady facility from the Steamboat Complex located in Reno, NV.  The Brady facility operates continuously 24 hours a day and 365 days of the year (excluding scheduled maintenance downtime or plant upsets).\n\n\n\n&#8195;\n\nRegulated Substance Handled:  The Brady Geothermal Power Plant utilizes normal butane in OEC-1 as its motive fluid in excess of the 10,000 pound threshold quantity.  \n\n\n\nWorst Case Scenario: Worst case scenario assessment has been made and potential off-site consequence analysis (OCA) was conducted.  Any potential offsite receptors were identified.\n"

These safe work practices apply to both employees and contractors.\n\n\n\nMaintenance Procedures: A Mechanical Integrity Program (MIP) has been developed for the Brady facility. The MIP adopted a maintenance concept for periodic preventative and corrective maintenance of the OEC system. The preventative maintenance tasks include visual inspection, lubrication of rotating parts, system cleaning, replacing liquids and filters, and periodic tests to verify that the system is in proper operating condition. Preventative maintenance tasks and procedures are scheduled to be undertaken over a series of maintenance intervals. The Mechanical Integrity Program identifies system maintenance procedures, frequencies and recommended spare parts, manufacturer's recommendations, operating experience and best practices.\n\n\n\nAlarm system maintenance is determined using a combination of regulatory requirements, manufacturer's recommendations, plant operating experience and best practices.\n\n\n\nStandard Operating Procedures: give detailed safe operating instructions on Normal Operations, Plant Startup and Shutdown and Emergency Operations. Additionally covered are operations of Fire Protection and Gas Detection System, Electrical Distribution System, Pentane System, Brine and Steam System, Evacuation, Transfer, and Storage System, Non-Condensable Gas Removal System, Turbine Controls and Support Systems, Compressed Air System and Cooling Water System.\n\n\n\nTraining: Initial training for personnel is given before that employee is allowed to operate or work on the facility's process area or on process equipment.

Training includes the following items, but is not limited to: (a) Location and sounds of the gas, fire, and evacuation alarms and detectors; (b) Expectations of response to injuries and emergencies by personnel on site, and (c) Evacuation routes and locations.\n\nRefresher training for all personnel shall be conducted annually at a minimum.\n\nSafety Training: Some equipment at the Brady Power Plant poses potential fire, explosion, and electrical hazards that could cause serious personal injuries and costly property damage if safety procedures are not followed correctly. Safety training, conducted monthly and required of all employees, identifies the different hazards to be found on the sites. These subjects include Emergency Action Plan (EAP), motive fluid hazards, fire prevention and hot work, lock out and tag out procedures, hazard communication, confined space, hearing conservation, personal protective equipment, accident, injury and incident reporting. Safety training is supplemented by the use of the Standard Safety Procedures.\n\n\n\nOEC Units: The OEC units are controlled and monitored by their own dedicated Programmable\n\nLogic Controller (PLC). The PLC receives all discrete (logic) and analog signals from the input devices (e.g. switches and measuring sensors), processes the signals according to pre-loaded Ormat software, and then outputs logic and analog command signals to local and field devices.

Under normal circumstances, no releases or other dangerous situations are expected to result from these automatic actions. \n\n\n\nRelief system design: Relief valves are located on the storage tank, OEC vaporizers and condensers. Each pressure relief valve relieves directly to atmosphere, and some installations have extension pipes installed to direct the relief valve discharge away from critical machinery. Additionally, each pressure relief valve is installed immediately above a rupture disk designed to fail at the relief pressure of its corresponding relief valve. Individual relief valve locations are equipped with \"telltale\" gauges in between the relief valve and its rupture disk to allow easy identification of leaking or blown rupture disks.\n\n\n\nVentilation System Design: All components of the motive fluid transfer and storage system and the\n\nOEC unit are located outdoors and well ventilated.\n\n\n\nSafety Systems: Beyond the relief system the Brady OEC units have extensive fire protection, detection, and alarming systems as well as an administrative control system aimed at fire prevention.\n\nThe fire detection systems include gas monitors which continuously monitor the area surrounding the OEC's, and multi-spectrum infrared flame detectors throughout the plant. The facility has a fire water system setup in a continuous loop around the generating units and within reach of the storage tank. The fire water systems consist of fire monitors and hydrants.
