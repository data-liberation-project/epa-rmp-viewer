This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.  We also work closely with our public emergency responders providing them with training and equipment so that they can respond safely and efficiently to emergencies that might occur at our facility.\n\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances \n\n\n\nThe Sonora Gas Plant, Southeast of Sonora, TX operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products (e.g., natural gas, propane, butane, condensate) from gas wells.  The Sonora Gas Plant handles methane; ethane, propane and butane which are regulated flammables. The Sonora Gas Plant does not use, process or store a reportable quantity of toxic regulated substances.\n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nWithin the past five years the processes have had no accidental release that caused offsite impacts provided in the risk management program rule (40 CFR 68.10(b)(1)).\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program/Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Sonora Gas Plant.  Because processes at the Sonora Gas Plant that are regulated by the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation are also subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the m"

Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the Sonora Gas Plant accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the Sonora Gas Plant and addresses each accident prevention program element.  In addition, The Sonora Gas Plant has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and employee safety issues.  These initiatives include a safety committee to promote both process and personal safety.  The committee typically has members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, and local plant management.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\nThe Sonora Gas Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Specific employees within the Sonora Gas Plant are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.  This information is readily available as part of the written employee participation plan to help employees locate any necessary process safety information.\n\n\n\n Chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in safety data sheets.

For specific process areas, the Sonora Gas Plant has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition).  The Sonora Gas Plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\n\n\nThe Sonora Gas Plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)  \n\n\n\nThe Sonora Gas Plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\n\n\nThe Sonora Gas Plant primarily uses the HazOp analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  This analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\n\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for res"

This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention. \n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the Sonora Gas Plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration and the final resolution of the finds is documented and retained.\n\n\n\n Operating Procedures\n\n\n\nThe Sonora Gas Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators, and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The procedures are maintained current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\n\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Sonora Gas Plant has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.
