Accidental Release Prevention Plan and emergency Response\n\nThe management of BC Systems is committed to maintaining a safe work environment.  A Safety and Risk Manager has been assigned to ensure that safe practices are followed in the specification and operation of systems involving hazardous chemicals.  This site has developed and trained an Emergency Response Team to ensure rapid and appropriate response to ammonia emergencies.  The site has specific and written evacuation, reporting, and response procedures in place to protect BC Systems employees, the public, and the environment in the event of an ammonia release. Due to the seasonality of this operation, the Yuma, Arizona facility is operational for six months out of the year - from November to April.  During the on-season months, there are five portable ammonia refrigeration systems on site and operational, containing a total volume of 19,560 lbs of ammonia.  There is an additional 3000 lbs of ammonia stored in a nurse tank.  During the off-months (May through October) three of the refrigeration units are transported to an alternate location and the total quantity of ammonia (19,560 lbs) is stored in nurse tanks.  One unit remains at Yuma full time, but this is considered portable due to its configuration.  The anhydrous ammonia refrigeration units are used for room cooling and process water chilling.  This system is depicted on the block flow diagram in Figure 5-1.  This ammonia refrigeration system is the only process at this site to which the RMP requirements are applicable.\n\n1.2.    Stationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\nThe BC Systems plant covered by this RMP is located at 6581 East Cattle Drive, Yuma, Arizona. The facility receives lettuce and other produce to be processed, packaged for consumer use in various salad mixes, set for short-term storage, and transported and distributed from this site.\n\nThe regulated substance is anhydrous ammonia.

Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nPrevention of accidental ammonia release at BC Systems is accomplished through the following:\n\nAA?    sound industry practice in the original ammonia refrigeration system design and construction\n\nAA?    specification and review of system modifications\n\nAA?    day-to-day operation and maintenance of the system  \n\nDay-to day operation and maintenance includes:\n\nAA?    Compliance with industry standards and codes in effect at the time of initial construction and modification\n\nAA?    Performance of a thorough Process Hazard Analyses (PHAs) at least once every five years using accurate Process Safety Information\n\nAA?    Implementation of Operating Procedures which have been reviewed by PHA\n\nAA?    Appropriate initial and refresher training of system operations and maintenance personnel  \n\nAA?    Performance of preventive and corrective maintenance according to system component manufacturer recommendations and pursuant to site wide hazardous energy lockout and hot work permit programs\n\nAA?    Application of established auditing, inspection, and pre-start-up review protocols\n\nAA?    Use of qualified contractors for work on the system\n\n1.4.    Five-Year Accident History\n\nBetween March 2005 and the present, no ammonia releases resulted in onsite or off-site injuries, deaths, or property damage, or off-site environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place. \n\nHowever, the following ammonia-related incidents occurred:\n\n11/27/07 AA? At approximately 23:30, there was a release of an ammonia and compressor oil mixture from the oil return line on the 160 screw compressor for cooler #5.  The motor on the compressor suddenly seized, causing a sudden vibration that led to a failure of the AA?AA? oil return line at the threaded fittings.  The failure led to the release."

The incident ended at approximately 01:15.\n\n1.5.    Emergency Response Program\n\nBC Systems has developed an Emergency Planning and Response document to ensure adequate preparedness with rapid and appropriate response to ammonia release emergencies.  The plan is maintained at the siteAA?s Safety Office and reviewed annually.  The document describes outside agency notification procedures in the event of an ammonia release, provides detailed evacuation procedures, and includes response procedures for the mitigation of ammonia releases. \n\nThe site has an Ammonia Emergency Response Team trained to use the Incident Command System organizational framework.  This is also described in detail in the planning document.\n\n1.6.    Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nBased on the Revalidation Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) conducted on March 10, 2010 the following adjustments are planned to ensure continued safe operations:\n\n\n\n"
