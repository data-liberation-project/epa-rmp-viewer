The management and employees of the Merrimack facility are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of highly hazardous materials.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to the community and the environment.\r\nThe facility's primary operations are the production of paper coatings where the covered material, vinyl acetate, is used as a starting material in the production of a vinyl acetate - vinyl pyrrolidone acetate copolymer called 3RB50. This material is an ingredient in a label adhesive coated at the facility under the name of DAVAC\r\n\r\nVinyl Acetate is received in 41000 lb  bulk trailer delivery to a 12,000 gal. UST from the  Supplier. The  system \r\ncontains a maximum of 39,000 pounds of vinyl acetate.  The vinyl acetate is then sent to other parts of the process for the manufacturing of a copolymer 3RB50.\r\n.\r\n\t\r\nThe worst-case scenario, based on the EPA's definition for a toxic liquid conducted and endpoints were determined using RMP*Comp Ver. 1.07 The endpoint of EPRG-2 Level was determined to be 0.4 miles. The weather conditions used were a wind speed of 1.5 meters/sec., Stability Class F, an air \ttemperature of 77 degrees F and urban topographical terrain.\r\n\t\r\nThe impacted area would affect 135 residents and business based on the 2000 US Census data.  No environmental receptors are affected.  A dike and spill containment area was the passive/active mitigation or administrative controls were considered in this assessment.\r\n\t\r\nThe alternative release scenario  involved the release of 396 pounds from a reactor. This release would result in the release of 396 lb of liquid onto a contained area within color room #3. Vinyl acetate would release at a rate of 3.3 lb/min"
