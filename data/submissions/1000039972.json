We receive hydrogen gas from an offsite Praxair facility via pipeline. In our production process, the hydrogen gas is compressed and cooled to remove moisture and other contaminants.  The hydrogen gas is then liquefied using a high-speed turbine process.  The final cryogenic liquid hydrogen product is stored in our insulated storage tanks, and is shipped by truck to customers throughout the midwest.\n\n\n\nRegulated Substances\n\n\n\nThis facility uses, manufactures, or stores a chemical listed in part 68 of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, beyond a threshold quantity, as established by the EPA; \n\nHydrogen, which is produced and stored in a liquified state.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Policy\n\n\n\nPraxair is dedicated to being the best performing industrial gas company in all aspects of our business, including safety, health, and environmental affairs. Our safety, health, and environmental policy call for a commitment to protecting the health and safety of our employees, neighbors, and the surrounding environment. This policy is the basis for engineering and construction programs that produce equipment and process systems that minimize the possibility of accidental chemical releases and operational safety programs that ensure safe operation of our facilities. Praxair is committed to the continuous improvement of these programs.\n\n\n\nPraxair is an active member of the American Chemistry Council and subscribes to the council's program of Responsible CareA&reg; Employee Health and Safety Code of Management Practices.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevention Program\n\n\n\nIn accordance with OSHA's Process Safety Management standard and EPA's Risk Management Program rule, the East Chicago IN facility has a comprehensive accident prevention program in place. This program is built around process safety concepts such as:\n\n- Technical documentation of Process Safety Info"

However, a failed pressure regulator on a purge gas line caused equipment damage with repair costs exceeding $25,000.  The purge gas over-pressurized and ruptured a weld on the coldbox (insulating container that holds cryogenic process equipment).
