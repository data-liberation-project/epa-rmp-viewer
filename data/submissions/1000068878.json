The safety information assists in the understanding of the safety-related aspects of the equipment and processes, and the limitations placed on the operations and the adopted codes and standards.  \r\nGeocycle receives hazardous waste, and uses a detailed chemical analysis and physical property analysis to define each waste stream.  There are no SDSs for hazardous waste.  However, a SDS of the individual components is used as a guide.  Also the information contained on the waste chemicals Safety Information Sheet is reviewed and updated on a periodic basis for completeness and accuracy.  The maximum intended inventory for each RMP Toxic Chemical is listed in the List of Chemicals in Table #1 and #2.  \r\nThe bulk containers used for delivering the waste fuel containing the RMP compounds are DOT-specification containers and are required to be tested periodically for tightness and adequacy for carrying hazardous materials.  \r\nDocumentation of the safety and design information on the typical process equipment, along with the corresponding design codes, is maintained in the plant's current RCRA Permit Application in"
