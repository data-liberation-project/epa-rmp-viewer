The regulated substance of concern and focus of this document is chlorine.  The following topics are addressed in this Executive Summary:\n\n*  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n*  Stationary Source and Regulated Substance\n*  Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n*  Five Year Accident History\n*  Emergency Response Program\n*  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe Huntington Beach UtilitiesA? senior management is not only committed to offer superior service, but to also maintain a safety and environmental program to promote a safe environment for all its employees and the surrounding communities.  The Water Supervisor administers the facilities safety and environmental policies. The Water Supervisor is responsible for various inspections of the facilities to ensure compliance, and oversees the entire safety and environmental programs.  These programs include safety, hazard communications, lockout/tagout, Hazardous Materials Emergency Business Plan, employee safety manuals, manufacturers documentation, Emergency Response, as well as the Risk Management Plan.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe Huntington Beach Utilities chlorine sites are located throughout the City of Huntington Beach.  The immediate area surrounding each chlorine site is primarily residential.\n\nThe chlorine systems at Huntington Beach Utilities are used for the treatment of water used for domestic purposes.  The Huntington Beach Utilities water treatment plant consists of four sites (Well Numbers 6, 7, 9, and 10), which use two one-ton containers, four sites (Well Numbers 1, 4, and 13 and Ellis/Edwards Hill Reservoir), which use 150 pound cylinders, and four sites (Overmyer Reservoir and Well Numbe"

Chlorine gas leaving the one ton containers and/or 150 pound cylinders passes through a vacuum regulator to the ejector. Still under vacuum from the regulators, it is drawn to ejectors and mixed with water from the treatment process.\n\nThe chlorine systems are all operated under vacuum conditions. Each one ton container and/or 150 pound cylinder is placed on a scale to allow Huntington Beach Utilities operators to plan ahead for ordering more chlorine and for the change out procedure.  Each one ton container is positioned so that the valves are vertically aligned.  A vacuum is created when process water is pumped through the ejectors.  This flow generates a vacuum (approximately 1-3 in. Hg) which opens the vacuum regulator.  Upon loss of vacuum in the line from any one ton container or 150 pound cylinder, a diaphragm in the vacuum regulator will close, stopping any chlorine from escaping. Any chlorine in the piping upon loss of vacuum will be drawn through the ejectors and into solution.\n\nThe chlorine gas is pulled from the one ton containers and 150 pound cylinders to the vacuum regulator from the ejector.  The vacuum regulator is equipped with rotameters to monitor and control the flow of the chlorine gas.  From the chlorinators, the chlorine gas is injected directly into the well effluent and into the distribution system.\n\nOnce the chlorine leaves either the one ton container or the 150 pound cylinder, the design of each process is very similar. \n\nTGO ChlorTainers\n\nTGO Technologies, Inc. is the developer and manufacturer of the \"ChlorTainer\", a vessel designed to contain the accidental release of liquid chlorine or chlorine gas.  The ChlorTainer is designed in accordance with ASME requirements and is capable of containing pressure releases of up to 250 psig and 300A?F.  In the event of a failed cylinder, the system will protect the operator as well as the external enviro"

Since the gas is totally contained, it satisfies the code requirement as a treatment system and provides an alternate to the conventional method of mechanical scrubber systems.  If there was a small leak from any of the threaded connections, the paint on the connections will change color (from yellow/orange to red), immediately alerting the operator of a leak.\n\nIn the event of seismic activity, the systems at the Huntington Beach Utilities sites are equipped with a seismic switch that will put the system in a shutoff mode and automatically reset after the event. Should a pipeline containing toxic gas external to the vessel break, the amount of toxic gas released is limited to the amount of gas in the line.  The system will sense the break in the line and will not allow the chlorine to continue dispensing.  It will close isolation valves to seal the stored chlorine from adding to the release through the broken line.\n\nIn addition to the seismic switch, the ChlorTainers use nitrogen to power the fail-safe actuator that will automatically close the chlorine supply valve in the event of a chlorine leak outside the vessel. This fail-safe device ensures that all of the chlorine is contained within the vessel until it is safe to resume normal operation.\n\nBack-up emergency and/or standby power is not required, as the ChlorTainer does not require power to contain gas releases.\n\nIn the event that a leak occurs in a stored cylinder, it can be contained by immediately placing the cylinder in the ChlorTainer.  The leaking cylinder may be removed after safely purging the ChlorTainer by processing the gas through the on-site chlorinator.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nHuntington Beach Utilities has implemented this California Accidental Release Prevention Program to manage the handling of chlorine. In addition, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are utilized to ensure safe practices "

This monitoring system is comprised of excess flow valves, pressure indicators, as well as other system safeguards and methods for allowing facility operators to effectively monitor and control operations.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no significant releases of chlorine at the any of the sites over the past five years (March 2004 A? March 2009), that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 10 pounds or the state requirement mandating immediate reporting of any release or threatened release of a hazardous material.  \n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nHuntington Beach Utilities has an emergency response plan in effect at the facility.  The Emergency Response Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the PSM/RMP document.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives: \n\n1.) To save lives.\n2.) To minimize and avoid injuries.\n3.) To protect the environment.\n4.) To minimize property damage.\n\nThe Huntington Beach Utilities maintains a safety committee whose members include the emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility. \n\nThe Plan also includes the Emergency training for all Huntington Beach Utilities employees. \n\nThe Emergency Response Plan is reviewed and updated by the Huntington Beach Utilities responsible person at least once a year.  This Plan will be reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM, RMP, and CalARP regulations, and to ensure that the plan is kept current.\n\nThe Huntington Beach Utilities has coordinated emergen"

In the case of a chlorine-related emergency, it is the policy of Huntington Beach Utilities to evacuate the employees and to allow the fire department to respond to the emergency (potentially with the assistance of trained facility personnel).\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nHuntington Beach Utilities has taken a pro-active approach to emergency response and safety at the chlorine well sites.  The annual emergency response drills are documented and mitigation measures to improve the TeamA?s response are continuously being reviewed. Huntington Beach Utilities has implemented all recommendations from the initial technical studies, and will complete the recommendations from the Process Hazard Analysis Revalidation (February 2009) in a timely manner. \n\nThe Process Safety Management team is planning to complete several items over the next year as their continued effort to provide a safe work environment for the facility employees.  These changes include the following items:\n\n1.  Continue to train all employees in Process Safety Management and the facility Safety Plan/Programs.\n\n2.  Continue to have employee involvement in Safety Plan Development.\n\n3.  Continue employee involvement through safety team participation.\n\n4.  Continue internal and external safety audits/inspections and implement changes as needed."
