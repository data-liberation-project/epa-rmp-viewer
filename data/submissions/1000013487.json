The facility policy, the owner, management, and employees of Hutchinson Co-op are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia and propane.  If any accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire company, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minmize the impact of the release to the people and the enviroment.\n\n2.  Facitily Information:  The primary activity at the facility is the storage and sales to farmers and propane sales and delivery.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application anhydrous ammonia is used for crop production nutrients.  Propane gas is receieved, stored and distributed for delivery for home heat and commercial business uses.  The maximum quantity of ammonia stored would be 493,000 pounds in our 28,000 and 30,000 gallon storage tanks and our nurse tanks.  The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a tank truck holding 40,000 pounds.  The maximum quantity of propane gas stored would be 217,000 pounds in our two 30,000 gallon storage tanks.  The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a tank truck holding 40,000 pounds.\n\n3.  The worst case release scenario and the alternate release scenario and the alternate release scenario.  A.  The worst case release scenario for anhydrous ammonia would be the relase of the totalcontents of a storage tank release as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.12 miles.  The worst case release scenario for propane would be failure of one 30,000 gallon storage tank when filled to 85 percent capacity (108,000 pounds) resulting in a vapor cloud expolsion, causing"

The alternative release scenario for anhdrous ammonia based on the hazard review is a 2 minute release from a break in a 3 inch pipe.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .78 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for propane would be the failure of one of the 30,000 gallon storage tanks when filled to 85 percent (108,000 pounds) resulting in two-thirds of a vapor cloud explosion, causing a 1 psi overpressure, according to epa lookup tables, the distance to the end point is (factor of .76 miles x .43 miles=.29 miles) .29 miles.\n\n4.  The accidental release prevention program:  The facility has implemented the provisions of \"safety requirements for the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia, K-61.1\" Published by the american safety and health administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia\".  In addition, minnesota dept. of ag rules.  For propane, NFPA-58 rules.\n\n5.  The five year accident history  A.  There have been no accidental releases of andhydrous ammonia or propane in the past five years that: have caused any death, injuries or significant property damage at he facility; nor to our knowledge have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations,sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\n6.
