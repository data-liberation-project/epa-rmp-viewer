Accidents are preventable through identification and elimination of causes.  Two of the most obvious causes of accidents are an unsafe act and unsafe condition.  Basic casues of unsage acts and unsafe conditions can be aidentified and eliminated through engineering, education and enforcement.  Some basic casuse are deficiencies in training, supervision, attitude and procedure of work-place .                                                                           Our program includes routine saftey meetings and training, area and facility inspections, accident investigations and record keeping.                                                                                                        St. John Parish's Administration has a sincere concern for the welfare and safety of its employees and the public it serves.  Administration acknowledges its obligation, as an employer, to provide the safest possible working conditions for employees and, as a government service organization, to provide a safe environment for the public that uses it services.                                                                                                                                                                     When accidents involving dangerous chemicals occur, the Department of Public Safety or the Parish President will decide when Parish employees are needed.  A Parish supervisor will be called to report to the Civil Defense command post at the scene of the accident.  Communication is the key to a safe outcome.                                                                                          REGULATED CHEMICALS HANDLED  All of our wastewater and pot"

Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide are the RMP-listed chemicals ( over the TQ value) which are handled by St. John the Baptist Parish.  Each plant carries between 2 to 8 tons of chlorine or Sulfur Dioxide to treat our waste or potable water.  St. John the Baptist utilizes these chemicals in the pressurized liquid form for sterilizing and disinfecting water supply systems and sanitary waste treatment discharges.  It has been used for many years by the Parish without any serious impact on anyone.

The Alternate case scenario is no longer required in this summary.                                                                              GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PERVENTION STEPS  St. John the Baptist Parish follows NFPA 58 based on state laws, OSHA and ASTM standards for complying with all PLant safety requirements.  Safety and training meetings are held on a routine monthly basis or more often if needed.  Employees are encourged to add recommendations and suggestions for safety topics or personal concerns dealing with the safe handling of chemicals or equipment.  Whe dealing with chlorine, the Parish employees use the following steps.                                       (1)  Two (2) ment work on chlorine equipment at all times.                                                                                                    (2) One (1) operator goes to the chlorintator area with respirator properly fitted and on face.

(6) If leak or chemical release occurs, Operator one must access situation.  Operator one must be a normal wastewater plant operator.  If minor and repairable by operator (valve closure, ect.), work should be completed immediately with Operator two on alert.                                                                                                                                                                                 (7) If Operator determines situation is uncontrollable, both operators should retreat and begin emergency procedures.                (8) Lead Operator must notify Emergency Coordinators (911) and initiate site evacuation plan.                                                  (9) Upon notification of Emergency Coordinator, Lead Operator should insure proper evacuation/accounting of all plant personnel.  These steps are practiced routinely, so that if a situation occurs, the steps involving the safety of the employees and the community are second nature to the Operators.

FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY   St. John Parish has had one reportable accidient at any five covered facilities. In November of 1996, and accident occurred releasing thirteen (13) pounds of gaseous chlorine due to a untightened lead washer on the cylinder valve.  No one offsite was injured, but an evacuation (precautionary) did occure to comply with St. John's policy of protecting the community."

Any required assistance must be coordinated in the plant by the on-side Operator.  A list of emergency phone numbers of agencies, a hazardous material incident reporting form, a spill leak, release decision tree form, safety equipment and more are provided for the Operators to guide them and managers, to a safe outcome of a potentially dangerous situations.
