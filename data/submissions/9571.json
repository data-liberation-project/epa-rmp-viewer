      "SummaryText": "Alabama Power Compamy's Plant Miller, located near Porter, Alabama, is a 4 unit steam electric generating plant.  Plant Miller has two (2) cooling towers to help reduce the temperature of the water that is discharged into the Locust Fork of the Black Warrior River.  In order to treat the water prior to returning to the river, chlorine is injected into the cooling tower system.  A 1 ton cylinder of chlorine is attached to a manifold at each cooling tower for this purpose.  Additional cylinders are kept as spares in this location.  Chlorine is also used to treat process water that is used by Plant Miller.  Therefore, the total quantity of chlorine exceeds the threshold limit of 2500 lbs.  A Process Safety Management (PSM) program is in effect under OSHA for Plant Miller, therefore Program 3 applies.\n\nThe main hazard that would be associated with the chlorine at Plant Miller is a toxic hazard.  The most likely event is the leaking of the manifold attached to the cylinders or the rupture of the cylinder.  The cylinders are protected from traffic around the facility by open sided steel framed sheds.  When it is necessary to replace empty cylinders, trained personnel remove and connect full chlorine cylinders to the manifold.  Therefore a rupture that would result in the rapid release of the gas is unlikely.  Due to the sparse population around the Plant, even in the worst case scenario exposure would be limited.\n                                   \nThe HGSYSTEM (Version 3.0) model was used to determine the worst case and alternate case scenario for the release of chlorine gas.  The model determined that the toxic endpoint occurred at approximately 1.7 miles from the release point for the worst case scenario and 0.3 miles for the alternate case scenario.  The end point for the worst case scenario did contain some public receptors but did not include any environmental receptors.  The alternate case scenario did not contain any public receptors or environmental receptors.  P"

      "SummaryText": "lant Miller did not exceed the threshold amounts for flammables.\n\nIn order ot insure that releases of chlorine do not occur, only trained personnel or contractors load or unload this material.  In addition, daily visual inspections are performed by plant personnel.  Plant Miller also has an outside contractor perform a yearly maintenance inspection on the chlorination system.  We feel this program greatly reduces the posssibility of an accidential release of chlorine. \n\nPlant Miller has not had any spills of chlorine in the past 5 years.\n\nPlant Miller does have a written emergency response plan that includes the release of chlorine.   In the event of a release this plan would be implemented immediately.  This plan provides for the notification of the local emergency response agencies and the public int the event of a release.provides for the notification of the public in the event of a release.  The local emergency response agencies have been notified that chlorine is present at Plant Miller."
