(Oiltanking Texas City) operates a marine terminal that stores chemicals including hydrocarbons/petroleum products, specialty polymers, solvents, intermediates, monomers and industrial products.  Operations occurring at Oiltanking Texas City are marine/overland vessel loading/unloading, storage, transportation, and distribution of chemicals.  U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations presented in Title 40 Code of Federal Regulations Part 68 (40 CFR 68), the Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions, require Oiltanking Texas City to comply with the Risk Management Program (RMP) rule because the quantities of propylene, vinyl acetate monomer, hydrogen sulfide, butane, isopentane, pentane, 1-pentene, 1,3-butadiene, ethylene, and 1-butene stored onsite exceed threshold quantities.\n\n\n\nThe RMP rule requires a facility to report the unit inventory for each RMP substance that exceeds threshold quantities, along with an EPA-approved chemical release prevention program.  In addition, 40 CFR 68 requires all RMP-covered facilities to update its Risk Management Program Plan (RMP Plan) at certain intervals, among which is the onsite presence of a new chemical in an amount greater than its threshold quantity.  The initial RMP Plan for Oiltanking Texas City was submitted to the EPA in November 2004.  The June 2007 revision included updates to terminology to more clearly reflect operations at Oiltanking Texas City, stylistic and grammatical corrections, and expansions of the assumptions made and techniques employed in the evaluation of release quantities, release rates, and impacts.  The August 2007 revision contains changes and updates that resulted from an EPA RMP inspection in June 2007.  The September 2008 revision contains changes and updates that resulted fro"

This revision contains products to be introduced by a recent amendment of TCEQ Air Permit No. 4804 and the potential pending storage of crude oil, which is already authorized by Permit 3284.  As a result of the changes authorized by the amendment of Permit 4804, threshold amounts of the flammable substances 1,3 butadiene, ethylene, and 1 butene were added.  Also, due to the pending storage of crude oil, the toxic substance hydrogen sulfide was added to the RMP.\n\n\n\nPotential offsite consequences of hypothetical Worst-Case Scenarios (WCS) and Alternative Releases Scenarios (ARS) were conducted using the EPA program RMP*Comp as well as the RMP Guidance for Offsite Consequence Analysis.  Although numerous controls are in place to prevent chemical releases and manage such consequences should an incident occur, no credit for active mitigation measures was taken into account in evaluating the worst case and alternative release scenarios.\n\n\n\nAs required by the RMP regulations, worst-case and alternative release scenarios were generated for toxic releases and for flammable releases.  Details regarding the worst-case and alternative release scenarios for Oiltanking Texas City are provided in the RMP Plan.\n\n\n\nOiltanking Texas City currently holds the following RMP-regulated substances above threshold quantities:\n\n\n\nRegulated Chemical    CAS Number    Characteristic    Threshold (lbs)\n\nPropylene        115-07-1        Flammable gas    10,000\n\nButane            106-97-8        Flammable gas    10,000\n\n1-pentene        109-67-1        Flammable gas    10,000\n\nPentane            109-66-0        Flammable gas    10,000\n\nIsopentane        78-78-4        Flammable gas    10,000\n\n1,3-Butadiene        106-99-0        Flammable gas    10,000\n\nEthylene            74-85-1        Flammable gas    10,000\n\n1-Butene            106-98-9        Flammable gas    10,000\n\nHydrogen Sulfide        7783-06-4    Toxic chemical    15,000\n\nVinyl Acetate Monomer    108-05-4        Toxic chemical    15,000\n\n\n\n|================================|\n\n|KEY "

OCA's are essential in identifying potential hazards of accidental release.  OCA's can consist of 2 elements, a worst-case scenario (WCS) and an alternative release scenario (ARS) for each type of chemical (either flammable or toxic) handled at the facility in a quantity greater than that chemical's threshold as listed in 40 CFR ?68.130.\n\n\n\n|==========================|\n\n|FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY|\n\n|==========================|\n\n\n\nThe Oiltanking Texas City Marine Terminal, in the past five (5) years, has not incurred any chemical releases that resulted in any known onsite or offsite deaths, injuries, significant damage, evacuations or sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.  \n\n\n\n|======================================|\n\n|ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION POLICIES|\n\n|======================================|\n\n\n\nThe plans for evacuation and accounting for personnel after an evacuation at the Oiltanking Texas City Marine Terminal are located onsite for all personnel to review. \n\n\n\nIf a release occurs, arrangements are described in the Emergency Response Plan/Integrated Contingency Plan for notification of local emergency response agencies and the public.\n\n\n\nOiltanking Texas City is committed to operate and maintain its facility in a safe and environmentally-friendly manner.
