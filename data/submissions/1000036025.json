This revision contains products to be introduced by a recent amendment of TCEQ Air Permit No. 4804 and the potential pending storage of crude oil, which is already authorized by Permit 3284.  As a result of the changes authorized by the amendment of Permit 4804, threshold amounts of the flammable substances 1,3 butadiene, ethylene, and 1 butene were added.  Also, due to the pending storage of crude oil, the toxic substance hydrogen sulfide was added to the RMP.\r\n\r\nPotential offsite consequences of hypothetical Worst-Case Scenarios (WCS) and Alternative Releases Scenarios (ARS) were conducted using the EPA program RMP*Comp as well as the RMP Guidance for Offsite Consequence Analysis.  Although numerous controls are in place to prevent chemical releases and manage such consequences should an incident occur, no credit for active mitigation measures was taken into account in evaluating the worst case and alternative release scenarios.\r\n\r\nAs required by the RMP regulations, worst-case and alternative release scenarios were generated for toxic releases and for flammable releases.

(Oiltanking Texas City) operates a marine terminal that stores chemicals including hydrocarbons/petroleum products, specialty polymers, solvents, intermediates, monomers and industrial products.  Operations occurring at Oiltanking Texas City are marine/overland vessel loading/unloading, storage, transportation, and distribution of chemicals.  U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations presented in Title 40 Code of Federal Regulations Part 68 (40 CFR 68), the Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions, require Oiltanking Texas City to comply with the Risk Management Program (RMP) rule because the quantities of propylene, vinyl acetate monomer, hydrogen sulfide, butane, isopentane, pentane, 1-pentene, 1,3-butadiene, ethylene, and 1-butene stored onsite exceed threshold quantities.\r\n\r\nThe RMP rule requires a facility to report the unit inventory for each RMP substance that exceeds threshold quantities, along with an EPA-approved chemical release prevention program.  In addition, 40 CFR 68 requires all RMP-covered facilities to update its Risk Management Program Plan (RMP Plan) at certain intervals, among which is the onsite presence of a new chemical in an amount greater than its threshold quantity.  The initial RMP Plan for Oiltanking Texas City was submitted to the EPA in November 2004.  The June 2007 revision included updates to terminology to more clearly reflect operations at Oiltanking Texas City, stylistic and grammatical corrections, and expansions of the assumptions made and techniques employed in the evaluation of release quantities, release rates, and impacts.  The August 2007 revision contains changes and updates that resulted from an EPA RMP inspection in June 2007.  The September 2008 revision contains changes and updates that resulted fro"
