In providing wastewater treatment services to the City, the Fourth Creek plant uses gaseous chlorine in the treatment process to maintain public health and receiving stream quality.  Fourth Creek has safely operated this process for for over twenty years through a comprehensive chlorine safety program including standard operating procedures and training.\n\nThe Fourth Creek WWTP is a 6 million gallon per day (MGD) plant that currently treats an average of 3 mgd.  Incoming wastewater is biologically treated, disinfected using chlorine, and then returned to the receiving stream, Fourth Creek.  In the disinfection process, wastewater is treated by using a chlorinator designed to mix chlorine gas with water to make a chlorine solution.  The treated wastewater is allowed to mix with the chlorine solution in the chlorine contact chamber in an effort to kill pathogens that are harmful to humans, animals, and the aquatic life that encounter the pathogens in the receiving stream.  Disinfection of wastewater insures that public health and receiving stream water quality are preserved.\n\nChlorine is a regulated toxic chemical per 40 CFR Part 68.  Fourth Creek WWTP stores a maximum of 7 1-ton chlorine cylinders (14000) pounds and is therefore subject to the RMP requirements.  The Fourth Creek plant is also subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) requirements of 29 CFR 1910.119\n\nIn order to prevent a release as outlined in Section 2 and Section 3 of this report, Fourth Creek WWTP complies with the OSHA PSM standard.  PSM requires that Fourth Creek's prevention program includes process safety information, process hazard analysis, operating procedures, training, mechanical integrity, management of change, pre-start up review, compliance audits, incident investigation, employe"

The facility routinely inspectsequipment, tests equipment, and trains employees in the PSM required areas.  The chlorine storage and feeding area is is continuously monitored by a chlorine gas detection monitor and operators thoroughly inspect equipment daily.\n\nThe Fourth Creek WWTP has not had a chlorine release in the last five years.  Upon notification by the operator on duty, emergency response to an accidental release is handled by the Statesville Fire Department HAZMAT Team.  Operators are trained to evacuate upwind and upgrade from the facility in case of a release.  Through coordination with Iredell County ECOM, all affected surrounding area will be evacuated."
