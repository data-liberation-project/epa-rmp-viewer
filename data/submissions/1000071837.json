The objective is to minimize the impact to CVD Ceramics' employees, the public and the environment. This objective is met by continuing to utilize general good operating procedures, providing appropriate training to all employees, and coordinating response activities, as necessary, with the local emergency response providers. CVD Ceramics' management is committed to providing the resources necessary to implement this policy.\n\n\n\nFacility Description\n\n\n\nCVD Ceramics is located in Weeks Island, LA and operates primarily as a manufacturer of zinc sulfide and zinc selenide.  Hydrogen Selenide (H2SE) is utilized at the facility in quantities sufficient to exceed the threshold subject to the RMP requirements as detailed at 40 CFR Part 68. Another chemical, H2S, which is regarded as being potentially harmful, is also used at the facility but does not exceed the threshold applicability.  These substances are handled and stored using the best manufacturing practices, including specially designed cylinders that are compliant with DOT regulations for transport. \n\n\n\nEmergency Contact\n\nBo Hilty, Director of EH&S and Site Support, is the designated emergency contact. Specific contact information is listed in the RMP eSubmit Tool. \n\n\n\nSubstance Description \n\n\n\nHydrogen selenide is present at the CVD Ceramics facility on Weeks Island. The substance is stored in individual cylinders that weigh between 110 and 132 lbs. Two H2Se manifolds are present in the Gas House and the"

The inventory does not exceed 7,000 pounds. The maximum flow rate to the furnace is 16.5 lbs/hour.  \n\n\n\n\n\nConsequence Analysis\n\n\n\nThe accidental Release Prevention Program requires facilities to evaluate the impact of a release of the regulated chemicals under well-defined conditions. Two types of releases must be considered; first, a \"worst case scenario\" must be examined and secondly, and an alternate case scenario. The model represents the worst case failure of the H2Se cylinders and an alternate case for a H2Se cylinder leak. \n\n\n\nThe modeling for both case scenarios was completed using EPA's RMP Comp under rural conditions. \n\n\n\nThe toxic worst case scenario consequence analysis performed for H2Se indicated if there's a rupture failure of the entire (15) cylinder interconnected manifold than a release of 1650 pounds could potential impact residence, schools, recreational parks, and an industrial business before dissipating at the endpoint of 15 miles. The mitigation measure for this scenario is the enclosed location of the cylinders. \n\n\n\nThe toxic alternative case scenario consequence analysis performed for H2Se indicated if there's a leak from an individual cylinder with a release rate of 13.2 pounds/minute for 10 minutes could potential impact an industrial business before dissipating at the endpoint of 1.1 miles. The mitigation measure for this scenario is the enclosed location of the cylinders.  \n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\n\n\nCVD Ceramics has not had releases of H2Se from the facility. Incidents previously indicated in RMP documentation were connected to a process that is no longer in operation. \n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\n\nCVD Ceramics personnel are trained in emergency response and capable of responding 24 hours each day and seven days per week. These personnel receive annual training on emergenc"

This includes compounds that are not specifically addressed under the RMP regulation. Furthermore a review is conducted on a routine basis to ensure that each process that employs hazardous chemicals are thoroughly examined.\n\n\n\nThe facility is governed by a set of OSHA and USEPA regulations that require planning and facility activities intended to prevent a release of hazardous material, or if a release inadvertently occurs, to minimize the consequences of a release to the employees of the facility, the public and the environment. These regulations include:\n\n- 40 CFR Part 68, Accidental Release Prevention\n\n- 40 CFR Part 112, Spill Prevention, Control and Countermeasure\n\n- 40 CFR Part 264, Hazardous Waste Contingency Plan\n\n- 29 CFR Part 119, Process Safety Management\n\n\n\nThe key concepts in CVD Ceramics' release prevention program are employee participation, appropriate design and maintenance of equipment, appropriate training of all employees, and ongoing communication and training with local responders.\n\n\n\nEmployee participation in the release prevention program is encouraged and supported by CVD Ceramics' leadership. Key personnel are responsible for conducting and implementing findings from the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) for H2Se. CVD Ceramics' policy is to construct all new equipment, systems, and facilities in accordance with the most current building and safety codes.
