The solution is shipped to the facility in approved tank trucks that are unloaded upon arrival into one of two bulk storage tanks.  One tank has a capacity of 83,000 gallons and can be filled to a maximum volume of 80,000 gallons while the other has a capacity of 35,000 gallons and a maximum fill volume of approximately 33,000 gallons.  An additional Day Tank of approximately 7,000 gallons is utilized in the process area"
