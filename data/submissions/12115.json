If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to noitify the Platte County Fire Dept. and request their assistance.\n  This facility is a swine breeding facility.  We use propane on the farm for heating purposes.  There is one 30,000 gallon propane tank and associated piping, valves, burners and other miscellaneous equipment.  Our worst-case scenario is failure of the storage tank, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  According to EPA's look up tables, the distance to the endpoint is .4 miles.  Since this facility is located in a relatively remote, unoccupied area, the worst-case scenarip would not affect anyone beyond our property.  \nThe propane system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with NFDA-58 and state law.  We have had no accidents involving propane.\n  In the event of an emergency involving our propane system, it is our policy to notify the Platte County Fire Dept."
