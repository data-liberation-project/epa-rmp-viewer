New employees receive basic training in refinery operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\n\nContractors\n\nThe ChevronTexaco Salt Lake Refinery uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the refinery has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform refinery personnel of any hazards that they find during their work. This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) training on safe work practices prior to their beginning work.  To ensure a safe work environment, the ChevronTexaco Salt Lake Refinery evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.

The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, such as, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe ChevronTexaco Salt Lake Refinery has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.  The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures.  In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process equipment.\n\nMaintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their job in a safe manner.

This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\nThe ChevronTexaco Salt Lake Refinery, located in North Salt Lake City, Utah, operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products (e.g., natural gas, propane, butane, gasoline, diesel, jet fuel) from raw crude oil.  \n\nThe refinery has several regulated flammables on site.  Included in this are:\n\n- Hydrogen\n- Methane\n- Ethane\n- Ethylene\n- Propane\n- Propylene\n- Butane\n- Butene\n- Isobutane\n- Isobutene\n- 2-butene-cis\n- 2-butene-trans\n- 2-Methylpropene\n- Pentane\n- Isopentane\n\n\nThe only regulated toxic substance that the refinery has above threshold quantities is hydrogen fluoride.  \n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThe ChevronTexaco Salt Lake Refinery has an excellent record of accident prevention over the past 5 years. There has been only one incidence in a covered process with a regulated material that resulted in an on-site impact.  The incident involved a small release of hydrogen fluoride which was sprayed is such a manner that it injured an employee.  The burn to the employee was minor and he suffered no long lasting effects from the exposure.   \n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the ChevronTexaco Salt Lake Refinery.  Because processes at the refinery that are regulated by the EPA RMP regulation are also subject to the OSHA P"

Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team. Employees have access to all information generated from the refinery accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the refinery and addresses each accident prevention program element.  In addition, the refinery has a number of initiatives that address process safety and employee safety issues. These initiatives include forming committees to promote both process and personal safety. The committees typically have members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and plant management.\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\nThe ChevronTexaco Salt Lake Refinery keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters including specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis and configuration information.  Specific departments within the refinery are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information. \n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards, emergency response and exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs). This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixin"

These parameters are documented in operating procedures and in equipment Safety Information Sheets (SIS's).  The process parameters include temperature, level, composition and pressure.  The refinery ensures that the processes are maintained within these limits using process controls, instrumentation monitoring, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\nThe refinery also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provide a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nThe ChevronTexaco Salt Lake Refinery has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\nThe ChevronTexaco Salt Lake Refinery primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience, as well as expertise in systems control technology and engineering.

Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive priority attention.  All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and the documentation is retained.\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the ChevronTexaco Salt Lake Refinery periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These reviews include not only the original study data, but they include process changes in the last five years that have been made through the MOC process and they include a review of incidents both in the unit and in other similar units throughout industry.  Periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating. The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  \nOperating Procedures\nThe ChevronTexaco Salt Lake Refinery maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.

This process helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made. \n\n\nSafe Work Practices\n\nThe ChevronTexaco Salt Lake Refinery has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.  Examples of these include (1) control of the entry, presence and exit of support personnel from the process unit, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous materials before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work), and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.  These and other procedures, along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\n\nManagement of Change\n\nThe ChevronTexaco Salt Lake Refinery has a comprehensive system to manage changes to processes.  This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized be"

Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nThe ChevronTexaco Salt Lake Refinery promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire or explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental release, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to Refinery management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings. Incident investigation reports are retained for at least five years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidations. \n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the ChevronTexaco Salt Lake Refinery periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.  Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years.  The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to refinery management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's f"

The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.  \n\n\nCHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe processes at the ChevronTexaco Salt Lake Refinery include hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation. The accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all Program 3 EPA RMP-covered process at the ChevronTexaco Salt Lake Refinery. Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by (1) equipment failures and (2) human errors.\n\nIn addition to the accident prevention program activities, the ChevronTexaco Salt Lake Refinery has safety features on many units to help (1) contain or control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of a release (mitigate).  The following types of safety features are used in various processes:\n\n\nRelease Containment/Control\n1. Process relief valves that discharge to a flare to capture and incinerate episodic releases\n\n2. Emergency Block Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated)\n\n3. Automated shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high level, high temperature)\n\n4. Curbing or diking to contain liquid releases\n\n5. Redundant equipment and instrumentation (e.g., uninterruptible power supply for process control system, backup power, backup pumps)\n\n6. Atmospheric relief devices\n\n\n\nRelease Mitigation\n\n1.  Fire extinguishing system\n\n2.  Trained emergency response personnel\n\n3.  Personal protective equipment (e.g., protective clothing, self-contained breathing \napparatus)\n\n4.  Water spray systems to mitigate a hydrogen fluoride release\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\n\nThe ChevronTexaco Salt Lake Refinery maintains a written Integrated Contingency Plan (ICP), which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment. The program consists of procedures for respo"

The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first-aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  In addition, the ChevronTexaco Salt Lake Refinery has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties. The emergency response program is updated when necessary, based on modifications made to refinery processes or other refinery facilities. The emergency response program changes are administered through the MOC process, which includes informing and/or training affected personnel in the changes.\n\nThe overall emergency response program for the ChevronTexaco Salt Lake Refinery is coordinated with the South Davis County Fire Department and the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which are attended by local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives.  The ChevronTexaco Salt Lake Refinery has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department). This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.
