At the facility 73 liquid caramel color products and 17 powder caramel color products are manufactured.  The caramel colors manufactured are used in the food and beverage industry in products such as soft drinks, soups, sauces, gravies, high spirit alcohols, beers, pet foods, etc.\n\nAs a global company, D.D. Williamson has many locations (including the Louisville, KY facility) that are located in residential neighborhoods.  We strive to be a good neighbor and a leader in the community with many volunteer projects and a core set of \u00bfValues and Beliefs\u00bf.  The process behind the design of the newly renovated facility was one with safety and well being of our neighbors and associates in mind.  The facility operates 24 hours/day, 5 days/week, and 52 weeks/year.  An 8 ft barbed wire fence surrounds the property and the building is monitored by an outside alarm security system when the facility is not in operation.\n\nThe following are procedures and systems installed to create a cleaner, safer, and quieter, facility to achieve this purpose:\n\nAll bulk raw materials used at our facility are shipped either via railcar or tank truck.  They are \u00bfreceived\u00bf by a trained shipping and receiving associate into the dedicated raw material storage tank.  Each raw material storage tank and transfer pump are contained inside its\u00bf own diked area which is inside a 6500 sq. ft area of the building.  With the tanks and pumps being inside a diked area and within the building, the chemical raw materials are prevented from entering the wastewater treatment system or discharging from the facility in the case of a pump leak or a rupture in the tank.  \n\nUnloading procedures are posted by each raw material inlet pipe to the appropriate raw material storage tank.  These procedures outline the proper methods required for each material, the appropriate protective equipment required for the safety of our associates, and the p"

We feel that the chemical raw material unloading process is the largest potential for an incident and is the Alternative Case Scenario discussed in the Risk Management Plan as opposed to the Worst Case Scenario, which assumes a rupture in the storage tank has occurred.  Both these scenarios would present a hazard to the surrounding public.  \n\nThe Ammonia Hydroxide used in the manufacture of caramel colors consists of a 29.4% Ammonia concentration.  The 29.4% material is stored in a 10,000 gallon (75,035lbs of 29.4% Ammonia), 30 psi, ASME coded vessel.  The storage tank is equipped with a pressure gauge, pressure relief valve, vacuum breaker, level gauge, and high level alarm.  Fumes from the Ammonia storage tank are vented to the scrubber.  The Ammonia tank remains at ambient temperatures at all times.  The storage tank is located within the walls of the building and inside a diked area, which can hold the 10,000 gallons of Ammonia present in the storage tank plus an additional 3473 gallons.  Approximately 1 tank truck of 29.4% Ammonia is received each week.  Receipts of Ammonia tank trucks vary with product demand.  An Ammonia detector is present inside the building at the chemical storage area as well as in the liquid processing area.  Procedures are in place describing the actions required in the event of an alarm.  All plant associates are provided a personal mask equipped with cartridges designed for Ammonia in the event of an incident.  Each associate is introduced to the safety requirements regarding the handling of all chemicals present at the facility during their initial orientation as well as yearly refreshment training.\n\nIt has always been the policy of D.D. Williamson to conform to the Federal, State, and Local laws pertaining to the unloading, storage, usage, and disposal of all chemicals.
