Pueblo Water has emphas its commitment to safety by holding monthly crew meetings emphasizing safety, and have been rewarded in this approach by having no injury causing accidents or chemical releases involving the chlorine or anhydrous ammonia feed facilities within the last five years.\n\n\n\nFacility and Regulated Substance\n\nThe Whitlock WTP is located at 1920 West 11th Street, on the west side of Pueblo near the Arkansas River.  Chlorine and anhydrous ammonia are used at the WTP to provide disinfection of the public water supply.  The primary plant chlorination process stores chlorine in one-ton cylinders, and no more that 28 cylinders of chlorine (56,000 pounds) are stored at the WTP. The primary anhydrous ammonia system includes storage of anhydrous ammonia in four 2,000 gallon storage tanks; however, since each anhydrous ammonia storage tank is limited to 85% of maximum volume (1700 gallons) the maximum storage capacity is determined to be 6800 gallons(35,200 pounds.)  The settling facility ammonia system includes storage of anhydrous ammonia in two 3,000 gallon storage tanks(also limited to 85% of the maximum volume) for a maximum capacity of 5,100 gallons (26,400 pounds).\n\n\n\nWorst Case and Alternative Case Release Scenarios\n\nThe worst case release scenario for the primary chlorination process involves the loss of 2,000 pounds of chlorine from a single cylinder of chlorine outside of any enclosure. The rule for worst case release analysis assumes all of the contents are released in 10 minutes. The alternative case release scenario for the primary chlorination process was based on accident history at the site, process hazard analysis, and experi"

The distance to endpoint for both scenarios were analyzed using RMP*Comp, and the analyses resulted in a worst case release scenario distance to endpoint of 1.3 miles and an alternative case release scenario distance to endpoint of 0.2 miles.\n\n\n\nThe worst case release scenario for the anhydrous ammonia storage and feed systems for Treatment Train A involves the loss of 8,800 pounds of ammonia from a single anhydrous ammonia storage tank in 10 minutes. The worst case release scenario for the anhydrous ammonia storage and feed systems for Treatment Train B involves the loss of 7,252 pounds of ammonia from a single anhydrous ammonia storage tank in 10 minutes.  The alternative case release scenarios for both primary and settling facility anhydrous ammonia process was based on accident history at the site, process hazard analysis, and experience at similar facilities and involves the release of 4,340 pounds of chlorine in 30 minutes as a result of a pump seal failure on the tanker truck during filling operations.  The distance to endpoint for both scenarios were analyzed using RMP*Comp, and the analyses resulted in a worst case release scenario distance to endpoint of 1.2 miles for the anhydrous ammonia storage and feed systems for Treatment Train A and 1.0 miles for the anhydrous ammonia storage and feed systems for Treatment Train B.  Alternate case release scenarios determined the distance to the required endpoint of 0.1 miles.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe accidental release prevention program complies with the requirements for Program Level 2 processes.  The prevention program includes an employee training program based on the written operating procedures for the WTP, hands-on training in the facilities with the systems, as well as the maintenance, inspection, and testing program fo"

These programs all serve to prevent or minimize unintended releases of chlorine and anhydrous ammonia.\n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nThe WTP has not had any incidental or non-incidental releases in the last five years.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe WTP is included within a written community emergency response plan, and the primary responder to the WTP is the City of Pueblo Fire Department.  WTP employees may only handle small, incidental releases of chlorine and anhydrous ammonia and are trained and equipped to do so.  Pueblo Fire Department is familiar with all three covered storage and feed systems at the Whitlock Plant and conducts safety inspections yearly."
