In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.\n\nMaintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices.  Written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training.  Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended, and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g. adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels).  If a deficiency is identified, equipment is repaired in a timely manner.  All outstanding deficiencies are tracked until corrective action has been implemented and documented.\n\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance.  The Baltimore plant incorporates quality assurance into equipment purchase and repairs. This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\nSafe Work Practices\n\nThe Baltimore plant has a long-standing safe work program in place to ensure worker safety.  Examples of the program include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) lockout/tagout procedures to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) procedures for safe removal of hazardous materials before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedures to conduct spark producing activities (i.e, hot work), (5) a permit and procedures to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space, and (6) procedures to ensure that hazardous jobs are closely coordinated by qualified supervision.  These procedures, along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\nIn"

Plant employees are trained to identify and report any incident requiring investigation.  Investigations are initiated within 48 hours of an incident.  Depending on the incident, an investigation team may be formed. Results of investigations are documented and appropriate changes are made.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nThe Baltimore plant maintains a written employee participation program to help ensure that safety and environmental concerns of plant workers are addressed.  The plant encourages active participation of personnel in safety, health and environmental programs at the plant.

Our commitment is demonstrated by the resources we have invested to ensure that our processes are safely designed, operated and maintained by qualified personnel.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent chemical accidents.  However, if a chemical release does occur, our trained personnel will respond in coordination with emergency responders from Baltimore City and the Maryland Department of the Environment to mitigate the release and protect public health and the environment.\n\nSASOL North America is committed to the American Chemistry Council's Responsible Care\u00ae initiative for safe management of chemicals.  The Responsible Care\u00ae Codes of Management Practices are integral to SASOL North America's Environmental, Health and Safety policy.  In particular, the Responsible Care\u00ae Community Awareness and Emergency Response Code is designed to assist emergency preparedness and foster community right-to-know, and the Process Safety Management Code is designed to prevent chemical accidents.\n\nSASOL North America's Baltimore plant uses by-products from petroleum refinery operations to produce linear alkylbenzene (LAB) and other specialty chemicals.  LAB is used in the production of household detergents.  The Baltimore plant uses hydrogen chloride gas to promote chemical reactions within the LAB process.  Hydrogen chloride gas is a regulated toxic substance.\n\nThe worst case scenario for a regulated toxic substance at the Baltimore plant involves catastrophic failure of a full hydrogen chloride gas cylinder and release of 2,000 pounds of hydrogen chloride gas.  The USEPA's RMP Comp software was used to estimate the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint (0.03 milligrams per liter).  The maximum distance to the toxic endpoint in the worst case scenario is 2.4 miles.\n\nThe alternative case scenario for hydrogen chloride gas involves maximum release of hydrogen chloride gas fr"

The plant requires that contractor supervisors train each of their employees on hazards and procedures specific to the Baltimore plant.  The plant periodically reviews contractor training documents and work performance to help ensure that safe practices are followed.\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nThe Baltimore plant experienced two accidents during the last five years that involved regulated substances and resulted in on-site injuries and/or property damage.  On October 13, 1998 a chemical reactor overpressured and failed catastrophically during performance of a process shutdown procedure.  A mixture of hydrogen chloride gas, hydrogen and combustible hydrocarbons was released from the reactor and ignited.  The subsequent fire injured five workers on-site and damaged the LAB process unit.  Based on video footage of the fire, emissions modeling, forensic evidence and failure analysis by expert consultants, no persons off-site could possibly have required hospitalization or medical treatment due to exposure to toxic concentrations, radiant heat or overpressure.  The Baltimore City Fire Department immediately responded and extinguished the fire.  There was no need to evacuate or shelter-in-place persons off-site, and there was no property damage or environmental damage off-site.  The principal cause of this accident was human error.  On March 24, 2000 a chlorine tankcar unloading hose developed a pinhole leak when it was placed in operation.  The hose was immediately removed from service.  An operator standing near the leak was briefly exposed to chlorine vapors and required medical treatment.  There was no need to evacuate or shelter-in-place persons on-site or off-site, and there was no property damage or environmental damage.  The principal cause of this accident was mechanical failure.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe Baltimore plant emergency response program has bee"

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe Baltimore plant primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  HAZOP analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience and engineering expertise.  The team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process and accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes recommendations for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures where deemed necessary.\n\nHAZOP team findings are made available to personnel who operate and maintain the process for comments, and forwarded to management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest rank receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options that are implemented in response to PHA findings are tracked until complete.
