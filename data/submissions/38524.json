      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\nThis document comprises the Risk Management Plan (RMP) for the City of Redlands (City) Henry Tate Water Treatment Plant.\n\nThe purpose of this document is to comply with the risk management planning requirements as set forth in Section 25535(d) of Article 2 of Chapter 6.95 of the California Health and Safety Code (also known as the California Accidental Release Prevention Program - CalARP) and Part 68 of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (40CFR Part 68), also known as the federal Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs or the federal RMP.\n\nThe scope of the RMP includes all operations conducted at the Henry Tate Water Treatment Plant which involve the storage, handling and/or use of chlorine.\n\nES 1.0  DESCRIPTION OF STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nHENRY TATE WATER TREATMENT PLANT\n\nThe Henry Tate Water Treatment Plant is a conventional water treatment plant utilizing two reactor-type clarifiers (that provide flocculation and sedimentation) and four dual media gravity filters. The Plant?s raw water source is Mill Creek. Water from the after bay of the Edison Mill Creek #1 Powerhouse travels via pipeline to the Cooley Hat where it is delivered to the influent of the Henry Tate Water Treatment Plant.  The untreated or raw water entering the plant contains sand, suspended particles, and microorganisms, collectively referred to as turbidity, that must be removed before the water enters the distribution system.  The basic treatment processes include a sand chamber, flocculation basins, sedimentation basins, and filters.  Polymers and other chemicals are added at various points to condition and treat the water.  Chlorine is added for water disinfection. Chlorine is a regulated substance subject to the federal RMP requirements.\n\nSTORAGE, HANDLING AND USE OF CHLORINE\n\nThe chlorine system is composed of four principal components:\n\n?  The chlorine container and feed system (i.e., gas transfer piping), "

The chlorine solution transfer piping, which conveys the chlorine solution to the end use points and diffuses it into the plant flow, and\n?  The chlorine residual analyzer, which measures and records residual chlorine concentrations.\n\nProvided below is a description of each of these components.\n\nChlorine Containers and Feed System\nThe chlorine container and feed system is located in the chlorine storage room. Liquid chlorine is received in one ton containers via truck and stored in the chlorine storage room on trunnions. The trunnions are fabricated from steel and have cadmium plated steel rollers. A maximum of six full one ton containers (i.e., a maximum inventory of 12,000 pounds) may be present inside the chlorine storage room at any time.\n\nThe two chlorine scales are sized to hold one standard one ton container each (each chlorine container has a total weight of approximately 3700 pounds of which 2000 pounds is chlorine. Each of the scales has a heavy duty bushed bearing trunnion to permit cylinder rotation. The container weight is displayed on a wall mounted 18-inch diameter dial. The containers are shuttled on and off of the scale and delivery truck by a hoist.\n\nFrom the containers, flexible connections lead to the chlorine header. From the chlorine header, a one-inch chlorine gas line leads to the chlorinators. Automatic switchover valves are provided on the discharge piping of the chlorine ton containers.  This allows an automatic switchover between the ?lead? container and the ?standby? container when the lead container supplies insufficient chlorine gas pressure.  For each container, one line is provided leading to a downstream chlorinator.\n\nChlorinators and Injectors\nTwo floor standing chlorinators are located in the chlorinator room. The principal units included in each chlorinator are as follows: an indicating rotameter, a V-no"

When the water moves through the injector, a suction is created that opens the differential regulating valve and the vacuum relief valve. The entire unit is full of air at this point as the chlorine supply line has not yet been opened. When the chlorine feed line is opened, the vacuum relief valve closes replacing the air in the chlorinator with chlorine gas.\n\nEach of the two injectors consists of a venturi-type nozzle with vacuum gauge and a ball valve. Chlorine gas is drawn from the chlorinator through a one-inch PVC pipe into the venturi, where it mixes with utility water. The water is supplied via a two-inch utility water line that is equipped with a plug valve and a ball check valve. The resulting chlorine solution is conveyed through separate lines to the chlorine solution distributor.\n\nChlorine Solution Piping\nUpon leaving the injectors, the two chlorine solution lines lead to two rotameters. The two rotameters allow the chlorine solution to be directed to the two main feed points (the flash mix basin and the clearwell).\n\nChlorine Residual Analyzer\nThe two chlorine residual analyzers continually measure and record the residual chlorine content in the plant effluent (one measures the residual chlorine content of the clarified well and the other measures the residua chlorine content in the clearwell). If a level of chlorine is detected below the desired level, a low chlorine residual alarm signal is sent to the main control panel.\n\nES 2.0  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nThis section has been deleted to comply with 2004 regulatory updates to address homeland security.\n\nES 3.0  FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nDuring the five years preceding the submittal of this RMP, the Henry Tate Water Tr"

Known offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place.\n\n\n\nES 4.0  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe Accidental Release Prevention Program at the Treatment Plant consists of a series of programs, procedures and policies designed to minimize the risk of accidental releases involving chlorine.  These programs include design and operating controls such as compliance with specified codes, the health and safety program, numerous standard operating procedures, the equipment inspection and maintenance program (including a mechanical integrity and preventive maintenance program), the management of change program, pre-start-up review, fire protection and hot work permit program, management of- and safety of- contractors, accident/incident investigation procedures, emergency response plan, RMP compliance auditing program, record keeping and a variety of training programs.  Details of each of these components of the Plant's Accidental Release Prevention Program are provided in the Prevention Program tab of the Risk Management Plan (RMP).\n\nThere are several detection and monitoring devices and alarms placed at strategic locations throughout the Plant.  Table ES-2 provides a summary listing of these devices as well as their sensitivities. In addition, there are portable fire extinguishers located throughout the Plant.\n\nES 5.0  EMERGENCY RESPONSE\n\nThe City recognizes that emergency planning and emergency response are an integral component of risk management.  As such, the City currently has an emergency response plan and an emergency evacuation plan in place at the Treatment Plants as part of the Hazardous Materials Business Plans (HMBPs).  \n\nThe Emergency Response Plan (ERP) for the City of Redlands was updated to comply with the Public Healt"

In addition, the ERP was updated to be compatible with Standardized Emergency Management System (SEMS) specifications to allow for a smooth interface with the operations of the municipal emergency response agency to ensure effective response to an emergency and provide the ability to operate under Unified Command.\n\nScenario-based emergency response procedures (including a chlorine release specific response) were selected based on the potential events identified during the workshops and concurrence of Redlands staff.  These emergency procedures serve as stand-alone documents that will address each scenario separately in terms of activation of a procedure, responsible personnel, required tools, specific actions that should be taken, precautionary statements, criteria to contact other agencies, etc. \n\nES 6.0  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nPer the requirements of the Process Safety Management, Risk Management, and California Accidental Release Prevention Programs, the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) revalidation was performed on ALL operations involving chlorine in order to evaluate the potential for accidental releases.  As a result of this PHA revalidation, a number of recommendations were made to improve the safety of the operations conducted.  A summary of the recommended actions is provided in Table ES-3.  Table ES-3 also presents the implementation status of the recommended actions.  As shown, the City has already implemented a number of the recommendations.  Table ES-3 also presents the expected date of implementation for those recommendations not yet implemented.\n\nES 7.0  FOR MORE INFORMATION\n\nThe City recognizes that some persons may be interested in obtaining more detailed information regarding risk management prevention program components not discussed herein. Interested parties that have additional questions regarding the City's Risk Management Plan are directed to contact:\n\nMr. Greg Gage"
