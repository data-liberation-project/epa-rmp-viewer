Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Orrick Farm Service, Inc. in Orrick are strongly committed to employee, public, and\nenvironmental safety.  This commitment is an inherent part of our comprehensive accidental release\nprevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance,\nand employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement\nappropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If such a release does\noccur, our trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of\nthe release.  We also coordinate our response efforts with the Orrick Fire Department, which\nprovides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n  2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities include support services for crop production.  We have anhydrous\nammonia stored in one 30,000-gallon tank and in two 6,000-gallon and one 12,000 gallon\ninterconnected tanks at our facility in Orrick (Figure 1). The maximum amount stored is 43,200  \ngallons (222,307.2 pounds) at the maximum fill capacity of 80 %.\n\n  3. Worst Case Release and Alternative Release Scenarios\nWe utilized RMP PRO for the worst case and alternate case scenarios of the required offsite\nconsequence analysis for our facility.  The following details these scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario involves a catastrophic release of the entire contents of the largest \n anhydrous ammonia storage tank (123,504 pounds) in gaseous form over a 10-minute period.  At\nClass F atmospheric stability, 1.5 m/s wind speed, and a urban topography, the maximum distance\nto a toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L is 5.0 miles (Figure 2).  Th"

The\nscenario involves the release of 7616.42 pounds of ammonia in a gaseous form over a period of 30\nminutes.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14\nmg/L of ammonia is 0.31 mile (Figure 3).  The estimated population within a 0.31-mile radius of the\nfacility is 350.\n\n  4. General Accidental Release Prevention Program\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the EPA's accidental release prevention\nrequirements as set forth in 40 CFR part 68.  The following sections briefly describe the elements\nof the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\nOrrick Farm Service maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical\nhazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associated with all processes (Appendix D).\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are\nidentified and controlled effectively.  Any findings from the hazard analysis are addressed in a\ntimely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nOrrick Farm Service maintains written operating procedures to ensure that activities within our\ncovered processes are conducted safely.  These procedures address various modes of operation; the\ninformation is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes\n(Appendix B).\n\nTraining\nOrrick Farm Service has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who\nare operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nOrrick Farm Service conducts documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure\nproper operation.  Maintenance checks are conducted by qualified personnel with"

Examples of process equipment that would receive maintenance checks\ninclude:  pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency\nshutdown systems, controls, and pumps.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance\nchecks are corrected in a safe and timely manner (Appendix C).\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at Orrick Farm Service to manage changes in process chemicals,\ntechnology, equipment, and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or other\nemployees whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly notified\nof the modification and offered training to deal with it.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nOrrick Farm Service routinely conducts pre-startup safety reviews related to new processes and\nmodifications in established processes.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction,\nequipment, and operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing\nequipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nOrrick Farm Service conducts compliance audits on a regular basis to determine whether the plan's\nprovisions, set out under the 40 CFR part 68, are being implemented.  Any non-compliance issue\ndiscovered during the audit is promptly corrected.\n\nEmployee Participation\nOrrick Farm Service truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team\neffort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident\nprevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all\ninformation created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP, particularly information\nresulting from process hazard analyses.\n\n  5. Five-year Accident History\nOrrick Farm Service has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5\nyears.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies, no accidental release "
