(Univar) branch located at 10889 Bekay Street, Dallas, Texas (the Branch).ERM-West, Inc. (ERM) prepared this Plan on behalf of Univar to satisfy the requirements of the Federal Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions in the Federal Code of Regulations (40 CFR Part 68). The RMP registration required under Section 68.160 of the Federal regulations is included in Section 7 of the RMP.\n\n\n\nUnivar is a wholesale chemical distributor serving a number of U.S. industries. Founded in 1924, Univar supplies the food industry, chemical compounders, pharmaceuticals, mining, forest products, oil and gas producers, electronics, coatings and many other key industries with the chemical raw materials and support services required to produce or refine products used in numerous end-use markets.\n\n\n\nSome of the products stored and handled by the Branch are subject to the Federal RMP regulations.  A key requirement of this program is the preparation and submission of a RMP.  The Federal EPA prescribes the content of the RMP. The current required 5-year update includes two processes, one specifically for formaldehyde, and the other specifically for aqua ammonia. The basis for the following modifications include:\n\n?    Process #1 is now only for aqua ammonia (less than 30% by weight), which remains a Program 2 process;\n\n?    A new Process #2 has been added reflect the change of formaldehyde from a Program 2 to a Program 3 process.\n\n\n\nUnivar has opted out of the RMP coverage exclusion for formaldehyde under 40 CFR 68.115(b)(1).  Despite the partial pressure of the material in solution being less than 10 millimeter of mercury (mm Hg), Univar has elected to keep formaldehyde in the current 5-year update as a regulated process.  \n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nUnivar's accidental release prevention program covers areas such as design, installation, operating proce"

It is the Branch's policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. This program includes provisions and requirements for the key elements listed in Section 1.4.\n\n\n\nThe Stationary Sources and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nThe Branch's primary activities encompass the warehouse storage of industrial chemical raw materials and products, and their distribution via Univar's fleet of trucks.  \n\nThe following branch processes are the subject of this Plan and hereafter are referred to as the covered processes:\n\n?    Process #1 - Warehousing Operations (Container Storage and Distribution): aqua ammonia (less than 30% by weight).\n\n?    Process #2 - Warehousing Operations (Container Storage and Distribution): formaldehyde (37% or less by weight).\n\nThe table below includes the Branch's regulated substances handled onsite that exceed the Federal RMP quantity thresholds. \n\nTable ES1:    Maximum Intended Inventory of Regulated substances\n\nChemical Name CAS Number Maximum Inventory (lbs.)

The emergency response plan includes adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.\n\nThis Plan is shared with local emergency responders who have access to branch personnel (and up-to-date phone numbers).  The Branch responds to minor incidents, but calls in professional emergency responders in the event of all other incidents.\n\nLocal emergency responders, such as the fire department, are invited and encouraged to visit and familiarize themselves with the products and facilities.  Joint emergency exercises are conducted when possible.\n\nFor more detail see Section 6.0.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nNo recommendations to further reduce the likelihood and/or severity of accidental releases of the two control processes at the Branch were generated during the February 2018 PHA.  \n\n"
