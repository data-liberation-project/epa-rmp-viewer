This report provides the Risk Management Plan (RMP) for the recovery skid system, pursuant to the requirements of the U.S. EPA RMP rule and applicable to the Snakes oil and gas production pad owned and operated by Enerplus Resources (USA) Corporation.\n\n\n\nThe system is designed to remove liquids from gas at the wellhead, having an inlet pressure between 150 and 400 psi. The refrigeration system can operate at a chilling temperature as low as -40 degF. Recapture Solutions uses this system to remove liquids from flared gases. The portability of the unit allows it to easily be moved from site to site when flaring ceases. The Porta-Pack (LPG storage portable tank) is the only storage tank for liquid products, and has 18,000 gallons water capacity. Recapture Solutions limits the maximum fill to 85% of the tank volume when the product temperature is above 0 degF, 82% when the product temperature is below 0 degF, or 80% when the product temperature is below -35 degF. For the purpose of this assessment, the Porta-Pack is assumed to be completely filled to 85% of its total capacity (15,300 gallons), which is equivalent to 57,146 lbs. of natural gas mixture (butane, propane and natural gasoline).\n\n\n\nUnder the authority of section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act, the Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions require facilities that produce, handle, process, distribute, or store certain chemicals to develop a Risk Management Program, prepare a Risk Management Plan (RMP), and submit the RMP to EPA. Covered facilities were initially required to comply with the rule in 1999, and the rule has been amended on several occasions since then, most recently in 2004. This facility is regulated under Title 40, Part 68 of the Code of Federal Regulations (40 CFR 68), more commonly known as"

For natural gas components (e.g. butane, ethane and propane), the threshold is 10,000 lbs. Recapture Solutions stores approximately 57,146 lbs. of natural gas and exceeds 10,000 lbs. threshold, thus the facility is subject to the requirements of the Chemical Accident Prevention rule and must prepare an RMP."
