This Site is a food service distribution and storage facility. The Site started operations in 1975 and presently employees 748 employees.\nRobert Orr - Sysco distributes products such as food service items.  Anhydrous Ammonia is the only chemical that is covered by EPA's 40 CFR 68.130 RMP standard with an on site  inventory of 15,000 lbs. The ammonia is utilized as a refrigerant for cooling and freezing food. This system is maintained inside ot two engine rooms. The engine rooms are provided with continuous ventilation, and the equipment is monitored for temperature, pressure, and ammonia leaks continuously 24 hrs/day. The facility is monitored by Security Guards 24 hrs/day.\nRobert Orr - Sysco strives to be an accepted part of the community by being a good neighbor and citizen.  We focus each day on all applicable Laws and Regulations in order to protect the Health and Safety of our employees and our community. The site has worked five years without a Lost Time Injury. \nThe Clean Air Act Amendments (Section 112(r) ) mandated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) requires a Risk Management Plan (RMP) which requires covered sites to perform an Off site Consequence Analysis by determining its Worst Case Scenario and its Alternative Release Scenario.\nThe Worst Case was based on the highly unlikely scenario of a catastrophic failure of an ammonia liquid receiver without any mitigation. This would consist of the release of 15,000 lbs of ammonia from the receiver vessel in a 10 minutes time period assuming the worst possible weather conditions. The Toxic End Point would be 1.5 miles downwind.\nThis scenario is used to help the LEPC to plan proper Emergency Response in case of a release.\nThe Alternative Release Scenario is a more realistic scenario and is based on the incident history and system knowledge. This scenario would be a compressor/pump seal"

Robert Orr - Sysco's Prevention Plan consits of adhering to OSHA's Process Safety Management standard that:\nIDENTIFIES POTENTIAL HAZARDS:\n1)  Conducting PROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS on our ammonia refrigeraton systems,\n2)  Reviewing MODIFICATIONS or changes to the system,\n3)  Conducting PRE-STARTUP SAFETY REVIEWS after a modification.\n\nCONTROLS POTENTIAL HAZARDS BY:\n1)  Utilizing detailed OPERATING PROCEDURES,\n2)  Thoroughly TRAINING each employee who operates and maintains the system, and certifying that he/she can properly operate the system,\n3)  Identifying, inspecting, & testing system piping and equipment for proper MECHANICAL INTEGRITY,\n4)  Maintaining accurate PROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION on the ammonia hazards, the equipment design data, and the system operating philosophy,\n5)  Selecting only CONTRACTORS with safe work histories and keeping them informed of potential hazards and emergency plans,\n6)  Utilizing a HOT WORK PERMIT system to assure safe maintenance work on the equipment.\n\nPROVIDES EMERGENCY RESPONSE BY:\n1)  Maintaining an EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN  to detail the protocol for notification of management and response agencies, mitigation procedures, and evacuation procedures.\n\nCONDUCTS AUDITS BY:\n1)  Completing INCIDENT INVESTIGATIONS on all incidents in order to prevent recurrance,\n2)  Completing COMPLIANCE AUDITS of the PSM program every 3 years.\n\nThese Prevention Plan elements are accomplished by utilizing EMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION as much as possible.\n\nMANAGEMENT STRUCTURE\nWe have the following Safety and Health staff to assure prevention activities are administered properly:\n1)  Safety Manager \n2)  Facility Services Manager\n3)  Refrigeration Technicians\n4)  Security Guards\n5)  Warehouse Trainers \n6) Transportation Trainers \n\nACCIDENT"
