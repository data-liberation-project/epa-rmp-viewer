      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\nOverview\n\nThe Cumberland Water Filtration Plant (Evitts Creek Water Company) reviews and updates when applicable the RMP and the OSHA PSM Program. While the Plant has been upgraded/modified since the original RMP was prepared, there has not been a change in the quantity or type of listed chemicals used and/or stored.\n\nRelease Prevention and Response Policy\n\nIn compliance with the provisions of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations Part 68 and in an on-going effort to be prepared for emergencies, the City of Cumberland Utilities Division prepared an Integrated Process Safety and Risk Management Plan for  the Evitt's Creek Water Filtration Plant in Bedford County, Pennsylvania.  It is the policy of the Utilities Division to operate all of the facilities within its jurisdiction in the safest and most efficient manner possible, with due regard for the health and safety of Utilities Division employees, the Public, and the environment.\n\nStationary Source and Chemicals\n\nThe Water Filtration Plant employs chlorine as a disinfectant for the surface water supply of the City of Cumberland, Maryland.  The chlorine is delivered, stored, and drawn from one-ton containers.  The ton containers are stored in a dedicated Chlorination Building.  This is considered to be a single, continuous process.\n\nAmmonia is employed to produce chloramines for persistent disinfection, and propane is stored for use in heating.  The ammonia and propane are delivered by tank truck and stored in 1000 gallon water-capacity pressurized storage tanks which are approximately 600 feet downhill from the Chlorination Building.  The current Emergency Response Plan has been in existence in some form since 1993, and is coordinated with the local emergency response organizations.\n\nRelease Scenarios\n\nFor the Water Filtration Plant, a worst case assumed an accidental release of two tons of chlorine during 10 minutes at 0 feet elevation and 100 degrees Fahrenheit, with an atmospheric stabili"

      "SummaryText": "ty class F.\n\nThe Alternative scenario for the facility assumes a break in the gas withdrawal tubing at a ton container connection, a temperature of 100 degrees Fahrenheit (the maximum temperature, at the closest reporting station), and an atmospheric stability class of D.  Procedures that prohibit lifting containers over in-service containers and having only one container actively in use at a time,  reduces the likelihood of breaking multiple lines and having multi-ton releases.\n\nRelease Prevention\n\nThe general release prevention program is based on training, standard operating procedures,  and material selection.  The operating personnel are trained in the proper operation, maintenance, connection-disconnection, and emergency response for the chemicals employed at the Water Filtration Plant.  With regard to anhydrous ammonia and propane, the two chemicals are present in quantities less than threshold, but Process Safety Management and Risk Management procedures have been performed in compliance with the General Duty Clause.\n\nAll gas-containing tubing and control devices are selected for specific material compatibility and compliance with appropriate Codes and Standards.  The systems are regularly and routinely inspected, and maintenance or replacement is performed as appropriate.\n\nAccident History\n\nTo date, there have been no accidental chlorine, ammonia or propane releases from the Water Filtration Plant resulting in either on-site or off-site consequences.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe Emergency Response Program is based on the use of Utilities Division WFP employees who are trained to respond to, and control, an accidental release of chlorine.  The employees are trained in the use of Personal Protective Equipment and specialized ton-container patching kits (Chlorine Institute Kit B)."
