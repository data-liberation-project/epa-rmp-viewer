The program reviews the safety record of all contractors to help ensure that the plant only hires contractors who can safely perform the desired job tasks.  The plant explains to the contractor supervisors the hazards of the process on which they and their employees will work, the plant's safe work practices, and the plant's emergency response procedures. The plant requires that the contractor supervisors train each of their employees who will work at the plant before that worker begins work at the plant site. The plant periodically reviews contractor training documents and work performance to help ensure that safe practices are followed.\r\n\r\n1.3.2 Chemical-specific Prevention Steps\r\nIn addition to the required prevention program elements, the Plant has implemented safety features specific to the hazardous substances used at the plant. The following paragraphs describe some of these features.\r\n\r\nFormaldehyde solution-Industry standards are followed at the plant to help ensure safe handling of formaldehyde.  Formaldehyde is delivered to the plant by offsite vendors.
