The facility is located on Paper Mill Road and is adjacent to Georgia-Pacific Pulp & Paper Mill. The facility employs fifty full-time employees.  GPC is committed to operating the plant in a manner that is safe for its workers, the public, and the environment. As part of this commitment, GPC has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility. One component of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the plant and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR Part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule). One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMP Plan) describing the risk management program at the plant. This document is intended to satisfy the RMP Plan requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at the plant.\n\n\n\nThe risk management program at the Plant consists of the following three elements:\n\n1) a hazard assessment to help understand the potential offsite consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and accidents that have occurred during the last five years associated with the use of substances regulated by the RMP rule (regulated substances), \n\n2) a prevention program to help maintain and safely operate the processes containing more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance (covered processes), \n\n3) an emergency response program to help respond to accidental releases of regulated substances from covered processes.\n\n\n\nInformation further describing these elements is provided in this RMP Plan.\n\nAlthough the risk management program at the Pl"

In fact, the Plant has a comprehensive safety program in place establishing many levels of safeguards against release of a hazardous substance and injuries and damage from a release of a hazardous substance.  GPC limits the use of hazardous substances. Before using a hazardous substance at the Plant, less hazardous alternatives are considered. When a hazardous substance is used at the Plant, GPC considers the potential for this substance to adversely affect plant workers, the public, and the environment and takes steps to prevent any such effects.\n\nGPC prevents releases of the hazardous substances used at the facility. When a hazardous\n\nsubstance is used at the Plant, the equipment is carefully designed, built, and operated to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release. Industry and government standards are closely adhered to in the design, construction, and operation of the equipment.\n\nGPC limits damage from a release, if such a release occurs. GPC trains its workers to respond to an accidental release, reducing the consequences of a release if it occurs. In addition, GPC works with the local fire department and with the Ashley County Office of Emergency Management (LEPC) to help prevent injuries and/or environmental damage if a release does occur.  \n\n\n\nThe safety program at the Plant consists of a number of elements, only some of which are required by the RMP rule. This RMP Plan is primarily intended to describe those parts of the safety program at the Plant that are required by the RMP rule.\n\n\n\n1.1 Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nGPC is committed to the safety of workers and the public, and the preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.

The training program includes both initial and refresher training that covers (1) a general overview of the process, (2) the properties and hazards of the substances in the process, and (3) a detailed review of the process operating procedures and safe work practices. Computer-based training modules, classroom training, and on-the-job training with experienced operators are used to conduct this training.
