Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response\n\nStemilt, Inc., (hereafter referred to as Stemilt) accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices.  It is the policy of Stemilt to adhere to all applicable federal and state safety and environmental regulations.\n\nStemilt's emergency response policy involves the preparation of response plans and training of employees in evacuation and the handling of ammonia releases.  Key Stemilt employees are first responder trained in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.120(q).\n\nAt Stemilt's anhydrous ammonia is used on-site. Ammonia listed on the Extremely Hazardous Substance (EHS) list.  \n\nB. Facility and Regulated Substance Handled\n\nStemilt is a fruit processing and cold storage facility, located at 80 McNeil Canyon Road, Chelan Falls, WA.  The facility is located in Douglas County.\n\nThe regulated substance used at Stemilt is anhydrous ammonia (CAS# 7664-41-7). The use of anhydrous ammonia is as a refrigerant.\n\nThere are 17,740 pounds of anhydrous ammonia in the refrigeration system and this is the only system subject to the RMP program.\n\nStemilt has established policies, procedures and training to reduce the risk of an accidental hazardous substance release for the safety of its employees and surrounding areas.\n\nC. Worst-Case and Alternative Scenarios\n\nThe off-site consequence analysis considers two ammonia release scenarios identified as \"worst case\" and \"alternative\" scenarios.  The worst case scenario is defined by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which states that \"the owner or operator shall assume that the maximum quantity in the largest vessel is released ?\".  The alternative scenario is defined as \"more likely to occur than the worst case scenario\".\n\nWorst-Case Scenario. - Failure of the largest vessel would release 8,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  However, to obtain a true worst-case scenario, an inventory release of 10,000 "

However for modeling purposes, no mitigation was taken into account during the modeling.  Although, building containment would be a substantial mitigation factor.  \nThe distance to the EPA end-point is off-site.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario - The alternative scenarios was modeled, using RMP-COMP.  The assumptions modeled were wind speed of 3 meters per second, stability class of D and an air temperature of 25 degrees centigrade.  The amount modeled for was the entire system inventory of 17,740 pounds over a 30-minute period, at a release rate of 330 pounds per minute.  There were no mitigation factors taken into account for this modeling. Although, building containment would be a substantial mitigation factor.\n\nThe distance to the EPA end-point is off-site.\n\nBoth the \"worst-case\" and \"alternative\" scenarios are unlikely because Stemilt has employed the following control and mitigating measures.\n? Industry standards and quality controls were followed in the design of this equipment and its manufacture.\n? The facility utilized a preventive maintenance program to maintain the ongoing integrity of the vessel.\n? The facility has a training program that insures only qualified personnel operate the system.\n? The facility requires that all PSM elements as well as company maintenance policies are followed.\n? The facility has trained emergency response personnel and procedures on site to respond quickly to isolate and potential releases.\n? Only trained and authorized personnel have access to the system.\n? The system was designed using standard practices and is maintained by rigid company standards.\n? The piping is routed to avoid impact from traffic sources.\n\nA more realistic scenario would be that of a pressure relief valve lifting, discharging ammonia vapor from vents on top of the building and the EPA end-point is just past the boundaries o"

Training of personnel\n? Preventative maintenance program\n? Written safety procedures and use of safety equipment\n? Use of accurate and effective written operating procedures\n\nStemilt also complies with: \n? OSHA's and Washington State's process safety management rule.\n? Applicable Washington State's safety regulations (WAC's 296-24 and 296-62).\n? Applicable local fire codes for handling of hazardous materials.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system was installed to applicable codes and good practices at the time of installation.  Piping is elevated to prevent accidental damage to the system from moving vehicles.  Engine room doors are tight fitting and open outwards.  Other safety devices Stemilt utilizes include:\n? Computerized controls, which can be operated remotely\n? Suction trap hi-level float\n? High discharge pressure shut down\n? Low suction pressure shut down\n? High discharge temperature shut down\n? Oil pressure failure shut down\n? High amperes shut down\n? Automatic timer to prevent short cycling\n? Oil filters plugged shut down\n? 250 psi relief valves on high pressure side, to prevent overpressure situations\n? 150 psi relief valves on low pressure side, to prevent overpressure situations\n                                                                                                                                                                             Operating Procedures have been prepared by Stemilt to be used by employees performing operational functions.
