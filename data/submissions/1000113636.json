The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the stationary source\n\nTo address concerns of an accidental release, prevention and emergency response, all plant and field personnel are trained in ammonia emergency response procedures and use of appropriate protective equipment. Refresher training and emergency response drills are conducted on a periodic basis to ensure personnel are equipped, trained, prepared, and practiced in responding to ammonia emergencies. \n\nAs a result of information gathered during preparation of this Risk Management Program, the MEISTER CHEESE/MUSCODA PROTEIN  PRODUCTS - MUSCODA FACILITY is committing additional resources to further increase employee awareness and equipment reliability and to establish operator training and preventive maintenance programs. As a demonstration of the MEISTER CHEESE/MUSCODA PROTEIN PRODUCTS - MUSCODA FACILITY 's high degree of commitment to public safety and service, the MEISTER CHEESE/MUSCODA PROTEIN PRODUCTS - MUSCODA FACILITY is taking action to decrease the risk of ammonia exposure to the public by implementing recommendations made during the Process Hazards Analysis and Off-site Consequence Analysis.\n\n2.

The anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system is a closed loop industrial refrigeration system. The ammonia is not used or mixed in any manner with other chemical processes.\n\n3. The \"Worst-case release scenario(s) and the alternative release scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\n\nA \"Worst-Case Scenario Offsite Consequence Analysis\" and an \"Alternative Scenario Offsite Consequence Analysis\" were performed identifying the public and environmental receptors within the toxic endpoint concentration radius of 200 ppm. The results are mitigated by the fact that all the vessels are inside the MEISTER CHEESE/MUSCODA PROTEIN PRODUCTS - MUSCODA FACILITY building. A variety of administrative controls and computerized controls are in place to shut the system down when operating parameters and limits are exceeded.\n\n4. The general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific preventative steps\n\nThe basic elements of the Program 3 Prevention program have been developed and are now in place. These include:\n\nProcess Safety Information\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nStandard Operating Procedures\nSafe Work Practices\nEmployee and Operator Training Programs\nMechanical Integrity Program\nManagement of Change Procedures\nPSM Compliance Audit Procedures\nIncident Investigation Procedures\nEmployee Participation Program\nHot Work Permit Procedures\nContractor Safety Program\nEmergency Response Program\n\nAmmonia specific prevention steps include:\n\nAdministrative controls\nOperator Training\nComputerized controls\n\nThe Preventive Program 3 provides extensive maintenance and operator/mechanic training to ensure that the system's mechanical integrity is maintained for the life of the covered process.

The five-year accident history\n\nA five-year accident history has not been prepared and included in the Risk Management Plan (RMPlan) since the facility has not experience any reportable releases and/or accidents in its history. To prevent and/or minimize any potential future release of anhydrous ammonia, the MEISTER CHEESE/MUSCODA PROTEIN PRODUCTS - MUSCODA FACILITY is implementing a detailed Process Safety Management program (Preventive Program 3).\n\n6. The emergency response program\n\nEmergency response is discussed in the Risk Management Program (RMP) binder of the complete program. MEISTER CHEESE/MUSCODA PROTEIN PRODUCTS - MUSCODA FACILITY has a detailed Emergency Response Plan for their facility. The purpose of this plan is to provide the means for rapidly determining the appropriate response for any emergency that may develop at the facility such as an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  The MEISTER CHEESE/MUSCODA PROTEIN PRODUCTS - MUSCODA FACILITY conducts scheduled drills of the emergency response plan. The Emergency Response Program is written, includes specific actions to be taken in response to an accidental release, includes procedures for informing the public and local agencies responsible for responding to an accidental release, and includes information on emergency health care.\n\n7. Planned changes to improve safety\n\nThe MEISTER CHEESE/MUSCODA PROTEIN PRODUCTS - MUSCODA FACILITY is incorporating and addressing any recommendations resulting from the Process Hazard Analysis, Offsite Consequences, and program audits. The flexibility of the program allows the MEISTER CHEESE/MUSCODA PROTEIN PRODUCTS - MUSCODA FACILITY to respond effectively to prevent or minimize any potential exposure of MEISTER CHEESE/MUSCODA PROTEIN PRODUCTS - MUSCODA FACILITY employees, the surrounding public, and/or the environment to a release of anhydrous ammonia.
