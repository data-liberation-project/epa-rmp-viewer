The facility produces fresh and frozen seafood products, using anhydrous ammonia in a closed system as a refrigerant in freezers and cold storage.  Ammonia is the safest refrigerant available and has excellent warning properties; it is extremely pungent at levels far below dangerous concentrations.  In calculating worst-case and alternative scenarios, efforts were made in all cases to overestimate rather than underestimate the effects of a release.  The facility system was recently expanded, which brings it over the threshold quantity for Process Safety Management and Risk Management Planning purposes.\n\nWorst-Case Scenario\nA worst case scenario is required to be documented in the RMP.  Based on the requirements of the RMP rule, it is assumed that the catastrophic failure of the largest vessel in the system results in the release of its entire contents over a 10-minute period.  The release is modeled using RMP*Comp? software. \n\nAlternative Release Scenario\nThe alternative release scenario for the ammonia refrigeration process is based on a potential hazard identified during the Process Hazard Analysis conducted during documentation of the facility prevention plan.  In this scenario, a safety relief valve fails, releasing ammonia gas to the atmosphere.  As this valve is designed to relieve to the outdoors, no mitigation is considered in the scenario calculations.  The release is evaluated according to the procedures documented in ?General Risk Management Program Guidance? (April 2004), Appendix E ?Supplemental Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration Facilities? and with R"

      "SummaryText": "MP*Comp? software.\n\nRelease Prevention Program \nTrident Seafoods has implemented a prevention program to comply with the requirements of the Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29 CFR 1910.119), which is designed to prevent accidental releases of all chemicals held in quantities over given thresholds.  The PSM program addresses all required elements including employee participation, process safety information and system drawings, operating procedures, hot work permits, management of change, mechanical integrity, training, pre-startup review, compliance audits, process hazard analysis, contractor safety, incident investigation and emergency response.  The system has many safety features built in including high and low level controls and alarms, high pressure shut downs, pressure relief valves, automatic and manually controlled valves, check valves, leak detectors and programmable logic control capabilities.\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\nPer the requirements of 40 CFR 68.42, facilities must include a five-year accident history for all accidental releases from covered processes that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.  There has been one such incident resulting in an injury to a contract employee at the facility in the past five years.\n\nEmergency Response\nThe Trident Seafoods North Naknek facility maintains a written emergency response plan per 29 CFR 1910.119 to facilitate safe response to accidental ammonia releases.  The plan identifies personnel designated and trained to conduct the necessary duties during a response.  Responsibilities include notification of and communication with local responders and authorities, coordinating and conducting responses, as well as maintenance of emergency equipment and trained personnel."
