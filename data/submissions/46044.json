The following is a brief narrative of the programs in place at the facility. The RMP includes prevention programs for safety information hazard analysis, SOPs training maintanance incident investigation and compilance audits. Safety information includes MSDS max inteended inventy,safe upper and lower parameters and equipment specifications and standards used to design, build and operate the process. The Haz. Anal. Progam includes identified hazards associated with the regulate substances, possible opportunities for releases. The SOPs covers allplant procedures. Traning of all employees at the plant is strictly enforced. All operators must have annual chlorine safety classes. The maintenance records and procedures are part of the plant SOP. Auburn has had no chemical release but an incident investigation program is in place. A compliance audit was done when the RMP was completed and have been done on schedule snice.AN EPA audit was done in February of 2004",

      "SummaryText": "The James E. Estes Water Treatment Plant is owned and operated by the city of Auburn Water Works Board. The facility is located at 1385 Binford Dr. in Auburn,Al. The parcel is desribed as being in the northeast 1/4 of section 5, township 18N Range 26E. The subject site consists of approx. 13 acres, bounded by residential property to the west, south and east. The Auburn 7.5 Minute Quadrangle Topographic Map, USGS 1983 shows the elvation at the site to be approx.600 feet above sea level. The surface water flow is in a souhtly direction towards a tributary of lake Wilmore. The plant treat water form Lake Olgetree for use as potable water for the city od Auburn, AL. Chlorine gas is used treat the water to reduce bacterial contamination. The chlorine gas process is isolated to reduce the probability of an incident and the operators are thoroughly trained in the handling of the one ton cylinders of chlorine. A review of the process indicated that the worst case secenario is the release of a one ton cylinder that is being place into service. The release would allow chlorine to migrate off site to the south southeast, along a natrual drainage fall line toward a residential area. The envelope of exsposure will be some 1.1 miles. The most likely alternative scenario is the release of a partally full cylinder, containing less the a ton of chlorine, with the flow pattern and traveling .42 miles. In both cases the emergency response involves the activation of the Emergency Response Program and the potential evacuation of the residents. The site has a prevention program in place that addresses the following program elements: Hazard review, SOP, Training, Maintenance, Incident Investigation and Compliance Auditing. These programs are used for the entire operation and for the specific use of chlorine. The site has had no incidents in the last five years and has an ERP that involves local public safety and HAZMAT teams. In the furture the site plans on removing chlorine gas and repl"
