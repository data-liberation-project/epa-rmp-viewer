Facility accident release and emergency response    policy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           The management and employees of Gateway FS, Inc.. are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Ferrin Fire Department, Clinton County Local Emergency Planning Committee or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n\n\n2. The stationary source and the regulated substances handled.\n\n\n\nThe primary activity at the facility, which is located at 12805 Ferrin Road, is the storage and distribution of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.  The storage and handling system consists of nurse tanks. Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.\n\n\n\nThe maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia that can be stored would be 14,000 pounds, this includes the amount of anhydrous ammonia that could be stored in three nurse tanks.\n\n\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations. This facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia,K6-11\", published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc as adopted by state regulation and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of A"

      "SummaryText": "nhydrous Ammonia\". Compliance with these regulations and on-going training of our employees make up accident release prevention program.\n\n\n\n4. Five year accident History\n\n\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\n\n-have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor\n\n-to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths,  injuries, evacuations, shelter in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n\n\n5. The emergency response program.\n\n\n\nThe facility has:\n\n-a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\n-provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\n\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving anhydrous ammonia, it is our policy to notify the Ferrin Fire Department and Clinton County LEPC and request that they respond to the emergency. Our emergency action plans have been coordinated with both the fire department and LEPC.\n\n\n\n6. Planned changes to improve safety.\n\n\n\nSafety Improvement is an on-going process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions. This site has no permanent storage capability for anhydrous ammonia and no hardware up-grades are necessary at this time. Upgrades to training and procedures that comply with OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations, 29 CFR 1910.119, will be implemented and recertification to an EPA RMP Program-3 Facility will be completed by the specified regulatory deadline."
