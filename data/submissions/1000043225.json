It is City of Bellingham's policy to manage the chlorine process \"using the highest standards for the protection of our people, our customers, the community, and the environment\" in order to ensure a safe and effective facility.\n\n\n\nRegulated Chemical\n\nThe Water Filtration Plant uses chlorine for disinfectant in the public water supply.  The amount of chlorine in the supply water is carefully controlled using computerized systems, which are continuously supervised and monitored by certified operators.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response\n\nThe toxicity of chlorine at high concentrations make it necessary for the City to observe certain safety precautions to prevent unnecessary human exposure, and reduce the threat to the personal health of our employees as well as nearby members of the community.  It is the City's policy to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle toxic chemicals including equipment design and safe handling procedures that are used to operate the equipment.  The City's release prevention program is based on four principles; inherently safe design, effective written procedures, training, and the goal of continuous improvement.  The chlorine storage and handing equipment meets or exceeds design codes and standards as well as incorporation of good engineering practices recommended by the Chlorine Institute.    Operating and maintenance personnel are thoroughly trained on proper procedures and safety hazards, and are provided with regular refresher training.\n\n\n\nThe City has developed a comprehensive Emergency Response Program.  In the event of an accidental release, the emergency response plan starts by notifying the Bellingham Fire Department.  Annual drills are conducted with the Bellingham Fire Department to review "
