We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n *  A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulation\n  *  An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\n *  A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule\n *  An overview of our emergency response program\n *  An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment\n *  The certifications required by EPA's RMP rule\n *  The detailed information (called data elements) about our risk management program\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nOur facility packages high purity laboratory, microelectronic, bulk pharmaceutical chemicals.  Our facility also accomplishes limited purification operations and some aqueous blending operations.  The Mallinckrodt Baker Facility consists of a single building situated on 70 acres. The building consists of 40,000 sq. ft. manufacturing, 50,000 sq. ft. lab and administration, and 200,000 sq. ft. warehousing.   In our processes, we use the following chemicals that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause off-site consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release:\n\nToxics\n\nChloroform:  Chloroform is brought to the facility in tankers in bulk form contain"

The chemical is distilled and/or subdivided into cycletainers, drums, and bottles.  Ethyl ether is then distributed for use in a laboratory setting. [Subject to Program Level 1.]\n \nOur accidental release prevention programs and our contingency planning efforts help us effectively manage the hazards that could potentially be posed to our employees, the public, and the environment if one of these were mishandled or otherwise involved in an accident.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nWe take a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of chemicals.  Our management systems address each of the key features of successful prevention programs including\n *  Process safety information\n *  Process hazard analysis\n *  Operating procedures\n *  Training\n *  Mechanical integrity\n *  Management of change\n *  Pre-startup review\n *  Compliance audits\n *  Incident investigation\n *  Employee participation\n *  Hot work permit\n *  Contractors\n\nAs part of our prevention efforts, we have implemented the follow"

Our company and employees are committed to the standard that these management systems set for the way we do business.  We have specific accountabilities and controls to ensure that we are meeting the highest standards for accident prevention.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nWe keep records of all significant accidental chemical releases that occur at our facility.  During the past five years there were no accidental chemical releases involving materials covered under the EPA's RMP rule that resulted in serious injuries, significant property damage, or environmental damage either on site or off site.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nWe maintain a site emergency response plan, which consolidates all of the various federal, state, and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning.  Our program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  To ensure the effectiveness or our emergency response plan, routine drills are conducted including testing emergency notice systems.  \n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPRO"
