Box 80\nGothenburg,  NE  69138\n\nFacility Policy:\n\nThe management and employees operating each of our facilities are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of hazardous material transported or stores on our locations.  In the event an accidental release should occur, we are prepared to work with our local fire company, Emergency Response Personnel and other appropriate authorities deemed applicable depending on the specific incident, to best mitigate any release and to minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\nFacility Information:\n\nThe primary activity of our company is NAICS code 422510, \u00bfEstablishments primarily engaged in operating country or terminal grain elevators\u00bf, however we are also engaged in providing \u00bfagricultural inputs\u00bf that include the receiving, storage, and reloading of Anhydrous Ammonia for delivery to farmers in our area.  The NAICS code we feel most applicable for receiving, storing and reloading is 493130 \u00bfFarm Product Warehousing and Storage\u00bf.  We include all crop protection and petroleum products in our planning, training, and maintenance programs, however only the Anhydrous Ammonia facilities will be include in this report. \n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application to farm fields during the spring months.  Anhydrous ammonia may also be applied in the fall during some years.  During the balance of the year little if any product transfer occurs.  This facility is used only as off season nurse tank storage.\n\nThe facility is operated on an \u00bfas needed\u00bf basis with staff present only during the receiving and reloading of product for delivery.  Total annual hours for these needs do not meet the 2,080 hour requirement to qualify as a \u00bffull time employee\u00bf on site, therefore, item number 1.11 is Zero.  Our facilities have adeq"

Time expended for these inspections is not included in our staffing calculation.\n\nWorst-case Release Scenario:\n\nThe \u00bfWorst Case Release Scenario\u00bf is considered to be the release of the total contents of our largest anhydrous ammonia tank.  The maximum quantity released is based on 85% of the capacity of the largest vessel on site as limited by design standards. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) miles is based on the EPA\u00bfs RMP-Comp Program (version 1.07).  Possible public and environmental receptors within the area have been provided to the Frontier County LEPC (Local Emergency Planning Committee) to assist them in planning for emergencies. \n\n\nAlternative Release Scenario:\n\nThere has not been an actual release of anhydrous ammonia during the last 5 years at the site.  We believe the most likely release would be caused by loss of contents from the liquid valve.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is rounded to 0.1 mile per instructions by EPA guidance.\n\nAccidental Release Program:\n\nOur anhydrous ammonia accidental release program is based on guidelines found in the American National Standards Institute, Inc. (ANSI) standard K-61.1 \u00bfSafety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\u00bf; and the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) standard 29CRF 1910.111 \u00bfStorage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\u00bf.  We conduct annual employee training on the safe handling, transportation and distribution of anhydrous ammonia and have installed safety equipment including, but not limited to:  Excess flow valves at rises; barriers to avoid damage by trucks or other vehicles; and lock outs to prevent tampering when the site is unattended.  We also maintain routine contact with our local fire department and emergency response personnel; and have provided and/or participated in safety training exercises on anhyd"
