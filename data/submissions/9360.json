Huntsman Marysville believes that the facility's use of propane will not be covered by the pending exemption and is thus registering its use now.\n \n3.  Offsite Consequence Analysis.\nThe RMP Rule requires that offsite consequence analysis (OCA) be performed to estimate the potential for an accidental release of a regulated substance to affect the public or the environment.  This OCA includes the development of worst and alternative release scenarios for the release of flammable substances.  The OCA allows for the consideration of administrative controls in estimating potential scenario impacts.  \n\nWorst Case Release Scenario\nThe worst case scenario, as based upon EPA-required assumptions, is highly unlikely, and has never occurred at this facility.\n\nThe worst case scenario associated with the release of a flammable substance is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE), involving the full inventory of the largest storage tank containing propylene.  The analysis assumes that the maximum possible inventory of 92,500 pounds is released, completely vaporizes and ignites, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  The VCE would reach offsite and may affect nearby public receptors.\n\nAlternative Case Release Scenarios  \nThe alternative case scenario for a flammable substance is a pipe failure from the first reactor, resulting in the release of 9,500 pounds of propylene.  This alternative case scenario does not have the potential to affect offsite receptors.  Emergency shutdown systems, fixed fire monitors, gas detectors, process interlocks, trained emergency response site personnel, and a process flare used for evacuating vessels are all a"

Huntsman Marysville believes that the software highly overstates the residential populations for both scenarios, given that there is only one residence near the facility.  In fact, the alternative case release scenario does not reach beyond Huntsman Marysville's property boundary.  The LandView III population estimates were included in the plan data because of the software's wide use in preparing Risk Management Plans.\n\n4. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps. \nFollowing is a brief summary of the elements that Huntsman's Marysville Site has implemented to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements outlined by EPA as well as with the Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) process safety management (PSM) standard.  \n\n7 Process Safety Information\n Huntsman's Marysville Site maintains a compilation of current and accurate written safety information to identify and understand the hazards of the process.  This includes information pertaining to:\n\n7 Hazards of regulated substances:  For each regulated substance, there is a Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) which discusses the physical properties of the chemicals, exposure hazards, the required personal protective equipment and the appropriate first aid and emergency treatment for exposure.\n\n7 The technology of the process:  Includes a discussion of process chemistry, safe upper and lower limits of temperature and pressure and analysis of consequences of deviation.\n\n7 Equipment in the process:  Includes such information as materials of construction, diagrams of the piping and instrumentation, safety systems and design codes.\n \n7 Process Hazard Analysis\n Huntsman's Marysville Si"

Huntsman Marysville has established a system to promptly address and resolve the incident report findings and recommendations and to document their resolution.  Finally, incident reports are reviewed with all affected personnel.\n \n7 Employee Participation\n Huntsman Marysville has developed a written action plan for employee participation in all aspects of its process safety management program.  Huntsman Marysville consults with employees on the conduct and development of PHA's and on the development of other elements of the process safety management program.  Huntsman Marysville ensures that all employees have access to PHA's and all other process safety management information.\n \n7 Hot Work Permit\n Huntsman Marysville employs a hot work permit program for hot work operations conducted on or near the covered process (hot work generally involves electric or gas welding, cutting, brazing or similar spark-producing operations).  If any hot work is performed near the covered process, Huntsman Marysville issues a permit that documents the fire prevention and protection requirements for the operation, the date authorized for hot work, and the object on which the work is performed.

Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies.  \nHuntsman Marysville is committed to providing a safe, healthy and environmentally conscious work place for its employees and neighbors.  This is exemplified by the Marysville Site's 10-1/2 year 0 accidental release history.   The Huntsman Marysville site maintains a working PSM program, which implements a series of steps to prevent potential hazards associated with the process and assures a well-trained work force.   The PSM program further implements its policies with onsite procedures and manuals.  Huntsman Marysville participates with community agencies to develop emergency response plans and participates in cooperative training with these agencies.  Since our first production of quality polypropylene resin for the automotive and other industries in October 1988 to our June 1996 certification to the International Standards Organization (ISO) 9002 quality management process and a September 1998 Automotive Industry's QS-9000 quality management system certification, the Marysville Site has been a quality producer and a Responsible Care Neighbor for over 10 years in Eastern Michigan.\n\nHuntsman's Marysville site is located in the southwestern corner of the City of Marysville, Michigan.  The site includes 58.6 acres, of which 20 acres have been developed.  The Marysville Site utilizes a continuous polymerization operation to convert pipeline-supplied propylene and ethylene into polypropylene pellets which molding companies then process into useful applications such as:  automotive trim, toys, medical containers, appliance parts, and other consumer products.  Propane is produced as a by-product of propylene purification.\n\n2.  Regulated Substances.\nHuntsman's Marysville Site has 2 regulated substances at the facility.  The two flammable substances are:\n\n7 Propylene - Used to produce synthetic polymer resins.\n  Propane - Used widely for home heating.\n\nNote:  H"
