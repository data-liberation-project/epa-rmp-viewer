Steels Corners Road\n\t\tStow, OH  44224-4921\nRMP Facility ID:\t100000197164\nSubmission Date:  June 16, 2023\n\nExecutive Summary\n\n\n1.\tAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nStruktol Company of America (\u0093Struktol\u0094) is strongly committed to the prevention of accidental releases of ethylenediamine and the safety of our employees.  We have a comprehensive release prevention program that covers release prevention and emergency response.  We have an active working relation with the Cuyahoga Falls Fire Department who provide us with the necessary expertise in both release cleanup and emergency response.\n\n2.\tStationary Source of the Regulated Substance\n\nThe ethylenediamine is stored in a 10,000 gallon stainless steel storage tank located outside and behind Building 1.  The tank is fully diked to prevent the release of material to the ground.  The tank is vented through a Tigg vapor capture device.  The maximum amount of ethylenediamine in the tank at any time is 70,000 pounds.\n\n3.\tWorst Case Release and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\n\tSee RMP section 2\n\n4.\tGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nOur facility has taken all necessary steps to comply with the EPA\u0092s accidental release requirements as set forth in 40 CFR part 68.  Struktol has conducted Process Hazard Analysis to identify and control any and all hazards of ethylenediamine.  We have written procedures for the unloading of the material.  All affected employees are trained in SOP for ethylenediamine\n\nPer RMP-07-01 Struktol will inspect the ethylenediamine tank, piping system and vent system on a five year period.  Maintenance checks are performed by qualified personnel.  Compliance checks are performed on a three year basis.\n\n5.\tFive Year Accident History\n\nStruktol had no reportable accidental releases in the last five years. Near miss incidents are documented and retained in the RMP folder by the Program Manager.\n\n6.\tEmergency Respo"

In the event of an accidental release, we will contact the local emergency response agencies and the public.  We also maintain the necessary required submissions of information with the Summit County LEPC and the Cuyahoga Falls Fire Department.\n\n\n\n\n\n7.\tPlanned Changes to improve Safety\n\n\tStruktol will continue to provide our employees with ongoing annual training to ensure they are current with all safety procedures for the handling and transfer of ethylenediamine and provide regular inspection and maintenance of all equipment.  Only authorized personnel will make any changes necessary if a non-compliance is identified."
