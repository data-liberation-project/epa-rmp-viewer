Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\nEquistar is committed to employee, public and environmental safety. This commitment is inherent to\r\na comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design,\r\ninstallation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the\r\nprocesses at Equistar. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases\r\nof regulated substances. Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, our trained emergency\r\nresponse personnel are stationed at the plant at all times to control and mitigate the effects of the\r\nrelease.\r\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\r\nEquistar's primary activity at the Matagorda site is the production of high density polyethylene. High\r\ndensity polyethylene is utilized in making a variety of plastic products such as grocery bags, plastic\r\ncups and plastic containers. We utilize four (4) regulated substances at Equistar:\r\n1)\tEthylene\r\n2)\tButene\r\n3)\tHydrogen\r\n4)\tTitanium tetrachloride.\r\n4. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention\r\nSteps\r\nEquistar has taken the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention\r\nrequirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68. This facility was designed and constructed in\r\naccordance with strict engineering standards and the facility is subject to the OSHA Process Safety\r\nManagement standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.\r\nThe following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program in place at\r\nEquistar.\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\nEquistar maintains a record of written safety information that describes the chemical hazards,\r\noperating parameters and equipment designs associated with the process.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis\r\nEquistar conducts studies to ensure that hazards associated with the proce"

The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with\r\nexpertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated on an as needed basis, but at a\r\nminimum every five years. Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely\r\nmanner.\r\nOperating Procedures\r\nFor the purposes of safely conducting operations activities, Equistar maintains written operating\r\nprocedures. These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal\r\noperations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown,\r\nand startup after a turnaround. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to\r\noperators involved with the processes.\r\nTraining\r\nEquistar has a training program in place to ensure that employees that are operating processes are\r\ncompetent in the operating procedures associated with these processes. New employees receive\r\nbasic training in process operations followed by on-the-job supervision until they are deemed\r\ncompetent to work independently. Refresher training is provided at least every three years and\r\nmore frequently as needed.\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\nEquistar carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper\r\nfunctions. Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels,\r\nstorage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and\r\npumps. Maintenance is carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance\r\npractices. Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed. Equipment\r\ndeficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\r\nManagement of Change\r\nWritten procedures are in place at Equistar to manage changes in process chemicals, te"

Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the\r\ncontractor is carried out. Equistar has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential\r\nhazards related the contractor's work and the processes. Contractors are also informed of the\r\nprocedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\r\nThe date of the last program review was June 25, 2020 and the date of the last field audit was December 1, 2020. The site's accidental release prevention program includes chemical specific prevention steps.\r\n5. Five-year Accident History\r\nThere have been no accidental releases of substances regulated by the RMP rule during the last five\r\nyears.\r\n6. Emergency Response Plan\r\nEquistar carries a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous\r\nmaterials. The plan includes many aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and\r\nmedical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public,\r\nas well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas. The facility's emergency response plan\r\nhas been coordinated with the Matagorda County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).\r\nTo ensure proper functioning, emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.\r\nIn addition, the plan is updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our process that\r\nwould require a modified emergency response.\r\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\r\nNewer technology gas detectors have been installed and are operational.  The gas detector system will be updated to automatically activate the deluge system in 2022."
