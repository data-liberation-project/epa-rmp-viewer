      "SummaryText": "Introduction and Policies\n\nAllison Gas Plant, owned and operated by Enbridge Pipelines (Texas Gathering), LP, is committed to the same quality of safety and environmental excellence that all other Enbridge assets promote.  This philosophy involves making each and every employee and contractor accountable for their own safety as well as that of the community around them.  As a company we follow a close adherence to all applicable federal, state, and local laws to ensure a safe and healthy environment for all.\n\nEmployees who enter the Allison Gas Plant complete a thorough training, both in the classroom and on-the-job, that enables them to address emergency issues as they arise.  This preparation includes standard operational, emergency operational, and release prevention training.  In addition, periodic refresher courses help to keep operators' problem solving abilities up to date and in sync with our recurring safety improvements.  Our regular internal audits provide an excellent checks and balances system for monitoring these high standards that we set.\n\nThe facility is a natural gas plant that stabilizes Natural Gas Liquids.   The plant  recieves, stores and introduces natural gas liquids (NGLs) into the pipeline for sale to wholesale markets.  Propane is used for refirgerant purposes only.  There are no threshold quantities of toxic substances present.  The facility consists of multiple small lube oil, waste oil, condensate and fuel tanks and their associated piping, valves, pumps, and compressors on site that support the plant as well as the NGL tanks.  The purpose of the Risk Management Plan (RMPlan) is to provide information about our operations at the facility, our programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, our emergency response plans in case an accidental release should occur, our 5-year accident history, and our planned changes to improve safety at the facility.  \n\nPrevention Program\n\nBelow is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at"

Because the processes at the facility are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Risk Management Program (RMP) and are also subject to the OSHA PSM, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\nEmployee Participation:  Active employee participation and involvement in the development and implementation of Allison Gas Plant's PSM program is an important step toward achieving the objective to prevent or minimize the consequences of catastrophic releases of toxic, reactive, flammable, or explosive chemicals.  Employee involvement will help to ensure that all perspectives regarding PSM are considered, and that the best ideas are implemented.  Open communications are encouraged between supervisors and employees regarding all safety and health issues.  Allison Gas Plant strongly promotes employee imvolvement in safety issues through existing programs.  These programs include Unit Safety Teams (which are made up of a cross section of employees and supervision), regularly scheduled safety meetings, tail-gate safety meetings, Hazard Communication, Safety Suggestion Forms, and special training programs (Emergency Response Training, First Aid, etc.). \n\nProcess Safety Information:  Complete and accurate written process safety information (PSI) concerning process chemicals, process technology, and process equipment is essential to an effective PSM and RMP program and to completing and maintaining a process hazard analysis (PHA).  The PSI will be useful to the operators; the team performing the PHA; those in charge of training; contractors; those conducting pre-startup safety reviews; and those in charge of updating the emergency preparedness plans.  Process safety information is readily available to all employees.  Allison Gas Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the process.  Thes"

Chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response / exposure treatment consideration, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA):  Allison Gas Plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.  The facility primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) and/or What-if/Checklist method analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.  Periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  \n\nOperating Procedures:  Allison Gas Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, normal shutdown, and initial startup of a new process.  These procedures provide guidance for experienced operators and also provide the basis for training new operators.  Operating procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The review and certification process involves both operators and technical staff.  \n\nTraining:  In addition to training on operating procedures, the facility has a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating the process.

This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years.  All of this training is documented for each operator including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.  \n\nContractors:  Allison Gas Plant uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the facility has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have appropriate skills, (3) are aware of the hazards of their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site specific safety rules, and (6) inform facility personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with orientation sessions pertaining to these key points.  \n\nPre-startup Safety Review (PSSR):  Allison Gas Plant conducts a PSSR on any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves as a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.  \n\nMechanical Integrity:  Allison Gas Plant has well established practices and procedures for maintaining process equipment.  The basic aspects of this program include (1) training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4"

In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.  \n\nSafe Work Practices:  Allison Gas Plant has long standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.  Examples of these include (1) control of the entry / presence / exit of support personnel, (2) lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous substances before process piping and equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e. hot work), and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.  These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.  \n\nManagement of Change:  Allison Gas Plant has a comprehensive system to manage changes to all covered processes.  This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to ensure that adequate controls have not been compromised by the changed.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.  \n\nIncident Investigation:  Allison Gas Plant promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in or reasonably could have resulted in a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to gather the facts, determine the root cause, and develop corrective action to prevent the reoccurrence of the in"
