For this purpose Tropicana has developed facility procedures that apply to both daily operations and emergency response situations, in the form of a Risk Management Program, developed and implemented specifically for the City of Industry facility.  The facility risk management program has been developed in accordance with both federal (EPA\u00bfs Risk Management Program, 40 CFR 68) and state (California`s Accidental Release Program, Title 19 CCR, Div.2, Ch. 4.5) requirements.  Tropicana has also submitted an in-depth description of the facility risk management program to the HAZMAT Unit of Los Angeles Fire Department (LEPC) , to ensure proper coordination of the facility program with the local emergency planning commission.\n\nTropicana Products, Inc. is a beverage production and packaging facility located in City of Industry, Los Angeles County, California.  The facility is situated on, approximately, 15 acres of property located between Orange Avenue and Sunset Avenue.  All utilities are provided by municipal sources, including water, sewer, electric, firefighting and police services.  The entire site consists of office space, production areas and storage areas (dry and cold), serving as a distribution center for Tropicana products throughout the West Coast region, employing a total staff of approximately 68 employees.  The plant was originally built in 1984 (under different ownership), with modifications completed in 1992. \n\nTropicana\u00bfs chilled juices require constant refrigeration to maintain their high quality and freshness.  Refrigeration at the facility is provided by an anhydrous ammonia system.  Ammonia, a regulated substance, is used instead of other refrigerants because ammonia has several advantages over the available alternatives.  Ammo"

These procedures include response as a stand-alone response unit (on-site personnel only), or in conjunction with off-site authorities.  The facility utilizes the Incident Command System for all response activities, as outlined in the current facility Emergency Response Plan.  On-site capabilities include responses to small (incipient) fires and non-consequential ammonia releases, such as normal operating losses and small, non-impacting sudden occurrences. \n\nTropicana has developed an Integrated Contingency Plan (ICP), detailing the facility\u00bfs emergency response capabilities, in a format the follows EPA\u00bfs (as NRT\u00bfs chair) Integrated Contingency Plan Guidance.  The ICP provides a single plan that insures emergency preparedness through logistical planning and coordination between facility personnel and local emergency response personnel.  The ICP provides basic facility information; contains essential response organization and procedures;  and, provides site specific supporting information such as drawings, detailed procedures, and incident history.   All aspects of Tropicana\u00bfs emergency response planning are developed in coordination with appropriate state and local agencies responsible for emergency response management.  Tropicana has made arrangements for coordination of emergency response activities with these agencies, as well as additional service organizations such as hospitals, health clinics, and pre-approved contractors.\n\nTropicana\u00bfs on-site Emergency Response (HAZMAT) Team, comprised of approximately 15  members, represents expertise in environmental operations, security, safety, and refrigeration.

Star status is only given to those facilities that consistently demonstrate excellence in safety and exceed regulatory requirements for maintaining a safe operation.\nAs a result of this status, Tropicana continually strives to maintain the highest quality safety program possible.  This includes evaluations of existing programs relative to any changes in facility operations, as well as recommendations that arise from incidents, such as injuries or near misses. \n\nTropicana has developed a safety issue tracking report to insure any safety issues identified as a result of daily operations, or scheduled inspection/walkthroughs, are properly addressed and resolved in a timely manner.  The report describes the corrective action required; lists the person responsible for completing the corrective action; identifies the source of the issue (walkthrough, inspection, safety meeting, etc.); and provides the actual or expected date of completion.  \n\nTropicana has, and will continue to be, an industry leader in assuring the proper and safe operation of its ammonia refrigeration system.  This leadership is exemplified by Tropicana employees at all organizational levels and is the basis for the company\u00bfs commitment to maintaining a comprehensive risk management program, minimizing the potential for accidental releases."
