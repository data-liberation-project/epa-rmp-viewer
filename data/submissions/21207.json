EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nStepan Company is committed to operating in a manner that is safe for Stepan Company's employees, the public, and the environment.  As part of this commitment, Stepan Company has established operations and management systems to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility.  One part of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage chemical risk at the Stepan Company's Winder facility and complies with the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Program Rule (RMP Rule).  One of the requirements associated with the RMP Rule is to submit a Risk Management Plan (RMPlan) describing the risk management program at Stepan Company's Winder Plant.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMPlan requirements associated with the RMP Rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at Stepan Company's Winder Plant.\n\n1.1 Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nStepan Company is committed to the safety of Stepan Company employees, public, and preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  Stepan Company implements controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances.  In the event of a chemical release, trained personnel will respond to control and contain such releases.  Stepan Company evaluates each situation, evacuates employees as necessary, and contacts the local fire department to control and contain the release to prevent and/or reduce the consequences of the release.  The Winder Plant will also contact the Barrow County Emergency Management Agency (EMA) and LEPC to assist with emergency management.  \n\nThe Winder facility conducts training and practice exercises on a regular basis to assure effectiveness in emergency response.  \n\n\n1.2 The Stepan Company an"

      "SummaryText": "d Regulated Substances\n\nStepan Company is a major manufacturer of specialty and intermediate chemicals used in a broad range of industries.  Stepan Company is a leading merchant producer of surfactants that are the key ingredients in consumer and industrial cleaning compounds. Stepan Company's Winder Plant handles two (2) substances regulated by the RMP rule in sufficient quantities to be covered by the regulation.  \n\nEthylene Oxide (EO) is delivered by rail car, stored on site, and used in the alkoxylation process.  The process is used to manufacture products that may be sold to customers, such as fabric softners and ag chemical emulisifiers.  Ethylene Oxide is classified as a toxic gas in the RMP Rule.\n\nPropylene Oxide (PO) is delivered by rail car, stored on site, and used in the alkoxylation process. The process is used to manufacture products that may be sold to customers, such as fabric softners and ag chemical emulisifiers.Propylene Oxide is classified as a toxic liquid in the RMP Rule.\n\n1.3 Offsite Consequence Analysis\n\nStepan Company's Winder Plant performed an Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA) to estimate the potential for an accidental release of the regulated substances and its effect on the public and environment.  The OCA consists of both Worse Case Scenarios (WCS) and Alternative Release Scenarios (ARS).  An ARS represents a release that might occur during the lifetime of a facility.  Both WCS's and ARS's help the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) improve the community emergency response plan.  The scenarios also assist the Winder Plant for emergency response pre-planning by identifying potentially impacted off-site areas.  The WCS and ARS are completed as defined in the RMP rule.\n\nThe main objective of performing the OCA is to determine the distance at which certain effects might occur off-site because of an accidental release.  Each regulated substance has an independent concentration to estimate the distance to the endpoint.  Endpoints hav"

The ARS scenario assumes a 5 minute release before the excess flow valve stops flow.  In addition to excess flow valve controls and immediate response by employees (such as tripping deluge system), area monitors have been installed to detect airborne concentrations of EO.  Video cameras monitor the rail car unloading area.  All railcar brakes are set and wheels chocked prior to unloading.  The estimated distance to the toxic endpoint is .7 miles. \n\nThe ARS for Propylene Oxide (PO) is the rupture of a 2-inch diameter transfer hose from the rail car to the storage tank(s). The hose fails due to movement of the railcar.  EO railcars are equipped with excess flow valves set to shut flow at 868 lb/minute.  Immediate shutoff will occur with a hose rupture.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) RMP regulation and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation regulate processes at Stepan Company's Winder facility.

It states:\n\nThe Winder Safety/Environmental Manager is responsible for defining, updating, implementing and auditing the Winder Process Safety Management Program (PSM). The PSM is managed by the Process Safety Management Team (PSM Team). Members and their responsibilities are as follows:\n\nSafety/Environmental Manager - PSM/RMP program Leader/coordinator\nProduction Manager - Operating procedures/operator training\nTechnical Manager - Engineering standards, Process safety information,  PHA coordinator, contractor program, Management of Change, Pre- startup safety reviews (PSSR)\nMaintenance Supervisor - PM programs, mechanical integrity\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nStepan Company's Winder Plant encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention, including team membership in process hazard analyses, team membership during pre-startup safety reviews, emergency response team participation and creating/updating operating procedures. \n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nStepan Company's Winder Plant maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for process parameters, chemical inventory, and equipment design information.  The facility management of change procedure (MOC) is used to maintain up to date information.  \n\nChemical specific information, including exposure hazards and treatment are provided in the material safety data sheets (MSDS).

The concentrations vary among the covered substances based on potential health effects upon exposure.  The endpoints have been defined in a manner that minimizes the potential for long term health effects if exposure to the concentration occurs.\n\nThe distances to endpoints are estimates using calculations and dispersion models as supplied by the EPA.\n\nThe RMP Rule requires regulated facilities to estimate the population within a circle with radius defined by the distance to endpoint from the release source.  The populations within the circles associated with WCS and ARS have been estimated using 1990 census data and the Landview III software.  \n\nWorse Case Release Scenario (WCS)\n\nThe WCS for toxic substances is a catastrophic failure of a rail car containing liquid Ethylene Oxide.  The maximum distance to the toxic endpoint concentration has been estimated at 7.4 miles.  \n\nSeveral communities are located within this distance from the rail car.  Several public gathering areas are also within this distance.   \n\nThe distance to endpoint associated with the WCS was calculated using EPA's Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA) Document and RMPcomp.  The document includes look-up tables that may be used to find the distance from a release point based on the release rate and the substances toxic endpoint.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario (ARS)\n\nAn Alternative Release Scenario is an event that is more likely to occur compared to the WCS.
