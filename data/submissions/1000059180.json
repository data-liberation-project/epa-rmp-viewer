The facility receives natural gas by pipeline, separates natural gas condensate, processes and stores natural gas liquids (NGL) and compresses the residue gas for sale. Western Operating Company (Western) has an ongoing commitment to safety and accident prevention. \n\n\n\nAlthough the plant is not manned by full-time, onsite personnel, critical process parameters are monitored and emergency shutdown (ESD) is enacted automatically, if necessary. Plant personnel are trained to respond to remote alarm conditions and are notified via a call-out system in the event of process faults. Various automatic process safeguards and interlocks are intended to preclude a release. If a release should occur, these systems allow an immediate remote response from trained operators as well as alerting other personnel to the need for an onsite response.\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nThe Wiggins Gas Plant is located just north of Interstate 76, approximately 4 miles east of Wiggins, Colorado. Western personnel visit the facility approximately every other day, for monitoring and routine maintenance.\n\n\n\nThe Wiggins Gas Plant consists of a single process to remove NGL from up to 3.0 MMscf/day of raw gas per day using Propac units, and the plant produces up to 5,000 gallons/day of NGL, although it recently has operated at much lower rates.  The NGL is a flammable mixture consisting of several regulated flammable substances, including methane, ethane, propane, butane, isobutane, isopentane and pentane. Included with the regulated flammables in the NGL are additional flammables in the C-6 through C-8 range. The flammable gas mixture is stored near the south end of the facility in pressure vessels at ambient temperatures and at approxim"

There are no regulated toxic materials.\n\n\n\nBecause the Wiggins Gas Plant does not meet the eligibility requirements for either RMP Program Level 1 (because it could impact a public receptor) or Program Level 3 (because it is not in one of the specifically designated NAICS codes and is not covered by 29 CFR 1910.119 because it is a normally unoccupied remote facility), it was determined to be a RMP Program Level 2 process.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM (Level 2)\n\n\n\nSafety Information:  The plant has material safety data sheets for the regulated and other chemicals; established maximum intended inventories for regulated substances; established safe upper and lower limits for process parameters; information on equipment specifications, codes, standards, and recognized and generally accepted good engineering practices employed; and established a management of change (MOC) program that includes updating the safety information when changes occur.  Although it is not required, the plant also has piping and instrumentation diagrams for the covered process.\n\n\n\nHazard Review:  An initial hazard review has been performed by facility and consultant personnel to identify hazards associated with the process; possible equipment malfunctions or human errors; applicable safeguards; and steps used or needed to detect or monitor releases, using the HAZOP technique.  The hazard identification included the following potential items: fire, explosion, overpressurization, corrosion, overfilling, equipment failure, and loss of plant utilities. Following the initial hazard review, periodic updates at least every 5 years and before any major process change will be conducted.\n\n\n\nVarious process controls are in place to regulate the process and prevent any unplanned events. The process equipment includes various vents, relief valves, check valves, manual "

There are lower explosive limit detectors and fire-eye sensors in the process and compression areas, both of which are tied into the emergency shutdown system. There is an onsite vent for emergency vapor release only. Unexpected excess vapor can be relieved through safety relief valves. Alarm systems continuously monitor the process. The monitoring information can be accessed onsite, with operational status information available remotely. Emergencies and shutdown conditions are relayed to operators and supervisors via a call-out system. \n\n\n\nOperating Procedures:  The plant has developed operating procedures for all covered equipment addressing the various phases of operation.  Consequences of deviation and steps required to correct or avoid deviations are addressed in individual procedures as well as the safe limits tables developed (discussed under Safety Information above).  Equipment inspections are performed by operations personnel following various maintenance procedures and checklists.  The plant has established an MOC program that includes updating the operating procedures when changes occur.\n\n\n\nTraining: Operators have written instructions for normal operations and emergency responses. These instructions include normal and emergency startup and shutdown as well as a variety of special procedures for restarting and adjusting various components of the process. Training is typically conducted through on-the-job education and guidance, and is verified by a combination of documented experience, observation/demonstration, and oral testing.  The plant has an MOC program that includes training operators prior to startup of changes to the process.\n\n\n\nMaintenance:  The plant has maintenance procedures and uses vendor procedures, trains employees on maintenance procedures they perform, ensures that contract maintenance employees are trained for the tasks they"

The audits and reports met applicable requirements and have been certified, and the recommendations addressed by plant and company personnel.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation: Incidents that result in, or could reasonably have resulted in, a catastrophic release of a regulated substance are documented and investigated. Investigations begin within 48 hours of the release, and a written report that includes dates, a description, contributing factors, and recommendations for corrective actions are prepared. Recommendations will be promptly addressed and resolved, and resolutions documented.  The findings will be discussed with affected personnel, and reports will be retained for a minimum of 5 years.
