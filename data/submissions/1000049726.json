Proc/Rec Plant\n\nEPA FACILITY ID #: 1000 0010 9367\n\n\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY  OCEAN SPRAY CRANBERRIES, INC.\n\n\n\nOcean Spray Cranberries, Incorporated (Ocean Spray) located in Wisconsin Rapids, Wisconsin processes cranberries into juice concentrate and sweetened dried products. The facility utilizes anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant to maintain the proper temperature of all the products within the facility. Anhydrous ammonia is an effective refrigerant that has been used for many years by most food processing facilities.  Ammonia is normally a gas at ambient temperatures but is handled as a gas liquefied under pressure.  The ammonia refrigeration system at the facility includes a pilot receiver, evaporators, compressors, piping, and valves. The entire system contains approximately 22,000 lbs of ammonia. \n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies: \n\n\n\nOcean Spray is committed to promoting safety for the plant, its employees and surrounding area.  The facility is complying with OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard (PSM), Title 29 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 1910.119, and EPA's Risk Management Plan (RMP), Title 40 CFR Part 68 to deal with the risks involved with the storage, handling, and processing of hazardous chemicals. In this way we promote overall plant, worker, and public safety. These programs enable the facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents. Overall, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid physical property damage. The purpose of these programs is to ensure that the refrigeration system is operated safely in order to prevent releases of ammonia from the system. In addition, these programs serve to develop procedures to minimize releases in the event that they do occur and to outline appropriate emergency respo"

The RMP and PSM rules require facilities to address only those processes that contain over the 10,000 pound threshold of ammonia unless a release of one process could result in a release from the other, or an external event to the processes (such as a fire or explosion) could have the potential to release ammonia from multiple containers.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps: \n\nAs a part of its PSM Program, Ocean Spray has established numerous programs that serve to prevent accidental releases of ammonia. The programs include:\n\nProcess Safety Information  \n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nTraining\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nManagement of Change\n\nPre-startup Review\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nIncident Investigations\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nHot Work Permits\n\nContractor Safety\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Information: \n\nAs a part of the PSM Program, the facility maintains an Emergency Response Plan that was prepared based on the OSHA requirements for Emergency Action Plans (29 CFR 1910.38 and 1910.119. In the event of an emergency involving the ammonia system, it is the policy of the facility to request assistance as necessary by calling 911 to notify the Wisconsin Rapids Fire Department who are trained for emergencies involving the release of ammonia. The Wisconsin Rapids Fire Department is familiar with the Ocean Spray facility and ammonia system. The Wood County Local Emergency Response Committee has included the Ocean Spray facility in its local emergency response planning.\n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History: \n\nIn the past five years there have been no reportable ammonia releases that have resulted in off-site injuries, death, environmental damage or external evacuations.\n\n\n\nThe facility will continue to operate and maintain the ammonia systems in accordance with appropriate"
