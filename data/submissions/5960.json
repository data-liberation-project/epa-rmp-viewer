This commitment is demonstrated by Dow's comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at the Dow site in Pittsburg, California.  It is Dow's policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. Dow is also committed to responding to emergencies resulting from accidental releases in order to mitigate the release and any associated consequences.\n\n\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nThe primary activity at Dow's Pittsburg site is agricultural chemical manufacturing.  Dow has 6 regulated substances present at the Pittsburg site.  These substances include: 1,3-Butadiene, ammonia (aqueous), chlorine, hydrogen chloride (anhydrous), hydrogen fluoride (anhydrous), and sulfur dioxide (anhydrous).  1,3-Butadiene is used in making emulsion polymers.  Ammonia (aqueous) is used to make an agricultural herbicidal intermediate.  Chlorine is used for water treatment and in making intermediate and finished products for agricultural applications.  Hydrogen chloride is made as a co-product of some of the agricultural product manufacturing processes.  Hydrogen fluoride and sulfur dioxide (anhydrous) are used to make agricultural products and intermediates.\n\n\n3.\tThe Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures\nTo evaluate the worst case scenarios, Dow has used the EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equations.  For alternative release scenario analyses Dow has used PHAST 5.01.  The following paragraphs provide details of the results of"

Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L of ammonia (concentration 20% or greater) would be 0.04 miles.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for the only Program 3 flammable substance on site involves an unlikely catastrophic release from the 540 Block.  In this scenario 180,000 lb. of 1,3-Butadiene would be released from a rupture of an unloading hose at the rail tank car unloading process. It is assumed that the entire quantity is released as a vapor, which finds an ignition source, with 10 percent of the released quantity participating in a vapor cloud explosion.  Under worst case weather conditions, the calculated distance of 0.45 miles is obtained corresponding to an endpoint of 1 psi overpressure.\n\nThe alternative release scenario submitted for the only Program 3 flammable substance on site involves an unlikely release from the 540 Block.  The release is assumed to result in a Vapor Cloud Fire.  The scenario involves the release of 24,850 lb. of 1,3-Butadiene in 10 minutes.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the flammable endpoint of 5 kw/m2 is 0.04 miles.\n\n4.\tThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program\nThe Dow Pittsburg site has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  The Dow Pittsburg site was designed and constructed in accordance with Dow Loss Prevention Principles and Dow Engineering Standards.    The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at the Dow site.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nDow maintains detailed records of safety information that describe the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.

The methodology used to carry out these analyses includes: Checklist, HAZOP, Dow Fire and Explosion Index, Dow Chemical Exposure Index, Reactive Chemical/Process Hazard Analysis, New Process Safety Subject Matter Expert Reviews, and project safety and loss prevention reviews.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated on a regular basis.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis where a response is required are addressed in a timely manner.  The most recent PHA/update was performed on November 9, 1998.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within Dow's covered processes, Dow maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nDow has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every three years and more frequently if needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nDow carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others: pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Qual"

These personnel are also offered specialized training as needed. The most recent review/revision of maintenance procedures was performed on May 10, 1999. Any equipment deficiencies identified by these maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at Dow to safely manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures. Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at Dow.  The most recent review was performed on April 1, 1999.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nDow conducts compliance audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  The most recent compliance audit was conducted on November 9, 1998.  These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\nDow promptly and carefully investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation\nDow truly believes that process safety management and accident pre"

The site has safety teams, which involve employees as leaders in facilitating team efforts. In addition, Dow employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses in particular. Safe job performance is required for each of the jobs at Dow's Pittsburg site.\n\nContractors\nOn occasion, Dow hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance, construction and various other activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out. Dow has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related the contractor's work and the processes.  Contractors are also required to inform Dow of any hazards they may introduce at the site. Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\n\n\n5.\tFive-year Accident History\nDow has enjoyed an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years.  Due to Dow's stringent release prevention policies, the number of accidental releases has been reduced to rates lower than the overall chemical manufacturing industry.\n\nThere have been 4 accidental releases as defined by the RMP rule of regulated substances from the Dow site within the last 5 years.  The first release took place on 02/27/1995 and involved less than 1 lb. of hydrogen fluoride (anhydrous).  No offsite deaths or injuries occurred as a result of this accident.  Onsite, there was one minor injury.  \n\nAnother release, of 151 lb. of hydrogen chloride (anhydrous) and 344 lb. of chlorine, occurred on 10/19/1995. The community was alerted as a precaution. No offsite deaths or injuries occurred as a result of this accident.  Onsit"

The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, Dow emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within Dow's processes that would require a modified emergency response.\n\nCalifornia Region II LEPC is the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) with which the emergency plan for the Dow Pittsburg site has been coordinated and verified. Dow also coordinates our response plans and actions with local agencies and industrial mutual aid groups, which provide Dow with additional emergency response capability.\n\n\n7.\tPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nSeveral developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of Dow's accidental release prevention program.  Development of the Environmental, Health and Safety Work Process along with our Environmental, Health and Safety 2005 company-wide goals are some of the major steps Dow has taken to improve safety at the Pittsburg site. Additionally, we plan to continue to evaluate options for reducing the duration of accidental releases that may occur, and to improve our crisis response tra"
