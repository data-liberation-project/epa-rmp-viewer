The corporate core values championed by our President, embraced by our Senior Leadership Team, encouraged by our Managers/Supervisors and pledged to our associates are: a) Caring Relationships, b) Entrepreneurial Spirit, c) Strategic Foresight, and d) High Performance. These 4 core values support our Safety and Health philosophy and management efforts. Interpersonal communications, problem solving, planning and safety achievement have a direct relationship with the core values when applied to safety training, hazard assessment/investigation, post-accident/incident recovery and generating solutions to potential risk exposures. U.S. Venture integrates Safety expectations as a part of Manager/Supervisors' responsibilities in order to create a meaningful daily presence during all work activity. All departments at the corporate level including Risk Management, Legal, Human Resources, Finance and Operations reinforce strategic safety planning and solid operation level decision-making that will reduce risk exposures.\r\n\r\nThe facility is located on a 35-acre site in Green Bay, Wisconsin on the west shore of the Fox River and also located along the east and west side of North Broadway Avenue.  The property is located in an industrial/commercial portion of the City of Green Bay.  Adjacent properties include Wolf Oil Company's bulk plant and office, the Buckeye terminal, Canadian National rail yard and engine house, and US Specialty Cheese, Inc.  Petroleum products including gasoline and diesel are received by West Shore Pipeline, truck, vessel, and/or rail while denatured ethanol is received by truck. The products are stored at the terminal, and shipped out by truck, vessel, or rail.  In addition, biodiesel and other non-petroleum oils are stored onsite and are received"

Finally, butane is delivered to the facility by railcar on the west side of North Broadway Avenue and by truck transports on the east side of North Broadway Avenue to four 30,000 gallon pressure vessels, which is then transferred via piping and associated equipment onsite and blended into gasoline.  The quantity of butane that is stored onsite exceeds the 10,000 pound threshold quantity, thus subjecting the facility to RMP requirements.\r\n\r\nThe U.S. Oil Fox River Terminal regulated butane process complies with National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) 58 for Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) Storage and Handling, and it is the facility's policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws/codes including Wisconsin Department of Safety and Professional Services (DSPS), Code for LPG System requirements, OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) rule, and DOT's Hazardous Materials regulations.  The Wisconsin DSPS has approved the installation of the system.\r\n \r\nIf a fire emergency were to occur, it is the facility's policy to notify the Green Bay Metro Fire Department, (distance to closest fire station from terminal is 1.4 miles by road), as well as Brown County Emergency Management, as necessary, with whom the facility emergency response plans have been coordinated. In the event of an accidental release of butane at the U.S. Oil Fox River Terminal butane system, Terminal Emergency Response Personnel have been trained to immediately activate an emergency shutdown device (ESD) at one of five locations depending on location of the release.\r\n\r\nWhen an ESD is activated and the alarm is not acknowledged within 20 seconds, CEC (Terminal Security Company) will be notified and a representative will call the terminal phone in response to confirm whether there is an actual emergency.  If there is no answer at the terminal to confirm whether help is needed, CEC will contact the terminal's on-call number.  CEC will continue calli"

During an emergency, the notification system can be used to communicate critical information including security threats, fires, and chemical releases to local Green Bay businesses, the Green Bay Metro Fire Department, and Brown County Emergency Management.\r\n\r\nThe SmartNotice service will be capable of reaching out to people in minutes.  During an emergency situation, facility trained personnel will be able to send out a notification from the web or call a 24/7 phone number staffed by Emergency Communications Network (ECN), the provider of SmartNotice, who will facilitate sending out the message on U.S. Oil's behalf.  Notifications can be sent via email, text, and/or phone depending on each individual preference."
