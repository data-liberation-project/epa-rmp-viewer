These standards include national codes and standards, quality assurance inspections, over pressure protection systems, toxic gas detectors, emergency shutdown systems, a fire water system, and computer controls for the processes.  Every individual in the facility receives training commensurate with their job responsibilities.  Training may consist of an overview of the plant safety signals given to visitors, a process and hazards overview for contractors before they begin working in a unit, or job-related training and testing for an operator or supervisor prior to assuming their duties. Training is an ongoing process that includes periodic retraining, as necessary.  Safety, environmental, operating, and training procedures are subject to periodic reviews and updates, as appropriate.  Additional systems are in place to review proposed changes and assure that any new training requirements are met.  Another system assures a detailed review for hazards in each operating unit on a prescribed frequency.  Training and updating procedures are monitored with multiple systems.  \r\n\r\nThe La Porte facility has a comprehensive maintenance and inspection program that minimize the possibility of equipment or piping failures.  Routine inspections of equipment are done in the same manner as the initial quality assurance inspections completed prior to installation.  Equipment inspections utilize procedures such as proof testing, where safeguard systems are forced to function in a controlled manner.  This assures that the safeguards will function if they are ever needed.  Preventive and predictive maintenance programs are utilized including, vibration monitoring, infrared imaging, inspections by insurance specialists and root-cause analysis procedures.  Piping is inspected and tested according to best management practices prior to installation. The piping is monitored by methods such as visual inspections by the operators or maintenance personnel, emissions monitoring and thick"
