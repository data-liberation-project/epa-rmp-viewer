Blytheville facility was previously operated as a manufacturer of nitrogenous fertilizers. On May 27, 2004, the manufacturing plants were permanently shut down and the facility converted to a Terminal operation for storage, loading, and unloading of nitrogenous fertilizers from other locations. Although Terra Nitrogen, L.P. has recently changed status from a manufacturing plant to a terminal, the facility (including the barge loading/unloading dock) has been in operation since 1965.\n\nIt is Terra Nitrogen's policy to prevent accidental releases from the terminal by effective process safety management (PSM) programs and procedures. Terra requires participation by terminal employees in every element of the PSM program.\n\nOne way Terra prevents incidents is by conducting regular analysis of process hazards utilizing current operating and accurate process safety information. The operations personnel draft and maintain current operating procedures. Terra provides timely and comprehensive training for all employees involved in operating and maintaining process equipment. It is our policy to oversee the activities of contractors and ensure that they are trained to perform their jobs safely. We follow established pre-startup safety reviews and management of change procedures to ensure that modifications are adequately evaluated for safety and administer a comprehensive mechanical integrity program to ensure that process equipment is maintained in accordance with good engineering practice and accepted industry standards. We immediately investigate incidents when they do occur so that we promptly correct deficiencies and learn from the experience.\n\nIt is our policy to maintain a current and accurate written emergency response plan and a well-trained and equipped onsite emergency response team. We also maintain a system to notify neigh"

On a regular basis, we audit the PSM program to verify that elements, procedures, and systems are in place and adequate.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program:\nThe Blytheville Terminal has a comprehensive Process Safety Management (PSM) Program and is subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's standard for process safety management of highly hazardous chemicals found at 29 CFR Part 1910.779. Key elements of the PSM program include: 1) stringent design standards of equipment which incorporate substantial safety factors and include state of the art monitoring and control instrumentation; 2) extensive process safety information that is accurate and up to date; 3) well trained operating, maintenance, and contract personnel; 4) written operating, maintenance, and safe work procedures; 5) mechanical integrity procedures for process equipment inspections and quality control; 6) management of change and pre-startup safety review procedures; 7) periodic, detailed evaluation of the process area by a team utilizing HazOp methodology; and 8) regular audits of the PSM program; and 9) employee participation in every element of the PSM program.\n\nFive Year Accident History:\nThere have been no accidental releases from covered processes at the Blytheville facility within the past five years that resulted in deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\nEmergency Response Team:\nThe Blytheville facility also has a comprehensive Emergency Response Program which includes a written plan that is coordinated with local authorities, an onsite emergency response team, an emergency notification system that utilizes both a terminal area alarm, and the Community Alert Network telephone system.
