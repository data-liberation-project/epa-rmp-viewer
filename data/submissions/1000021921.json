These safeguards include continuous and emergency engine room ventilation, failsafe controls that shut down the compressors if operating limits are exceeded, the capability of shutting the entire system down if required and computerized PLC controls.  Ammonia detection units are installed throughout the facility to notify employees in the event of an ammonia release.  Administrative controls are in place limiting the utilization of vessels to less than their maximum intended capacities.\n\n\n\nThe company has also developed an emergency response plan that includes: procedures for notifying public and local emergency responders; emergency response duties by trained refrigeration personnel; emergency evacuation of personnel; use of emergency alarms and equipment; employee training in evacuation and response procedures; and periodic review and updating of the written plan. \n\n",

The facility utilizes anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant for ice manufacturing and storage. \n\n\n\nThe facility has two refrigeration systems, each utilizing a standard closed-loop design consisting of compressors, condensers, thermosyphon vessels, high-pressure and low-pressure ammonia storage vessels, ice makers, and freezer vaults. The systems have numerous protective controls including motor overload, high and low temperature and pressure, low oil pressure, high and low liquid level cutouts, and pressure relief valves on all equipment. Ammonia detectors and alarms are installed throughout the plant.\n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammonia, when properly used, has proven to be a safe and reliable refrigerant. The sharp odor of ammonia provides its own warning agent. Practically all accidents involving anhydrous ammonia can be avoided through the facility's program of proper training; knowledge of the equipment and procedures; and conducting preventive maintenance on all ammonia equipment. Reddy Ice has instituted administrative and engineering controls as well as training programs on the corporate level to prevent such accidents.\n\n\n\nThe facility has multiple safeguards pertinent to the anhydrous ammonia process. These include an ammonia detection and alarm system, exhaust purge fans, controls which shut down the compressors if operating limits are exceeded, and the capability of shutting the entire system down if required. Administrative controls are in place limiting the utilization of vessels to less than their intended maximum capacities.\n\n\n\nThe company has also developed an emergency response plan (ERP) that includes: procedures for notification of emergency authorities/agencies and the public; evacuation of personnel; emergency response duties or first responder duties by trained refrigeration personnel with fire department backup; use of emergency alarm"

This accident prevention program is a way to make safe operations and accident prevention systematic throughout the facility. Reddy Ice corporate management and Reddy Ice-Phoenix management are committed to operating a safe and compliant facility for the protection of its employees, the public, and the environment. A Combined Process Safety Management/Risk Management (PSM/RM) Program has been developed to meet the accidental release prevention requirements of both EPA's Risk Management Program (40 CFR Part 68) and OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard (29 CFR 1910.119) under the Clean Air Act. The Combined PSM/RM Program contains thirteen elements, establishing requirements for employee participation, safety information, hazard analysis, pre-startup safety review, standard operating procedures, employee training, management of change, mechanical integrity/preventive maintenance, hot work permits, contractor qualifications, release incident investigation, compliance audits, and trade secrets. These elements are tied together by a management system to ensure plant-wide development, implementation and integration of all the Program requirements.\n\n\n\nMANAGEMENT SYSTEM\n\nA management system has been developed to oversee the implementation of the PSM/RM Program elements.

The OCAs describe the potential offsite exposure to surrounding areas from an accidental release. A worst-case release scenario and alternative release scenarios from the facility, company, and industry history were studied and calculated using the EPA RMP*Comp modeling program, and the potentially affected offsite population and facilities were identified.\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe Reddy Ice-Phoenix facility has not had any releases that would require reporting as part of a five-year accident history.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY PLANNING AND RESPONSE\n\nThe Reddy Ice-Phoenix facility operates under an Emergency Response Plan (ERP) that includes procedures for: notifying plant personnel, the public, and local emergency responders; emergency evacuation/response procedures; use of emergency alarms and equipment; employee training in evacuation and response procedures; first aid for ammonia exposure; and periodic review and updating of the ERP. The plan is reviewed regularly for verification of data, and revised and updated as necessary to reflect changes in facility operations and personnel.\n\n\n\nAs required, the facility has coordinated emergency response activities with the Maricopa County Department of Emergency Management and the Phoenix Fire Department, and has appropriate mechanisms in place to notify emergency responders if needed. The ammonia inventory is verified and reported annually to state and local authorities as required under EPCRA, and the plant is incorporated into the community emergency response plan developed under 42 USC.\n\n\n\nPLANN"
