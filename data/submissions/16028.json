This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities encompass production of liquid starter fertilizer 10-34-0, 7-21-7, 4-10-10 and  9-18-9.  We have one regulated substances present at our facility.  This substance is Ammonia (anhydrous), which is involved in two uses.  Ammonia is used to control the pH and also to react with phosphoric acid, ammonium nitrate, and other raw materials to produce fertilizer.\n\n\n3.\tThe Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equations.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from Ammonia (Anhydrous).  In this scenario 41571 lb. of Ammonia.  Toxic liquid is assumed to be immediately released to form a pool height of three inches, from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to evaporate over 10 minutes.  The released quantity has been limited to 80% of the maximum capacity of the source by a system of administrative controls.  Passive mitigation systems such as dike(s) and Low"

At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 2.6 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Ammonia (anhydrous) involves a release from the V-655 NH3 Vap/Liq Separating Tank in the Anhydrous Ammonia process piping.  The scenario involves the release of 357.50 lb. of Ammonia in a gaseous form over 5 minutes.  Toxic liquid is assumed to be released to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated after 5 minutes.  Passive mitigation controls such as operator on duty watching area are taken into account to calculate the scenario. The release is also assumed to be controlled by control valve maximum flow is set at 71.5 lb/minute.  These active mitigation systems have the effect of reducing the amount of toxic liquid releasing.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L of Ammonia (anhydrous) is 0.19 miles.\n\n4.\tThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1967 Edition.    The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nNutra-Flo Floyd Facility maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.
