Emergency Response Program\n\nFMC's emergency response program includes a general plantwide program to be implemented in the event of an emergency as well as specific response scenarios for methyl chloride. In the event of an emergency which could affect the community, FMC has worked with Bessemer City and Gaston County emergency responders to develop a plan to protect public safety and advise our neighbors. Table top and full scale drills have been conducted with emergency responders and the community.\n\nVI. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nFMC continues to review and update procedues, programs, and hazard analyses to identify addtional measures to make our processes safer."

Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nFMC Corporation's Lithium Division facility in Bessemer City, North Carolina (\"FMC\") is committed to\nconducting its business in a manner that protects the safety and health of its employees, contractors,\nand neighbors.  This committment is demonstrated in the resources invested in accident prevention,\ntraining, and the highest regard for safety throughout facility design, installation, operation and maintenance.  Our policy is to implement effective controls to prevent releases of regulated substances.   Trained emergency response personnel work with local response agencies to control emergencies and protect public safety.\n\nII. Source Description and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe FMC Bessemer City facility manufacturers and processes organic and inorganic lithium compounds.  Methyl chloride, an RMP regulated substance, is used as a reactant to manufacture methyllithium / methyl grignards.  While methyl chloride is a gas at ambient conditions, it is shipped and handled as a compressed liquid.  Methyl chloride is considered toxic at concentrations of 400 ppm (0.04% in air) or greater and is flammable. Up to 30,000 pounds of methyl chloride may be stored at the facility.\n\nIII. Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nExtensive process safety analyses have been conducted to identify potential hazards in the methyllithium / methyl grignard process and mechanisms to prevent releases have been implemented.  Experts have been consulted and used in the design of FMC's methyllithium / methyl grignard process to ensure that process safety systems protect our employees and neighbors.  Operating procedures have been developed, reviewed and operators are trained on routine operations as well as process startup, shutdown, and safety and emergency systems.   Methyl chloride is only stored at FMC when"
