              "Description": "    Prevention of a release is a core component of the Merchants Ice & Cold Storage Company Risk Management Program.  This program is designed to insure proper work practices and an on-going mechanical integrity program.  The primary methods used by this facility are a part of the Process Safety Management Program as follows:\n    A.  Written Plan of Action - Process Safety Information.\n    This part of the program is one of the most involved and included the development of a written plan of action regarding the implementation of employee participation in the program.  In accordance with a specific schedule outlined by the standard, as per 29 CFR 1910.119, Merchants Ice & Cold Storage Company has completed a compilation of written process safety information concerning the process and operations involved with Anhydrous Ammonia of these standards of operating procedures.  For purposes of defining a process covered under this program, the use of Anhydrous Ammonia in refrigeration system has been considered \"a process,\" whereas a production or usage system/function is considered an \"operation.\"   By identifying each functional operation, a team was able to ascertain the potential and develop preparation plans in the case of a release.  This compilation of information is to enable Merchants Ice & Cold Storage Company and the employees involved in the operations related to Anhydrous Ammonia to identify and understand the hazards posed by these processes.  This process safety information includes information pertaining to the toxicological and physical hazards of the chemical listed.\n    B.  Hazard Analyses/Abatement Schedule.\n    This analysis is the heart of Merchants Ice & Cold Storage Company's process safety management or Risk Management release prevention program.  The safety and health staff, engineering and maintenance personnel, and certain operational personnel performed an initial process hazard analysis (hazard evaluation) on each operation within the Anhydrous Ammonia process.  The analysis was completed by a team with expertise in the operations.  The team included employees who have experience and knowledge specific to the operations of handling and using the chemicals at each of the process operations.  A system was developed and is maintained to promptly address the team's findings and recommendations by the formation of a PSM/RMP committee.  Also, a written schedule of when these actions were to be completed has been developed, indicating by whom and when.  The hazard analyses will be updated as needed and at least every five (5) years.\n    This analyses involved a review of each operation of the process to address steps for each operating phase, operating limits, safety and health considerations, and safety systems and their functions.  The assessment also included information concerning the emergency action plans related to the process; development and implementation of safe work practices also in regards to the control of entrance and exit of personnel in the process areas; pre-startup safety; mechanical integrity of equipment; inspection and testing, correction of deficiencies in equipment, planned or unexpected changes to the process, equipment, and procedures to the processes.\n    C.  Written Operating Procedure.\n    Merchants Ice & Cold Storage Company has developed and implemented written operating procedures to provide clear instructions for safely conducting activities involved in the processes at each operation by our employees, consistent with the process safety information and to address steps for each handling phase, limitations, safety and health considerations, and safety systems and their functions.  Other written documentation of standard operating procedures as a part of this program is included in the following documents:\nMechanical Integrity Study of Process Equipment\nPreventive Maintenance Program\nWritten Emergency Response Plan\nEmployee Emergency Action and Evacuation Plan\n    D.  Training.\n    Process Safety Management\n    Each employee involved in operations within the process where Anhydrous Ammonia is received, processed, or used at the facility has been trained in an overview of the process and in the operating procedures as outlined by 29 CFR 1910.119.  Refresher training is provided no less than every three years and more often if necessary.  Training includes:\n    a.  Emphasis on the specific safety and health hazards;\n    b.  Emergency operations in the case of a release including shutdown; and\nc. Safe work practices applicable to the employee's job tasks.\nMechanical Integrity\nAlso, each maintenance person who has responsibilities to perform maintenance on the process components receives training on an as needed basis, but no less than every three years.\nEmergency Response\nA team of individuals has been trained and is equipped as a HAZMAT team.  The team is equipped with Self-Contained Breathing Apparatuses, Level A suits and monitoring equipment to respond in an offensive manner.\n    A record of the training, which contains the identity of the employee, the date of training, and the means, used to verify that the employee understood the training is completed and maintained.\nAlso, offensive level HAZMAT emergency response support is provided by the local fire station.  Their response time for emergencies at the facility is approximately five minutes.\n    E. Contractors.\n    Designated personnel have specific responsibilities related to the use of contractors who perform maintenance or repair, turnaround, major renovation, or specialty work on or adjacent to areas where the Anhydrous Ammonia is received, stored, or processed in the facility.  These responsibilities include specific requirements in selection of contractors regarding the contractor's safety performance and programs; the provision of information concerning the emergency action plans related to the process; development and implementation of safe work practices regarding the control of entrance and exit of contract employers and contract employees in the process areas, periodic evaluation of the contractor related to safety management at the process; maintenance of certain records related to contractor employee injury and illness; development of written procedures for any new processes, and provision of training to employees.  \n    Contractors performing work on or adjacent to equipment or processes in which Anhydrous Ammonia is present must have clearance from the Maintenance Supervisor prior to beginning operations.    In those cases where contractors will perform work directly to or on the process equipment in which the Anhydrous Ammonia is present, the Safety Coordinator and Maintenance Supervisor provide an orientation section to them prior to beginning operations.  This orientation includes an introduction to the Merchants Ice & Cold Storage Company Process Safety Management Program, information concerning the toxicological and physical hazards of Anhydrous Ammonia, and the emergency response plan in the case of an incident involving a release.  Upon completion, the contractor is issued a permit by the Maintenance Supervisor to begin work.\n    F  Inspection and Testing.\n    A program has been developed for inspection and testing, correction of deficiencies in equipment, quality assurance, management of changes in the handling of the Anhydrous Ammonia, and procedures to the process, and compliance audits.\n(1) Mechanical Integrity Program and Assessment - To insure the integrity of the mechanical components of the Anhydrous Ammonia process, a professional engineer, in collaboration with Merchants Ice & Cold Storage Company personnel has developed an On-going Written Mechanical Integrity Program.  This development included a thorough assessment of the process in an attempt to assess the age and present integrity of the component parts.  This assessment included the identification of the component parts for comparison with the manufacturer's specification for maintenance and replacement with \"like in-kind components\" on a scheduled basis.  \n(2)  Equipment Preventive Maintenance and Quality Assurance Program - In an effort to maintain the mechanical integrity and to complete repairs of the equipment in the process, the Maintenance Supervisor oversees a Preventive Maintenance Program.  \n(3)  Management of Change - To insure that proper safety precautions are initiated when change in the operations of the process occurs, the PSM/RMP committee will meet to discuss the planned changes before authorization is given.  The committee will address the following issues prior to approval of a change in the process:\n7 The technical basis for the proposed change\n7 Impact of the change on employee safety and health,\n7 Modifications to operating procedures\n7 Necessary time period for the change\n If changes are decided upon, training for personnel in the operation is provided.  Also, any changes to be made are evaluated by performing a Hazard Operability Study to identify any hazards and/or actions that must be taken.  Additionally, if a change covered by these procedures results in a change in the process safety information, such information will be updated accordingly.  \n     (4)  Pre-startup safety review - To insure that proper safety precautions are initiated when shut-down and startup of the systems occurs after such things as renovations or major repairs, the PSM/RMP committee will meet to discuss the changes.  The committee will decide if the changes are significant enough to require a change in the process safety information.  If the modification is significant enough to require such a change the committee will confirm the following:\n7 Construction and equipment are in accordance with design specifications;\n7 Safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency procedures are in place and are adequate\n7 A process hazard analysis has been performed for new facilities and recommendations have been resolved or implemented before startup, and modified facilities meet the management of change requirements, and\n7 Training of each employee involved in operating the process has been completed.\n    (5)  Compliance Audits - Compliance audits will be conducted with these operating procedures at least every three years to verify that the procedures and practices developed are adequate and are being followed.  The PSM/RMP Committee will certify that they have evaluated compliance with the provisions of the program.  The compliance audit must be conducted by at least one person knowledgeable in the process and a report of the findings will be developed and documented noting any deficiencies that have been corrected.  The written report of the two (2) most recent audit reports will be retained.\n    G.  Incident investigation \n    A crucial part of the Merchants process safety management and release prevention program is a thorough investigation of incidents to identify the chain of events and causes so that corrective measures can be developed and implemented.  An investigation will be conducted on each incident, which resulted in, or could reasonably have resulted in a catastrophic release of the Anhydrous Ammonia in the workplace.  Accident Investigations will be conducted by:\nPlant Manager\nSafety Coordinator\nMaintenance Supervisor\n\n    H.  Emergency planning and response \n    The facility Emergency Response Plan will be maintained according to the provisions of 29 CFR 1910.38 and 29 CFR 1910.120 and EPA guidelines.\nA team of individuals has been trained and is equipped as a HAZMAT team.  The team is equipped with Self-Contained Breathing Apparatuses, Level A suits and monitoring equipment to respond in an offensive manner.\n    Meetings with the Local Emergency Planning Committee Chair and local fire-fighting personnel have taken place to insure proper implementation of emergency response operations should a release occur. \n    I.  Hot Work Permits \n    In accordance with 29 CFR 1910.252, authorization is required from a designated person before cutting or welding is permitted in areas not specifically designed for such purposes.  Based on fire potentials of the plant facility, areas are established for cutting and welding and procedures for a permit for other areas.  Prior to welding or cutting in other than established areas, any Merchants Ice & Cold Storage Company employee or contract employee must acquire a written permit.\nJ. Monitoring Devices\nAir monitoring devices to measure the concentration of Anhydrous Ammonia are located at the storage vehicle, in the vaporizer room, and at the furnaces.  If for some reason the concentration of Anhydrous Ammonia equals or exceeds 5ppm an audible and visual alarm in the production area engages.  Also, an alarm in the production supervisor's office alerts personnel of the concentration.\nActions to be taken should the alarm engage are a part of the facility's written Emergency Response Plan and subjects covered during initial and refresher HAZMAT training.",

      "SummaryText": " warehouse owned by Ray C. Glass.  \nSite Description:\n    The facility is located in Louisville, Kentucky at 801Logan Street, Louisville, Kentucky 40204.  Its Dun and Bradstreet number is 02-405-9032.  Map Location 38014'30\"N; 85044'W.\nOperation Description\n    The site process involves the receipt of commercial food products for cold storage.  No processing takes place at the facility, only storage for maintenance of cold temperature.  Industrial lift trucks, placed into coolers or freezers move the materials.\n    From the time of receipt and throughout the storage period, the materials are maintained at a cool temperature by anhydrous ammonia refrigeration processes.\n    The air cooling process involves the distribution of liquid ammonia through piping (coils) across which air is blown with fans to cool the air.  \nOperation (Technology) of the Process\n    Refrigeration is the control of heat.  According to American Heritage Dictionary heat is defined as:\n\"The energy associated with the motion of atoms or molecules in\nsolids, which can be transmitted through solid and fluid media\nby conduction, through fluid media by convection and through empty\nspace by radiation.\"\n    Heat is energy.  The amount of energy or heat available is determined by the amount of motion or excitement of the atoms or molecules.  The more excited the molecules, the more energy or heat available.\n    This energy or heat can be moved or transferred.  This transfer occurs when there is a difference of temperature.  Heat flows from a source of grater energy (higher temperature) to a source of lower energy (lower temperature).  The greater the temperature difference, the more rapid the heat flow.\n    There are three types of heat transfer mechanisms:\nConduction\nConvection\nRadiation\n    The use of liquid ammonia as a refrigerant is the transferring of heat by conduction and convection.  In conduction heat is transferred by the molecules in a medium coming in contact with each other.  The warm molecules collide with colder m"

Metals are very good at transferring heat by conduction.\n    By blowing air or moving a liquid such as water or glycol over a material such as metal that has been cooled heat is transferred by convection.  The heat load in a freezer is moved via convection to the coils where conduction takes place in transferring the heat to the refrigerant.  The refrigeration process does not produce cold.  It simply moves the heat from an area where it is not wanted to a place it can be discharged.\n    The refrigeration systems at Merchant are accomplished by three methods using Anhydrous Ammonia.  These include:\nAir Cooling\nWater Chilling\n\n    Liquid ammonia has the ability to absorb very large amounts of heat as it vaporizes.  This ability is the basis for mechanical refrigeration systems.  These mechanical systems utilize both pressure and temperature in the refrigeration cycle.  There are five major components in a mechanical refrigeration system.  These include, 1) Receiver, 2) Metering device/expansion valves, 3) Evaporator, 4) Compressor, and 5) Condenser.\n    The Receiver collects the condensed vapors and stores the excess refrigerant charge that is not circulating through the system.  The receiver is located between the condenser and the expansion valve.  It is also used to store refrigerant when it is necessary to service the system.\n    The liquid ammonia is routed to a metering device (expansion valves).  This device regulates the amount of refrigerant going into the evaporator.\n    As the ammonia flows through the device, there is a pressure drop.  The amount of pressure drop determines the temperature of the refrigerant going to the evaporator.  The refrigerant leaves the metering device in both a liquid and a vapor phase.\n    The two-phase refrigerant then enters the evaporator.  The evaporator removes heat from the area or substance bei"

      "SummaryText": "ng cooled.  The ammonia absorbs heat and vaporizes as it travels through the evaporator.  The ammonia then leaves the evaporator and travels to the compressor.\n    The compressor takes the vapor through the suction line and increases the pressure such that when the heat is removed in the condenser, the vapors change form and become liquid.  Work is required to compress these vapors.  This work is converted into energy and stored in the compressed vapors.  This increase in energy results in an increase in temperature.\n    The compressed vapors then go to a condenser.  The condenser removes a lot of the heat contained in the compressed vapors.  When enough heat is removed, the vapor changes form and become liquid.  This condenser liquid then flows to the receiver.\n    Merchants Ice & Cold Storage Company receives Anhydrous Ammonia by wheeled vehicle.  The receiver has a maximum of 11,000 pounds which is filled to 80% capacity.  The Anhydrous Ammonia is in a liquid form at receipt.  Contract personnel complete the connection to the tank.\n\n    Worst-case release scenario and alternative release scenario\n    As a part of the Merchants Ice & Cold Storage Company proactive program concerning the hazards of ammonia to its' workers and the surrounding public, its staff has conducted a thorough hazard assessment.\n    For the hazard assessment and the RMP, populations potentially affected are defined as those within a circle that has as its center the point of release and its radius the distance to the toxic or flammable endpoint.  Owners or operators may use Census data to define this population.  The presence of schools, hospitals, other institutions, public arenas, recreational areas, and large commercial and industrial developments that can be identified on street maps within this circle must be noted.  The presence of environmental receptors within this circle must also be listed.  The EPA has defined environmental receptors as natural areas such as national or state parks, forests, or mon"

The following information was determined using the Automated Resource for Chemical Hazard Incident Evaluation (ARCHIE) model, based on the stability class F , 4.5 mph wind speed, and the level of 200ppm for Anhydrous Ammonia.  This resulted in a release rate of 1,500 lbs/min, and an end point of 2.75 miles from the spill point during summer season at 85 degrees F.  \n    The alternate case scenario for Anhydrous Ammonia was decided as the loss of Anhydrous Ammonia resulting from a release through a 1-inch and a 2-inch line break. . The following information was determined using the Automated Resource for Chemical Hazard Incident Evaluation (ARCHIE) model, based on the stability class F, 6.5 wind speed, and a level of 3ppm for Anhydrous Ammonia.
