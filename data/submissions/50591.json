Included in the plan are measures to be taken internally by Food Lion as well as measures to be taken by off-site response agencies.  \n\nFood Lion on-site personnel will respond to minor incidental ammonia releases only.  Trained off-site responders will handle all non-incidental and major releases.\n\nTo assure that local governmental response agencies are familiar with the Food Lion, Dunn, North Carolina emergency response procedures, Food Lion has provided copies of the ERP for review and approval by the local agencies. \n\nTo plan for an ammonia release with off-site effects, Food Lion ERP includes procedures/equipment to mitigate the release, procedures to inform local response agencies, transportation maps for response agencies, evacuation route maps, and procedures for public communication.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\nFood Lion\u00bfs aim, is to provide a professional service as efficiently as possible while minimizing the use of toxic materials wherever and whenever prudent.  In this effort our highest priority will be the proactive pursuit of cost-effective process changes that reduce or eliminate the use and/or generation of hazardous toxics at the endpoint of service.  Where hazardous toxics cannot be eliminated, improving controls to handle these substances will be explored and implemented wherever possible."

This commitment is inherent to our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with our regulated processes. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible accidental releases of regulated substances. However, if such an accidental release does occur, we are coordinated with this facility\u00bfs contracted emergency response team, local Fire Department, and the Harnett County Emergency Management Agency for emergency response support.\n\nThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nFood Lion-Distribution Center # 4 is a dry and cold storage distribution facility.  The facility is primarily responsible is for storage, processing and resourcing Food Lion grocery stores. The facility is located in the rural area of the city of Dunn, North Carolina.  \n\nThe substance regulated under the Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions (40 CFR 68) that is located on site is anhydrous ammonia.  Ammonia  (Anhydrous) is the only RMP regulated substance present at this facility in a threshold quantity and is utilized as the primary cooling media in our closed-loop refrigeration system. The system\u00bfs purpose is to provide refrigeration and cold storage capabilities for our product. Due to the size and characteristics of our ammonia refrigeration system, as well as Process Safety Management (PSM) applicability, this facility is covered under Program 3 of the RMP regulations.\n\nThe Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario have been completed as discussed in the enclosed RMP Submittal text file.\n\nTo evaluate both the"

Food Lion is also subject to the OSHA PSM Standard under 29 CFR 1910.119, as well as the EPCRA Section 302 and 311/312 notification/reporting requirements.\n\nEmergency Response Plan\n\nFood Lion\u00bfs Emergency Response Policy focuses on evacuation of the facility in the event of an ammonia emergency, with the assistance from local emergency response agencies performing rescue, firefighting, first-aid, medical treatment, and other response functions. The facility maintains a written Emergency Response Plan to document specific procedures to be implemented in the event of various emergencies, including ammonia release. The Emergency Release Plan includes procedures for facility evacuation, as well as for notification to the local emergency response agencies, which are responsible for notifying the public.
