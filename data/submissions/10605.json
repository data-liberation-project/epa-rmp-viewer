(AGA) facility located in Canton, Michigan complies with NFPA requirements for LP-Gas storage, and it is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  If an emergency accidental release were to occur involving our propane, propylene or acetylene storage/handling systems, it is our policy to immediately notify the Canton Fire Department and the AGA emergency response team, who would respond to the emergency.\n\n2.  A description of the facility and the regulated substances handled:\nThe AGA facility manufactures acetylene and stores propane and propylene in above ground storage tanks (ASTs).  All three gases are put into storage cylinders of various sizes before they are sold and shipped from the facility.   The propane storage/handling process consists of one 18,000-gallon propane AST, propane cylinder filling equipment, filled propane cylinders of various sizes, and associated piping, valves, and other miscellaneous equipment.  The propylene storage/handling process consists of one 3,500-gallon propylene AST, propylene cylinder filling equipment, filled propylene cylinders of various sizes, and associated piping, valves, and other miscellaneous equipment.  The acetylene manufacturing/handling/storage process consists of a low pressure acetylene generator and a high pressure cylinder filling area.  The low pressure acetylene generator uses calcium carbide to generate acetylene gas that is purified and stored in a \"gas holder\".  The acetylene that is generated in the low pressure generator is piped to the high pressure cylinder fill area where it is compressed and routed through manifolds that are used to fill multiple cylinders.  \n\n3.  The worst-case release scenario:\nThe worst-case release scenario for the AGA facility considers the potential failure of the 18,000-gallon propane storage tank filled to 80% of its holding capacity (administr"

Utilizing a computer-based version (RMP*Comp) of the methodology presented in USEPA's \"RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance\", USEPA, May 24, 1996, the distance to the flammable endpoint (1 psi overpressure) was determined to be 0.3 miles.  The public receptors affected under this worst-case release scenario include commercial, office, and/or industrial facilities and agricultural land.  There is no residential population within this 0.3-mile radius.\n\n4.  The alternative release scenario:\nThe alternative release scenario for the AGA facility considers the potential release of propane from a 100-pound capacity storage cylinder (i.e., caused by a cylinder being knocked over, resulting in the cylinder valve being broken off), resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  The release rate of propane from the cylinder was estimated to be 1.67 pounds per minute.  It was assumed that the release occurred for a duration of 60 minutes.  Therefore, the alternative release scenario modeled a release of a total of 100 pounds of propane.  Utilizing RMP*Comp, the distance to the flammable endpoint was determined to be 0.02 miles.  The only affected public receptor under this alternative release scenario is an industrial facility.  There is no residential population within this 0.02-mile radius.\n\n5.  The general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\nThe AGA facility complies with USEPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable federal, state and local codes and regulations.  The propane, propylene, and acetylene systems are designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with NFPA and state law at the AGA facility in Canton, Michigan.\n\n6.

We have communicated this policy with the Canton Fire Department. All memebers of the AGA emergency response team are properly trained to respond to emergencies at the facility.
