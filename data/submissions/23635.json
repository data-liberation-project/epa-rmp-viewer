Pursuant to this commitment, the City makes every effort to operate the wastewater treatment facilities in a safe manner, in accordance with all applicable rules and regulations and according to established good engineering and management principles.  \n\n\n\nThe Baton Rouge South Wastewater Treatment Plant (SWWTP) was designed by qualified and experienced engineers and all operating personnel received the necessary training for the safe operation of the plant.\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES.\n\n\n\nThe SWWTP receives domestic wastewater from the south third of the City's urban perimeter and provides secondary treatment to this wastewater.  Before being discharged into the Mississippi River, the treated effluent is disinfected with chlorine and further treated with sulfur dioxide for removal of the residual chlorine.  The use of these two chemicals makes the SWWTP subject to the provisions and requirements of Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act.\n\n\n\nChlorine.  The SWWTP has two 40,000-gallon storage tanks (nominal size) to satisfy the chlorine needs of the wastewater disinfection process.  Each tank has a working capacity of approximately 30,000 gallons, or approximately 50,000 lb. of  liquid chlorine.  This chemical is delivered on the plant site by dedicated tanker trucks operated by the chlorine supplier.  All of the chlorine storage and handling facilities are enclosed inside a steel-frame and concrete building.\n\n\n\nSulfur Dioxide.  The SWWTP receives sulfur dioxide in one-ton cylinders which are delivered by truck.  The cylinders are stored inside the sulfur dioxide building, a steel-frame and concrete structure that also houses all of the major co"

The WCS's associated with the SWWTP were assumed as follows:\n\n\n\n* Chlorine: catastrophic failure of a chlorine storage tank, resulting in the release of the entire tank contents (50,000 lb.) within a period of 10 minutes, and \n\n\n\n* Sulfur Dioxide: the total failure of an angle valve on a sulfur dioxide cylinder, resulting in the release of the entire contents of the cylinder (2,000 lb.) within a period of 10 minutes.  \n\n\n\nThese worst-case scenarios are extremely unlikely to occur.  Also, the evaluation of these scenarios did not take into account the available mitigating conditions such as the location of the facilities inside a closed building, the existing leak detection devices and alarms and the existing emergency scrubber systems.  The caustic scrubber systems are designed to capture the entire contents of a chlorine tank and of a sulfur dioxide cylinder, respectively.  Therefore it was necessary to assume, for the purposes of the Worst-Case Scenarios, that these systems would be inoperable at the time of the release (i.e., they would trip out as soon as they tried to start).\n\n\n\nThe maximum distance to the chlorine toxic end point of 0.0087 mg/L was calculated at 5.4 miles.  The maximum distance to the sulfur dioxide toxic end point of 0.0078 mg/L was calculated at 0.9 miles.\n\n\n\nAlternate Release Scenarios.  The ARS's associated with the SWWTP were assumed as follows:\n\n\n\n* Chlorine:  Failure of a flexible hose connector at one of the chlorine storage tanks.  This would release chlorine gas from the broken hose for one minute, until the tank excess-flow valve is activated.  The amount of chlorine released under this sce"

      "SummaryText": "nario was estimated at approximately 1,610 lb.\n\n\n\n* Sulfur Dioxide: Rupture of a metal tube connection on an empty sulfur dioxide cylinder, while changing cylinders.  This would cause the release of sulfur dioxide gas at an approximate rate of 30 lb. per min. and it would last for approximately 30 minutes until the Hazmat team arrived and closed the cylinder valve.  Total amount released was estimated at approximately 900 lb.\n\n\n\n\n\nThese scenarios are also unlikely but they represent a somewhat more realistic view of a hypothetical release.  Just as in the WCS, existing mitigating conditions were not taken into account in the development of this scenario.  It was also necessary to assume that the caustic scrubber system would trip out as soon as it tried to start and therefore would not be able to capture the released chemical.\n\n\n\nThe maximum distance to the chlorine toxic end point of 0.0087 mg/L  was calculated at 0.6 miles.  The maximum distance to the sulfur dioxide toxic end point of 0.0078 mg/L was calculated at 0.1 miles.\n\n\n\n\n\nPREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\n1.0    Safety Information\n\n\n\nThe South Wastewater Treatment plant of the city of Baton Rouge keeps on site the necessary documents related to the operation and maintenance of the plant in a safe manner.  Documentation kept on site provides information regarding the chemical properties and chemical hazards associated with the regulated chemicals (not only chlorine and sulfur dioxide but caustic as well); operating limits for all key process parameters; record of the current inventory of these chemicals; and data on equipment design and specifications.\n\n\n\nThese documents include, but are not limited to the following:\n\n\n\n* Copies of current Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS's) for the chemicals involved\n\n* Vendor's Operation and Maintenance (O&M) manuals for each major component of the chlorination and dechlorination systems.\n\n* A complete set of construction drawings and specifications\n\n* A copy of the plant's Emergency "

      "SummaryText": "e Incident\n\n\n\nOn the morning of May 25th, 1999 at approximately 8:15 AM, a 2-person maintenance crew (a mechanic and a plant operator) entered the evaporator room in the chlorine building of the SWWTP to replace a failed relief valve rupture disk.  Both members of the crew were experienced and were familiar with the chlorination system and with established procedures.  \n\n\n\nAfter the system was evacuated according to procedure, the mechanic started to loosen the connection on the rupture-disk union.   At this time, chlorine gas was released from the loose connection and the mechanic was exposed to it.  He was immediately taken to a medical clinic and provided with the necessary medical care.  In the meantime, the plant operator called Hazmat, the State police and the LDEQ.\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription of Release - On-Site Impacts\n\n\n\nThe release only lasted a few seconds and the amount of chlorine released was estimated to amount to just a few grams.  Only the technician who was loosening up the pipe union was exposed (his companion was not exposed) and this was the only on-site impact resulting from this incident. The technician was immediately transported to the hospital for treatment and observation, however he apparently only suffered a minor exposure, as he was released from the hospital the same day and was able to return to work before the end of his shift.\n\n\n\n\n\nOff-Site Impacts\n\n\n\nThere were no off-site impacts that resulted from this incident.  The release occurred inside the evaporator room which is completely enclosed, therefore the small quantity of chlorine gas actually released was contained inside this room. \n\n\n\nInitiating Event \n\n\n\nThe subsequent incident investigation indicated that the system evacuation procedures that existed at the time were not very effective in removing all of the chlorine gas from the system.  Whereas the crew believed that all of the chlorine had been removed from the system according to the evacuation procedure, in reality there still was"

      "SummaryText": " a small amount of chlorine gas remaining inside the pipe, even though the evacuation procedure had been followed.  As a result, when the pipe union was loosened for the removal of the failed rupture disk, the chlorine gas still remaining in the line was released, thereby resulting in the technician being exposed to the gas. \n\n\n\nContributing Factors\n\n\n\nThere were a few other factors that contributed to this incident:\n\n\n\n* The established procedures at the time did not require the crew to wear respirators or fresh-air masks while performing this task.  As a result, the technician had no respiratory protection when chlorine gas was released from the loosened pipe union.\n\n* Each of the chlorinator units is provided with a vacuum breaker diaphragm valve that will allow air to be pulled in when the vacuum level gets \"too high\" inside the chlorinator.\n\n* It is believed the vacuum in the system increased and the diaphragm vacuum breaker was activated in the chlorinator, thereby allowing air into the system.  \n\n* There were no vacuum gauges available on the system being worked on. Thus, the maintenance crew had no way to verify whether there was negative pressure in the system.\n\n* The maintenance crew was not aware of the existence of this vacuum breaker device on the chlorinators.\n\n\n\nOff-site Responders \n\n\n\nAs mentioned above, HazMat, the State Police and the LDEQ were called immediately after the incident.  The HazMat team that reported to the SWWTP proceeded to tighten the union and close the chlorine gas valve.  Breard-Gardner, a maintenance contractor for the chlorine system, was called out to check out the chlorination system and verify that it was in working order.  The HazMat team gave the All-Clear at approximately 11:00 AM on the same morning.\n\n\n\nOperational and Process Changes\n\n\n\nThe incident investigation report submitted a number of recommendations to prevent the reocurrence of such incidents.  Among such recommendations, the most important are as follows:\n\n\n\n1"

Similarly, replace the existing pressure gauge on the evaporator control panel with a dual-range gauge.\n\n3. Install a block valve on the evaporator relief valve connection, just upstream of the rupture disk.  This valve shall have the means to be locked in the open position and it shall always be kept locked open, except when changing or servicing the rupture disk.\n\n4. The standard operating procedures should be revised to require maintenance personnel to wear the appropriate personal protection equipment (PPE) (respirator or gas mask) when breaking into any component in the chlorination system.  The PPE should continue to be worn until it is established that chlorine is not present inside the system.\n\n\n\nOther Accident History\n\n\n\nNo other injuries or other related consequences resulted from this incident and no other reportable chemical release accidents, as described in 40 CFR Part 68.42(a), have occurred within the past five years at the SWWTP.\n\n\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe South WWTP has in place a written Emergency Preparedness and Response Plan for the Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide Systems.

These drills were performed with the participation and under the guidance of the Baton Rouge Hazmat team and the Baton Rouge Fire Department.\n\n\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nAt the present time the SWWTP has not defined any process changes or improvements that may result in improved safety.  However, some of the action items identified during the Hazop analysis are directly or indirectly related to safety.  The timing of their implementation will depend on their ranking according to priorities and on the overall implementation schedule of the Hazop action items.\n\n\n\nThe City has issued a contract for the implementation of the Preventive Maintenance program for all chlorine and sulfur dioxide equipment at all three wastewater treatment plants. This contract was issued for a period of 4 years, with an effective date of March 31, 2,001.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVjs - H:\\My Documents\\BTNROUGE\\SOUTHPLT\\rmp1exec-rv.doc    Page 1 of 1 \n\n\n\n"
