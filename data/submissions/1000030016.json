HF-70 is stored on-site in a  6,000 gallon storage tank, located within a concrete dike in the outdoor acid tank farm.  Administrative controls assures that the tank is maintained at a level of 5500 gallons or less. In addition, up to 20 55-gallon drums of HF-70 are stored inside the facility's warehouse. \n\n\n\nWe have a certified environmental management program in place (ISO 14001).This includes operating procedures, accidential release controls, corrective actions, and an emergency response plan.\n\n\n\nThe contingency plan, emergency procedures, and operational control procedures are located on a shared drive. See procedures 09.16.2001 through 09.16.2018, forms 09.16.8001 through 09.16.8006 and the Integrated Contingency Plan.\n\n\n\nHazard assessment is done done using the ISO 14001 aspect review program. There is an aspect review team involved in the assessment. This provides employee participation as required by 40 CFR 68.83.\n\n\n\nThere have been no accidents or releases in the last 5 years. We did have a near miss that involved the potential for a chemical burn due to a contaminated pump being moved to the maintenance cage, this did not trigger the contingency plan.\n\n\n\nRisk has been reduced, we have eliminated several corrosive commodities from our operation.\n\n\n\nAn analysis of a worst case release scenario, as defined by the EPA rules, and more likely alternate release scenarios, selected from EPA guidance documents, were conducted and are documented in this plan.  The alternate case release scenarios indicate that a radius of two-tenths of a mile would be included in the distance to toxic endpoint. Hukill Chemical Corporation developed an Accidental Release Prevention Program as part of this Risk management Plan.  The prevention program elements, such as training, operating procedures and maintenance procedures are in pl"
