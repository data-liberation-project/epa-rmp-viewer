The mill assembles an audit team that includes personnel knowledgeable in the RMP rule and in the process, and this team evaluates whether the prevention program satisfies the requirements of the RMP rule and whether the prevention program is sufficient to help ensure safe operation of the process.  The results of the audit are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate enhancements to the prevention program are implemented.\n\n1.4.9  Incident Investigation\nARC investigates all incidents that could reasonably have resulted in a serious injury to personnel, the public, or the environment so that similar accidents can be prevented.  The mill trains employees to identify and report any incident requiring investigation.  An investigation team is assembled, and the investigation is initiated within 48 hours of the incident.  The results of the investigation are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate process enhancements are implemented.\n\n1.4.10  Employee Participation\nARC developed a written employee participation program for covered processes to help ensure that the safety concerns of mill employees are addressed.  ARC encourages active participation of personnel in the prevention program activities of all processes at the facility.  Employees are consulted on and informed about all aspects of the RMP rule prevention program, including PHAs, employee training, and operating procedures.\n\n1.4.11  Hot Work Permits\nARC established a hot work permit program to control heat producing maintenance activities (i.e., welding, grinding) that could result in fires or explosions in covered processes at the mill.

Operators must be certified to complete Hot Work Permit Forms.\n\n1.4.12  Contractors\nARC established a program to help ensure that contractor activities at the mill are performed in a safe manner.  The program reviews the safety record of all contractors to help ensure that ARC hires only those contractors who can safely perform the desired job tasks.  For required operating areas, the mill trains all contractors in the hazards of the process on which they will work, mill safe work practices, and mill emergency response procedures.

The team evaluates the process and reviews the potential hazards of different scenarios. Any hazard with unacceptable residual risk is given a recommendation to reduce the risk down to an acceptable level. These recommendations are assigned a primary person responsible and a due date for required completion. \n\n1.4.3  Operating Procedures\nARC engineers, operators, and supervisors work together to develop and maintain operating procedures to define how tasks related to process operations should be safely performed.  The operating procedures (1) are used to train employees, and (2) serve as the foundation for appropriate actions to take during both normal operations and process upsets.  Mill employees develop and maintain operating procedures that cover all phases of operations, including initial startup, normal operations, normal shutdown, emergency shutdown, startup following a turnaround or emergency shutdown, and temporary operations.\n\n1.4.4  Training\nARC trains employees to safely and effectively perform their assigned tasks.  The employee training program includes both initial and refresher training that covers (1) a general overview of the process, (2) the properties and hazards of the substances in the process, and (3) a detailed review of the process operating procedures and safe work practices.

The two mills produce bleached kraft market pulp for sale to customers.  As part of this manufacturing process, ARC handles chlorine dioxide in sufficient quantities to be covered by the RMP rule.\n\n1.3  Offsite Consequence Analysis\nARC performed an offsite consequence analysis to estimate the potential for an accidental release of a regulated substance to affect the public or the environment.  The offsite consequence analysis consists of evaluating both worst-case release scenarios and alternative release scenarios.  ARC does not expect a worst-case release scenario to ever occur.  The alternative release scenario was selected to help the Monroe County Emergency Management Agency improve the community emergency response plan.  An alternative release scenario represents a release that (1) might occur at a facility like ARC, and (2) would result in the greatest potential offsite consequences if the release occurred.  \n\n1.4  Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nSince its inception in 1978, the facility has used a prevention program to help prevent accidental releases of hazardous substances.  Beginning in 1992, the mill formalized this prevention program for the Kraft Pulp Bleaching process to comply with the 14 elements of the OSHA process safety management (PSM) prevention programs for chlorine dioxide.  In 1996, the EPA's RMP rule established similar requirements for Program 3 processes.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of ARC's Program 3 prevention program that address the EPA's RMP rule accident prevention program requirements."

As part of this commitment, ARC has established a system to help ensure the safe operation of the processes at its facility.  One component of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the facility to comply with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR Part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements:  Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMPlan) describing the risk management program at ARC.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMPlan requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program implemented by ARC.\n\nARC's risk management program consists of three elements:\n1.  A hazard assessment to help understand (a) the potential offsite consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and (b) accidents that have occurred during the last five years associated with the use of substances regulated by the RMP rule (regulated substances) - see topics 1.3 and 1.5.\n2.  A prevention program to help maintain and safely operate the processes containing more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance (covered processes) - see topic 1.4.\n3.  An emergency response program to help respond to accidental releases of regulated substances from covered processes - see topic 1.7\nInformation further describing these elements is provided in this RMPlan.\n\nAlthough the risk management program at ARC helps provide assurance that the facility is maintained and operated in a safe manner, it is only one component of the safety program at the mill.
