Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the stationary source.\n\nGusto Packing Company has prepared a Risk Management Program (RMP) in accordance with Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 68. Gusto is committed to providing a safe work environment for our employees and to prevent or minimize any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia. Gusto prepared the RMP to satisfy regulatory requirements and to demonstrate our commitment to the safe handling of anhydrous ammonia at our facility. \n\n2.    The stationary source and substances handled.\n\nGusto Packing Company is located at 2125 Rochester Drive in Montgomery, IL. We manufacture meat products including smoked hams and bacon, and bone-in pork and turkey products. We employee approximately 450 employees and our products are shipped to all 50 states and around the world.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia, a common industrial refrigerant, is maintained in a closed refrigeration system for the purpose of temperature control for meat products processing. \n\n3.    The general accidental release prevention program and prevention steps.\n\nThe refrigeration system incorporates redundant safety controls to prevent and mitigate potential releases. The system is continuously monitored by computer control systems that will shut down components that exceed normal operating limits.  Other safety features of the system include:\n    -Pressure relief valves installed on all pressure vessels\n    -Relief activation alarm systems\n    -Manual emergency shutdown systems\n    -Automated emergency ventilation system\n    -Ammonia detection systems.\n    -Backup generator capacity for refrigeration system.\n\nAdministrative controls to maintain safe system operation in compliance with OSHA Process Safety Management and EPA Risk Management Program regulations, include:\n-Employee Participation Program\n-Proces"

The emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of local emergency responders.\n\n6.    Planned changes to improve safety.\n\nMost of the changes recommended by the Process Hazard Analysis Team have been implemented. Additional changes will be implemented over the next 6 months, including:\n\n-Installation of System 1 relief valve activation detectors.\n-Expansion of audio and visual alarms to include relief valve activation.\n-Modification of computer controls to simplify remote system isolation.\n"
