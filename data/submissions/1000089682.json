      "SummaryText": "Facility Description\n\nWisconsin Public Service, Weston  station, located in Rothschild, Wisconsin uses 29% aqueous ammonia within the NOx emissions controls systems at Units 3 and 4.  Since the Facility has more than 20,000 pounds of aqueous ammonia at a concentration greater than 20%, it is required to submit a Risk Management Plan (\"RMP\") and comply with the requirements of 40 CFR 68. Weston  station is subject to Program 2 requirements for aqueous ammonia. \n\n\n\nFacility and Regulated Substances handled\n\nThe Weston  facility has three 45,000 gallon tanks of aqueous ammonia (29%) surrounded by a containment wall. The aqueous ammonia is used in the emissions control systems for units 3 and 4.  Note:  we administratively keep the max fill at 38,000 gallons for each tank.  The piping volume was included in the resubmission as 322 gallons.  Inspection of underground piping discovered piping underground is an inch larger so another 162 gallons was added to volume.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nWisconsin Public Service is committed to the protection of its employees, the greater community and the environment. The facility recently established a system that identifies the hazards associated with the aqueous ammonia covered process and the control equipment required.  Senior management is committed to site safety and the implementation of safe procedures.\n\nThe facility also utilizes an Incident Reporting and Incident Investigation program to determine root cause(s) and appropriate corrective action(s) for incidents that occur.\n\nThe Facility has an emergency action plan in place. Wisconsin Public Service employees will not respond to accidental releases.  There is a comprehensive system in place that triggers the appropriate mechanisms to notify emergency responders when there is a need for a response. Training for employees includes classroom instruction, hands on review of the equipment, and several incident simulation drills conducted e"

      "SummaryText": "ach year.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThrough completion of this RMP, Integrys has complied the elements as defined under 40 C FR Part 68 for program 2 facilities. Safety information and operations/maintenance procedures are documented on-site. Periodic functions such as process hazard analysis and training are conducted on a regular basis. Audits of the overall RMP will be conducted on a regular basis to assure compliance with EPA regulations. Personnel training program includes an overview of the plant processes, safety and health hazards, emergency action plan and Risk Management Plan elements.  \n\nThe Facility has established a maintenance procedure to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors. \n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nThe Weston facility has not had an ammonia accident in the past five years at the facility.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nPlanned changes include \n\n1. Relocate wash-up station at ammonia unloading area for easier access, \n\n2. Work with chemical delivery vendor to improve their pre-unloading inspection procedure\n\n3. Will consider recommendations for improvement that are developed from assessments and incident investigations.\n\n"
