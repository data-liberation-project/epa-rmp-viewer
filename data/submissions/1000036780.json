The CalARP RMP is for the aqueous ammonia that is stored at the plant for use in drinking water treatment.\n\n\n\n1. DESCRIPTION OF STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\n\n\nThe sole purpose of the MHWTP is to treat reservoir water for use in drinking water (NAICS code 22131 Water Utilities).\n\n\n\nMHWTP is a water treatment plant that uses ammonia to produce chloramines, which act as a residual disinfectant to protect against pathogens in drinking water. \n\n\n\nThe MHWTP has a maximum inventory of 3,200 liquid gallons of aqueous ammonia (4,670 lbs NH3).\n\n\n\nA metal fence and a security system protect the site, and all building entries are equipped with intruder alarms to alert use of unauthorized access.\n\n\n\n2. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nIn order to limit the risk of release the operations staff must be properly trained. The operators will become familiar with the following information:\n\n?    Material Safety Data Sheets\n\n?    Maximum intended inventory\n\n?    Safe upper and lower parameters\n\n?    Equipment specifications\n\n?    Codes and standards used to design, build, and operate the process\n\n\n\n3. FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThere have not been any accidents on site or any accidental releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n\n4. EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM \n\n\n\nIn the event of a spill or release the following steps will take place.\n\n1)Call the local emergency response agency: 911\n\n2)Call the fire department: (209) 831-6700.\n\n3)Call Cal OES: (800) 852-7550\n\n4)Call the San Joaquin Office of Emergency Services: "

PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nThe following changes are planned in response to the hazards identified during the hazard review. \n\n1)Provide windsock in visible location.\n\n2)Set-up emergency response team.\n\n3)Post warning sign on the outside of the chemical building.\n\n3)Add label to aqueous ammonia chemical piping at the Finished Water Storage Effluent injection point.\n\n4)Remove hose tripping hazard near the emergency eyewash station within the chemical building.\n\n\n\nMike Buckley will be responsible for implementing these changes by February 14, 2014. \n\n"
