The addition became fully operational in early December of 2003. A Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) was conducted on September 9, 2003 before the addition went into operation. In addition, a PHA was conducted in March 2002, and prior to that a PHA study was conducted on May 20, 2000.     In April of 2004, a Compliance Audit was performed at the facility, as required by the PSM standard. In 2007 a 14,000 sf  processing addition was built on the North side of the facility. In Auguts of 2008, a Compliance Audit was performed by an outside agency. The same agency conducted a PHA in January of 2008. The facility applied for VPP Star Status and during the week of February 18, 2008 OSHA conducted a week long inspections to qualify the facility for the VPP Star Status. The Management is confident, that the facility will receive the OSHA VPP Star Designation."
