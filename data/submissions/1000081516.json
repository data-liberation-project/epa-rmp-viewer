      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nRisk Management Plan Executive Summary\n\nEquistar Chemicals, LP\n\nChocolate Bayou Polymers Plant\n\n\n\n1. Purpose\n\n\n\nThis document describes the Equistar Chemicals Chocolate Bayou Polymers Plant's philosophy and procedures for managing risk to employee health, public safety and to the environment.  It is intended to be just a summary of the many policies, procedures and actions that are taken to prevent or mitigate the potential release of chemicals listed under EPA 40 CFR 68 Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (RMP) Under the Clean Air Act, Section 112(r)(7).\n\n\n\n2. Plant Overview\n\n\n\nThe Equistar Chocolate Bayou Polymers Plant is a High-Density Polyethylene Resin production facility.  It manufactures a range of differing molecular weight High-Density Polyethylene (HDPE) Resins used in the manufacturing of plastic products.  The complex consists of two parallel reactor trains operated as a single process.  Ethylene and applicable co-monomers are dissolved in isobutane and polymerized to HDPE by the addition of suitable catalyst.  The reaction is carried out in loop-type reactors operated at elevated pressure and temperature; there, the reaction mixture is circulated at a high velocity.  Feed ethylene, co-monomers, isobutane, hydrogen, catalyst, and co-catalyst are added continuously to the system as the product is withdrawn.  A portion of the reactor slurry is circulated through external hydroclones to concentrate the slurry and therefore reduce the amount of isobutane, which is recycled.  The polymer is continuously removed as a slurry and processed into HDPE pellets.  The ethylene feedstock is transported to the facility by pipeline, other  process chemicals are transported to the facility by tank truck or in shipping containers.\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nEquistar is committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive acc"

It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent and mitigate possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, our trained emergency response personnel are on hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  We also coordinate with the Chocolate Bayou Mutual Aid Group which provides additional emergency response resources.\n\n\n\n4. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nThe Equistar Chocolate Bayou Polymers Plant encompasses the manufacturing of High-Density Polyethylene (HDPE).  In the process of making HDPE, several regulated substances are used in a flammable mixture, comprising of two (2) regulated flammable substances above the threshold quantity.  The two (2) regulated flammable substances are: Ethylene and Isobutane.  Hydrogen is handled below threshold quantities and is piped into the process. No regulated toxic substances are used above the threshold quantity at the Equistar Chocolate Bayou Polymers Plant.\n\n\n\n5. The Worse-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios have been modelled and are included in the RMP.\n\n\n\nThe Flammables Worst-Case Release Scenario involves the catastrophic release of isobutane from a storage bullet. The Flammables Alternative Worst-Case Release Scenario involves a catastrophic release of isobutane due to shaft seal failure of a reactor elbow pump. Both scenarios assume a release rate total quantity over immediate duration as specified in 40CFR Part 68.25 (e).\n\n\n\nThere is no Toxics Worst-Case Release Scenario for this facility because no regulated toxic substances are used above threshold quantity.\n\n\n\n6. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nEquistar has taken the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release p"

This facility was designed, constructed, and is maintained in accordance with many national Codes and Standards too numerous to mention in this short summary.  Codes or Standards from the following major organizations are used: ASME, ANSI, API, IEEE, NFPA, ASTM and ISA.  The reactor portion and associated feed/catalyst preparation/purification areas of the HDPE process at the Equistar Chocolate Bayou Polymers Plant are subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.  The HDPE pellet finishing, blending and storage areas are not a covered process due to the lack of a threshold quantity of OSHA regulated chemicals.\n\n\n\nThe following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program in place at Equistar.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nEquistar maintains a record of written safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazards Analysis\n\nEquistar conducts studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out the analysis is referred to as a Unit Process Hazards Analysis (PHA).  A team of qualified personnel with expertise and knowledge of the process technology and plant operations undertake the studies.  A person knowledgeable of the PHA process being used leads the team.  Any findings related to the PHA are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n\n\nOperations Procedures\n\nFor the purposes of operating our facilities safely, Equistar maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency operations, emergency shutdown, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operating technicians involved with the process.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\nEquistar has a "

Equistar has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related to the contractors work and to the potential process hazards of the area the contractor will be working in.  Contractors are also informed of the procedural actions that they are to take during an emergency response situation.\n\n\n\n7. Five Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThe Equistar Chemicals, Chocolate Bayou Polymers Plant has an excellent record of preventing accidental releases.  Due to our release prevention policies, there have been no accidental releases of substances regulated by the RMP in the last five years that had an onsite or offsite impact as described under 40 CFR Part 68.42.  Therefore no public meeting have been held to address RMP Incidents. As a matter of course, Equistar reports and investigates all incidents.  \n\n\n\n8. Emergency Response Plan\n\n\n\nEquistar has in place a written Emergency Response Plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes many aspects of emergency response including: fire fighting, adequate first aid and medical treatment, shelter in place, evacuations, notification of Brazoria County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) with which our emergency plan has been coordinated and verified recently on 9/21/2021, and notification of the public through our \"First Call\" System.  This system is an automatic phone system that calls all neighbor phones with a recorded message that provides key actions to be taken in the event of an emergency. Additionally, the site maintains a telephone \"CAER\" hotline that provides information to the community when abnormal or emergency conditions occur in the plant that may affect or be noticed by the community.
