The Hazardous Communication Program has been incorporated into the Risk Management Program to help evaluate the needs of our facility.  Information training sessions with employees on response to an emergency has prepared them to respond in a safe manner.  Our facility is a wastewater treatment facility and the wastewater is chlorinated for disinfection.  One ton cylinders of chlorine are used in this process and there are usually two to four cylinders on site.  Only one cylinder is connected at any time.  The worst case scenario at this facility would be the release of a one ton cylinder.  Vacuum check regulators are in place on the cylinder.  For a release to occur, the check would have to fail.  These regulators are cleaned and inspected every six months.  No chemical releases have occured in the past.  The employees at the treatment facility have been trained to respond to leaks and are knowledgeable of the emergency agencies to notify if a leak cannot be contained immediately.  Mock drills will be conducted for all personnel and community notification will be done with the cooperation of the Vincennes Fire Department and Local Emergency Management.  Environmental Management Corporation and the City of Vincennes will continue to monitor the chlorine process and take all necessary measures to prevent any accidental release.  The safety of our employees and the community we serve is our number one priority."
