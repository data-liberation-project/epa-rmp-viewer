This facility started batch manufacturing at the Camanche, IA location in 1989.    \n\n\n\nThe Camanche facility is sited distant from residential population, in an industrial area with space, fences, security, natural obstacles separating the areas from casual public.  A perimeter fence with guard service is located around the facility to keep the public out.  Vertex shares security and perimeter fencing with another manufacturing company, Clysar.  Secondary security fencing is located around the chlorine railcar unloading area to keep unauthorized personnel away from the chlorine unloading area.  Batch process is set up as close as possible to the chlorine railcars to reduce pipeline distance which reduces the hazard of mechanical failure and how much chlorine would be released in a pipeline failure.\n\n\n\nPrevention and Emergency Response policies:  Hawkins' management and safety committees have set a motto of \"Think Safe! Be Safe!\" regarding accidents and injuries.  Support for this motto is manifested in several ways, including:\n\n1. A corporate Health, Safety and Environmental (HSE) department staffed with trained professionals.\n\n2. Training programs in chemical safety, safe material handling, accident prevention and emergency response.\n\n3. Prompt investigation of near misses and incidents to identify root causes and implement measures to prevent future occurrences.\n\n4. Adherence to all EPA and OSHA regulations governing our operations.\n\n5. Compliance with DOT requirements regarding shipping and materials.\n\n6. Internal and 3rd party audits of Health, Safety and Environmental procedures at all Hawkins locations.\n\n7.
