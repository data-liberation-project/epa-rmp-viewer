The EHS (Environmental, Health and Safety) Director reports to the Plant Manager and assure that every job, task, project, etc. that will be perform its been evaluate in term of EHS.  \n\n\n\nFor the Process Safety Program and Risk Management Program roles and responsibilities are defined to assure all changes and repairs are completed following Good Engineering Practices. \n\n\n\nBaxter has policies and local procedures that defined programs to prevent accidental release and to respond to any emergency in the case that would be neccesary. Senior management jobs description defined roles and responsibilities to ensure compliance with EHS regulations.    \n\n\n\nBaxter Guayama manufactures three types of anesthesia: Isoflurane, Desflurane, Sevoflurane.

There is one shot pot for the Desflurane Process and one for the Sevoflurane process. From the Shot Pot the substance is transfer to the Fluorination Reactor. Tanks are connected to an emergency scrubber system. At the Desflurane process there are two Fluorination Reactors although only one can be used at a time in the reaction step. At the Sevoflurane process there is one Fluorination reactor.  Also an Iso-container is included in this process (41,477 lbs) because the iso-contai"

      "SummaryText": "p safety review may be required if defined as part of the evaluation process. \n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis is performed according to the regulation or more often if a change impact the process safety.  Risks and Hazards are identified as part of the analysis for each element of the process.\n\n\n\nBaxter and contractor roles and responsibilities are defined as part of the procedure.  Contractor performance is evaluated each year. Also annually a meeting is coordinated with Contractor personnel to ensure they know Baxter safety rules. Each contractor has to complete annually a training offered by Baxter personnel where safety rules are reviewed.  As part of the selection process Contractor's Safety program and training evidence is evaluated.  \n\n\n\nAlso Baxter Safety Programs includes procedures related to Lockout Out/Tag Out, Hot Work Permit, Confined space entry,  etc. that help to keep process in control during routinely and non-routinely activities. \n\n\n\nMechanical integrity program includes preventive maintenance, calibration and inspection for process critical equipment's. Also safety systems like alarms, fire system are verified as part of the program. Shutdowns are scheduled throughout the year. Mechanical Integrity Testing is conducted based on the requirements by applicable codes, standards and regulations by specialized contractors and onsite personnel. \n\n\n\nCompliance audits are regularly conducted and comply with RMP Program elements. \n\n\n\nIn the past five years Baxter didn't have any reportable accident as per RMP requirement.  Baxter has a program for Accident/Incident Investigation in which incidents are notified and investigated.  Not only incidents/accidents related to environmental release also related to safety, property damage, product loss, security, occupational health and near misses are investigated  as part of the program. \n\nAs part of the report factors that contribute to the incidents are identified.  Corrective and preventive actions are defined. \n"

      "SummaryText": "\n\n\nThe emergency response program consists of several elements like: Organization and Procedure for Fire Control, Hurricane Emergency Plan, Emergency Evacuation Alarms, and Procedure for Area and Emergency Meeting Point Coordinators.\n\n\n\nAs part of the Baxter emergency system employees from different shift and areas are trained in emergency response to fire, spill, etc.   As part of the training program classroom training and drill are provided like Chlorine Kit, Level A SCBA, HAZWOPER, Fire Extinguisher, Confined Space, etc. \n\n\n\nLocal agencies like Fire Department know information about our facility through SPCC, SWPP Plan and other EPA required reports. At this moment LEPC didn't have periodic meetings but Baxter keep local agencies informed in case an accident affect the community or neighbors.    \n\n\n\nFor the next year Baxter is planning to performed periodic drills in coordination with local agencies. \n\nAlso continue to provide specific trainings to Baxter personnel in order to increase knowledge related to response to emergencies that can affect not only our employees but also our neighbors. \n\n\n\nWhen compared this resubmission with 2009 submittal the covered process, no new storage tank or area was built. \n\n\n\nIn this resubmission; process were defined in a different way in order to cover areas as defined in the 2009 resubmission (Summary Section)\n\n\n\nProcess 1: Fluorination (Sevo)\n\n\n\nProcess 2: HF Storage tank (Tank Farm); including iso-container during transference process. \n\nThis re-submission iso-container was included because iso-container could be store temporarily at site until QA Release completed for transference.  Also all safety system needs to be revised and two operators need to be available to transfer the process.  No new tank was installed. Iso-container scenario was included in 2009 and 2014 submission. \n\n\n\nProcess 3: Chlorination (ISO) \n\n\n\nProcess 4: Chlorine Storage Rack \n\n\n\nProcess 5: Chlorination (SEVO)\n\n\n\nProcess 6: Fluorination (DES)\n\n"
