If a fire emergency were to occur, it is the facility's policy to notify the McFarland Fire Department by calling 911, (distance to closest fire station from terminal is 1.5 miles by road) which may trigger involvement by Dane County Emergency Management, Wisconsin Emergency Management and/or City of Madison Hazardous Materials Team, as necessary.  All personnel at this facility are 40-hour HAZWOPER certified and receive annual refresher hazardous materials training.  \r\n\r\nThe U.S. Venture, Inc. - U.S. Oil Madison South Terminal is a bulk petroleum terminal that stores refined petroleum products, including gasoline, diesel oil, denatured ethanol, biodiesel and fuel additives.  Two 30 thousand-gallon storage tanks and butane blending equipment have beeen installed and began operating at the facility in April 2012.  In addition, in September of 2012 construction of a rail butane delivering system was finalized that can be used to offload butane into the two 30 thousand-gallon storage tanks and/or load truck transports.  The quantity of butane that will be stored onsite exceeds the 10,000 pound threshold quantity, thus subjecting the facility to RMP requirements.\r\n\r\nThe Risk Management Program (RMP) covers the butane blending system, including the associated piping, two storage tanks and butane rail cars. The facility's worst case scenario is the failure of one of the system's two 30,000 gallon storage tanks when filled to the greatest amount allowed (85% of each tanks capacity) resulting in a vapor cloud explosion. The resulting distance to the endpoint (1PSI overpressure) extends off-site 0.4 miles and includes public receptors but no environmental receptors. The facility's alternate (most likely res"

The resulting distance to the endpoint (1 PSI overpressure) extends off-site, but affects no residential areas rather a few businesses. The BLEVE has similar impacts. The U.S. Venture, Inc. - Madison South Terminal complies with the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) accident prevention rules (40 CFR Part 68 Subpart D), the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29 CFR Part 1910.119), and all applicable state and local laws and regulations. \r\n\r\nThis butane blending system is designed, constructed, and maintained in accordance with NFPA #58 and the manufacturer's (Technics) instructions. The Butane System installation is approved by the State of Wisconsin's Department of Safety and Professional Services (DSPS). To date, this facility has never had an accident involving butane which has resulted in deaths, injuries, property/environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place. In the event of an emergency involving the U.S. Venture, Inc. - U.S. Oil Madison South Terminal's butane blending system, it is the policy of the facility to initially contact the McFarland Fire Department and request their assistance (via 911).  The facility emergency response plans are coordinated with the fire department and the Dane County Emergency Management. The McFarland Fire Department is aware of the butane blending process.\r\n\r\nEfforts to improve system safety include tying in the emergency shutdown devices (ESDs) at adjacent, owned, and operated U.S. Oil Madison South Terminal and U.S. Oil Madison North Terminal locations. This will allow both terminals to be shut down completely at the same time regardless of where the ESD is activated from in the event of an emergency.  In addition, high level alarms will be installed in each of the two butane tanks not to exceed 85% of the tanks capacity."
