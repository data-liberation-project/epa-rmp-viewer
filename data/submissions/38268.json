We use a combination of accidental release prevention and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees, the public, and the protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities we have designed and implemented.  This includes the following:\n\nA description of our facility and uses of EPA's RMP regulated substances at our facility.\nAn overview of our accidental release prevention programs.\nA five-year history of accidental releases for regulated substances.\nAn overview of our emergency response program.\nAn overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental regulated chemical releases.\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nVopak Terminal Galena Park Inc. is a for-hire liquid storage terminal and drumming warehouse facility.  Chemical and refined petroleum products represent the majority of the chemical stored, drummed, handled and transported in this facility.  Chemicals are received into and transported from the facility via ship, barge, tank truck, and tank car.  At this time, the facility plans to store one EPA RMP regulated chemical, Ethylenediamine (EDM), CAS# 107-15-3.  We do not drum EDM - we only unload, handle palletized loads, store the palletized drums in a warehouse, and ship the drums out as orders are received.\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nWe take a systematic, proactive approach to the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  Our management system addresses each key feature of a successful prevention program, including process hazards analysis, mechanical integrity assurance, management of change, compliance audits, "

Our company and our employees are committed to the standards that are established for the way we conduct our everyday business activities with our specific accountabilities and controls to ensure that we are meeting our own high standards for accidental chemical release prevention.\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no releases in the past five years of any EPA RMP regulated substances.\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nWe maintain various contingency plans which address federal, state and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning.  Our program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting our employees, the public, and the environment during emergencies.  Furthermore, we coordinate our plans with the community emergency response plan.\n\nWe are using this information to help ensure that our emergency response plan and the community emergency response plan address all reasonable contingency cases.  Our accidental release prevention programs and our contingency planning efforts help us to effectively manage the hazards that are presented to our employees, the public, and the environment.\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nWe plan to segregate EDM from other chemicals stored in our warehouse, especially those identified as having potential adverse consequences if mixed with EDM - such as acids and chlorinated hydrocarbons.  The hazards associated with mixing these chemicals [violent chemical reactions] will be communicated to operators so they understand the importance of isolating such chemicals from EDM."
