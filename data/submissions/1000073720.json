Process safety equipment at the Edison Site includes relief devices such as relief valves and rupture disks, vents, check valves, quench systems, automatic shutoffs, interlocks, keyed bypasses, grounding and purge systems. Mitigation systems in the accidental release prevention program include, enclosures, scrubbers, dikes, sumps, sprinkler systems, deluge systems, water curtains, a hazmat foam system, firefighting foam systems, mineral oil dump systems, neutralization and fire water containment system. Leak detection systems are installed in process areas to detect toxic or flammable leaks and oxygen deficient environments. The preventative maintenance program conducts inspections and tests to assure the operation of preventive devices. Management of Change assures that all changes are reviewed for their hazards before implementation and considers the need for process safety equipment, mitigation equipment, and leak detection systems. All incidents are investigated to determine the root cause and corrective actions are implemented to prevent future incidents.\nd) In the last five years, the Edison site has had one major accident, in which 660 lb"

The initiating cause of the event was an equipment failure allowing for unintended reaction.\ne) The site emergency response program meets the requirements of the EPA Integrated Contingency Plan Guidance. The plan defines the response organization, coordination with the local emergency response committee, equipment, response procedures, training, notification procedures, and drills. The plan is updated according to the recommendations from the system deficiencies uncovered by periodic drills and incident reports.\nf) Planned changes to improve safety \u0096 To improve the emergency response capabilities of the site, operations and other select personnel have received enhanced emergency response trainings, including basic fire brigade, hazmat, confined space rescue, and CPR/first aid/AED training. New operating buildings on the site have been built with safety features including foam suppression and water curtains. A new quick attack response vehicle is planned to be added to the site to further increase the on-site response capability."
