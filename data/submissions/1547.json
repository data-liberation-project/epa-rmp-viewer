EXECUTIVE  SUMMARY\n\n\n1.1 Company's Prevention and Emergency Response Approach (philosophical statement representative of a company policy). \n\nPlastomer Corporation has coordinated its Risk Management Plan with the LEPC.\n\n\n1.2 Description of the Stationary Source\n\n7 The facility manufactures polyurethane foam by the vigorous mechanical mixing of polyols with toluene    diisocyanate (TDI) along with water, catalyst and surfactants. The resultant polymeric network is expanded with carbon dioxide formed in the reaction between the water and TDI.\n7 The facility stores and uses quantities of toluene diisocyanate in excess of the threshold quantities specified in the 40 CFR 68.115, which is 10,000 pounds.\n7 The toluene diisocyanate is stored in a storage tank, described below:\n\n7 One 10,000 gallon carbon steel TDI (toluene diisocyanate) storage tank located inside the facility. This storage tank is surrounded by a containment wall or dike. \n\n7 TDI is pumped from the storage tank to the production line where it is mixed with other chemicals and reacts to form polyurethane foam.\n\n\n1.3 Description of the worst-case release scenario\n\nThe worst-case release analyzed was the loss of the entire contents of the 10,000 gallon TDI storage tank. After using the Areal Locations of Hazardous Atmospheres Model (ALOHA), Plastomer Corporation  determined that the distance to the endpoint would not impact a public receptor.  The release rate and distance to endpoint stated in Section 2. Toxic Worst Case are higher than the values actually calculated by the ALOHA software.  The limitations of this RMP Submit Software required Plastomer Corporation to enter values that were higher than calculated by the ALOHA software.  The actual value calculated for the distance to the endpoint is considered to be company confidential.\n\n\n1.4 Description of general prevention program\nNo prevention program is needed since Plastomer Corp. is a Program 1 facility.\n\nThe actions taken at the facility to preve"

      "SummaryText": "nt accidental releases include the following:\n- periodic inspection of all lines, pumps, valves for leaks, corrosion, operational failures\n- manual inspection of the tank levels prior to unloading to ensure adequate space is available\n- unloading operations are not left unattended\n- unloading operations performed only by trained personnel\n- storage tanks are located indoors\n- a containment wall or dike surrounds the TDI storage tank\n\n1.5 Description of Any Accident History (5 year previous period with off-site impacts)\nThere have been no accidental releases of TDI at the facility in the past 5 years that have caused any on-site or off-site impacts.\n\n\n1.6 Description of your Emergency Response Program\nNone required. The local LEPC has been informed of the dangers associated with TDI and has been provided with sufficient information to enable them to deal with a release incident."
