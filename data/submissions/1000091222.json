The facility has been expanded and is now capable of producing 23,000 barrels per day (BPD) of renewable diesel. The feedstock consists mainly of refined animal fats, recycled cooking oil, and corn oil. The facility includes a Pretreatment Unit, which removes metals and other contaminants from the feedstock. DGD also includes a small wastewater treating unit, rail and truck unloading facility, and tank farm area.\n\n\n\nDGD also includes the Ecofining Unit, which utilizes a UOP licensed technology, that uses Hydrotreating and Isomerization processes to convert the fats/oil feedstock into Green Diesel. This process contains approximately 160,000 pounds of flammables as the maximum intended inventory of vessels and piping and is therefore covered under the PSM and RMP regulations.\n\n \n\nThis plan has been updated and resubmitted in accordance with 40 CFR 68.190 to address the following:\n\n1.    Review and certification of the RMP once every five years\n\n2.    Review and updates, where necessary, to the chemical quantities in the covered process to reflect current maximum inventories,\n\n3.    Updates to all prevention program data and other facility information\n\n4.    Review and update of the Offsite Consequence Analysis\n\n\n\nThe purpose of this plan is to provide information about regulated substances at the facility, policies and programs to prevent accidental releases, emergency response planning, accident history and planned changes to improve safety at the facility. Each of these aspects are summarized below and fully detailed in the RMP.\n\n\n\nPrevention Policies and Programs\n\n\n\nDGD operates under the strict guidelines of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management ("

Copies of the Emergency Response Plan as well as ERT exercises are coordinated with the DEP Director as applicable.\n\n\n\nAccident History \n\n\n\nThere have been no accidental releases in the past 5 years that resulted in on site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering-in-place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nContinuing compliance with PSM/RMP guidelines and regulations forms the basis of DGD's commitment to ensuring a safe working environment for employees as well as a safe community. The facility benefits from the use of the latest technology in its processes as well as the assurance of the finest training of its employees. Specific actions that will improve safety include:\n\n\n\n-    Evaluation of process changes using Management of Change procedures to ensure safety and health\n\n-    Continual improvement in safety standards through application of the PHA process\n\n-    Use of process controls such as vents, relief valves, check valves, scrubbers, flares, shutoffs, interlocks, alarms, quench and purge systems and rupture disks to prevent or minimize releases\n\n-    Use of mitigation systems such as sprinkler systems and deluge systems to reduce the impacts of any accidental releases\n\n-    Use of process area detectors "
