      "SummaryText": "ACE ethanol is primarily a producer of fuel ethanol; secondary products include dried distillers grains, liquified carbon dioxide, dry ice and corn oil.  ACE Ethanol is committed to operating it's facility in a safe manner for the sake of both the employees and the surrounding community.\n\nACE Ethanol has two chemical products that are required to be included in this Risk Management Plan: aqueous ammonia and the natural gasoline that is used as a denaturant for ethanol.  Anhydrous ammonia is also present at the site, however the quantity stored and used on site has been reduced to lower the risk posed by this chemical.  ACE Ethanol has completed a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) to identify potential risks associated with the use and storage of these chemicals and has implemented the recommended changes that resulted from this PHA.\n\nDuring the 5 year reporting period, ACE Ethanol has not had a reportable release from the facility.  We believe that this record is largely due to the rigorous training program each of our operators and maintenance staff is required to complete prior to working independently within the facility.  This training includes written coursework, on the job training with experienced staff, and a final evaluation by supervisors and the Operations Manager.\n\nIn the event of a serious release from the facility, ACE Ethanol has coordinated response activities with the Stanley Fire Department, and Chippewa County.  Contract response services are also available from Waste Research and Reclaimation of Eau Claire, Wisconsin."
