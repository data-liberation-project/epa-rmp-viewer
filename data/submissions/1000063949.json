The Facility Policy:\r\n\r\nThe owners, management, and employees of Poole Chemical Slaton, TX are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, and other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\r\n\r\n2. Facility Information:\r\n\r\nA) The activity at the facility is the storage of anhydrous ammonia.\r\nB) Anhydrous ammonia is used in the production of liquid fertilizer.\r\n\r\n3. The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario:\r\n\r\nA) The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of the storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes. The maximum quantity released would be 130,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 0.14 mg/L; basis: ERPG-2) is 6.9 miles.\r\n\r\nB) The alternative release scenario based on the five-year accident history (or the most likely potential incident) is a release from a break in a transfer hose. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 0.14 mg/L; basis: ERPG-2) is 1.8 miles.\r\n\r\n4. The accidental release prevention program:\r\n\r\nThe facility has referred to the provisions of CGA G2.1-2014 Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia (an American National Standard) and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.\r\n\r\n5. The Five-year Accident History:\r\n\r\nA) The facility operates under PSM Standards\r\nB) There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; n"
