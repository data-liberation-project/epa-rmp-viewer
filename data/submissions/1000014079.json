This commitment is inherent to our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with our regulated processes. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible accidental releases of regulated substances. However, if such an accidental release does occur, we are coordinated with this facilityA?s Hazmat Teams, Howard County Fire Department, and the Howard County Emergency Management Agency for emergency response support.\n\n- Stationary source and regulated substance handled.\n\nDreyer's Grand Ice Cream, is located at 9090 Whiskey Bottom Road, Laurel, MD 20723.

There are two separate anhydrous ammonia refrigeration systems at this site.  The original system is refered to as the \"south side\" and the newer system is refered to as the \"north side\".  The two systems are located at opposite ends of the facility and are not connected.  Both systems use anhydrous ammonia in closed loop refrigeration system as a heat removal media.  \n\nDreyer's Grand Ice Cream has developed and implemented a Risk Management Program (RMP), a Process Safety Management (PSM) and an Emergency Preparedness System to prevent and respond to ammonia releases.   \n          \n- The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nDreyer's Grand Ice Cream has integrated various engineering and administrative control mechanisms to eliminate and/or minimize any possible upsets/releases from this facility including; electronic ammonia detection and alarms located through out the facility, safety devices and interlocks that will shutdown equipment e"
