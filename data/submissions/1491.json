Treadaway\n                      Abilene, Texas 79602\nLocation: Trent, Texas\nFor Further Information Contact:   J.W. Vinson, Owner\n\nRisk Management Plan - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n     1.   The Facility Policy\n     \n     The owners, management, and employees of Abilene Ag Service & Supply, Inc. are\ncommitted to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental\nrelease should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department company, the\nlocal emergency planning committee, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize\nthe impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n     2.   Facility Information.\n\n     - The primary activity at the facility is storage for sale to farmers.\n     - Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as fertilizer\nfor crop production nutrients.\n     - The maximum quantity stored would be 53,000 pounds in a 12,000 gallon storage tank.\n\n     3.   The Worst-Case Release Scenario and the Alternate Release Scenario.\n\n               a.   The worst-case scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage\n          tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum released would be 53,000\n          pounds, which represents the volume of the tank at 85 percent capacity as limited\n          by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200\n          ppm) is 1.5 miles in a rural area.\n               b.   The alternate release scenario, based on the most likely potential incident, is a\n          release from a break in a hose.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to\n          200 ppm) is .6 miles in a rural area.\n\n     4.   The Accidental Release Program.\n     \n     The facility has implemented the provisions of Safety Requirements for the Storage and\nHandling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1, published by The American"

The Five-year Accident History.\n     \n     There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia at our facility.\n\n     6.   The Emergency Response Program.\n\n     The Facility has:\n               a.   A written emergency plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38;\n               b.   Provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-\n          to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n               c.   A written emergency response program, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29\n          CFR 1910-120, including pre-emergency planning and employee training.\n\n     7.   Planned Changed to Improve Safety.\n     \n     Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are\nperformed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific\nanhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time.\n\n     8.
