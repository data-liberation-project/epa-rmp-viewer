FMC employees receive training in the areas of operations and safety to minimize the potential of a release due to human error.\n\nThis facility is on an approximately 6 acre parcel of land in a rural area approximately 1 mile from the west edge of Bremen.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, transferred and stored, and distributed as fertilizer to our farmer customers.  The maximum quantity stored at any time is 40,800 gal. or approximately 210,936 lbs.  This quantity is the sum of the quantities held by a 16,000 gal. tank and a 30,000 gal.  \n\nThe worst case release scenario would have all the ammonia released from the 30,000 gal. tank within 10 minutes and reaching a toxic endpoint of 200 ppm at 1.3 miles from the tank.  Due to the low population density of the area relatively few people would be affected by a release.\n\nAs an alternative release scenario in the vent of equipment failure, the amount of ammonia released before mitigation would reach a toxic end point of 200 ppm at 1.2 miles from the tank.  Again, this would impact a relatively small number of residents due to the low population density of the area.\n\nWe have instituted procedures for storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia as required by OSHA and the Indiana State Chemist into our plan.\n\nWe have not had a release resulting in any of the criteria stated in 40 CFR 68.48 in the past 5 years.\n\nOur Emergency Response Plan is on file with the required agencies and will be updated as changes take place.  Personnel are trained in the safe handling of anhydrous ammonia.  Local emergency response personnel are trained in prper response to a release of anhydrous ammonia.\n\nIt is the policy of FMC to remain proactive in the area of accident prevention and minimization of loss in the event of a release.  We will continue to conduct self audits and compliance inspections of "
