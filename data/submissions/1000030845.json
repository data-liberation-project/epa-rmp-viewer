This stationary source / facility's accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates procedures and management practices. Applicable procedures of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Prevention Program are followed. The facility's emergency policy involves the preparation of plans tailored to the facility and to the emergency response services available in the community.\r\n\r\nThe facility spill prevention policy seeks to implement appropriate controls to prevent accidental releases of regulated flammable substances. In the event such a release occurs facility personnel are prepared to work with the local fire department, Local Emergency Planning Commission, and other authorities to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\r\n\r\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nThe Bar X Dew Point Control Facility is located 1.3 miles northeast of the intersection of 2 8/10 th Road and U.S. Hwy. 6 & 50 in rural Mesa County, Colorado.  The facility removes NGLs from field natural gas and stores NGLs in an above ground, pressurized vessel. NGL is a flammable pressurized liquid mixture of aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons including regulated flammables methane ethane, propane, butane isobutane, isopentane and pentane. There are no threshold quantities of toxic substances present. This facility was designed and constructed in accord with applicable state and federal regulations.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE AND PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe necessary steps have been taken to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements of 40 CFR part 68.
