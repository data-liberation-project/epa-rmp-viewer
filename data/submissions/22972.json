As part of this commitment, Westvaco has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility.  One component of this system is a Risk Management Program (RMP) that helps manage risks at Westvaco, and also complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).  This document is intended to satisfy the RMP Plan requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at Westvaco.\n\nThe risk management program at Westvaco consists of three elements:\n\n1. A hazard assessment to help understand:\n   (a) the potential offsite consequences of hypothetical accidental releases\n   (b) accidents that have occurred during the last five years associated with the use of substances\n        regulated by the RMP rule (regulated substances) - see topics 1.3 and 1.5\n\n2. A prevention program to help maintain and safely operate the processes containing more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance (covered processes) - see topic 1.4\n\n3. An emergency response program to help respond to accidental releases of regulated substances from covered processes - see topic 1.6\n\nInformation further describing these elements is provided in this RMP Plan.\n\nAlthough the risk management program at Westvaco helps provide assurance that the facility is maintained and operated in a safe manner, it is only one component of the safety program at Westvaco.  In fact, Westvaco has a comprehensive safety program in place establishing many levels of safeguards against release of a hazardous substance and injuries or damage from a release of a hazardous substance.\n\nWestvaco limits the use of hazardous substances.

Response activities have also been discussed with the LEPC.\n\n\n1.2\tWestvaco and Regulated Substances\n\nWestvaco is an integrated pulp and paperboard mill primarily involved in the manufacture of bleached paperboard products.  As part of this manufacturing process, Westvaco handles Chlorine Dioxide in sufficient quantity to be covered by the RMP rule, as shown below.\n\nProcess                                Program Level                Regulated Substance              Process \n\nChlorine Dioxide Generation          3                         Chlorine Dioxide                    78000 lb.     \n\n\n\n1.3\tOffsite Consequence Analysis\n\nWestvaco performed an offsite consequence analysis to estimate the potential for an accidental release of a regulated substance to affect the public or the environment.  The offsite consequence analysis consists of evaluating a worst-case release scenario and alternative release scenario.  Westvaco does not expect a worst-case release scenario to ever occur.  The alternative release scenario was selected to help the local emergency planning committee improve the community emergency response plan.  An alternative release scenario represents a release that:\n\t(1)\tmight occur at a facility like Westvaco\n(2) would result in a conservative estimate of potential offsite consequences if the \n            release occurred\n\nThe main objective of performing the offsite consequence analysis is to determine the distance at which certain effects might occur to the public because of an accidental release (called the endpoint distance).  The following effects could occur at the endpoint distance.  At distances less than the endpoint distance, the effects would be greater; at distances greater than the endpoint dista"

Some people who are particularly susceptible to the substance released could be incapacitated.\n\nThe RMP rule includes specific requirements for the worst-case and alternative release scenarios that must be reported by Westvaco.  These requirements are:\n\n\u00b7 one worst-case release scenario for the class of toxic substances in Program 3\n  Processes (chlorine dioxide)\n\n\u00b7 one alternative release scenario for the toxic substance in a Program 3 process\n  (chlorine dioxide)\n\nThe following information summarizes the offsite consequence analysis performed by Westvaco.\n\n 1.3.1\tProgram 3 Processes - Toxic Substances\n\nThe worst-case release for toxic substances is a loss of containment of both Chlorine Dioxide storage tanks, which evaporates and forms a vapor cloud.  The maximum distance to the toxic endpoint concentration is greater than 25 miles.  The U.S. Census indicates that 242,313 people live within the 25-mile radius from the storage vessel.  This 25-mile radius contains public receptors of all types defined by the EPA in the RMP regulation.  The receptors include schools, hospitals, industrial developments, and residential developments.  The primary environmental receptors within the 25 mile radius per USGS maps are Big Thicket National Preserve, E.O. Siecke State Forest, and Sabine Island State Wildlife Management Area.\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario for chlorine dioxide is shearing off a one-inch sample line on the discharge of a chlorine dioxide solution (1wt%) pump that transfers solution to/from the chlorine dioxide absorber to storage.   This scenario assumes that the solution is released through the hole for the 60 minutes before workers detect the release and isola"

Several public receptors are also located within this distance (e.g., the local school, part of the Pinefield subdivision, the Westvaco park baseball field, and several small businesses).  No environmental receptors are within this distance.\n\n\n1.4\tAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical - Specific Prevention Steps\n\nSince its inception in 1953, Westvaco has used a prevention program to help prevent accidental releases of hazardous substances.  Beginning in 1992, Westvaco formalized this prevention program for the  Chlorine Dioxide Generation and Storage processes to comply with the 13 elements of the OSHA process safety management (PSM) prevention program.  In 1996, the EPA RMP rule established prevention program requirements:\n\nProgram 3 - essentially the same as OSHA PSM, except that the program also focuses on protecting the public and the environment\n\nThe following sections briefly describe the elements of Westvaco's prevention program that address the EPA RMP rule prevention program requirements.\n\n 1.4.1\tProgram 3 Prevention Program\n\nThe Westvaco Program 3 prevention program, which applies to the Chlorine Dioxide Generation and Storage processes, consists of the following 12 elements:\n\na.\tProcess Safety Information.  Westvaco maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to help ensure safe operations of the Westvaco processes.  These documents address:\n(1)\tphysical properties of hazardous substances handled at Westvaco\n(2)\toperating parameters of the equipment at Westvaco\n(3)\tdesign basis and configuration of the equipment at Westvaco.\n\nWestvaco ensures that this process safety information is available to"
