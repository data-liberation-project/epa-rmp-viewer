Emergency response policies include mitigation when possible within the abilities and training of the plant staff.  Should these efforts be insufficient, further intervention would be in active cooperation with the Clinton County Emergency Management (LEPC) and Local Emergency First Responders.  Sethness Products is an active member of the Clinton County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).\n\nSethness Products Company produces caramel color for the soft drink and other food process industries by processing corn syrup.  29% aqueous ammonia is used as a reactant with the raw corn syrup to achieve the color desired by the customer.  \n\nTwo aqueous ammonia tanks exist that hold up to 212,654 pounds of 29% aqueous ammonia at ambient temperature.  Distribution piping containing 29% aqueous ammonia contributes a negligible amount of additional volume. \n\nThe programs in place to prevent hazardous releases focus primarily on prevention by process and equipment design, an aggressively monitored and updated preventive maintenance program, and daily equipment inspections.  The facility personnel work in concert to insure that design and system components are properly selected and installed for safe operation.  All proposed changes are reviewed by plant engineering staff to insure that system integrity is not compromised.  During this review, any activities such as inspection or maintenance are specified and integrated into plant operations.  Given the small facility staff, outside experts frequently provide or review design changes to the systems.  In addition to an aggressive safety program based on Job Safety Analysis, the facility is in compliance with the Process Safety Management (PSM) rules.  The plant safety program assures"

      "SummaryText": " that management, engineering, and operations are informed of the hazards posed by 29% aqueous ammonia, and the actions required to maintain the system in safe condition.  The safety program has the full support of labor and management.\n\nIn the unlikely event of a release, facility personnel would assess the seriousness of the problem and take appropriate action.  Actions if required could include evacuation of the facility, notification of emergency first responders, or a call for help to the Quad Cities HazMat Team.  In order to provide rapid response to a problem, Sethness employees have been trained in the early detection of small leaks and catastrophic events that could result in large releases.  Employees, upon detection of incidental leak conditions, have training and equipment to make emergency repairs.  In the event of catastrophic failure due to a tornado or major equipment malfunction, activation of the community emergency response plan would be the primary response.\n\nWithin the last 10 years there has been no release of 29% aqueous ammonia that has had an impact on off-site receptors.  On January 28, 2001, a small release of 29% aqueous ammonia occurred as a result of a cracked pump suction pipe.  The release resulted in no on-site or off-site impact.  As a result of this release there were no injuries reported or property damage.   Minor releases that have occurred are due to maintenance repairs.  All leaks whether minor or small are always aggressively followed up to prevent reoccurrence. \n\nThe emergency response plan is designed to assure the safety of Sethness employees and  neighbors.  Once the safety of employees is assured, abatement of the release will be addressed.  Preventing hazardous vapor releases is the primary goal.  This will be accomplished by replacing or repairing faulty and damaged equipment, or through the application of temporary A?bandages.A?
