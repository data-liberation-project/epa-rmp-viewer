ACCESS TO THE SITE  IS RESTRICTED TO AUTHORIZED  FACILITY\nEMPLOYEES,  AUTHORIZED  MANAGEMENT PERSONELL, AND AUTHORIZED CONTRACTORS.\nTHE MAXIMUM QUANITY OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA  THAT CAN BE STORED WOULD BE 84,000 POUNDS.  \nTHE WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO WOULD BE THE RELEASE OF THE TOTAL CONTENTS  OF THE STORAGE TANK  RELEASED AS GAS OVER 10 MINUTES. THE MAXIMUM  AMOUNT  RELEASED  WOULD BE 84,000 POUNDS, WHICH REPRESENTS THE VOLUME OF THE LARGEST STORAGE TANK AS LIMITED BY DESIGN STANDARDS.  THE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT OF .14MG/L FOR THE WORST CASE SCENARIO IS 2.1 MILES.\nTHE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO BASED ON THE MOST LIKELY POTENTIAL INCIDENT IS A RELEASE FROM A BREAK IN A TRANSFER HOSE. THE DISTANCE TO THE ENDOINT OF .14MG/L FOR THE ALTERNATIVE SCENARIO IS .20 MILES.
