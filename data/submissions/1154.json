      "SummaryText": "A risk management plan has been implemented at Wheeler Brothers Grain Company's Watonga, Oklahoma facility to provide a contingency plan in the event of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  This plan has been developed to prevent accidental release through responsible handling and proper storage of the product, ensure proper training and safety equipment are provided for our employees, and to make the surrounding community aware of our preparedness in the event of an accident.\n\nWheeler Brother's Watonga facility is primarily a grain elevator as well as a fertilizer and chemical dealership.  The only regulated substance which qualifies under the Clean Air Act of 1990 in quantities abovethe minimum threshhold is anhydrous ammonia.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for application as a crop production nutrient.  One 18,000 gallon storage tank is located at this site which never contains anhydrous ammonia at more than 85% of capacity.\n\nAs required by EPA guidelines the following worst-case release and alternative release scenarios have been devised as follows:\n\n     Worst-case Scenario:  Failure or rupture of 18,000 gallon storage tank containing 80,000 pounds\n     of anhydrous ammonia (85% of capacity) released over a 10 minute period.  Under the worst\n     weather conditions the contents could travel .80 miles (Degadis model) before dispersing enough\n     to no longer pose a hazard to the public.\n\n     Alternative release Scenario:  Failure of 1\" transfer hose and the release of 3,000 pounds of\n     anhydrous ammonia over a 2 minute period.  Under the worst weather conditions the contents\n     could travel .20 miles (Degadis model) before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to\n     the public.\n\nWheeler Brothers accidental release prevention program at the Watonga location falls under the Occupational Safety and Health Administration standards at 29 CFR 1910.111 for the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.

Maintaining our facilities, equipment and employee training program in accordance with these guidelines is merely a starting point.  We have taken additional steps to prevent accidental releases.  These include the installation of valve locks and a security fence around the storage tank and fill station to prevent unauthorized access.  Also, all nurse tanks are stored in a fenced area to prevent theft and vandalism.\n\nThere has been one accidental release of anhydrous ammonia at this location in the past five years that resulted in injury to one employee.  On 8/27/94 a transport driver delivering a load of product inadvertently turned a valve on a transfer hose spraying a small amount of NH3 into the face of a Wheeler employee.  No permanent damage was sustained by our employee as he was wearing personal protective equipment.  However, he did miss two days of work due to injury to his mouth and nasal passages.\n\nAs part of our emergency respose program, this facility has a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38 and has provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time.\n\n          Wheeler Brothers Grain Company\n          501 W Russworm\n          P.O.
