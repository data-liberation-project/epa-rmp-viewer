The Facility Policy\n\n     The owners, management and employees of Lewistown Propane & Fertilizer Co. are committed to safety and prevention of any accidental releases of propane or anhydrous ammonia.  In the event of any accidental releases, we work with local DES as well as fire departments and law enforcement agencies.  We fund local training exercises on a yearly basis.\n\n2.  Facility Information\n\n     The primary activity of the Lewistown branch site is the receiving, storing and delivering of propane and anhydrous ammonia.\n\n     In Lewistown, propane and anhydrous ammonia are received, stored and distributed for direct application for home heating and crop production respectively.\n\n     The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia stored at Lewistown would be 131,325 pounds in  a 30,000 gallon tank.\n\n     The maximum quantity of propane stored would be 172,922 pounds stored in one 18,000 and one 30,000 gallon tank that sit side-by-side.\n\n3.  The worst-case release scenario.\n\n     Anhydrous Ammonia:\n\n     The worst-case release scenario for anhydrous ammonia would be the release of the total contents of the 30,000 gallon storage tank released over a 10 minute period.  The maximum quantity released would be 131,325 pounds, which represents the volume of the storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 4.4 miles.\n\n     Propane:\n\n     The worst-case release scenarion for propane would be the release of the two tanks ofer a 10-minute period.  This would release a maximum of 172,922 pounds.  This represents a maximum of 85 percent of both tanks as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .4 miles.\n\n4.  The accidental release prevention program.\n\n     Anhydrous Ammonia:\n\n     The facility has implemented the provisions of \"S"

The Five-year Accident History.\n\n     Propane & Anhydrous Ammonia\n\n     a.  There have been no accidental releases of propane or anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\n\n          -  have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor\n\n          -  to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place,\n             property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6.  The emergency response program.\n\n          -  The facility has:\n\n              a.  provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and communtiy right-to-know\n                   information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\n7.  Planned changes to improve safety.\n\n     Safety improvements is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific anhydrous safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
