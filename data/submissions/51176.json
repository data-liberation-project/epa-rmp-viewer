(Evraz Stratcor), we use anhydrous ammonia (AA) as a reactant in the recovery of vanadium products and chlorine (Cl2) and titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4) in the halide manufacturing process. AA, Cl2, and TiCl4 are regulated substances under the Accidental Release Program regulations, which governs the Risk Management Plan (RMP).  Certain safety precautions must be observed when handling these chemicals to prevent unnecessary human exposure and to reduce the threat to employees and nearby members of the community.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and state rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle these chemicals, training of our personnel who operate the processes, and the safety devices inherent in the design of their storage vessels. \r\n\r\nOur emergency response program presents a logical coordinated course of action to be followed in case of an emergency.  The program utilizes information from the Emergency Response Guidebook by the Department of Transportation.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of the local fire authority and notification of any potentially affected neighbors.\r\n\r\n2.0  Evraz Stratcor, Inc. and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nOur Hot Springs facility includes a vanadium recovery process and a halides manufacturing process. AA is used to aid in the recovery of the vanadium product in a crystallization circuit. Cl2 is introduced into the vanadium halide production process as a reactant. TiCI4 is blended with vanadium oxytrichloride to form vanadium-titanium mixtures.  AA, Cl2, and TiCI4 are the only chemicals that EPA has identified on the RMP Rule Toxic Substances list and that are stored above threshold quantities. Evraz Stratcor has no flammable substances regulated by Part 68.  Storage conditions for the toxic chemicals regulated under the RMP Rule by Part 68 are provided in the following"

Evraz Stratcor's PSM program follows the requirements of the OSHA standards (29 CFR 1910.119) that are given in Part 68. Although the PSM program has been developed to follow the guidelines of the OSHA PSM standard, it should be noted that the Evraz Stratcor facility is under the jurisdiction of the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA).The requirements for our prevention program take a proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of regulated substances that pose a danger to human health and the environment. This prevention program is a vital part of our everyday operations as safety is our chief priority. Our program employs high standards and includes the following steps and programs that lead to successful accident prevention: \r\n\r\n3.1  Process Safety Information\r\n\r\nProcess safety includes information pertaining to the hazards of the substances in the process, information pertaining to the technology of the process, and information pertaining to the equipment in the process.

Recommendations resulting from the PHA are promptly addressed following the completion of the review. The resolutions to the recommendations are performed and documented as soon as possible and a schedule of the completion of all resolutions to recommendations resulting from the PHA is developed and kept on-file in the PSM program with the PHA. \r\n\r\n3.3  Operating Procedures\r\n\r\nThe PSM program has developed and documented procedures for each operating phase of Evraz Stratcor's processes covered by the PSM program. Standard operating procedures (SOPs) for each department are kept on the server for electronic access. SOPs are also readily accessible to employees. The SOPs are revised as needed as part of their ongoing review and reflect the most current operating practices of the covered processes.
