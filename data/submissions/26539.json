The scenario\n was based on the following criteria:\n\nVessel:                         High Pressure Receiver (HPR) 60\" x 16' 0\"\nAmount Released:        13,000 lbs.\nDuration of Release:     10 minutes\nRelease Rate:              1,300 lbs/min\nWind Speed:                1.5 meter/sec\nAtmospheric Stability:   F\nTopography:                 Rural\nPassive Mitigation:       None\n\nThe High Pressure Receiver is located in the compressor room of the facility. Since it is adjacent to an overhead door, and sometimes left open, no passive mitigation was considered. Using the tables in the \"RMP Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration\", the toxic endpoint was calculated at 1.8 miles. Affected within this radius is a population of 254, one school, a city park, two lakes, residential homes, and retail stores.  \n\nCensus information was obtained using \"Landview III\" software.\n\nAlternative release scenario for a toxic substance:\n\nThe alternative release toxic endpoint was also determined using the EPA's \"RMP Guidance for\nAmm"

The scenario was based on the following\ncriteria:\n\nScenario:                          Relief Valve Lift\nRelease Rate:                   100 lb/min\nDuration of Release:          15 min\nAmount Released:             1500 lbs\nWind Speed:                     3 meter/sec\nAtmospheric Stability:        D\nTopgraphy:                        Rural\nMitigation:                         None\n\nToxic endpoint for this scenario was calculated to be  0.20 miles. Affected within this radius is a population of 13. Public receptors include residential housing.  \n\nAccidental Release and Emergency Response Policies:\n\nM. G. Waldbaum has established an in-house emergency response team to quickly respond to and handle releases of Anhydrous Ammonia. The established steps include initial training under the OSHA regulation 29 CFR 1910.120 HAZWOPER. The facility has also established annual retraining for all personnel that are on the HAZMAT Team as well as periodic spill drills and plant wide evacuation drills to assure all employees are prepared in the event of an emergency. M. G. Waldbaum is also coordinating efforts with the local Volunteer Fire Department to establish a joint training program and the County Local Emergency Planning Committee. These established plans and procedures shall be periodically reviewed to assure that they are current and up to date.\n\nEmergency Response Program:\n\nM. G. Waldbaum has trained the refrigeration operators and selected production and office personnel in Hazardous Waste Operation and Emergency Response 29 CFR 1910.120. The trained personnel will access each release situation and determine the appropriate emergency response to initiate. This could be by simply tightening a packing nut or flange bolt or initiating a system shut down. M. G. Wldbaum has  established written operating procedures for the ammonia refrigeration system and has included in those procedures the Emergency Shutdown and isolation in the e"

This team will coordinate their efforts with the outside emergency services to assure the safety of all.\n\nFive Year Accident History: \n\nWe have had two accidental release of ammonia in the past five years. No one offsite was injured and there were no evacuations.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps:\nM. G. Waldbaum has not only complied with the EPA Risk Management Program but also the OSHA Process Safety Management regulation to assure that the Ammonia Refrigeration System is well maintained and employees are properly trained and periodically retrained to assure they are kept up to date on any changes and new operations that may effect them. In addition, to maintain the mechanical integrity and safety of this process, this facility practices the following industry codes and standards:\n \nASME Boiler & Pressure Valve Codes\nANSI B31.3 Piping Code\nIIAR industry guideline for safety and good engineering practices\nNFPA guidelines for fire protection equipment\n  \nThrough regular audits, training, maintenance, testing and inspection programs M. G. Waldbaum has established a history of safe operation and that community emergency action plans are current and training with community services is done for a safe response in the event of an accidental release."
