      "SummaryText": "LAKE SALTONSTALL FACILITY\n\nThe Lake Saltonstall Water Treatment Plant (Lake Saltonstall) has two independent chlorine injection systems that are fed through a one ton container.  There is only one ton container of chlorine on line at any given time.  The system is operated under vacuum using gaseous chlorine.  There is a vacuum regulator to automatically switch from one injection system to the other when the pressure drops and the gas container is empty.  Each one ton container is equipped with a spring loaded normally closed valve attached to the container head.  If the system loses vacuum (due to a down stream malfunction, leak, etc.), the valve shuts and chlorine addition is automatically stopped.  The valve is a normally closed, static control device that requires no electrical power to operate.\n\nThe facility has three chlorine detectors to monitor leakage in the chlorine storage and chlorinator rooms.  One detector in the chlorine storage room gives a digital readout of the atmospheric chlorine concentration.  The sensor is located in the storage room, but the readout is located outside this area. Chlorine sensors are located at six inches above floor level in both rooms.  The detector will alarm at the main control room panel and automatically start the dry scrubber in the affected area.  Currently the facility has two building exhaust fans to vent the chlorine gas from the buildings and to provide a minor level of workers safety.  A dry scrubber system will be installed and operational prior to June 21, 1999.  A chlorine release inside the building will be drawn into the scrubber and neutralized using a solid adsorbent.  The scrubber has the capacity to adsorb one full ton container of chlorine gas (2000 pounds of chlorine).\n\nThe Lake Saltonstall Facility normally stores a maximum of eight one ton containers at the site at any one time.  All containers are stored indoors in a building with doors, which seal.  During chlorine deliveries, the delivery truck bac"

The building doors are open and the chlorine containers are brought inside.\n\nNormally the chlorine storage and chlorinator rooms are sealed with doors that remain closed unless chlorine is being unloaded.  All chlorine containers are stored within the chlorine storage room.  If a chlorine leak is detected, the chlorine alarm will sound and the dry scrubber starts-up automatically.  Air inside the building is evacuated and fresh air is drawn into the building.  The scrubber will provide a negative pressure within the building and not allow the chlorine gas to leak outside\n\nA second safety feature in operation at this facility is vacuum regulator units.  These units are installed on the operating and standby containers.  If the valve loses vacuum because of a down stream leak on the vacuum side of the valve, the system will lose vacuum and automatically shut down.\n\nThe Worst Case chlorine release for this facility assumes that a one ton chlorine container ruptures during unloading outdoors in a rural area.  The container discharges a dense gas release under worst case meteorological conditions of F Stability, wind at 1.5 meters per second, and ambient temperature of 25:C.  All two thousand pounds contained in the one ton container are assumed released over ten (10) minutes. It is only presented for comparative purposes and for non-OSHA facilities to determine under which RMP Program Level the facility fits.\n\nThe Worst Case Impact Area is three (3.0) miles in radius (EPA CEPP Risk Management Program Guidance For Wastewater Treatment Plants EPA 550-B-98-010 October 1998).  There are about 70,000 people living in the Worst Case release area who could be affected by this release.  Located within this area are twenty two schools.  They are Branford Hills School, Brushy Plain School, Canoe Brook School, Gerrish Avenue School, Gillis School, Harbor Street School, Harrison Avenue School, Hays School, Highland School, Indian Neck School, Jepson Sc"

East Lawn, Green Lawn, Union and Branford Center cemeteries are also located in the area.  The worst case impact radius includes Tweed-New Haven Airport, Saint Andrew's Church, the Old Stone Church, a portion of Interstate 95 and a portion Amtrak's rail line.  The impact area affects recreational areas, parks, and several bodies of water including Long Island Sound and New Haven Harbor.  The worst case release will also affect major commercial and industrial areas. \n\nThe Most Likely release case is that no chlorine will be released outside of the clorinator building.  As indicated above there are three redundant levels of safety controls at the facility should a release occur.  First the dry scrubbing system would prevent any released chlorine gas from exiting the building.  Second, the vacuum regulator check unit would shut down and prevent additional gas from being released from the container.  Thirdly, an alarm would be sounded and the facility's emergency response team would be at the location within a few minutes to shut the system down if all of the automatic controls failed.\n\nIn order to evaluate a Most Likely release scenario that results in a release that is not contained, it is necessary to assume that all automatic controls fail and the on-site response team must shut off the leaking chlorine container.  Under those unlikely assumptions, the following release scenario was addressed.  A steady-state leak of up to 5 pounds per minute of chlorine either as a gaseous or a two-phase release. It should be noted that a completely filled one-ton container has a maximum gaseous discharge rate of about 500 pounds per day (0.35 pounds per minute).  Significant gaseous discharges above this rate will result in the container freezing up and the disc"

There are about 46 people living in the Most Likely Case release area who could be affected by this release.  There are no schools, hospitals, parks or other sensitive receptors located within this area.  In fact almost all of this release would be contained on the South Central Connecticut Regional Water Authority property.\n\nThe facility has not had an accidental release of chlorine from this covered process in the five years prior to the submission of this Risk Management Plan (RMP)."
