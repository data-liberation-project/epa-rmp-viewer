The emergency response program\r\n\r\nEmergency response is discussed in the Risk Management Program (RMP) binder of the complete program. BEN E. KEITH - NORTH LITTLE ROCK FACILITY has a detailed Emergency Response Plan for their facility. The purpose of this plan is to provide the means for rapidly determining the appropriate response for any emergency that may develop at the facility such as an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  The BEN E. KEITH - NORTH LITTLE ROCK FACILITY conducts scheduled drills of the emergency response plan. The Emergency Response Program is written, includes specific actions to be taken in response to an accidental release, includes procedures for informing the public and local agencies responsible for responding to an accidental release, and includes information on emergency health care.\r\n\r\n7. Planned changes to improve safety\r\n\r\nThe BEN E.

Refresher training and emergency response drills are conducted on a periodic basis to ensure personnel are equipped, trained, prepared, and practiced in responding to ammonia emergencies. \r\n\r\nAs a result of information gathered during preparation of this Risk Management Program, the BEN E. KEITH - NORTH LITTLE ROCK FACILITY is committing additional resources to further increase employee awareness and equipment reliability and to establish operator training and preventive maintenance programs. As a demonstration of the BEN E. KEITH - NORTH LITTLE ROCK FACILITY 's high degree of commitment to public safety and service, the BEN E.
