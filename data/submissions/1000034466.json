      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Taft Manufacturing Company facility located in Taft, California is subject to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Risk Management Program (RMP) for Accidental Release [40 CFR 68] because its Acrolein production, storage and loading process contains more than the threshold quantities of acrolein (CAS No. 107-02-8) and propylene (CAS No. 115-07-1). Acrolein is a toxic and flammable substance which is a liquid at ambient temperatures.  Propylene is a flammable substance which is a gas at ambient conditions, but is carefully stored under pressure as a liquid at the Taft Manufacturing Company.\r\n\r\nThe Taft Manufacturing Company uses air, propylene, and steam to produce specification-grade acrolein.  The raw materials are feed into a reactor with a catalyst that converts the propylene to acrolein.  The acrolein is separated from the other reactant by-products and residues in a series of quench columns, a stripper, and two distillation columns.  The acrolein is stored in three 1,000 gallon vessels and ultimately transferred to the railcar storage at the repackaging plant.\r\n\r\nA maximum inventory of 260,000 lbs of propylene can be on site at any one time with up to 130,000 lbs of propylene per railcar storage vessel. Acrolein is stored in three 1,000 gallon process tanks and dedicated railcars. The process generates approximately 660 lbs of acrolein, with up to 30,000 lbs present in a single iso-container.\r\n\r\nThe Taft Manufacturing Company utilizes standard operating procedures, training, administrative and engineering controls, and other safety practices to assure that acrolein and propylene are handled in a safe manner. There has not been a fire, explosion, or release event at the facility plant in the last five years which has impacted people or property offsite.  Details of the facility's extensive prevention program are summarized in Section 3.0.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Facilities\r\n\r\nWe at the Taft Ma"
