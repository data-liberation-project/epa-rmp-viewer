      "SummaryText": "The Southern Cayuga Lake Intermunicipal Water Commission (SCLIWC) Bolton Point Water System operates and maintains a water treatment plant located on East Shore Drive, in the Village of Lansing, New York.  The facility treats approximately 2.7 million gallons of water from Cayuga Lake per day and distributes it to five municipalities \u00c2\u00bf Towns of Dryden, Ithaca and Lansing, and Villages of Cayuga Heights and Lansing.  Bolton Point uses gaseous chlorine to disinfect the water before it is distributed to the general population.  The facility receives chlorine in one ton (2,000 pound) cylinders and stores up to a maximum of four cylinders at any given time.\nChlorine is a toxic substance regulated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency\u00c2\u00bfs Risk Management Program Rule (40 CFR part 68).  The Bolton Point facility has prepared a Risk Management Plan (RMP) in accordance with the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68.\n\nAccident Prevention\nThe Bolton Point facility has used chlorine in its disinfection system since becoming operational in 1976.  In that time facility personnel have taken considerable care in the storage and handling of chlorine.  The facility receives one-ton cylinders by truck, lifts them using a motorized crane designed specifically for moving one ton cylinders, and places them in saddles in a locked building.  Before accepting any chlorine cylinder, facility operators inspect it for leaks.  If a chlorine supplier delivers a cylinder that appears to be in less than good condition or the person who delivers the cylinder does not follow proper safety procedures, that supplier will be removed from the vendor list until that supplier verifies that they have corrected the deficiency.  The chlorine storage facility is used solely for chlorine storage and is not subject to daily traffic.  The chlorine storage area is only accessed when a cylinder is empty (approximately every 5 to 6 weeks).  Facility personnel check the storage area through a window inside t"

      "SummaryText": "he plant several times during each shift.  Continuous monitoring of the storage area is performed by means of a closed circuit TV camera.  Another camera monitors the approaches to the chlorine storage area.\nThe design of the chlorine feed system is very simple and inherently safe.  The system is operated under a constant vacuum as opposed to utilizing pressure from the chlorine cylinders.  The vacuum is generated at the point at which the chlorine is mixed with the water.  Without a constant vacuum, the valve on the cylinder-mounted chlorinator will close.  This prevents chlorine from entering the system when the system is not in use.  In the unlikely event of a break in the chlorine feed line, the system would lose vacuum, and the valve on the cylinder-mounted chlorinator would close automatically, stopping flow from the chlorine cylinder.\nChlorine sensors are located within the chlorine storage room and chlorinator room which generate alarms when the chlorine concentration exceeds 2 part per million (ppm).  The alarm notifies the operators when chlorine concentrations are still low in these two areas, so they can respond immediately and correct the situation.  The alarms are tested monthly.\n\nFive Year Accident History\nThrough training, prevention measures, and safe operating practices, the facility has not experienced a release of chlorine that has effected offsite receptors during its entire 33 year operating history.  \n\nEmergency Response\nFacility operators are trained to respond to a minor release of chlorine within the chlorine storage area or chlorinator room.  The operators wearing the proper personal protective equipment are capable of entering the contained area and performing minor repairs, provided the concentration of chlorine is less than 10 ppm.  In the event of a more significant release, the facility has a mutual aid agreement with the local emergency planning committee (LEPC), that would coordinate the response of HAZMAT- trained personnel from th"

In the interval between the previous update of the Risk Management Program in 2004, the facility has implemented the following changes to increase safety and reliability of the chlorine disinfection system.\n\u00c2\u00b7\tInstalled a new computer based monitoring and control system for plant and remote station operations.  \n\u00c2\u00b7\tLocal law enforcement personnel continue to be acquainted with the facility and the chlorine system as part of a continuing upgrading of security."
