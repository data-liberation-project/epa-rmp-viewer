Growers Ice Company considers safe operations to be a serious matter, for our employees benefit, as well as for the continued well being of the community in which we operate.  \n\nGrowers Ice Company has led the industry by requiring all of its Refrigeration Operating Engineer\u00bfs and Refrigeration Technician\u00bfs be RETA (Refrigeration Engineers and Technicians Association) certified.  Our operators are trained in safe operational procedures, set-up and safe maintenance procedures.  All Refrigeration Operating Engineer\u00bfs are trained in hazardous response training.  Training is updated yearly.\n\nThe maintenance department (typical mechanical maintenance) is trained in company hazardous response. Policies are written and maintained in the employee handbook and the business response plan.\n\nIn addition to the general response procedures, specific personnel are assigned certain duties to perform in the event of a spill or release.  Examples of such assignments are, evacuation and employee accountability, emergency vent fan location, relocation, radio or cell phone communication, etc.\n\nNATURE OF BUSINESS\n\nGrowers Ice Company is an industrial refrigeration and ice manufacturing company specializing in the manufacturing of ice and providing refrigeration for process cooling of fresh fruits and vegetables.\n\nThe post harvest cooling processes that are utilized include vacuum cooling, pressure cooling, hydro cooling, hydro vac cooling, ice making and ice injection. \n\nGrowers Ice Company also provides refrigeration for TWENTY FOUR (24) cold storage rooms within NINE (9) facility groupings (buildings) that are used for fresh vegetable processing and storage for various customers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNATURE OF HAZARD\n\nGrowers Ice Company, Salinas, CA , produce cooling and shipping facility uses anhydrous ammonia as a refr"

Anhydrous ammonia (NH3) is a gas in its natural state and attacks mucous membranes and lung tissue.  The gas is pungent and may be suffocating as shortness of breath and labored breathing can develop if inhaled.  Prolonged inhalation of high concentrations may cause bronchitis and or pneumonia, with some residual reduction in pulmonary functions.  Repeated or prolonged contact of high concentrations of ammonia to the skin can cause frost bite, redness, pain and serious skin burn.\n\nTHRESHOLD DETERMINATION (40 CFT 68 115/CALARP 2780.2)\n\n1.\tThis facility is required to comply with Program 3 requirements since it exceeds the state threshold limit of 500 lbs and exceeds the federal threshold limit of 10,000 lbs. in one of the on-site fixed systems.\n\n2.\tPublic receptors are also located within the worst-case accidental release toxic end point area.\n\n\nACUTELY HAZARDOUS MATERIAL USES\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is used as the refrigerant in the cooling systems.  The cooling system consists of a single stage ammonia refrigeration system with a central plant and a piping loop distributing refrigerant throughout the site.  \n\nThis system contains approximately 140,000 lbs. of ammonia.  This is an engineering estimate based on calculations of the system volume.  The exact ammonia volume is not known due to the system\u00bfs age and the fact that the ammonia was not measured into the system.  The TPQ for ammonia is 500 lbs.\n\nThe main engine room is located at 1040 Growers Street.  The main condensers and receivers and the main liquid shutoff valve (King Valve) are located at 1140 Meeks Street.  The emergency ammonia diffuser system is located at 1140 Meeks Street and is only to be used in an absolute catastrophic emergency to relieve excess pressure.  There are wind socks located around the facility as an aid for evacuation.  A facility-wide computer system manufactured by Andover Corporation controls the tempe"

The remaining facility will eventually be monitored as well.\n\n\n\n \n\n\nALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO ANALYSIS\n\nThis scenario considers the release of high-pressure gas from a \u00be inch pressure relief valve with a 250 psig set point.  Per the manufacturers data, a \u00be inch high capacity pressure relief valve, Henry Model No. 5602, has a relief rate of 43.3 lbs/min NH3 at 250 psig.  The total release is expected to be constant over a ten minute period.\n\nThe maximum extent of the release is 316 feet (0.06 miles) offsite.  This release can occur in any direction offsite from the facility.\n\nThe result of the release scenario analysis shows that no populations are impacted by this release.  This release is limited to this facility and immediately surrounding businesses and areas.\n\nThe release is assumed to occur at 0 feet elevation.  In reality, the pressure relief valves are typically \nlocated 12 feet off the ground or higher.  This will result in dispersion of ammonia at higher elevations.\n\n \n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION\n\nThe Grower Ice company facility utilizes visual inspections procedures prior to starting and stopping of on-line cooling equipment.  This equipment includes compressors, condensers, and evaporation equipment as well as ice-makers, vacuum coolers and air handling equipment.\n\nGeneral visual inspections are done throughout the work day as the starting/stopping of the equipment is required.\n\nInspections identify potential sources of problems and potential releases of ammonia.

All new hires are trained in safety and operational safeties specific to the operation of the refrigeration equipment.\n\nBusiness Response Procedures, and Emergency Response Procedures are updated yearly.\n\nPortable equipment, new to the site, is tested for operational safeties at the time of specific installation, typically at least once a year.\n\nAll ammonia refrigeration maintenance and operations personnel are required to be trained and become familiar with the company\u00bfs Safety and Operational Procedures and Emergency response Plan.  Regular safety meetings with recorded employee participation is required, attendance records are maintained n the main office.  Yearly local community hazardous response training is made available to all employees, refrigeration personnel are required to attend.  Records of attendance are in the main office.  Air Pak Training (self contained breathing apparatus) is conducted yearly and an updated fit test is done yearly, records maintained in the main office.\n\nRETA certified operations personnel are trained in safe operating practices of the basic engine rooms and refrigeration systems.  Certificates of Achievement copies are maintained in the employee files.  \n\n \n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nNo reportable releases or accidents relating to the release of ammonia refrigerant have occurred in the last five years.\n\nReleases of ammonia, should they occur, will be responded to in accordance with company policy and procedures outlined in the RMP.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe Growers Ice facility has implemented the state and county mandated \u00bfEmergency Response Plan\u00bf (a.k.a. \"Business Response Plan\").

Employee\u00bfs participation through on hands training ultimately makes the workplace and the community a safe place to be.\n\nBeing aware of potential problems and responding to a problem prior to emergency status is the preferred method of safety planning.  Pro-active mechanical maintenance of the \u00bfsystem\u00bf includes a five-year relief valve change-out program, yearly compressor inspections, bearing replacements, paint and cleaning of equipment, etc.\n\nThe \u00bfSystem\u00bf is also monitored by a computerized operating system.  The system safeties and alarms are recognized and responded to in a timely manner.\n\nAmmonia detectors (strategically placed) are being used in conjunction with automatic paging to key personnel.   The \u00bfOperator on Duty\u00bf, received the page, the alarm is noted and responded to, emergency shut down buttons (switches) are strategically located to safely stop the engine room and related equipment.  A third party (Sentry Alarm) monitors 2/3's of the facility 24 hours a day seven days a week.  In the event of a release of ammonia NH3 detectors located at several locations will activate and automatic call to the fire department and to responding parties at Growers Ice Co.  The remaining facility will eventually be monitored as well.\n\nWe are currently developing a computer assisted first response information system   This system will give the Operator on Duty, data that will aid the \u00bffirst responder\u00bf in a safe approach to the \u00bfalarm\u00bf site.  Wind direction, air speed, and in the case of an ammonia release, parts per million concentrations will be invaluable for the first response.

      "SummaryText": "ders.\n\nALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO ANALYSIS\n\nThis scenario considers the release of high-pressure gas from a \u00be inch pressure relief valve with a 250-psig set point.  Per the manufacturers data, a \u00be inch high capacity pressure relief valve, Henry Model No. 5602, has a relief rate of 43.3 lbs/min NH3 at 250 psig.  The total release is expected to be constant over a ten-minute period.\n\nThe maximum extent of the release is 316 feet (0.06 miles) offsite.  This release can occur in any direction offsite from the facility.\n\nThe result of the release scenario analysis shows that no populations are impacted by this release.  This release is limited to this facility and immediate surrounding businesses and areas.\n\nThe release is assumed to occur at 0 feet elevation.  In reality, the pressure relief valves are typically \nlocated 12 feet off the ground or higher.  This will result in dispersion of ammonia at higher elevations.\n\radministrator\radministrator\u00ff\u00ff\u001a\u000bGrowers Ice\u0001\u00bf.\u0015Valued Gateway Clie"
