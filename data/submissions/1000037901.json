The Plan's purpose is to enhance the facility's existing safety programs implemented at the site to reduce the possibility of accidental releases of anhydrous and aqueous ammonia that could cause harm to employees, the public and the environment.  The emergency response program, documented in the emergency response procedures, includes accidental release prevention and chemical specific prevention steps.\r\n\r\nWilbur-Ellis ensures that equipment meets the appropriate industry standards prior to use.  Wilbur-Ellis implements operating procedures and maintenance procedures in accordance with manufacturer and industry specifications to prevent accidental releases at the facility.  Chemical specific prevention steps implemented at the site include pressure relief valves, emergency shut off valves and ammonia training for personnel.\r\n \r\nFive-Year Accident History\r\n\r\nThere have been no qualifying accidents involving ammonia in the five-year period prior to the completion of this Plan.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\n\r\nThe facility coordinates with the Whitman County Fire Department #8 (fire department) regarding specific actions to be taken in response to an accidental release of anhydrous and aqueous ammonia.  The facility has established emergency evacuation procedures to evacuate the site and notify the appropriate agencies regarding a release.  The facility's emergency response program is documented in the facility's Emergency Response Procedures.  The emergency procedures contain the following key elements:\r\n\r\n1.\tProcedures for informing local agencies responsible for responding to accidental releases.\r\n2.\tInformation on emergency health care.\r\n3.\tEmergency response training for employees."

      "SummaryText": "Planned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nPlans to improve safety at the facility were developed based on the results of the process hazard analysis (PHA) and a Risk Management Plan (RMP) site evaluation conducted by an outside contractor.  The Branch Manager is currently working on an implementation schedule for the recommended actions.  Recommended actions include the following:\r\n\r\n1.\tEvaluate installation of a remote-activated emergency shutdown system, including one that can be activated from the riser used for railcars.\r\n2.\tEvaluate potential installation of a fenced perimeter for added security.\r\n3.\tInstall additional barricades around anhydrous ammonia storage tanks, piping, and risers to prevent impact from vehicular traffic.\r\n4.\tEnsure that bulkheads are designed to shear and protect the plumbing or install devices such as shear fittings that are designed to shear and protect the plumbing.\r\n5.\tEquip risers with pull-away protection.\r\n6.\tEnsure that a fire extinguisher is stored in the immediate vicinity of the riser/loadout area."

      "SummaryText": "The Plan describes procedures implemented by Wilbur-Ellis Company, Agribusiness Division (Wilbur-Ellis) to prevent accidental releases of ammonia that could cause harm to the public and the environment from short-term exposures.  The Plan includes an analysis of the potential offsite consequences of an accidental release, a five-year accident history, and a release prevention and emergency response program.  \r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nWilbur-Ellis has implemented release prevention and emergency response procedures to minimize the potential for accidental releases of hazardous materials.  Emergency response procedures including evacuation procedures and notification procedures have been implemented by Wilbur-Ellis.  In addition, Wilbur-Ellis has developed operating procedures and preventative maintenance activities to reduce the likelihood of accidental releases.\r\n\r\nThis Plan and the emergency response procedures document the accidental release prevention, safety, and emergency policies in place at Wilbur-Ellis.\r\n\r\nDescription of Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nWilbur-Ellis is located at 502 Central Ferry Road in Pomeroy, Washington (the facility).  Wilbur-Ellis is a distributor of fertilizer.  There is one 25,000 gallon storage tank, three 30,000-gallon storage tanks, and six 30,000-gallon rail cars at the facility that are used for anhydrous ammonia storage.  The 25,000-gallon tank is operated in tandem with one 30,000-gallon tank.  The anhydrous ammonia is distributed to other Wilbur-Ellis facilities in the area and is also used for the on-site production of aqueous ammonia and for the production of ammonium polyphosphate.  \r\n\r\nThere are eight 36,000-gallon aqueous ammonia storage tanks located at this facility.  The aqueous ammonia storage tanks are filled to a maximum capacity of 34,000 gallons.  The aqueous ammonia has a concentration of 20 percent and is distributed to other Wilbur-Ellis facilities i"
