We are committed to the safety of our employees and the public, and to the preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances. Successful implementation of our accidental release prevention program will help ensure that emergencies are unlikely and reduce the likelihood that emergency response procedures are needed.\r\n\r\nDescription of the Facility Information and Regulated Substances handled\r\n\r\n(b)\tFXI Inc. is located at 154 Lipford Rd in the Lee Industrial Park South in Verona, MS.  The facility manufactures flexible polyurethane foam, primarily for the furniture and bedding industry, and handles mixed isomers of toluene diisocyanate (TDI) which is considered hazardous and regulated by the EPA.  TDI is regulated under section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act Amendments.\r\n\r\nThe same properties that make TDI valuable for use at our facility also makes it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in the handling of the substance. TDI is considered a toxic substance and associated safety precautions have been implemented to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of our community.  Nevertheless, an emergency such as fire, explosion, or toxic release of TDI is possible. \r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program & Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\n(c)\tFXI uses this RMP and FXI best management practices as the primary programs for defining and guiding the Accidental Release Prevention Program for the facility.  The facility has implemented programs and procedures that comply with EPAA\u00bfs Accidental Release Prevention Program (Level 2) due to the following factors:\r\n\t1.\tTDI is listed on CAA 112(r) and our process involves a quantity that exc"
