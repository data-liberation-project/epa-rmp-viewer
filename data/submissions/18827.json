To ensure that the water is safe for drinking throughout the distribution system, a small amount of chlorine is added as a disinfecting agent.\n\nBecause chlorine can be hazardous if not handled properly, The Metropolitan District has established risk management programs for the protection of it's employees, the public and the environment.  \n\nThe chlorine present at this Metropolitan District facility is kept in one ton containers to minimize the potential for harm in the unlikely event of an accidental release. If such a release should occur, the public will be notified via state and local emergency management agencies.\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario\n\nThe Reservoir 6 Water Treatment Facility has conducted an offsite consequence analysis including a worst-case release scenario.  As required by the EPA RMP regulations, the worst-case scenario is defined as the release of an entire one ton container as a gas in ten-minutes. Because all operations from unloading to use are fully enclosed in a building, the effects of the building in slowing the rate of release was considered in accordance with EPA RMP Guidance for Waste Water Treatment Plants. The mitigating affects of the building were considered by applying a factor of 0.55 to the release rate modeled for an unmitigated release as described above. This means that the chemical release rate from the building is 55% of the release rate from the source. This resulted in a projected release of 110 lbs./min. from the building to the outside air in about 18 minutes. The regulations require assuming worst-case wind speed and atmospheric conditions that result in the greatest projected impact distance. \n\nFor the offsite consequence analyses, the endpoint concentration is defined by the Emergency Response Planning Guideline (ERPG-2) values developed by the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA).

The endpoint (ERPG-2 value) established for chlorine is 0.0087 mg/L (3 ppm).\n\nFor the wooded and hilly setting of the Reservoir 6 Water Treatment Facility, the potential distance to the endpoint concentration for the worst-case release is 0.9. miles, which extends offsite into residential areas. This distance was obtained from the EPA RMP*COMP offsite consequence analysis  software developed by the EPA as a tool for risk management planning.\n\nA major release of the magnitude represented by this worst-case scenario is extremely unlikely because of the robust design of one-ton chlorine containers (they are designed to withstand transportation mishaps) and the rigorous maintenance and prevention programs in place at the Reservoir 6 Water Treatment Facility.  In fact, release reporting databases and water industry experience suggest that the worst-case release scenario as defined in the RMP regulations is so unlikely that it should not be used as the basis for emergency planning.  A more reasonable potential release scenario for emergency planning is presented in The alternative release scenario(s) section below.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario\n\nA credible worst-case scenario was selected as the Reservoir 6 Water Treatment Facility alternative release scenario. This scenario assumes that the connection to one of the ton containers is completely severed and the resulting vapor release occurs within the building. The mitigating affects of the building were considered by applying a factor of 0.55 to the release rate modeled for an unmitigated release as described above. This means that the chemical release rate from the building is 55% of the release rate from the source. T"

Based on this commitment, the Director of Water Treatment and Supply has assumed overall responsibility for the development and implementation of the Risk Management Program.  Also, the Plant Superintendent has clearly defined accountability and responsibility for each of the prevention program elements to meet both EPA and OSHA Process Safety \n\nManagement requirements.\n\nTo ensure a worst-case or alternative release scenario does not occur, the Reservoir 6 Water Treatment Facility maintains a release prevention program with the primary focus of protecting plant employees and the public from the hazards associated with an accident or release involving chlorine.
