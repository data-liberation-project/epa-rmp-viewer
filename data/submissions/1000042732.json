The site has a mature workforce so much effort is being placed on early development of new Technicians so that the plant maintains its current skill level into the future.  Development of new employee training curriculum and systems for auditing of existing SOPs are two of the current 2009 projects for this position. A new electronic work permit system has been developed to make permits easier to create, implement, and track to completion."

These are evident in several plant policies and procedures, including Plant Procedure A-1, which is the Statement of Policy.  This procedure states that safety is a primary concern and a core value and that it is the policy of the St. Gabriel Plant management that safety is a definite job requirement at every level of the organization.   \r\n More relevant to the Risk Management Program is Plant Procedure C-8 which is entitled Process Safety Management Standard Compliance Procedure.  The purpose of this procedure is To establish measures (per Process safety Management standard 29 CFR 1910.11 and Risk Management Program 40 CFR 68) to ensure that accidental releases of toxic, reactive, flammable, or explosive chemicals are minimized and procedures are in place to lessen the consequence should a large release occur. \r\n\r\n(b) The stationary source and regulated substances handled;\r\n\r\n Syngenta has separated the facility into several processes.  Of these, the processes subject to RMP and the regulated substances handled by these processes are as follows:  \r\nHCN/ HPF and associated Tank Farms - anhydrous ammonia; sulfur dioxide; hydrocyanic acid; chlorine; isopropylamine; ethylamine\r\nMMU - Toluene 2,4-diisocyanate, Toluene 2,6-diisocyanate\r\nNote that in completing Section 7.0 of the RMP, the description of the prevention programs for these units, Syngenta separated the HCN/ HPF and associated Tank Farms into two sub-processes.

The Syngenta Maintenance Department maintains a Preventive/Predictive Maintenance (PM/PDM) Manual.
