The facility utilizes anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant to maintain the proper temperature of finished products. Anhydrous ammonia is an effective refrigerant that has been used for many years by most storage facilities. Anhydrous ammonia is normally a gas at ambient temperatures and atmospheric pressure, but is utilized in the refrigeration process as a gas liquefied under pressure.\r\n\r\nMRS operates one distinct ammonia refrigeration system within the facility. MRS's refrigeration system is designed to provide the following:\r\n\r\n- operating flexibility (through availability of multiple operating equipment combinations);\r\n- economy and efficiency of operations (through the use of operating pressures commensurate with the degree of cooling required);\r\n- optimal safety performance (through minimal use of ammonia liquid pumps, utilized instead the pressure differentials established in the system to move liquid refrigerant); and,\r\n- consistency of operations, utilizing programmable logic controllers (PLCs) to monitor, record, operate, and modulate refrigeration equipment as conditions require.\r\n\r\nMRS has implemented a Process Safety Management program for its ammonia refrigeration process operation and maintenance. This was accomplished through the development of a PSM Team comprised of Operations, Maintenance, Safety, and Engineering personnel, augmented by the support of refrigeration contractor personnel. The PSM Program has been incorporated as both policy, and most importantly, procedure in every day operations and maintenance of the ammonia refrigeration system.\r\n\r\nMRS (Midwest Refrigerated Services Inc.) is committed to promoting a safe operating environment for the facility, its employees, and the surrounding community.
