EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\n\nThe Mead Corporation -Mahrt Coated Board, Mahrt Mill is committed to operating in a manner that is safe for Mahrt workers, the public, and the environment.  Employing over 700 people from the surrounding communities, Mead recognizes that it is a vital part of the community.  It also recognizes its responsibility in informing the community of potential hazards associated with the processes at the Mahrt Mill.  As part of this commitment, Mahrt has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility and in turn, reduce the risk to employee health, contractor health, community health and to the environment.  Mead's Mahrt Mill risk reduction system includes a Process Safety Management system that complies with the requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulation 29 CFR 1910.119.  Another component of this system is a Risk Management Program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at Mahrt and complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements:  Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMPlan) describing the risk management program at Mahrt.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMPlan requirements of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at Mahrt.\n\n\n\n1.1 Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nMahrt is committed to the safety and health of Mahrt workers and the public, and to the preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  Mahrt implements reasonable controls such as operator training, preventive maintenance and safe operating procedures to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances.

      "SummaryText": "e at Mahrt mill, Mahrt considers using alternative substances that do not have the potential to adversely affect Mahrt workers, the public and the environment.   In the event of a significant accidental release, Mahrt evacuates workers and contains the release to prevent and/or reduce the consequences of the release. \n\n\n\n1.2    The Mead Corporation - Mahrt and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nMahrt is a paper mill without bleaching operations, producing coated unbleached Kraft paperboard, known as Coated Natural Kraft for use in multiple beverage packaging and folding cartons for food, pharmaceuticals and other products.  Mahrt mill produces two grades of Coated Natural Kraft paperboard:  Carrier Kote for Beverage packaging and Custom Kote for folding cartons.  More than half of the mills total production is Carrier Kote.   The covered process is defined as a regulated substance present in more than a threshold quantity as determined under 68.115 and includes any use, storage, manufacturing, handling, or the on-site movement of such substances, or combination of these activities.  For purposes of this definition, any group of vessels that are interconnected, or separate vessels which are located such that a regulated substance could be involved in a potential release, shall be considered a single process.  The facility handles one substance regulated by the RMP rule in sufficient quantities to be covered by the RMP rule:\n\n\n\n-    Aqueous ammonia stored in the Color Plant area for use on the Paper Machines\n\n        \n\nAs a result of the use of regulated substances at Mahrt, the following process is covered by the RMP rule:\n\n    \n\nProcess - Aqueous Ammonia\n\nProgram Level - 1\n\nRegulated Substance - Ammonia  (29 wt%)\n\nProcess Quantity - 32,190 lbs\n\n \n\n1.3    Off-site Consequence Analysis\n\n\n\nThe RMP rule requires Mahrt Mill to perform an off-site consequence analysis for the following scenarios:\n\n\n\n        -   One worst case scenario for the toxic substance ammonia\n\n\n\nThe purpose of the offsite consequenc"

It is non flammable, mixes with water and contact should be avoided with the liquid and vapor.\n\n\n\nThe worst case release scenario for toxic substances is failure of the 15,000-gal (32,190 lb.) aqueous ammonia (29 wt%) storage tank in the Rail car Unloading Area.  A diked area contains the release aqueous ammonia, which evaporates, forming a vapor cloud.  The maximum distance to the toxic endpoint concentration is 0.30 mile. No public or environmental receptors are located within this distance of storage tank.\n\n\n\n1.4  Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nMahrt maintains a number of programs to help prevent accidental releases and ensure safe operation.  The accident prevention programs in place at Mahrt include:\n\n\n\n        Safety information.  Mahrt maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes at Mahrt.  Material safety data sheets (MSDSs) document the physical properties of hazardous substance handled at Mahrt, including the regulated substance in covered process.  The information includes toxicity information, permissible exposure limits, physical data, reactivity data, corrosivity data, thermal and chemical stability data and the hazards of mixing substances in the process.  The engineering design documents include the operating parameters, the design basis and configuration of the equipment in each covered process, and references to applicable codes and standards.\n\n\n\n          Hazard Review.  Mahrt performs and periodically updates hazard reviews of the covered process to help identify and control process hazards.  Checklists are used to guide the hazard review.  These ch"

Mahrt develops and maintains operating procedures to define how tasks related to process operations should be performed.  The operating procedures are used to (1) train employees and contractors and (2) serve as reference guides for appropriate actions to take during both normal operations and process upsets.\n\n\n\n        Training.  Mahrt trains personnel in the operating procedures to help ensure safe and effective performance of their assigned tasks.  A training documentation file is maintained to help ensure that refresher training is provided, as necessary.\n\n\n\n        Maintenance.  Mahrt properly maintains the process equipment.  The Mahrt maintenance program includes (1) procedures to safely guide workers in their maintenance tasks, (2) worker training in the maintenance procedures, and (3) an inspections and testing program to help identify equipment deterioration and damage before the equipment fails.\n\n\n\n        Compliance Audits.  Mahrt performs periodic compliance audits of the covered process to verify that the process is operating in compliance with the requirements of the RMP rule.  A compliance audit report is prepared after each audit, and any deficiencies noted by the audit are corrected in a timely manner.\n\n\n\n        Incident investigations.  Mahrt investigates all incidents that could reasonably resulted in a serious injury to personnel, the public, or the environment.  Mahrt trains employees to identify and report any incident requiring investigation.  An investigation team is assembled, and the investigation is initiated within 48 hours of the incident.  The results of the investigation are documented, recommendation is resolved, and appropriate process enhancements are implemented.\n\n\n\n        Chemical-specific prevention steps-ammonia.
