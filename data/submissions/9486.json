Items of a low priority (Process improvements) were budgeted for completion in 1998 and 1999.\n     The Dannon Company also incorporates additional safety items such as tagging of all ammonia system valves and components, a PC / PLC based control system with a graphical operator interface.      The ammonia refrigeration system at The Dannon Company actually consists of two systems, which are standard compression and evaporation style systems.  These systems are linked together via crossover valves, which are kept closed at all times. \nSystem 1\n     Ammonia vapor from Pump Recirculators, Accumulator, and Surge Drum is routed to the High Stage Compressors.  Vapor from the Economizer suction vessels is used to feed gas to the High Stage Compressors' Economizer ports.  If the pressure of this gas should rise to 135#, the gas would be diverted through a regulator to a Pump Recirculator.  The High Stage Compressors compress the vapor.  The compressed vapor is then fed to the Evaporative Condensers.  Compressed Vapor is also fed to the cooler evaporators for hot gas defrost.\n     At the Evaporative Condensers, heat is removed from the compressed vapor converting it to high pressure liquid.  The high pressure liquid is then collected in the high pressure receiver.\n    "

      "SummaryText": " High pressure liquid is fed from the high pressure receiver to the sub-cooling coil in an Economiser Vessel.  High pressure liquid is also fed to this vessel as liquid make-up. As the liquid is fed through the cooling coil, it becomes colder than it normally would at that pressure.  The high pressure, sub-cooled liquid is then fed to another Economizer vessel and another sub-cooling coil to reduce liquid temperature even more.  The high pressure sub-cooled liquid is then fed to the Pump Recirculators as liquid make-up.  This maintains the liquid level in these vessels.  High pressure liquid is also fed to a common high pressure liquid header which feeds Ice Builder #1, the Chester Jensen Wing chiller, Hansen Auto-Purger, Batching Evaporator, and New Process Evaporator.  \n     High Pressure sub-cooled liquid is fed to the Auto-Purger as is purge gas from purge points at the Evaporative Condensers.  Any non-condensables in the vapor streams are removed periodically by the Auto-Purger.  The Purger separates ammonia from the non-condensables by condensing the ammonia.  Any non-condensables are piped to the water bubbler to remove any trace quantities of ammonia.  Condensed Vapor from the Purger is then transferred to the Pump Recirculator.\n     High pressure liquid is also fed to the Chester Jensen Wing Chiller by way of a surge drum.  At the Wing Chiller ammonia flows through plates where it absorbs heat from water which is cascading over the outside of the plates.  The ammonia will absorb heat, changing from a liquid to a liquid/vapor.  The liquid/vapor is returned to the surge drum where it is separated.  The liquid is returned to the Wing Chiller and the vapor is returned to the High Stage Compressors. \n     High pressure sub-cooled liquid is fed to Ice Builders #1, #2, #3, and #4 where it is circulated through coils while water floods the outside of the coils.

The liquid/vapor from the Ice Builders is discharged to an accumulator.  The vapor is separated and fed to the High Stage Compressor and the liquid is returned to a Receiver.  The Receiver serves as a storage vessel for the system.  \n     High pressure sub-cooled liquid is also fed to evaporators in Processing, Batching, the Northwest Cooler, Process Area, Milk Receiving, New and Old Coolers and the East Fruit Room.  In these Evaporators the liquid flows through coils where it absorbs heat from the air, changing from a liquid to a liquid/vapor.  High temperature recirculated suction from these units is returned to the pump recirculator. \n     The system contains an ammonia recharging system which is used for the charging of ammonia into the refrigeration system.  The recharging system consists of a liquid header which is piped from outside the engine room to the High Pressure Liquid return header from the transfer system.\n     The system also contains several oil pots which are used to remove excess oil from the system and an oil supply system which provides a constant supply of oil to the compressors.  An operator is required to perform charging operations.\nSystem 2\n      System 2 is similar in operation to System 1.  Most differences lie in the areas and equipment being cooled.  \n      Ammonia vapor from the Pump Recirculator is routed to the High Stage Compressors where it is compressed and then fed to the Evaporative Condensers.  At the Evaporative Condensers heat is removed from the compressed vapor converting it to high pressure liquid.  The high pressure liquid is then passed to the Thermosyphon vessel.

The mixture returns to the thermosyphon vessel where it separates.  The vapor passes through the equalizer line to the top of the evaporative condensers where it condenses.  The liquid is recirculated back to the oil coolers.  The thermosyphon vessel is equipped with a gravity drain stand pipe that allows ammonia liquid to gravity drain to the high pressure receiver once the thermosyphon vessel has accumulated liquid to the stand pipe.\n     The High Pressure Receiver serves as a storage vessel for liquid in the system.  High pressure liquid is fed from the High Pressure Receiver to the Hansen Auto where non-condensibles are separated from the ammonia as in System 1.  \n     System #2 services the Northwest Cooler, Cooling Tunnels 1,2,3, and 4,and the Cooling Cell.  Liquid ammonia flows through the coils in the evaporators at each of these areas where it absorbs heat from the air, changes from liquid to liquid/vapor mixture and is returned to the pump recirculator.\n     System #2 also contains an ammonia charging system for adding ammonia to the system and an oil pot to remove excess oil from the system.  Additionally, this system contains and emergency dump station located directly outside the engine room.  The station is composed of several headers linking together the Thermosyphon Vessel, High Pressure Receiver, and Pump Recirculator via normally closed cross-over valves.  In an emergency these valves may be opened to equalize pressures or dump the charge to the atmosphere.\n     Dannon has determined that the worst case release scenario would be the sudden and complete release of the ammonia contained in one of the High Pressure Receivers and its associated Evaporative Condenser.  This would release 7200 pounds of ammonia into the atmosphere.  The area of concern if this were to happen is a one mile radius around "

Total population within the area of concern is calculated to be approximately 527 with one school and a portion of a State Park within the radius.  Prevailing winds at the site would most likely leave the school and Park unaffected by a release and greatly reduce the number of people affected.\n     There are two likely causes which would predicate the Worst Case Scenario.  The first is that the equipment would experience external corrosion.  The corroded equipment weakens and leaks/ruptures, resulting in an ammonia release.  To prevent such and occurrence, a Preventive Maintenance Program is in place along with regular Mechanical Integrity Inspections.  The second cause would be if the vessel were impacted by a vehicle, causing a rupture and resulting in an ammonia release.  To prevent such an occurrence, Engineering/Administrative Controls in place include forklift training, a King Solenoid Valve, contractor qualifications, and warning signs.\n     A more likely release event would be caused by the failure of a sealing component such as packing, O-rings, gaskets, mechanical seals, etc. This type of failure is estimated to release approximately 250 lbs. of ammonia over a period of twenty minutes.  Based on RMP Comp calculations, ammonia would reach an endpoint 0.10 miles from the engine room.  The population affected by such an event is estimated to be two with no public receptors within the radius of concern.  To minimize the possibility of this occurrence a Preventive Maintenance Program and schedule of Daily Rounds has been implemented.\n     We have had three accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia which were large enough to be reportable.  The three releases were of 2,000 pounds, 1,000 pounds, and 250 pounds.  No off-site impacts were reported, no injuries occurred off-site, and no evacuations were necessary.
