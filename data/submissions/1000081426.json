ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n\n\nThe Lilly Technology Center (LTC) is committed to operating and maintaining all processes in a safe and responsible manner.  This is especially important for those processes using hazardous substances.  LTC has numerous systems in place to manage these chemicals.  Lilly uses a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to ensure the safety of employees and the public, as well as protection of the environment.  Lilly's accidental release prevention programs and contingency planning efforts help effectively manage the hazards that are posed to employees, the public, and the environment by the use of these chemicals.\n\n\n\nLTC has an Integrated Contingency Plan that contains procedures on how to handle emergencies that occur.  This plan includes procedures for notification of local authorities and notification of any potentially affected neighbors.  Additionally, individual business units at the plant maintain local emergency response procedures which focus on the actions of local personnel in the event of an emergency.\n\n\n\nLTC plays an active role in its Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  A primary goal of the LEPC is to protect local citizens by developi"

Through LEPC, citizens can obtain information about hazardous substances handled at local facilities and about emergency planning efforts designed to successfully cope with accidents if they occur.  LEPC maintains a coordinated emergency response plan for the community detailing operational procedures to be followed in the event of an accident involving hazardous materials.  The plan is available for public inspection.\n\n\n\nLTC actively supports community outreach efforts through Community Advisory Panels and neighbor groups.  These panels provide useful feedback from the community and advise Lilly on community issues.  Lilly also hosts plant tours and informative evening programs for nearby neighbors.\n\n\n\n2.  STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\n\n\nEli Lilly produces a variety of pharmaceutical products using a variety of chemicals and processing operations.  The Lilly Technology Center (LTC) is bounded by Raymond Street on the South, Harding Street on the West, and Morris Street on the North (plus one property to the north of Morris Street which totals 9 acres); the LTC Site is comprised of 267 total acres.  LTC North was originally opened in 1946 and LTC South in 1968.  The following regulated substances are handled at LTC in quantities above the threshold quantities established under the RMP regulations:\n\n\n\nToxics:  Ethylenediamine\n\n\n\nFlammables:  None\n\n\n\n3.  GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND THE SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nThe Lilly Technology Center is subject to OSHA's Process Safety Management requirements, as well as other OSHA requirements.

Responsible Care is the chemical manufacturing industry's environmental, health, safety and security performance initiative and is aimed at helping member companies enhance performance and improve the health and safety of their employees, the communities in which they operate and the environment as a whole.  At Lilly our strategy has been to integrate the Responsible Care Guiding Principles into our Global HSE Procedure and HSE Standards.  Internal assessments and external audits occur on a three-year frequency to confirm conformance.\n\n\n\nLilly takes a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  Our management systems address each of the key features of successful prevention programs including:\n\n\n\n?    Process safety information\n\n?    Process hazard analysis\n\n?    Operating procedures\n\n?    Training\n\n?    Mechanical integrity\n\n?    Management of change\n\n?    Pre-startup review\n\n?    Compliance audits\n\n?    Incident investigation\n\n?

The site's response is coordinated by plant security using the plant's emergency response teams and equipment.  The emergency response plan spells out the \"hows\" of emergency response and the roles and responsibilities of the incident response and management response teams.  It includes response procedures that are applicable for each building/area of the plant.  Periodic tabletops, functional drills and exercises test readiness and help employees practice responses to alarms and incidents.  The emergency response plan has been written based upon the \"one-plan\" EPA guidance and covers all topics based on that guidance.\n\n\n\nRAVE System\n\nThe Lilly Technology Center implemented an innovative community emergency notification system in 1996.  The RAVE system is an automated phone messaging system that can send a recorded message to everyone who lives or works within one mile of the plant site.  The system calls every number up to three times if there is no answer initially.  It also generates a report advising what phones were not answered.\n\n\n\nLilly Fire Rescue (LFR)\n\nThe Lilly Indianapolis plant sites have a trained emergency response team, Lilly Fire Rescue (LFR), made up of full time emergency staff and trained extended staff members (volunteers who have other job duties but can be called as needed). LFR is trained as an all hazard response team including Fire, Rescue, HazMat and EMS. LFR will respond to any emergency situation on the plant site when called. When Security has been notified that an emergency has occurred via telephone (555), radio, alarm or other means, Security dispatches the LFR full time staff along with the LFR extended staff who are in or near the incident area to immediately report to the incident scene to verify that an emergency exists and respond as necessary.  \n\n\n\nLFR undergoes regular training to meet Local, State, Federal and Company requirements.

LFR personnel are trained to the Hazmat Technician level and to use proper equipment and techniques to stabilize a hazardous area and rescue employees who may need help.  This team undergoes rigorous monthly training in HAZMAT response.  \n\n\n\nConfined Space Rescue Team\n\nPart of the training for LFR also includes Confined Space Rescue.  LFR specializes in rescue from tanks, pits, and other confined areas.  LFR is trained to use ropes, mechanical rescue and high angle rescue techniques.\n\n\n\nMedical First Responders\n\nPart of the training for LFR also includes Emergency Medical Response.  LFR personnel are trained to give emergency medical aid.  All first responders are certified in CPR, first aid, and defibrillation.  In addition, most LFR personnel have received state certification to the level of Emergency Medical Technician (EMT).\n\n\n\nFire Response\n\nLFR personnel are state certified (Firefighter I and II) and are trained to address structural fires in the incipient stage and chemical fires.
