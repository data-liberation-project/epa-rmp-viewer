      "SummaryText": "Hamilton Sundstrand (HS), A UTC Aerospace Systems Company, is located in Windsor Locks, CT and is owned by United Technologies Corp. (UTC).  The 254 acre facility is located approximately half way between Hartford CT and Springfield MA. The site is secured by 6-foot high security fencing and a 24-hour security staff which restricts public access.\n\n\n\nHamilton Sundstrand is an aerospace company which includes the design and manufacture of air, spacecraft, and marine control systems and components. Products include environmental control systems, fuel control systems, propeller assemblies, electronic components, electrochemical cells and testing equipment.  Wastewaters from these processes are treated by an on-site wastewater treatment facility. \n\n\n\nAn EH&S Oversight Organization representing all HS operating and functional units provides strategic direction for the EH&S initiatives. EH&S professionals have been assigned to provide technical support to various operating centers within HS to ensure day to day compliance with EH&S regulations.  In addition, the managers of each operating unit within HS are held accountable for compliance with EH&S regulations.  A Safety Culture Grass Roots Team was established to ensure that safety was a first priority in day to day activities.  Members of this team and operators of the various processes are involved with hazard assessments, inspections, operational and emergency procedures, and implementing and tracking corrective actions.\n\n\n\nAny new chemical or new/modified process proposed for the site must first be reviewed and approved by the Environmental, Health, and Safety Department.   Depending on the change facilities engineering and emergency services organizations are also involved with the review and approval process.  Management of Change (MOC) procedures are varied depending on the type of change but the approval process is the same regardless of the exact MOC being utilized.

If the chemicals are transferred to a secondary container, a hazard communication label indicating the hazards and proper personal protective equipment to wear is attached.  Procedures are established on-line that provide instructions on proper chemical handling and storage.  Chemical Handling, Hazard Communication, and Waste Management training are provided throughout the year for new and existing employees.\n\n\n\nThe regulated substance requiring HS to have a Risk Management Plan (RMP) and Process Safety Management (PSM) program is propane. There are four 18,000-gallon propane tanks situated in the same area.  The first tank contains high purity propane which not only supplies fuel to be used for heating and use as a fuel in forklifts, but also as a feedstock for a carburizing process.  It is the carburizing process, which takes place in the \"DOW\" furnace located in the heat treat area of the facility, which requires HS to fall under both RMP and PSM regulations.  Previously propane was also utilized for a powder metal furnace but that process no longer exists and all associated piping has been removed.\n\n\n\nThe next three tanks are interconnected and provide standard grade propane.  The propane from this tank system is used only as a fuel for equipment such as heaters and furnaces.  Currently two of the three tanks are empty and locked out of service but may be utilized at anytime depending on site wide demand.  Subsequently, both release scenarios were calculated using worst case situations involving all four tanks assumed as full. No active or passive mitigation measures were included in the scenario. This enables HS to project a true worst case in order to better understand the ramifications on the facility, the public, and the environment.\n\n\n\n"

      "SummaryText": "The worst case release scenario mandated by EPA is a vapor cloud explosion and was calculated using EPA's RMP* Comp software. The alternative release scenario is tank overfilling resulting in a vapor cloud explosion and was calculated using EPA's OCA Guidance.\n\n\n\nThe prevention program consists of a properly equipped tank system per National Fire Protection Agency (NFPA) 58 LPS Gas Codes. Each tank is individually equipped with pressure relief valves and excess flow valves.  A backflow check valve is supplied on the loading station as well as an emergency shutoff valve.  An alarm system and a deluge system are provided which signal the on-site Emergency Services Department if an emergency has occurred.  All loading and unloading operations are performed under the supervision of qualified HS associates. \n\n\n\nThe tank system is sited in an area not frequently traveled which greatly minimizes the chance of an ignition source such as a passing vehicle, and all equipment is properly grounded.  During the off loading process to fill the tanks, all perimeter roads are closed and secured by on-site emergency services personnel.  During the filling of forklift and portable propane tanks, the access road is also closed to all traffic and personnel with the exception of the forklift being filled.\n\n\n\nIn the spring of 2014, as part of the prevention program, HS replaced all underground black iron distribution piping with new Polyethylene Gas Pipe, Butt Fusion Fittings, and Trace Wire in accordance with NFPA 58 and 54, and the National Fuel Gas Code.  The new underground lines include pressure testing valves in various locations so periodic pressure testing for mechanical integrity can occur.  In November 2014 HS also replaced the first stage gas pressure regulators and installed new Pentair Safety Selector Valves and first stage pressure relief valves.  These changes were recommended as part of past internal and external hazard analysis and audits.\n\n\n\nThere were two incidents in "

In the first incident a distribution pipe was damaged by a forklift.  The location of the pipe was moved to eliminate the potential for \"struck by\" incidents.  The second was a minor leak at a pump union discovered during daily routine inspections and was due to vibration from the pump. Both releases were immediately contained following established emergency procedures which were deemed effective during incident response reviews and the situations corrected the same day.\n\n\n\nHS has an Integrated Contingency Plan (ICP) which describes actions to be taken in the event of a spill, fire or medical emergency and procedures specific to the operations utilizing propane, including the tank farm. The facility has an on-site Emergency Services (ES) Department with a full time fire/security staff supplemented by a small volunteer fire brigade.  300,000 gallons of fire stand pipes feed the fire pumps with makeup coming from the Metropolitan District Commission potable water system. The ES Department manages the upkeep and maintenance of the fire systems. In the event of an emergency the highest ranking ES personnel at the time of the incident acts as the Incident Commander.\n\n\n\nArrangements with outside agencies include the Windsor Locks fire department, Windsor Locks police department, local environmental contractors, and local hospitals and are outlined in the site ICP.  In the event an outside agency is called for assistance, upon arrival the town fire department will act as incident commander for the remainder of the incident and notify the public of action(s) to be taken.
