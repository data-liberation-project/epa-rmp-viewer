      "SummaryText": "General Executive Summary for Chemical, Manufacturing and Oil Refining Facilities\n\n1.    Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Holox Ltd.. are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, we are completely coordinated with Fulton County Emergency Response Team which provides highly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities encompass repackaging of Industrial, Medical, and Specialty gases and the manufacturing of Acetylene.  We have 3 regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include Propylene  [1-Propene], Acetylene  [Ethyne] and Chlorine.  The regulated substances at our facility are involved in several uses.  Propylene  [1-Propene] is used in the process of cutting metal.  Propylene is used as a less expensive substitute for Acetylene in Oxyacetylene Welding.  Holox repackages Propylene from a bulk tank into smaller cylinders and it's shipped to our branches for resale.  Acetylene  [Ethyne] is used for cutting metal (Oxyacetylene Welding), heat treating, and also, some laboratory applications.  Acetylene cylinders are shipped to our branches for resale.  Chlorine is used as a purifying agent or disinfectant.  The plant in Fairburn stores the Chlorine cylinders as a stocking point for our branches.  Holox does not repackage or manufacture Chlorine.  The Chlorine cylinders are purchased from Harcross Inc., stocked at Fairburn, and shipped to our branches for resale.\n\n"

The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\nTo evaluate the worst case scenarios, we have used the look-up tables and equations provided by the EPA in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance as well as Equations from Appendix D of the EPA's Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.  For alternative release scenario analyses, we have employed the look-up tables and equations provided by the EPA in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from storage of Chlorine.  The scenario involves the release of 4800 lb. of Chlorine in a gaseous form over 10 minutes.  At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 7.4 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L.\n\nOne alternative release scenario will be submitted for each toxic substance present in Program 2 and Program 3 processes cumulatively.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Chlorine involves a release from the east side of the high pressure plant (main bldg.) in the storage of Chlorine process.  The scenario involves the release of 4800 lb. of Chlorine in a gaseous form over 10 minutes.  The release is also assumed to be controlled by active mitigation measures that include Contact the Chlorine Institute.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L of Chlorine is 2.9 miles.\n\nThe worst case"

The scenario involves the release of 30000 lb. of Propylene  [1-Propene].  It is assumed that the entire quantity is released as a vapor, which finds an ignition source, with 10 percent of the released quantity participating in a vapor cloud explosion.  Under worst case weather conditions, the maximum distance of 0.25 miles is obtained corresponding to an endpoint of 1 psi overpressure.  \n\nThe alternative release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 flammable substances involves a release from the east side of the acetylene plant in the storage and transfilling of propylene.  The release is assumed to result in a Vapor Cloud Explosion.  The scenario involves the release of 30000 lb. of Propylene  [1-Propene] in 10 minutes.  Passive mitigation controls such as grounding are taken into account to calculate the scenario.  The release is also controlled by active mitigation measures that include fire extinguishers.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the flammable endpoint of 1 PSI overpressure is 0.15 miles.\n\n\n\n4.    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1967 Edition.  A number of processes at our facility are subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.  Our facility is also subject to EPCRA Section 302 notification requirements.    The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nHolox Ltd. maintains a detailed record of safety information th"
