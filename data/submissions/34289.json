      "SummaryText": "FACILITY DESCRIPTION\n\nThe Kern County Water Agency (KCWA), ID4 Water Purification Plant was designed and built to provide drinking water to the City of Bakersfield and surrounding areas.  The facility uses Chlorine for water treatment, including bacterial and viral destruction; taste and odor control; and slime and algae growth control.  Multiple feed points are provided to give flexibility in achieving disinfection goals.  Disinfection is achieved by withdrawing gaseous chlorine from pressurized 1-ton cylinders.  The chlorine is metered through a chlorinator under vacuum created by an injector.  The residual chlorine is automatically maintained and its amount is continuously recorded.\n\nAnhydrous liquid chlorine (chlorine gas that is stored as a liquid under pressure at ambient temperature) is supplied to the site by truck and stored in 1-ton cylinders for use in the disinfection process.   Cylinders are stored and connected to the process in the Chlorine Storage Room.  The chlorination system consists of 1-ton cylinders on scales attached to two (2) manifolds, two (2) expansion chambers with rupture disks, three (3) chlorinators, injectors, and interconnected piping, valves, and appurtenances; a chlorine scrubber; an underhung bridge crane; three (3) leak detectors; and emergency warning lights.\n\nNormally, two (2) 1-ton chlorine cylinders, which rest on the scale, feed the system through a pipe manifold.  There are two pipe manifolds, each connected to two chlorine cylinders.  Only one pipe manifold is in operation at a time; the other is in standby condition.  When the chlorine gas in the two cylinders is depleted, a switch-over valve automatically switches operation to the system in standby mode.  There are ball valves that can bypass the switch-over valve when necessary.  Both chlorine gas systems can be in use at the same time through the bypass valves (allowing four cylinders to be in use simultaneously); however, this condition has never been used in normal o"

      "SummaryText": "peration.\n\nIn addition to the four cylinders connected to the process (two in operation, two in standby), up to an additional eight (8) full cylinders of chlorine are stored in the Chlorine Storage Room at a time.  Therefore, the maximum inventory of chlorine in the storage room at any one time is 12 1-ton cylinders or 24,000 lbs.  The underhung bridge crane is used for moving and handling cylinders.  The chlorine hoist and trolley has a 2-ton capacity.\n\nEach manifold pipe includes an expansion chamber with a rupture disc.  In the event that the line is valved off and sufficient heat is present, the rupture disc is designed to burst to protect the piping.  The expansion tank is sized according to the pipe size and length to contain the pipe contents at safe pressure.  This prevents chlorine from escaping to the atmosphere.  A pressure switch is located above the rupture disc to annunciate an alarm in the event of a rupture.  A separate alarm is annunciated if the pressure in the gas piping exceeds pre-set limits.\n\nFeed equipment consists of chlorinators to meter the gas under vacuum and injectors to create the vacuum and mix the gas with water for transport and application.  The system is under vacuum from the ejector to the remote vacuum regulator.  From the remote vacuum regulator to the 1-ton cylinder, the system is pressurized.\n\nThere are three (3) chlorine leak detectors in the system - two in the Chlorine Storage Room and one in the Chlorination Room.  Warning lights are installed near each entry to the Chlorination Room and Chlorine Storage Room.  These warning lights illuminate in the event of a detected chlorine leak.  Above the east entrance to the Chlorine Storage Room, an audible alarm sounds during a chlorine leak.  The treatment plant supervisory control and data acquisition system (SCADA) receives chlorine leak information from the leak detectors andn records on a printer the time of the chlorine leak.  The SCADA system also annunciates visual alarms"

The ID4 plant is an RMP Program Level 3 facility.  Chlorine is stored in 1-ton cylinders.\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASES DURING PAST FIVE YEARS\n\nKCWA has not had any releases during the past five years that resulted in any injuries, off-site evacuations, or property damage.\n\n\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe KCWA Water Purification Plant is subject OSHA's process Safety Management (PSM) regulations for all equipment and operations associated with the chlorine storage and disinfection systems.  KCWA's PSM program includes the following stringent activities to minimize the potential for an accidental release:\n\n- Review of the design of all equipment and controls for the chlorine storage and disinfection systems to ensure that they are properly designed and installed, including the documentation and filing of all process safety information.\n\n- Updating of standard operating procedures to include specific information on operating the facility safely.  All procedures must be reviewed and certified annually.\n\n- Initial safety training and 3-year refresher training for all operators and maintenance staff.\n\n- Procedures to ensure that all contractors receive the same safety training that KCWA provides for its own employees.\n\n- Regular inspection of all equipment, monitoring systems, and controls with detailed documentation.\n\n- Prompt corrective action for any non-conforming items identified by regular inspections.\n\n- Rigorous safety reviews conducted prior to system start-up, if any equipment or operations are modified.\n\n- Investigation of any incidents that have the potential to have caused chlorine releases.\n\n- Periodic evaluation of the safety records of all outside contractors who work on the chlorine system.\n\n- Development of a"

The key elements of KCWA's emergency preparedness and response program are as follows:\n\n- All plant staff, including administrative and clerical staff, are trained in the specific elements of the program.\n\n- A team of supervisors and operators are trained, certified, and equipped for hazardous materials (Hazmat) emergency operations to repair accidental releases.\n\n- The plant uses a combination of audible and visual alarms and a plant loudspeaker system to alert the staff of a potential accident and to conduct in-plant communications.\n\n- In the event of a large release, the facility would immediately contact a telephone call-down list that includes the local fire department.\n\n\nRECENT STEPS TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nBased on recent safety reviews that were conducted as part of the evaluations for the Accidental Release Prevention Program, KCWA is in the process of implementing the following actions to either reduce the likelihood or severity of potential chemical releases.\n\nFuture Discontinuation of Chlorine Usage - KCWA is planning to convert the gaseous chlorine disinfection system to a a disinfection system using hypochlorite in the near future.  Once the new system is installed, the facility will no longer use gaseous chlorine.  A release of hypochlorite solution will be substantially less of a risk than a release of chlorine gas.\n\n\nHYPOTHETICAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE SCENAR"

      "SummaryText": "IOS\n\nThe Risk Management Plan must assess and document the downwind impacts of hypothetical accidental releases.  EPA requires facilities to report a Worst Case Release Scenario and Alternate Release Scenario.  The facility must assess the distance that a plume of released gas would travel before it dispersed to an ambient concentration equial to the \"Toxic Endpoint Concentration\".  The Toxic Endpoint Concentration for various compounds was specified by EPA and are generally concentrations that would cause no physical harm, but could interfere with people's ability to leave the area.  The Toxic Endpoint for chlorine is 3 parts per million (ppm).\n\nKCWA conducted a process hazards analysis (PHA), during which the PHA team identified and discussed potential chlorine release scenarios for the Worst Case and Alternate Case.  KCWA is unaware of any conceivable event that could actually cause the catastrophic worst case scenario.\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario for Chlorine\n\nThe WCS for chlorine assumes an event where the entire contents of a single, 1-ton cylinder of chlorine or 2,000 lbs are released as a gas cloud in 10 minutes, during a period of exceptionally calm winds and stagnant atmospheric conditions (1.5 meters per second wind speed and F stability class) that would result in minimal dispersion of the gas cloud.  The thermodynamic properties of anhydrous chlorine indicate that such a large instantaneous gas release is nearly impossible.  The release of a large quantity of gaseous or liquid chlorine from a cylinder would result in rapid chilling of the chlroine and ice formation.  The liquid or frozen chlorine would take much longer than 10 minutes to vaporize into a gas cloud.\n\nThe Risk Management Program Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants (EPA Publication No. 550-B-00-0070) was used to estimate the distance to the toxic endpont for chlorine.  The OCA methodology for chlorine in this publication applies to water treatment plants, as well as wastewater treatme"

Based on F Stability, a Wind Speed of 1.5 m/s, and Release Rate of 200 lbs/min, the Distance to Endpoint is 1.3 miles.  The estimated residential population within a radius of 1.3 miles from the facility is 16,663 people according to Landview 6 Census 2000 Population data.\n\n\nAlternate Release Scenario for Chlorine\n\nThe ARS assumes an incident during cylinder change-out where an operator wearing protective gear accidentally ruptures the 3/8-inch pigtail pipe from the cylinder valve.  Using the same EPA guidance, the calculated release rate of chlorine is approximately 21 lbs/min.  Note that the release rate is conservative.  As the release proceeds, chlorine continuously evaporates from the liquid surface in the cylinder.  This causes the liquid to cool, the vapor pressure to decrease, and the rate of release to decline.  However, for the purpose of this evaluation, the calculated release rate of 21 lbs/min was used.  A repair kit (B-kit) is available and the leak is repaired within 30 minutes.\n\nBased on the release rate of 21 lbs/min, D Stability, and a Wind Speed of 3 m/s, the Distance to Endpoint for the alternative release is 0.1 miles before it dispersed to the 3 ppm Toxic Endpoint Concentration.  The estimated residential population within a radius of 0.1 miles from the facility is 46 people according to Landview 6 Census 2000 Population data."
