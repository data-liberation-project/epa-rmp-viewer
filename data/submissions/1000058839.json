The ammonia is contained in a closed loop system; it is designed to remain inside the piping and vessels in our facility. We believe that ammonia provides the safest and most efficient cooling choice for our operation; however, because of its moderate toxicity and slight flammability, ammonia is considered a hazardous material.\n\n\n\nAmmonia is the only substance covered by the Accidental Release Prevention Regulations handled at this facility.\n\n\n\nWe take many precautions to prevent or minimize accidental releases of ammonia from the refrigeration system. These precautions include safety controls (alarms and automatic shutdown devices) which are designed to identify and prevent potentially unsafe conditions like pressure increases that could cause a system failure. We also have a preventive maintenance program designed to maintain the on-going integrity of the systems, a training program designed to ensure that the systems are operated by qualified personnel, and emergency response procedures that enable trained personnel to respond quickly to system upsets.\n\n\n\nWe are committed to maintaining a safe warehousing operation for our team members and the surrounding community. Our refrigeration system obeys our local building and fire codes, as well as industry consensus codes and standards where appropriate. In accordance with the Federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration (29CFR1910.119) and Environmental Protection Agency (40CFR68) our priority is to prevent accidental releases of hazardous materials instead of merely responding to problems.\n\n\n\nThe facility has not had a reportable accidental release in the last five years.\n\n\n\nAn emergency response program has been implemented at the facility. This program contains procedures describing how the facility will respond to ammonia spills and other emergencies, including evacuation procedures. The program has been coordinated with lo"
