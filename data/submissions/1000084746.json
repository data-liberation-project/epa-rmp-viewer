The facility produces fresh and frozen seafood products, using anhydrous ammonia in a closed system as a refrigerant in freezers and chillers. Ammonia is the safest refrigerant available and has excellent warning properties; it is extremely pungent at levels far below dangerous concentrations. \n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nIcicle Seafoods - Wood River facility implements a prevention program to comply with the requirements of the Process Safety Management (PSM) standard per 29 CFR 1910.119, which is designed to prevent accidental releases of certain chemicals held in quantities over given thresholds. The PSM program addresses all required elements including employee participation, process safety information and system drawings, operating procedures, hot work permits, management of change, mechanical integrity, training, pre-startup review, compliance audits, process hazard analysis, contractor safety, incident investigation and emergency response. The system has many built-in safety features including high-level controls and indicators, pressure relief valves, automatic and manually controlled valves and shutdowns, and leak detectors.\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nPer the requirements of 40 CFR 68.42, facilities must include a five-year accident history for all accidental releases from covered processes that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on-site or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage. There have been no such accidents at this facility in the past five years. \n\n\n\nEmergency Response Pr"

The plan identifies personnel designated and trained to assist in evacuation, make required notifications, and conduct the necessary actions to help ensure employee and community safety during an emergency. The facility has coordinated its Emergency Action Plan with local responders and conducts drills periodically to practice required actions.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSafety at the facility is improved continuously through the process hazard analysis process, safety meetings, employee suggestions, accident, incident and near-miss investigations, and as the result of internal and external audits and inspections. Upgrades are planned on an ongoing basis as needed to keep the system in safe working order.\n\n"
