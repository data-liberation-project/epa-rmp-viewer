      "SummaryText": "     Our facility handles Chlorine for disinfection purpose for water treatment.  The water treatment plant usually has on hand 3 one ton cylinders.  Most of the time one is empty and the other two are on the feeder rails.\n     We keep safety equipment updated and inspected.  Our policy is to never have one man work on equipment, change tanks,hook-up tanks ect.  We do it in pairs.  We keep spare parts and feed lines on hand for repairs.  We follow manufacture guidelines on maintenance & repairs.  We use the procedures as specified by the Chlorine Manual.  Every man who works around the Chlorine knows the safety procedures and emergency medical care.  We  will be  expanding our water plant capacity, so we will be installing newer equipment and more up to date control equipment.  We will keep training on all aspects of the operation.\n     We will be co-ordinating with the local fire department on emergency procedures and updated training.  We also will be co-ordinating with  the local police, the sheriff's office and the Highway  Patrol's office for help with public notification.  We have not had an accident in the past five years.\n     The only rules and regulations we were aware of is with the Department of Natual  Resources.  We are  usually  inspected once a year by them and comply with their rules.  Since receiving this RMP our awareness will be heightened and we will try to comply with all the regulations.\n     The worst-case release scenario has offsite impact.  It could be reduced by a hill to the east of the water treatment plant that runs north and south  and then connects to a railroad berm that runs east and west.  The town of Orrick is south of the treatment facility with the railroad berm in between.  The only opening in that railroad berm is where the road goes underneath the rail line.  The reason I say it could be reduced is Chlorine is heaverier than air and when it got to the railroad berm it should reflect to the sides.  In the new construction we "

We have a class B Chlorine repair kit on hand so we should be able to take care of any emergency that comes up.\n     The alternate scenario I used is leak during hookup, packing  nut leak and faulty valves.  With the procedures we have in effect , that should be the worst scenario that we would have.  Our Chlorine system now runs off vacumn so if we have a piping failure the tank shuts off.  We will install any new saftey equipment as needed."
