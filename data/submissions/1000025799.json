Written procedures are maintained and are followed by Institute personnel.  Release-reporting procedures are included in Institute's manufacturing process units which prescribe immediate and follow-up reporting to federal, state, and local authorities, including the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), the U.S. Coast Guard, the West Virginia Division of Environmental Protection (WVDEP), the state and local emergency planning centers (EPCs), and the Metro 911 Center, as required by federal, state, and county protocol.  The plant maintains an emergency response team with appropriate training and equipment to respond to releases of toxic or flammable materials inside the plant.  The plant also has mutual-aid agreements with local fire departments for response to various emergencies including chemical releases.\n\n\n\n\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\n\n\nThe Institute Plant is located eight miles west of Charleston, WV on the north bank of the Kanawha River.  The site has a total area of 460 acres, which is owned by Bayer CropScience.  Portions of the site are leased to Union Carbide (Dow), Praxair, and Reagent Chemical Company.\n\n\n\nBayer CropScience, an agricultural chemical based company, operates a multi-product, multi-process chemical plant.  The plant has three basic manufacturing units along with several other production facilities primarily responsible for producing raw materials used in the manufacture of agricultural chemicals.  The principal products produced at the Institute site are LARVIN brand thiodicarb, RHODIMET AT-88, and Carbosulfan.  Praxair, Catalyst Refiners, and Reagent Chemical operate their own facilities inside the site.\n\n\n\nBayer CropScience currently has one produ"

That RHODIMET AT-88 process supports the Adisseo Animal Nutrition business, which is operated for Adisseo by Bayer CropScience.  The RHODIMET AT-88 facility produces methionine hydroxy analog that is used in poultry feed supplies.  Ammonia is used as a raw material for this process.  \n\n\n\nProcesses no longer subject to the RMP rule are Methyl Isocyanate, Phosgene/Chlorine and Aldicarb as those processes has been permanently shut down.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nManaging Process Safety at the Institute Site requires proactive identification, evaluation, and mitigation or prevention of chemical releases that could occur as a result of failures in processes, procedures, or equipment.  We maintain a process safety management program that requires a systematic approach to evaluating the whole process. Using this approach, the process design, process technology, operational and maintenance activities and procedures, non-routine activities and procedures, emergency preparedness plans and procedures, training programs, and other elements which impact the various covered RMP processes are all considered in the evaluation.  The various levels of protection  that have been incorporated into the design and operation of the unit process to prevent or mitigate the release of hazardous chemicals are evaluated periodically and  revised as needed to assure their effectiveness at each level.  Ultimately, the major objective of process safety management of hazardous chemicals is to prevent unwanted releases of hazardous chemicals which could expose our employees, the community and the environment to serious hazards.\n\n\n\nThe process subject to the RMP regulation is also subject to the OSHA process safety management (PSM) regulation.  OSHA's PSM regulation is intended to prevent potential releases inside the plant and the RMP program is meant to help control and pre"

The process is periodically evaluated to assess the risk of the operations by current standards and to make improvements where necessary\n\n\n\nIn addition to skilled operators, the process has computerized control systems which monitor and record conditions within the process and adjusts accordingly.   The control systems are equipped with redundant safety systems which are designed to correct or shutdown the process if certain parameters are exceeded.   The process covered by RMP utilizes scrubbers and flares to neutralize emissions from the process and minimize potentially harmful releases to the atmosphere.  \n\n\n\nMaintenance of equipment containing hazardous substances is also a key element in preventing accidental releases.  In addition, any changes made to the processes are carefully reviewed prior to implementation to ensure that safety and environmental risks are recognized and addressed.  Finally, while many steps have been taken to prevent accidental releases, in the event that an accidental release does occur, it is formally investigated to determine the root causes and to prescribe corrective actions to prevent the release from recurring in the future.\n\n\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThe Institute Site had no accidental release from an RMP-covered process that meets the RMP incident reporting criteria during the last five years. \n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe Institute Plant maintains an on-site  emergency response team to handle fires, explosions, toxic vapor releases, medical, chemical spills, and natural disasters and rescue emergencies.

These occur as a result of the periodic risk-based process hazard assessment review process, as described above.\n\n\n\nSince the last resubmission in 2011 Chloroform and Chlorine have been removed from the site as the result of process shutdowns.  Those shutdowns prompted the current resubmission.  The Rhodimet AT-88 process is planned to shut down permanently by September 1, 2012.  When that occurs, there will be no more RMP chemicals remaining at the Institute site.\n\n\n\n"
