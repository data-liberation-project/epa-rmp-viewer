This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n\u00bf A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulation\n\u00bf A summary of results from our assessment of the potential offsite consequences from accidental chemical releases\n\u00bf An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\n\u00bf A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule\n\u00bf An overview of our emergency response program\n\u00bf An overview of recent improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance:\n\nOur facility uses sulfur dioxide in the production of Sodium Hydrosulfite and Zinc Oxide for use in the paper and rubber industries.  The EPA has identified sulfur dioxide as having the potential to cause adverse offsite consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release.  Our storage tank holds 287 thousand pounds of sulfur dioxide at the site.\n\nOur accidental release prevention programs and our contingency planning efforts help us effectively manage the potential hazards that are posed to our employees, the public, and the environment by our use of sulfur dioxide.  We are using this information to help us ensure that our emergency response plan and the community emergency response plan address all reasonable contingency cases.\n\nChemical Release Prevention Program:\n\nAt the Chemtrade Logistic's Kalama Plant"

Our company and our employees are committed to maintaining these management systems and recognize that this is the way we do business.  We have specific accountabilities and controls to ensure that we are meeting our own high standards for accident prevention. \n\nFive Year Accident History:\n\nThere have been no reportable releases of sulfur dioxide in the past five years at our facility. In fact, none have occurred since the plant began operation in 1969.  However, we have a system in place to investigate and keep records of significant incidents, including accidental chemical releases that might occur at our facility.  If a significant release should occur, we will conduct a formal incident investigation to identify and correct the root cause(s) of the event.\n\nEmergency Response Planning:\n\nWe maintain emergency response plans, which address all of the various federal, state, and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning.
