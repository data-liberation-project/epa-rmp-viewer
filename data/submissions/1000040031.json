This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of this facility. Our standing practice is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated flammable substances. However, if a release does occur, gas plant trained personnel will respond to control / mitigate the release. In the event a non-incidental release occurs, gas plant personnel are prepared to work with the local fire department, Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC) and other authorities to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nThe High Plains gas plant, located near Midland, TX, recovers petroleum products(e.g., natural gas and natural gas liquids (NGL)) from field gas. NGL is a mixture of aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons, including the regulated flammables ethane, propane, butanes, and pentanes, and is shipped from the facility by pipeline. There is also refrigerant propane at the site. There are no threshold quantities of toxic substances at the facility.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the High Plains gas plant. The processes at the gas plant regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's(EPA's) risk management program (RMP) regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM) standard, therefore this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program. \n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nEmployees at the High Plains gas plant are encouraged to participate in all facets of proces"

Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team. Employees have access to all information created as part of the gas plant accident prevention program. Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the gas plant. In addition, the gas plant has initiatives under way which address process safety and employee safety issues.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe High Plains gas plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operations. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis / configuration information. The reference documents and their location is readily available as part of the written employee participation program to help employees locate any necessary process safety information.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response / exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDS's). For specific process areas the plant has documented safety related limits for specific process related parameters (e.g. temperature, level, composition). The gas plant ensures that the process is maintained within acceptable limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\nTechnical documents are maintained at the plant that provide information about the design and construction of the process and equipment.

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe \"What If\" analysis technique is primarily used to perform these evaluations. The analyses are conducted\n\nusing a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process, as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution. Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is guided by a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team. This helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention. All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained. To help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.

These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate. These procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process. The procedures are readily available in the process unit for operators and other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the High Plains gas plant has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process. New employees receive training in gas plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate (e.g. through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. This refresher training is conducted at least every three years. This training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\n\n\nContractors\n\nThe gas plant uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.

This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.\n\nIn addition, the High Plains gas plant evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor. Gas plant personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\n\n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\nThe High Plains gas plant, conducts a PSSR for any new facility or process modification that requires a change in the process safety information. The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup before placing the equipment into service. This review provides an additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready. The PSSR review team uses checklist(s) to verify all aspects of readiness. A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe High Plains gas plant has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief valves, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.

Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\n\nSpecialized Safety Features\n\nThe High Plains gas plant has safety features to help:\n\n(1) contain/control a release,\n\n(2) quickly detect a release, and\n\n(3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release.\n\nThe following types of safety features are used in the covered processes:\n\nRelease Detection\n\n1. Hydrocarbon detectors with alarms\n\nRelease Containment / Control\n\n1. Process relief valves\n\n2. Valves to permit isolation of the process\n\n3. Automated shutdown systems for specific process parameters\n\n4. Curbing or diking to contain liquid releases\n\n5. Atmospheric relief devices\n\n6. Redundant equipment and instrumentation (e.g. uninterruptible power supply for control system, spare pump)\n\nRelease Mitigation\n\n1. Trained personnel\n\n2. Personal protective equipment\n\n3.

      "SummaryText": "xtinguishers\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no accidents over the past five years\n\nEMERGENCY ACTION PLAN INFORMATION\n\nThe High Plains gas plant has a written emergency action plan that is in place to protect the safety of workers and the public, as well as the environment. There are no 112(r) threshold toxic substances on the plant site. For a non-incidental release of a flammable substance, including the possibility of fire, response actions have been coordinated with the local emergency agencies and notification mechanisms are in place. Employees receive training as necessary to perform their specific emergency actions. The emergency action plan is updated when needed and affected personnel informed and or training in the changes. The gas plant has around the clock communications capability with appropriate officials, emergency response agencies and emergency response organizations (e.g. fire department). This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident if necessary, as well as facilitating a quick response to an incident. The plant emergency plan is tailored to this facility and to the emergency services available in the community.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe High Plains Gas Processing Plant has resolved all findings from PHAs. At the current time, no changes are planned over the foreseeable future.\n\n"
