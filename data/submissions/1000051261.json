If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Fairmount Fire Department, or other authorities, to mi minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.  Farmers Union Oil of southern Valley has sponsored several NH3 safety trainings for the local fire department and the district fire departments in the last three years.\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage of anhydrous ammonia and loading nurse tanks for delivery to the farm for application. \n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application for crop nutrients.\n\nThe maximum quantity stored would be 78,795 lbs. in one 18,000 gallon tank.  The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a transport truck vessel containing 53,000 pounds.\n\nThe worst case scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank release over ten minutes.  The maximum quantity would be 78,795 pounds representing 85 percent of the largest tank capacity, as limited by design standards.   \n\nThe alternate release scenario based on a two minute release is a release from a break in a three inch transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint in this case would be .62 miles.\n\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc. and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA),29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia\".\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of Anhydrous Ammonia in the past five years at this site.\n\nFarmers Union Oil of Southern Valle"

Periodic evaluations are performed to access the maintenance of safety conditions.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementations at this time.\n\nFarmers Union Oil of Southern Valley has reviewed their safety policy on anhydrous ammonia annually and has a specific training before each fall application starts.  The company has several employees on the local fire department which makes the information and fire drill practices at this site happen more often.  "
