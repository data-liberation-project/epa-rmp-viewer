Taken together, the components of its prevention program are designed to ensure that:\n\n* Process equipment is in proper working order\n* Employees are trained in safety and aware of correct operating procedures\n* Changes to the process or personnel do not result in accidents\n* The hazards of the process are identified and addressed.  \n\nMechanics walk through the system every 2 hours, 24-hours-a-day to ensure that the equipment is in proper working order.  They utilize IIAR training videos and employees attend RETA training courses.  Refresher training is offered to employees every four to six months, and competency is assessed using written tests, demonstration and observation.  The employees at Farbest Foods are also closely involved in developing safety procedures for the facility.  For example, the mechanics worked together to create a combined set of daily operational procedures expected of all shifts in order to completely and safely monitor the system.  Employees are also strongly encouraged to suggest changes to any of the Operating Procedures.  \n\nD.  No significant acci"
