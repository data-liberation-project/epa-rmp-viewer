The emergency response plan includes procedures for:\r\n\r\nA\u00b7 Informing local emergency responders about accidental releases that could reasonably result in offsite consequences\r\nA\u00b7 Providing proper first aid and emergency medical treatment for accidental human exposure to hazardous substances\r\nA\u00b7 Obtaining outside assistance to control and contain accidental releases of hazardous substances, including the use of emergency response equipment\r\nA\u00b7 Inspecting and maintaining emergency response equipment\r\nA\u00b7 Reviewing and updating the emergency response plan\r\n\r\n We have trained our employees to recognize and report emergency situations.

We have a hot work permit program to control spark- or flame-producing activities that could result in fires or explosions in our plant.

Personnel who are to perform hot work are required to fill out the form, and the appropriate supervisor reviews the completed form before work can begin.  Training on hot work activities and on the requirements of the hot work permit program is included in our safe work practices orientation.\r\n\r\n12. Contractors.  We have a program in place to help ensure that contractor activities related to the ammonia system are performed in a safe manner.  We explain to the contract supervisors the hazards of the processes on which they and their employees will work, our safe work practices, and our emergency response procedures.

We have a program to perform compliance audits of our ammonia system every 3 years to be certain our prevention program is effectively addressing the safety issues of the process.  This audit is performed by an audit team that includes personnel knowledgeable in the PSM and RMP regulations and in our process designs, and this team evaluates whether the prevention program satisfies the requirements of these two regulations and whether it is sufficient to help ensure safe operation of the ammonia system.  The results of the audit are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate enhancements to the prevention program are implemented.\r\n\r\n9. Incident investigation.  We have a program to investigate any incidents or near misses that could reasonably result in serious injury to personnel, the public, or the environment so that similar accidents can be prevented in the future.  We communicate to our employees the requirement to identify and report any incident requiring investigation.  In the event of an incident, an investigation team would be assembled, and the investigation would be initiated as soon as possible, but always within 48 hours of the incident.

We work to prevent accidental releases from occurring.  However, we also train our workforce to recognize accidental releases, quickly assess the severity of a release, and respond to mitigate and stop the release, including contacting the local agency responsible for responding to accidental releases (e.g., the Local Emergency Planning Committee [LEPC]) if emergency response actions are necessary. We work closely with the LEPC to ensure appropriate plans are in place to minimize the impact of the release on our workers and the community.\r\n\r\nOur safety program consists of a number of elements, only some of which are required by the RMP rule.  This RMPlan is primarily intended to describe those parts of the safety program required by the RMP rule.\r\n\r\n1.  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\r\n\r\nWe are committed to the safety of workers, contractors, and the public, and the preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of regulated substances.  We take appropriate steps to prevent fo"

      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY FOR THE CHOUTEAU POWER PLANT IN PRYOR, OKLAHOMA\r\n\r\nThe Chouteau Power Plant is committed to operating in a manner that is safe for our workers, contractors, the community, and the environment.  To meet this commitment, it has established systems to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this plant.  One component of these systems is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks involved with using hazardous substances at our plant and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit an executive summary in the risk management plan (RMPlan) describing the RMP at the Chouteau Power Plant.  This document is intended to satisfy the executive summary requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of our RMP.  Section 2 of this executive summary describes the one substance currently used at the Chouteau Power Plant in sufficient quantity to be regulated by the RMP rule.\r\n\r\nThe Chouteau Power Plant risk management program consists of three elements:\r\n\r\n1. A hazard assessment designed to inform of (a) the potential offsite consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and (b) accidents that have occurred during the last 5 years associated with the substances regulated by the RMP rule - see Sections 3 and 5 of this executive summary\r\n\r\n2. A prevention program to help maintain and safely operate processes containing significant quantities of substances regulated by the RMP rule - see Section 4 of this executive summary\r\n\r\n3. An emergency response program to help respond to accidental releases of regulated substances from processes covered by the RMP rule - see Section 6 of this executive summary\r\n\r\nAlthough the RMPlan helps ensure that our plant is maintained and operated in a safe manner, it is only one component"
