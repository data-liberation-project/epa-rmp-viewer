A primary aspect of this commitment is the EP Pine Bluff system to help ensure the safe operation of our processes.  Our commitment is also demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our processes, as well as, extensive training of our operating personnel. \n\nIn the event of an accidental release, EP Pine Bluff will implement procedures which are designed to control and contain the release in a manner which will be safe for our employees and will help prevent injury to the public and the environment.  EP Pine Bluff's emergency response personnel receive thorough training in handling accidental releases.  A safety & health manager has been assigned to oversee response activities and to coordinate response efforts with local emergency agencies. Communications with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) served to support the original preparation of this plan and policies.\n\nTo effectively implement these policies, EP Pine Bluff established a management system headed by the Manager of Environmental Health and Safety to ensure the proper implementation and effectiveness of our Risk Management Program (RMP).\n\n\n\n2.0  REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nEP Pine Bluff is primarily involved in the manufacture of high quality bleached paperboard.  To manufacture our products, EP Pine Bluff utilizes one substance, chlorine dioxide, which is regulated by the RMP Rule.  The chlorine dioxide used at EP Pine Bluff, is generated on site, immediately absorbed into water, and then stored in a 1.05% solution.  The RMP Rule requires all regulated toxic substances contained in 40 CFR 68 that are stored in quantities above the specified thresholds to"

Chlorine dioxide is present in an aqueous solution in storage tanks above the threshold quantity of 1,000 pounds. \n\nChlorine dioxide is also used in the water treatment process.  This process uses a blend of purate (sodium chlorate and hydrogen peroxide) and sulfuric acid to produce chlorine dioxide for immediate use. There is no chlorine dioxide stored for this process; therefore, this chlorine dioxide is not covered by the RMP Rule.\n\nThe regulated use of chlorine dioxide at EP Pine Bluff is as follows:\n\n\n\nTable 1.

Chlorine dioxide was evaluated for possible worse case scenarios and alternative release scenarios.  It is important to understand that EP Pine Bluff has invested extensive resources to prevent releases, and the potential for a worse case release is extremely small.  The alternative release scenarios, though also highly unlikely, present a more realistic potential for occurrence and are based on historical data from our process or other similar processes.  By identifying these potential releases, EP Pine Bluff has prepared an extensive program to prevent such an occurrence. This program is discussed in detail in the \"Prevention Program\" section of this plan.\n\nThe primary objective of performing the offsite consequences analysis is to determine the distance at which the public and/or the environment might be affected in the event of an accidental release.  This point is called the endpoint distance.  At distances less than the endpoint distance, the effects would be greater; at distances greater than the endpoint, the effects would be less.  The offsite consequence analysis can be foun"
