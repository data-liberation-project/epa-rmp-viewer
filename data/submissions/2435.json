Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at GROCERS SUPPLY are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substance Handled\nOur facility's primary activities encompass a REFRIGERATED GROCERY WAREHOUSE.  We have one regulated substance present at our facility.  This substance is anhydrous ammonia.  Ammonia (anhydrous) is used for THE REFRIGERATION PROCESS.\n\nThe maximum inventory of Ammonia (anhydrous) at our facility is approximately 20275 pounds.\n\n3.    The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the         distances for each reported scenario\nTo evaluate the worst case scenarios, we have used RMP*COMP VER 1.06.  For alternative release scenario analyses we have employed the EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equations and the EPA's RMP Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration  Reference Tables or Equations.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from  the ammonia refrigeration system . In this scenario 11200 lb. of Ammonia (anhydrous) is released.  The toxic liquid released is assumed to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to evaporate over 10 minutes.  The released quantity has been limited to 5"

At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 1.2 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L.\n\nOne alternative release scenario for Ammonia (anhydrous) involves a release from AMMONIA REFRIGERATION SYSTEM.  The scenario involves the release of 20273.38 lb. of .  Toxic liquid is assumed to be released to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated after 10 minutes.  Passive mitigation controls such as enclosure(s) are taken into account to calculate the scenario, having the effect of  reducing any onsite and offsite concequences.  The release is also assumed to be controlled by sprinkler system(s), emergency shutdown system(s) and  manual shutoff valves.   Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L of Ammonia (anhydrous) is 0.62 miles.\n\nAnother alternative release scenario for Ammonia (anhydrous) involves a gas release from  a damaged pipe in the equiptment room.  The scenario involves the release of 2948.51 lb. of ammonia .  Toxic gas is assumed to be released to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.

This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1967 Edition.    The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nGROCERS SUPPLY maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is What If/Checklist (combined) and HAZOP.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of  five years.

These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations and  normal shutdown . The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nGROCERS SUPPLY has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every once every year  and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nGROCERS SUPPLY carries out  documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls compressors and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at GROCERS SUPPLY to manage changes in  technology, equipment and procedures.  The most recent review/revision of maintenance procedures was performed on 06/30/1998.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in estab"

These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nGROCERS SUPPLY conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP/PSM  rule are being implemented.  The most recent comliance audit was conducted on 12/13/1996.  These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\nGROCERS SUPPLY promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation\nGROCERS SUPPLY truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses in particular.\n\nContractors\nOn occasion, our company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out.
