The Facility Policy\n\n    MFA Incorporated and the employees of the MFA Agri Services in Jefferson City are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Jefferson City Fire Department, and other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information\n\n    The primary activity at the facility is the receiving, storage and distribution of bulk dry and liquid fertilizer and anhydrous ammonia for direct application as a crop nutrient. The\nfacility also handles pesticides, grain, feed and farm supply products. \n\n    The maximum quantity stored would be 70,098 pounds in our 15,000 gallon storage tank. The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a transport delivery truck holding approximately 50,000 pounds.  The facility has thirty 1,000 gallon nurse tanks and three applicator tanks, therefore the facility total maximum storage would be 207,172 pounds.\n\n3. The Accidental Release Prevention Program.\n\n    The facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., the Missouri Anhydrous Ammonia Law, and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\". The facility will move to use of the newest codes as time and budgets allow.\n\n\n\n\n\n4. The Five-year Accident History\n\n    There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that: have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, i"
