The facility is refrigerated warehouse that is utilized for refrigerating and freezing a variety of food products. The NAICS code for the facility is 49312. \n\nThe facility uses anhydrous ammonia for refrigeration, and is regulated under 40 CFR Part 68, the EPA RMP Rule. There is one refrigeration system onsite that is used for refrigerating and freezing a variety of food products. The total amount of ammonia onsite is approximately 20,000 pounds, which is above the minimum threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds.\n\nThe refrigeration system provides the mechanical refrigeration required for maintaining temperatures in the freezer, blast freezers, holding coolers, product re-pack area, and the inspection areas.\n\nIV.\tGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\nA prevention program is in place to minimize the risk of hazardous chemical releases in accordance with the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29 CFR 1910.119) and the EPA Risk Management Program.   \n\nThis prevention program covers those processes that handle ammonia above the threshold quantity for both PSM and RMP rules.  The elements of the PSM, Program 3 prevention program, and a brief description are listed below.\n\u00bf\tEmployee Participation - Lineage Logistics LLC has developed a site specific employee participation plan that ensures employees and their representatives are consulted when conducting and developing a process hazard analysis and all other information required to be developed under PSM/RMP.
