It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of ammonia.  If such a release does occur, we have trained staff in emergency response and are coordinated with the Marshall Fire Department and the Saline County LEPC for emergency response support.\r\n\r\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nThis facility is a food processing plant used for mixing, cooking, conveying, freezing, and packaging of frozen meals and processed foods. The only Risk Management Program (RMP) regulated substance present is anhydrous ammonia utilized as the primary cooling media in our two (2) closed-looped ammonia refrigeration systems.  In that the engine rooms are in close proximity and managed by onsite personnel as one system (PSM Program), for the purposes of this RMP we are considering both systems as one process.  \r\n\r\nDue to the size and characteristics of our ammonia refrigeration onsite, as well as Process Safety Management (PSM) applicability, this facility is covered under Program 3 of the RMP regulations.\r\n \r\n3.
