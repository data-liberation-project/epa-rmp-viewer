      "SummaryText": "The Lower Colorado River Authority (LCRA) owns and operates a coal-fired electrical generating plant, the Fayette Power Project (FPP), in Fayette County, Texas.  LCRA has reviewed its obligations under Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act.  In response to these requirements, LCRA notes that there are two obligations incumbent on the operations at FPP:\n\n1. ?112(r)(1) - Purpose and General Duty Clause - The essence of the general duty clause is that an owner/operator that stores and uses hazardous chemicals in any quantity has a fundamental obligation to ensure a safe operation, and to have plans in place in the event of an accident to appropriately manage the situation.  LCRA takes this obligation very seriously, and intends that FPP be not only a good neighbor but a leader in community safety and emergency preparedness as evidenced by our participation in the Fayette County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).\n2. Risk Management Plan - FPP has one process that involves a chemical stored in excess of thresholds specified in ?112(r), the chlorine water treatment process.  Even prior to the promulgation of  ?112(r), FPP management has been very aware of the potential hazards posed by storage and use of chlorine, and has established programs to prevent any accidental releases and training for emergency response in the event of a release.  These programs are documented and described in this Risk Management Plan.\n\nThe purpose of the chlorine water treatment process is to treat and disinfect water for plant use. Chlorine is delivered as a compressed gas in one-ton cylinders, and there are typically six cylinders at the plant at any one time.  For planning purposes, the LCRA has considered the impact of a sudden release of the entire contents of one cylinder within a ten-minute period of time.  Very conservative (i.e., \"worst case\") assumptions about possible weather conditions and a predictive model indicate a potential radius of impact extending to 3.0 miles.  A cons"

      "SummaryText": "ideration of this radius has been incorporated into our notification and emergency response planning.\n\nWe also considered the impact of a more likely release, based on a five-year accident history.  The largest release of chlorine actually experienced by the facility resulted in a radius of impact of 43 meters (141 feet), i.e. having virtually no off-site impacts.\n\nLCRA has implemented safety precautions to prevent and mitigate any chlorine release.  In addition to maintenance, training, and inspection procedures, the LCRA has an active monitoring and alarm system that will detect a release and sound a local alarm and send an alarm notification to the FPP control room, which is managed 24 hours per day.  The LCRA has extensively coordinated with local emergency responders including the Fayette County Fire Department and the Local Emergency Planning Committee, and provides annual training to employees to staff a \"HazMat Team.\"\n\nLCRA-FPP management is committed to:\n\n? Preventing accidents;\n? Training our employees in correct response procedures in the event of an accident;\n? Providing leadership to the community with respect to emergency preparedness;\n? Addressing any citizen concerns by fully explaining potential hazards associated with FPP operations and all steps being taken to prevent and mitigate accidents; and\n? Being a good corporate citizen of Fayette County.\n\nWith these objectives in mind, this Risk Management Plan provides information about our management of the risks associated with the chlorine water treatment process, but more importantly we stress our commitment to ensuring a safe operation for our employees, our visitors, and our community."
