(Texas Barge and Boat) operates a marine terminal that primarily cleans and degasses marine tank barges, and will increase their propane storage capacity to facilitate flare operations. After expansion, Texas Barge and Boat will store up to a total capacity of 4,000 gallons.  Chemicals handled at the facility include hydrocarbons/petroleum products, solvents, intermediates, and industrial products.  The terminal is located on the Brazos River approximately three miles south of Freeport. In accordance with U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations in Title 40 Code of Federal Regulations Part 68 (40 CFR 68), the U.S. EPA has identified quantities for 77 toxic substances and 63 flammable substances that require a facility to comply with the Risk Management Program (RMP) rules when unit inventories exceed threshold quantities.  The RMP rules require a facility to report the unit inventory for each RMP substance that exceeds threshold quantities, along with an EPA-approved chemical release prevention program.  In addition, 40 CFR 68 requires all RMP-covered facilities to update its Risk Management Plan (RMP Plan) within (6) months of an RMP reportable incident or every five (5) years, whichever comes first.  Per 40 CFR \u00a768.190(b)(3), an update to the RMP is required no later than the date on which a new regulated substance is first present above its threshold quantity.  This is the initial submittal of the RMP Plan for Texas Barge and Boat.\r\n40 CFR 68 requires all facilities subject to the rule to conduct an Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA) to provide information to the public as well as state and federal environmental agencies about potential consequences of an accid"

OCAs can include a Worst-Case Scenario (WCS) and an Alternate Release Scenario (ARS).  This submission includes OCAs of both the WCS and ARS for propane (PROPANE), a toxic chemical; it is the only chemical stored in excess of a threshold quantity as listed in 40 CFR 68 at the site.  Although numerous controls are in place to prevent chemical releases and manage such consequences should an incident occur, no credit for active mitigation measures was taken into account in evaluating these scenarios.\r\nAn OCA for the WCS was conducted using the EPA's RMP Guidance for Offsite Consequence Analysis, (EPA 550-B-99-009, April 1999).  The RMP sets forth specific criteria that must be incorporated in modeling the WCS.  The EPA defines a WCS as one that results in the greatest distance from the point of release to a specified endpoint.  As defined by the rule, the endpoint for a toxic substance is a specified concentration.\r\nAn ARS assesses the potential hazards that are more realistic than those associated with the worst-case scenario and is designed to assist in the development of emergency response plans.  The EPA RMP Guidance for Offsite Consequence Analysis was used in modeling the alternative release scenarios.  As required, an alternative release scenario was created for a toxic chemical release.\r\nThis is the initial submission of the RMP Plan for Texas Barge and Boat.  It is a requirement to update the RMP Plan within five (5) years of the initial submittal, no later than three years after a substance is first listed by EPA, or no later than the day on which a newly regulated substance is first present above the threshold level in a process that is already covered.\r\nTable 1 lists the RMP-regulated substances that Texas Barge and Boat can hold above threshold quantities:\r\n\r\nTable 1  Chemicals Considered in RMP\r\nRegulated Chemical\tFound in\tCAS Number\tCharacteristic\tThre"
