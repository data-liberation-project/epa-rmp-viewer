This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, gas plant trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Walker Creek Gas Plant, located in Taylor, Arkansas, operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products (e.g., natural gas, ethane, propane, butane) from natural gas.  The Walker Creek Gas Plant has several regulated flammables, such as ethane, propane and butane.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the plant.  The gas plant process is regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's  (EPA's) risk management program (RMP) regulation.  This summary addressed the elements of the Walker Creek Gas Plant's accident prevention program and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nThe Walker Creek Gas Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associates hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Personnel at the gas plant are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations,"

This information is supplemented by documents that describe specifically any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For specific process areas, the gas plant has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameter (e.g., temperature, levels, composition) in the Walker Creek Gas Plant Operating Procedures Manual.  The gas plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\nThe gas plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings of equipment.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\nThe Walker Creek Gas Plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe Walker Creek Gas Plant primarily uses the Checklist analysis techniques to perform these evaluations.  Checklist analysis, performed by trained and knowledgeable personnel is recognized as an extremely thorough hazard evaluation technique.  The analyses are conducted by personnel who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  The PHA personnel identify and evaluate hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes sugg"

Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned during the PHA process.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the PHA findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\nOperating Procedures\nThe Walker Creek Gas Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are periodically reviewed at least annually to verify completeness and accuracy.\n\nIn addition, the Walker Creek Gas Plant Operating Procedures Manual also contains a section pertaining to the consequences of deviation which provides guidance on how to respond to upper or lower limit exceedances for specific process or equipment parameters.

New employees receive basic training in gas plant operations even if they are already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior level operator to learns process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through oral tests and skill demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically will be re-certified on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintaine at an acceptable level.  This re-certification is conducted at least every 3 years.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nMaintenance\nThe Walker Creek GasPlant has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.  The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures.  In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the integrity of the process.\n\nMaintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their jobs in a safe manner.

Examples of these include:  (1) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (2) a permit and procedure to control hot work activities (i.e., grinding, welding), and (3) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.  These procedures and others, along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance acitivites are performed safely.\n\nIndicent Investigation\nThe Walker Creek Gas Plant promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to gas plant management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings.
