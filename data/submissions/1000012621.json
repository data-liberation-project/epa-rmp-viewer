The quantity is limited by automatic and manual systems to half of the tank's capacity; this is the inventory reported in the Section 1.17.   Ammonia is reacted with natural gas and air in the presence of a platinum gauze to produce HCN.  It is also used in various neutralization processes around the plant.\n\nHydrogen Cyanide\nHCN is produced by the catalytic reaction of ammonia, natural gas and air over a platinum gauze.  It is stored as a refrigerated liquid in two separate, non-connected, widely-separated stainless steel tanks.  Normal inventory is limited by policy to 35% of each tank's capacity.  For major unit maintenance, the inventory in one tank is increased to 60% of capacity; this was the inventory reported in the Section 1.17.  This inventory is quickly used; the tank will be back to the normal level in 2-3 days.  The HCN is used as an intermediate in the production of methacrylic acid and its esters, methyl methacrylate and butyl methacrylate.  \n\nChlorine\nChlorine is used in our Battleground Water facility to sanitize process water.  The chlorine is stored and used in one ton cylinders.  \n\nFlammable Chemicals:\n\nPropylene\nLiquid propylene is received into the plant via pipeline, and there is no storage tank.  There are two long, interconnected pipelines from the metering station to the process units.  The total quantity reported in Section 1.17 is the volume contained in both pipelines and in the vaporizers.  Propylene is used to produce acrylic acid via partial oxidation in the presence of a catalyst.\n\n\nOur accidental release prevention programs and our contingency planning efforts help us effectively manage the hazards that are posed to our employees, the public, and the environment by our use of these chemicals.\n\nKey Offsite Consequence Analysis Scenarios\n\nEPA's RMP rule requires that we provide information about"

The following notes about these scenarios include information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the exposure distances for each scenario:\n\nWorst-case Release Scenario(s) - Regulated Toxic Chemicals:\n\nAmmonia\nThe inventory of the tank is limited to 50% of capacity by automatic level controls and the operating procedures.  The worst case for ammonia is the release of the entire tank inventory in 10 minutes.  This will result in a liquid spill and vaporization and will produce a cloud that does have offsite residential impact. This scenario is unlikely because the tank has 1.5 thick steel walls, is made of stress relieved carbon steel, and is inspected periodically.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario(s) - Regulated Toxic Chemicals:\n\nAmmonia\nThe Alternative case for ammonia is a 1.5 line leak.  This will produce a cloud that will not impact public receptors other than neighboring industrial plants and Tidal road.  For the alternative scenario, the Rohm and Haas emergency response system will allow mitigation to begin within 10 minutes.  There are remote manual valves available to isolate the release.  The pipelines downstream of the ammonia storage tank are equipped with excess flow valves.  Fire monitors are available for water curtain in most areas of the plant.\n\nHydrogen Cyanide\nThe Alternative case for HCN is a 0.5 line leak into a diked area.  This will produce a cloud that will not impact public receptors other than neighboring industrial plants and Tidal road.  For the alternative scenario, the Rohm and Haas emergency response system will allow mitigation to begin within 20 minutes.  There are HCN detectors in strategic locations throughout the plant and remote manual valves available to isolate the release.

There are automatic shut-off valves which will isolate the cylinders from the feed piping to isolate the release. There are also chlorine detectors in strategic locations.\n\nWorst-case Release Scenario(s) - Regulated Flammable Chemicals:\n\nPropylene\nThe Worst case release scenario for propylene is a rupture of the pipeline that would release the entire inventory of propylene in 10 minutes, which then ignites.  A vapor cloud explosion would result in an overpressure that would affect Tidal road.  Depending on the location of the pipeline rupture, off-site effects could occur and affect industrial neighbors.  Because the area along most of the pipeline is unconfined, a vapor cloud fire is a more likely scenario.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario(s) - Regulated Flammable Chemicals\n\nPropylene\nThe alternative case scenario for propylene is a 1 leak in the pipeline. The pipeline is equipped with remotely-operated isolation valves which will shut on low pipeline pressure which will occur upon line rupture or significant leaks.  The quantity reported in the alternative scenario assumes the valves will shut and the volume contained in the longest section of the pipeline between the isolation valves will be released. Depending on the location of the leak along the pipeline, this scenario results in overpressure that could  affect a portion of Tidal road and could affect one industrial neighbor.  Because this area is unconfined, a vapor cloud fire was chosen for the scenario.   \n\n\nWe are using this information to help us ensure that our emergency response plan and the community emergency response plan address all reasonable contingency cases.

      "SummaryText": "cidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nWe take a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  Our management systems address each of the key features of successful prevention programs including:\n\n- Process safety information - All of our processes have comprehensive information that is used to guide the choice of process and control technologies, operating parameters, and inspection intervals for equipment such as pipes, vessels, and protective systems.\n\n- Process hazard analysis - All processes have been subjected to a PHA that was at least as rigorous as a HAZOP.  These HAZOPs were used to define the scenarios used in this report. The accident scenarios found in HAZOPs form the basis of additional analyses which allow us to ensure that the integrity levels of all protective systems are high enough to protect both our employees and our neighbors.   They also help us target the most important equipment for more frequent inspection.  \n\n- Operating procedures - Operating procedures include windows for safe operations and guides for trouble shooting which allow operators to keep the processes out of unsafe areas.  Operators are involved in writing, reviewing, and updating operating procedures.\n\n- Training - Training is based on the operating instructions.  Operators help determine the frequency of refresher training.\n\n- Mechanical integrity - We have a comprehensive inspection and preventive maintenance system that ensures that equipment maintains its capability to contain the process chemicals.  This system is being continuously improved.\n\n- Management of change - As an industry pioneer in the management of change, we have a comprehensive, well-institutionalized MOC system.  Employees at all levels are involved in the operation of the MOC system.\n\n- Pre-startup review - The Pre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR) is integral to ensuring that any new or modified process is built as intended.

PSSRs are part of the institutionalized MOC and PHA systems.\n\n- Compliance audits - Several types of compliance and management system audits are performed.  RMP/PSM self-audits are performed every three years.  Annual VPP evaluations are conducted.  Company/corporate EHS audits are completed every 2 years.  Actions needed are entered into a computer-based action tracking system that automatically tells those responsible if completion of action items is taking longer than anticipated, so that remedial steps may be taken.\n\n- Incident investigation - We also pioneered process safety incident investigations using multiple-cause, system-oriented techniques.  Many technical papers and presentations came from this work.  We continue to investigate process incidents using this technique and other root cause analysis tools so that we can gain all the information from each incident that we can to determine the root cause(s), in order to prevent future incidents and to add to the body of information about each process.\n\n- Employee participation - Employees participate in all aspects of the prevention program.  Since 1978, we would not perform a HAZOP unless hourly employees were present.  Operators help write operating instructions and perform much of the training for new employees.  Operators and mechanics are expected to attend MOC reviews.\n\n- Hot work permit - We have had a very effective Hot Work permit, and safe work permit, system.  \n\n- Contractors - Contractors are picked according to stringent standards of management, competence, and safety.  Contractors are expected to adhere to the same standards of safety that our own employees do.  A monthly management meeting is held to review all contractors' EHS performance. \n\nAs part of our prevention efforts, we have implemented the following chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\nAmmonia:  Most of the amm"

(Carbon steel is considered adequate for ammonia service, but we opted for the more costly choice to eliminate future concerns about external corrosion.)  There are two tanks capable of storing ammonia, but only one is in service at any time.  This allows maintenance to be performed at leisure on the tank that is out of service.  The tanks are made from carbon steel and both are stress-relieved.  There are excess-flow check valves in the tank outlets and in the line from the tank to the north end of the plant.  These valves will slam shut on major flow increases which would occur upon line rupture or significant leaks.\n\nHydrogen Cyanide: Where possible, HCN lines are all-welded construction, and all welds are 100% X-rayed.  Where flanges are required, we use 300# flanges and spiral-wound gaskets for maximum integrity.  Pumps for 100% HCN are magnetic drive pumps which have no seals, and leaks are highly unlikely.  HCN detectors are mounted at strategic locations throughout the unit, and provide an excellent warning system.  There are evacuation procedures at each HCN unit which are tested and drilled.\n\nChlorine:  The chlorine system feed piping uses a vacuum delivery system.  Leaks in the vacuum section of the delivery piping will automatically isolate the feed cylinders.  Chlorine detectors are installed in the area surrounding the chlorine system.   \n\nPropylene:  The propylene lines are welded carbon steel; one is buried, the other is above ground.  The buried pipe is coated and wrapped and is cathodically protected.   The propylene piping is designed for high pressure and normally operates at less than 20% of the design pressure.  The extra capability gives us an inherently safer means of being prepared for pressure surges, but there are also relief valves in the system to prevent damage to the pipelines.
