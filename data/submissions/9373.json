EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nThe ISP Huntsville Plant is committed to operating in a manner that is safe for Huntsville Plant workers, Redstone Arsenal (RSA) on-site personnel, the public, and the environment.  For example, as a member of the Chemical Manufacturers Association and the Synthetic Organic Chemical Manufacturers Association, ISP implements the principles of Responsible Care to ensure a safe and environmentally sound operation.  In addition, there are RSA coordinated environmental, health, safety, and emergency response programs and procedures, which ISP adheres to. Also as part of ISP's over-all commitment to Envirnmental Health and Safety, the Huntsville Plant has established systems to help ensure safe operation of the processes at our facility.  One part of these systems is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the Huntsville Plant and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) rule 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule). One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMPlan) describing the risk management program at the Huntsville Plant.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMPlan executive summary requirements of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at the Huntsville Plant.\n\n1.1.1 Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe ISP Huntsville Plant is committed to the safety of Huntsville Plant workers, RSA employees, and the public, and to the preservation of the environment through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances. The Huntsville Plant implements "

In the event of a significant accidental release, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain such releases.  The Huntsville Plant evaluates each situation, evacuates workers as necessary, responds based on our capabilities and training, and if necessary, contacts the RSA Emergency Response Team which has both the resources and training to respond to major fires and hazardous substance releases. The RSA Installation Response Team (a.k.a. the RSA Fire Department) coordinates emergency response activities with both base and if need be additional local emergency personnel (e.g., the Huntsville- Madison County Emergency Management Agency) to assist in controlling and containing the release and to prevent and/or reduce the consequences of the release.  The Huntsville Plant and the RSA Installation Response Team have established a system for warning RSA employees if an accident occurs that could threaten the base or surrounding community.\n\nThe Huntsville plant manager has overall responsibility for the development and implementation of the risk management program for EPA-regulated processes at the facility. However, the specific responsibilities for certain aspects of that program have been delegated to the plant engineer and the plant foreman who report directly to the plant manager. Specific responsibility for the implementation of certain portions of the process safety management (PSM) and accident prevention program has been delegated to the aforementioned employees.  The responsibility for the RMP hazard assessment and risk management plan, and the emergency response program, including compliance with the RMP aspects has been delegated to the plant manager and plant engineer. In keeping with our policy that safe operation is part of everyone's job, many other personnel are also involved in RMP activities on an ongoing basis.\n\n1.2  The ISP Huntsville Plant Regulated Substances\n\n"

      "SummaryText": "The ISP Huntsville Plant is a chemical manufacturing facility located at the Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville, Alabama.  We lease this from the US Army and we have been operating at this site since 1949. There are approximately 22 ISP employees who work at this site. We use ammonia, hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and iron as our feed materials. The principle products made at the ISP Huntsville Plant are Carbonyl Iron powder and Iron Pentacarbonyl.  Some of these feed materials and products are toxic substances that EPA has specifically listed in the RMP rule and are present in our process units above the specified EPA threshold quantity.  \n\n1.3  Offsite Consequence Analysis\n\nThe Huntsville Plant performed an offsite consequence analysis to estimate the potential for an accidental release of a regulated substance that could affect the base, public or the environment.  The offsite consequence analysis consists of evaluating both worst-case scenarios and alternative release scenarios.  The Huntsville Plant does not expect a worst-case release scenario to ever occur.  An alternative release scenario represents a release that might occur during the lifetime of a facility like The Huntsville Plant.  Alternative release scenarios can be used to help the Redstone Arsenal LEPC and the RSA Installation Response Team (a.k.a. the RSA Fire Department) improve the emergency response capabilities.  We have shared that information with the Redstone Arsenal LEPC and other base emergency personnel.  It is also available to local residents and businesses.  If you are interested in this information, please contact our RMP coordinator at 256-882-0177.\n\nThe main objective of performing the offsite consequence analysis is to determine the distance at which certain effects might occur to RSA employees or the public  because of an accidental release (called the endpoint distance).  The following effects could occur at the endpoint distance:\n\n     - When considering the release of a toxic substanc"

Some people who are\n       particularly susceptible to the substance released could be incapacitated.\n\n     - Although there are no flammable substances above the RMP threshold, the following effects were\n       considered as a part of emergency response planning effort. \n\n           - When considering explosion of a flammable substance, people at the endpoint distance are likely\n              to be knocked down by the blast.  Windows could shatter, and the potential for structural damage\n              to buildings exists, although a building collapse is unlikely.  People could be seriously injured by\n              being knocked down by the force of the blast, by flying glass, or by falling objects.\n\n           - When considering the fire hazard of a flammable substance, people at the endpoint distance are\n             likely to receive second-degree burns over the exposed parts of their bodies if they cannot\n             quickly find cover or otherwise escape the heat of the flame.

The PSM program at this facility has been extended by the Huntsville Plant, where necessary, to satisfy EPA's Program Level 3 accident prevention program requirements.\n\n\n1.4.1 Employee Participation\n\nThe Huntsville Plant encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of  process hazard analysis (PHA), incident investigation, and plant and process inspection teams. Employees have access to all information created as part of the Huntsville Plant accident prevention program.  \n\n1.4.2  Process Safety Information\n\nThe Huntsville Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. The plant manager and plant engineer at the Huntsville Plant are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information. Key reference documents are located in the plant engineer's office and are readily available. \n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).

The Huntsville Plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits by using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems). \n\nThe Huntsville Plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n1.4.3  Process Hazard Analysis\n\nThe Huntsville Plant has a comprehensive PHA program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage those hazards.\n\nThe Huntsville Plant primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations. HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques available.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes recommendations for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. \n\nThe PHA team recommendations are"

All approved safety improvements being implemented in response to PHA team recommendations are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each recommendation is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the Huntsville Plant periodically updates and revalidates the PHA results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating. The results and recommendations from these updates are documented and retained.  Any new team findings are forwarded to the local Layer of Protection Analysis (LOPA) Team for risk analyses and the final resolution of the recommendations is documented and retained.\n\n1.4.4  Operating Procedures\n\nThe Huntsville Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  Procedures are periodically reviewed as current and accurate. Procedures are maintained current by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made to the process.  In addition, the Huntsville Plant operating procedures provide guidance on how to respond to events that result in exceeding safe operating limits for specific process or equipment parameters.

It should be noted that there are only 2 processes conducted at the Huntsville Plant.\n\n1.4.5  Training\n\n To complement the written procedures for process operations, the Huntsville Plant has implemented a company training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in Huntsville Plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. Refresher training is conducted in concert with the routine job safety analysis and training improvement effort. All of this training is documented and include the means to verify operator understanding.\n\n1.4.6 Contractors\n\nThe Huntsville Plant uses contractors to supplement its work force during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the Huntsville Plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform Huntsville Plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work. This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirement"

In addition, the Huntsville Plant evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor. Huntsville Plant personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\n1.4.7 Pre-startup Safety Reviews\n\nThe Huntsville Plant conducts a pre-startup safety review for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the review is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  The review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.  A review involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\n1.4.8 Mechanical Integrity\n\nThe Huntsville Plant is updating and revising its practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.  The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures.  In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process equipment.\n\nMaintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards,  (3) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their job in a safe manner"

      "SummaryText": ".  Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended, and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels).  If a deficiency is identified, management will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or  management of change will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\n\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance.  The Huntsville Plant incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs.  This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made. \n\n1.4.9  Safe Work Practices\n\nThe Huntsville Plant has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.  Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous materials before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control welding and other spark-producing activities, and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.  These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\n1.4.10  Management of Change\n\nThe Huntsville Plant has a comprehensive system to manage changes to processes.  This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure"

Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided with any necessary training on the change.\n\n1.4.11 Incident Investigation\n\nThe Huntsville Plant promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to Huntsville Plant management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings. Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidations. \n\n1.4.12  Compliance Audits\n\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the Huntsville Plant periodically conducts audits to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented. Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years.  Both hourly and management personnel participate as audit team members.  The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to Huntsville Plant management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit tea"

The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released. The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, plant evacuation plans and accounting for plant personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and postincident cleanup and decontamination requirements. The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to plant processes or facilities. The emergency response program changes are administered through the management of change process, which includes informing and/or training affected personnel in the changes. \n\nThe overall emergency response program for the Huntsville Plant is coordinated with RSA Installation Response Team (a.k.a. the RSA Fire Department) and Redstone Arsenal LEPC and with offsite responders who would be called to support emergency response efforts if required. The arsenal emergency response requirements are setforth in the RSA Installation Spill Contingency Plan (ISCP) which is the basis for the site's emergency response program. The ISCP serves as the basis for training, required actions, and joint response efforts. This coordination includes periodic meetings of the LEPC, which consists of  RSA emergency response team members.  The Huntsville Plant has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department). This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an "
