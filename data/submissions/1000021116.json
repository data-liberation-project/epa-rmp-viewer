The facility emergency response plans are coordinated with the fire department and the Johnston County Emergency Management.  The Selma Fire Department has participated in the initial RMP/PSM training session for this system.\r\n\r\nProcess safety controls include excess flow valves, low-melting point pneumatic valve feeds to pneumatic valves (fail closed), 85% fill shut-off (80% alarm and 90% ESD actuation) on the vessels, emergency shut-off devices on the system and video display terminal, line thermal/hydrostatic reliefs, and grounding interlock devices.  Note: In contrast to the PSM requirements, this stationary source as defined under 40 CFR Part 68 is bounded by the off-load station and the points of injection.  \r\n\r\nBlanchard Terminal Company LLC looks for, and seeks employee input, on process safety improvements.  Additionally, the Selma Fire Department is contacted regarding participation in site emergency response drills.  Additional actions include consolidating separate system inspection checklists for ease of completion."

The facility's alternate (potential off-site impact) release scenario is a BLEVE accident and associated fireball.\r\n\r\nBlanchard Terminal Company LLC - Selma Terminal complies with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Accident Prevention Rules (40 CFR Part 68 Subpart D), the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29 CFR Part 1910.119), and all applicable state and local laws and regulations.
