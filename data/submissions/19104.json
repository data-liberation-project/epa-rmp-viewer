      "SummaryText": "1.  The owners, management and employees of Champaign Landmark, Inc., are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility will work with local fire departments, or any other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release public and the environment.\n\n2.  The Mechanicsburg Fertilizer facility is located outside of the town of Mechanicsburg at the intersection of State Route 29 and State Route 187.  This is a fertilizer facility that receives anhydrous ammonia only by truck.  It is used strictly for agriculture.  The maximum amount stored is 212,200 lbs.  The maximum amount handled would be 42,000 lbs while unloading a semi.\n\n3.  The worst case scenario would be to loose the total contents of the tank (132,600 lbs).  It would reach its endpoint in 10 minutes at 200ppm at 2.41 miles.  The alternative release scenario would be the rupture of a 3\" hose that would reach its endpoint at 1.14 miles in 2 minutes from release time, and releasing 11,908 lbs of ammonia.\n\n4.  The Mechanicsburg facility has implemented the OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.111 for the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.  ODA and other regulations are followed.\n\n5.  The mechanicsburg facility has not had a reportable accident in the last five years.\n\n6.  Our Emergency Response Program has been recently reviewed and gone over with all personnel.\n\n7.  Our company policy is to remain proactive in the areas of safety and accident prevention.  With the ODA - Workers Comp. and our own audits, we feel that the chances for accidental release are minimal.  We are making no specific anhydrous ammonia safety changes at this time."
