      "SummaryText": "CE ANALYSIS (OCA)\n\nAn off-site consequence analysis (OCA) was performed on the potential worst-case scenario (WCS) and alternative release scenario (ARS) involving toxic and flammable substances at Equilon. The WCS is considered to be unrealistic because it does not reflect actual operating conditions, nor allow credit for existing mitigation measures that have been identified. Based on the review conducted when preparing this executive summary, the ARS is considered a more realistic scenario and takes into account actual operating conditions.\n\n\n\nThe following are summaries of the toxic and flammable WCS and ARS modeling at Equilon. All OCA release modeling was performed using the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (USEPA) RMP*Comp Version 2.01 off-site consequence analysis program. Population estimates, public receptors and environmental receptors were analyzed using the USEPA's and NOAA's MARPLOT Mapping Software, version 5.0.3. MARPLOT currently uses 2010 U.S. census data.\n\n\n\nAlthough the RMP rule does not allow credit for the consideration of mitigation measures in WCS modeling, various prevention measures that are in place should reduce the likelihood of the WCS and its impacts should it occur. These measures include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n\n\n- Mechanical integrity inspection and preventive maintenance programs;\n\n- Routine surveillance by trained operators;\n\n- Various audible and visual alarm and notification systems;\n\n- Responder call-out, incident command establishment and staging, and agency notification, as necessary.\n\n\n\n1.

An estimated maximum storage quantity of 59,631 lbs. of hydrogen sulfide can be present at this concentration in the K-478 storage tank. The catastrophic failure of the tank results in a toxic endpoint distance of 13.0 miles (20.9 kilometers).\n\n\n\nMARPLOT was utilized to estimate the population impacted by this accidental release. This worst-case scenario has the potential to impact an estimated population of 250,273 people (102,689 residences).

Bayou Trepagnier, which is a designated scenic stream and is located adjacent to the northern fence line at the storage and treatment area, could also be affected by this release scenario.

A calculated amount of 28,900 pounds of hydrochloric acid (37% concentration) will be released in approximately 10 minutes before mitigation of the leak can occur.

Multiple prevention measures are in place to mitigate or prevent this release from occurring and the actual pumping rate in the event of a release would be significantly lower than the modeled scenario.
