      "SummaryText": "Jewel-Osco (?Jewel?) is a diversified retailer of grocery products. Jewel is the wholly owned Midwest Division operating unit of Albertsons, Inc. (Boise, ID).  Jewel operates many retail grocery stores that are supplied through a distribution and transportation complex that straddles property in two cities, Melrose Park and Franklin Park, Illinois. The Jewel Refrigerated Distribution Center #8770 employs approximately 1200 people and uses anhydrous ammonia in two separate systems for the refrigeration of fresh and frozen food products in storage. Anhydrous ammonia is subject to EPA regulation under 40 CFR 68, Accidental Release Risk Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals.  Both of the refrigeration systems exceed the threshold quantity of ammonia and are thus subject to the RMP regulation.\nJewel?s Melrose Park distribution center stores and uses anhydrous ammonia for refrigeration of grocery products in storage.  Jewel?s Melrose Park distribution center has not experienced a release of ammonia involving consequences that affected residents or the environment in the last five years.\nPursuant to the RMP regulations (40 CFR 68) and the Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations, Jewel has developed a comprehensive PSM written program to protect employees and the surrounding community from exposure to the hazardous chemicals onsite.  The facility completed a process hazards analysis (PHA) for ammonia using the industry standard What-If?/Checklist Analysis developed through the International Institute for Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR). The PHA was completed using technical and operations staff from the Melrose Park facility as well as experienced facilitators from an outside engineering firm (ERM-West, Inc.), and was revalidated to meet the PSM and RMP requirements in 2004.\nJewel?s implementation of the PSM program includes employee education in the hazards of ammonia and measures that can be used to reduce employee and community exposure to accidental releases of ammo"

      "SummaryText": "nia. The plans include preventive maintenance programs (mechanical integrity) for the ammonia system, and a program for both pre-startup safety reviews and management of changes (MOC) to this system. The program also includes specific requirements for safe work practices (such as safe approaches to welding and similar hot work) and safety requirements for contractors who may be hired to work on the system.\nAs part of the RMP requirements, Jewel undertook a review of the potential offsite consequences of the accidental release of the largest vessel in the system.  Although such a release is highly unlikely, the regulation requires this review.  \nJewel is committed to minimizing accidental releases of ammonia from the refrigeration process at the Melrose Park distribution center.  Facility management is involved in the design, operation, and maintenance of the system.  Melrose Park?s employees have been involved in the development of the PSM and RMP programs.  Management has committed to working with local agencies and the community to educate the public regarding the hazards of ammonia and to ensure a safe workplace and surrounding community.  Specific questions regarding RMP compliance at Jewel should be addressed to Albertsons? Environmental Affairs Department.\nJewel has prepared this RMP in accordance with the requirements imposed by the April 2004 revisions to the RMP regulations."
