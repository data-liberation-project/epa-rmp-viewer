Our program also relies heavily upon the prior experience of our operators and maintenance personnel, advice and help from outside consultants, inspections by an expert refrigeration company and our on-going commitment to adhere to OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) program.  In this regard we have developed and implemented safe work practices (including lock/out tag/out, confined space entry, line break and entrance control policies and permits), expanded our training and emergency action program and reassessed procedures to maintain the on-going integrity of the refrigeration equipment.  We continuously modernized our facility as new technologies are developed.  One important feature of our prevention strategy is our program for the re-positioning of evaporators in recessed areas, making contact with vehicles highly unlikely, as well as the placement of virtually all of the refrigeration piping on the building's roof.  Other items include updating of our operational manual and training to reflect improved approaches to safety.",

The success of this policy is evidenced by the safe operation of the facility since its original construction in 1957.  \n7 That no vehicles, such as fork lifts, are permitted near ammonia refrigeration components, including piping.  Vehicle drivers are trained to use caution wherever refrigeration units are present.  \n7 That all operators and maintenance personnel must be properly trained before they are permitted to work on, or operate, the refrigeration system.  \n7 That all key operators and maintenance personnel are required to undergo 24 hour hazardous material training as per OSHA 1910.120 regulations.  This is done to insure their ability to participate in the correction or repair of conditions that might result in an accidental release.  \n7 That every employee, visitor, contractor or truck driver is informed of the safety aspects of the facility.  \n\nDescription of our facility and the regulated substances handled, including how and why we use ammonia.  \n\nRefrigeration is an essential component of the health and safety in everyday life of the consumer, who uses it to prevent spoilage.  In the same way, our company employs refrigerated working areas where our meat products are prepared.  Our building is basically a large refrigerator/freezer used to keep food fresh while it is being processed, or stored awaiting shipment.  \n\nAnhydrous ammonia is utilized as the essential refrigerant in the cooling system.  Unlike the now-banned or restricted chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs such as certain Freons and Genetrons), ammonia is not an environmental ozone depleter.  When in the environment, it readily enters the natural nitrogen cycle, supplying fixed nitrogen to plants, which in turn use it as an essential growth nutrient.  In addition, ammonia is a highl"

This translates to lower energy costs, thereby resulting in a savings to the consumer, less dependence upon foreign energy imports, as well as less production of public-utility-generated greenhouse gases.  \n\nDescription of the \"worst-case release scenario\" and the \"alternative release scenario\", including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario.  \n\nWe used the EPA-supplied RMP-Comp software package to perform the release scenario calculations.  As part of our modeling, we have assumed that the building structure will act in the capacity of passive mitigation, to decrease the rate of release to the environment.  \n\nWe have performed a \"worst case scenario\" calculation for a release from a ruptured storage vessel that could potentially hold 938 cubic feet of ammonia.  However, it is our normal operating policy to keep this vessel filled to only about 19 to 31% of capacity.  From our calculations we have concluded that there would be offsite consequences to the neighboring community in the event of an ammonia release.  However, due to our continuous inspection and maintenance procedures, we feel such a release is extremely unlikely.  \n\nWe have also performed \"alternative release scenario\" calculations.  The alternative release we have presented would be if a fork lift completely broke one of the major lines in the system.  In this instance the effect on the surrounding location would be drastically less than in the worst case scenario described above.   This is even assuming no active mitigation devices.  However, our protection systems and devices in the refrigeration system make off-site impact even less likely.  \n\nGeneral accidental release prevention program and prevention steps relating to the ammonia refrigeration system.  \n\nPreventative maintenance has been the hallmark of the safety program at our facility.
