This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our process.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, gas plant trained personnel with assistance from Van Field personnel and the Van Volunteer Fire Department will respond to control and contain the release.\n\n    DESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n    The Van Gas Plant, located in Van, TX, operates a process to produce petroleum product called NGL.  The Van Gas Plant has several regulated flammables, including propane.  The Van Gas Plant does not use and/or process any regulated toxic substances.\n\n    OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n\n    The worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with a release of flammable substances in the program Level 3 process at the gas plant is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) involving the full inventory of the largest storage tank containing NGLs flammable mixture).  The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this WCS is 0.4 mile, resulting in offsite impact.  Although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for passive mitigation measures was taken into account in evaluation this WCS.\n\n    The alternative release scenario (ARS) for flammable substances at the gas plant is a vapor cloud fire resulting from the release of NGLs from a transfer line (5190 lbs. released in 30 seconds).  The release is expected to be isolated by automatic shutdown controls and/or the operators within 30 seconds (active mitigation).  The estimated distance to the lower flammability limit (LFL0 endpoin"

Because the process at the Gas plant that is regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) risk management program (RMP) regulation is also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health AdministrationA?s (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\n    Employee Participation\n\n    The the management at the Van Gas Plant encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the gas plant accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the gas plant and addresses each accident prevention program element.  In addition, the gas plant has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and employee safety issues.  These initiatives include forming teams to promote both process and personal safety.  The teams typically have members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and plant management. \n\n    Process Safety Information \n\n    The Van Gas Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the process.

      "SummaryText": "he Van Gas Plant uses the HazOP methodology on these studies.  The studies are conducted using a team of people that will be knowledgeable in the specific process hazard analysis methodology used.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\n    The PHA team findings are forwarded to local management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\n    To help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\n     \nOperating Procedures\n\n    The Van Gas Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are periodically reviewed and necessary "

This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and fro other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\n    Training\n\n    To complement the written procedures for process operations, the Van Gas Plant utilizes a training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in gas plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration)  they possess adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\n    Contractors\n\n    The Van Gas Plant uses contractors to supplement its work force during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the gas plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform gas plant personnel of "
