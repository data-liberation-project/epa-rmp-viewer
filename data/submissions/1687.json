CHARLES WASTEWATER TREATMENT FACILITIES CHLORINATION BUILDING\n\nINTENT: To define  a guideline regarding communication centwr operations information exchanging to responding fire apparatus and response locations for apparatus in the event of a release of chlorine at the wastewater treatment facility chlorination building.\n\nLOCATION: South off of Deveraux Way at the Public worrks/Wastewater Treatment Facility.\n\nGUIDELINE: An automatic hlorine detection alarm is connected to the Tri-Com Center for the City's wastewater treatment facility, and is identified  as automatic alarm position #1740. In the event of a receipt of an automatic alarm, or of a compalaint from a citizen of chlorine odors, a single engine will respond to investigate. a response from Riverside Drive to Deveraux shall be the response route, the alternate location of 1405 South Seventh Avenue. Tri-com will also notify wastewater treatment pesonnel. If the officer or supervisor confirms a leak, the following items shall be considered:\n\nACTION: A minor leak, such as a feed line connection seal that is leaking is located by using an ammonia squirt bottle. Ammonia vapors, when combined with chlorine will produce a white cloud. Turn off the valve on the cylender to mitigate a minor leak. Full protective turn-out gear is acceptable for minor leaks.\nFor major leaks, the supervisor shall upgrade the alarm to a HAZMAT Response with Trailer. Containment of the leak and evacuation of residents shall be initiated immediately. Responding personnel shall don full encapsulating protective clothing level A, with self contained breathing apparatus, enter the chlorination building from the west side below the overhead crane and proceeed with necessary actions or repairs."
