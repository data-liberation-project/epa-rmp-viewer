This is accomplished by using the most current design, training, and inspecting processes available. Stugeon Point in 2005 installed a scrubber, annually automatic shutoff valves are factory tested and gas detector are inspected and tested weekly\nChlorine flexible line from the tanks to the manifold are repleaced yearly.\n\nTraining in operating procedures are reviewed annually with plant personnel, reviewed during the Annual Review 9/2006\n\nOperating procedures are reviewed annually and offially approved as the accepted oprating procedures as 3/14/2007\n.\nThe Stantionary Source for Chlorine (CAS No. 7782-50-5) The chlorine system maximum inventory is reduced from 32,000 pounds to 16,000 pounds.\n\nThe Worst-case Scenario was completed for 2007 and remains the same as RMP 1999\n\nThe Alterantive Release Screnario  was completed for 2007 and remains the same as RMP 1999\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program  remains the same as the RMP 1999\n\nEmergency Response Program (ERP)  revised February 2003. The ERP is progress of being scheduled and coordinated with the District One Response. The contact being the Local Fire Department Fire Chief a review of ERP will be completed July 1, 2007\n\nPlanned Changes to improve Safety.
