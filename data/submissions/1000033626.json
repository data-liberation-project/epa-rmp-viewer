      "SummaryText": "Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nThe City of Jackson is dedicated to the proper use of chemicals in a manner which is safer to the environment and people.  Chemical storage areas and process equipment are regularly inspected, repaired and upgraded to prevent accidental releases.  Should an accidental release occur, response activities will be coordinated through the Hinds County Emergency Operations Center and the Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality.  On-site personnel are trained to make minor repairs and to contain small accidental releases.\n\n\n\nFacility Description and Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nThe J.H. Fewell Water Treatment Plant withdraws water from the Pearl River, treats the water and supplies the water to a portion of the City of Jackson.  The plant uses chlorine gas mixed in water with anhydrous ammonia gas to disinfect the water.  The chlorine gas is stored in 14 one-ton cylinders.  At a given time, 7 of the cylinders are connected together on a single header.  The ammonia gas is stored in a 10,000 gallon above ground tank with a 2,000 gallon above ground tank used for backup.\n\n\n\nCoordinates for the chemical storage locations at the plants were computed using EPA's downloadable Marplot tool.\n\n\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenarios\n\n\n\nEPA mandates that the Worst Case Release Scenarios have a release of the entire contents of the largest single container of each regulated substance during a 10-minute period with a wind speed of 1.5 meters per second and an F atmospheric stability class.  \"Toxic Endpoint\" distances for releases were developed using tables listed in EPA's \"RMP Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants.\"  Population affected by releases was computed using the EPA / NOAA Marplot 4.2 software which contains the year 2010 census data.  EPA requires that a circle with a radius equal to the \"Toxic Endpoint\" be used to determine the area adversely affected by a release.  EPA does not allow the circle to be mod"

      "SummaryText": "ified to compensate for prevailing wind conditions or terrain effects, which would greatly reduce populated areas adversely affected by a release.  For a 1-ton release of chlorine gas, the distance to the \"Toxic Endpoint\" is 1.3 miles, affecting approximately 5,358 residents and nearby schools, hospitals, major commercial areas, the recreational area along the Pearl River and Leflore's Bluff State Park.  The 10,000 gallon ammonia tank is limited to being filled to 85% of capacity due to the policy of ammonia suppliers used by the City, reducing effective capacity to 8,500 gallons.  For an 8,500 gallon release of ammonia gas, the distance to the \"Toxic Endpoint\" is 2.6 miles, affecting approximately 24,273 residents and nearby schools, hospitals, major commercial areas, the recreational area along the Pearl River and Lefleur's Bluff State Park.\n\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenarios\n\n\n\nAs recommended by the \"RMP Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants,\" a wind speed of 3.0 meters per second and D atmospheric stability class were used.  Gas was assumed to be released through a 1\" diameter break in the supply piping.  Failure of the system to automatically close valving at each cylinder was assumed.  The release scenario for chlorine storage assumed the release of all 7 one-ton cylinders connected together, producing a distance to the \"Toxic Endpoint\" of 0.2 miles, affecting approximately 125 residents, the recreational area along the Pearl River and Leflore's Bluff State Park.  The release scenario for ammonia storage assumed the release of the contents of the largest of the storage tanks (effectively 8,500 gallons), producing a distance to the \"Toxic Endpoint\" of 0.3 miles, affecting approximately 337 residents, the recreational area along the Pearl River and Lefleur's Bluff State Park.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nThe plant is manned 24 hours each day including holidays with at least two operators.  These operators inspect the "

      "SummaryText": "chlorine and ammonia systems at least twice each shift.  The chlorine system has area gas monitors which trigger flashing lights and an audible alarm on the main plant computer in the Operations Room.  The ammonia system has an area gas monitor in the Ammoniator Building which triggers a flashing light and an audible alarm in the building.  The ammonia system also has high and low pressure alarms which produce an audible alarm on the plant computer and a warning light on the plant?s control board.  Maintenance personnel are immediately called in to stop small releases.  The operation and maintenance of the chlorine and ammonia equipment are performed in accordance with manufacturer's instructions.  Operations and maintenance personnel receive regular training in the use and maintenance of the equipment through monthly safety meetings, seminars provided by the equipment manufacturers and formal classes provided through the Mississippi Water and Pollution Control Operators Association and other training providers.\n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nDuring the last five years, the plant has not had any releases of chlorine of ammonia which resulted in death, injury, property damage or environmental damage.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\n\nThe J.H. Fewell Water Treatment Plant has developed an emergency response program.  Once it is determined that a situation is larger than what can be handled by Plant personnel, the situation will be reported to the 911 emergency dispatcher, who will then contact the appropriate emergency response agency, such as the City Fire Department, the City Police Department and the Hinds County Emergency Operations Center (EOC).  Though discussions during monthly safety meetings, through formal training and through quarterly emergency drills, plant operations and maintenance personnel will be properly trained in limited emergency response.  As the situation warrants, the public will be notified through respective Public Affairs personnel at the "
