An 14-mile radius circle surrounding the facility includes all of Henderson, a portion of southern and eastern Las Vegas, and portions of Boulder City. The area encompassed by the circle contains most types of urban land use, as well as large areas of undeveloped and mountainous terrain\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\nThe Henderson bleach facility is committed to the safety and well-being of its employees, neighboring community, and the environment.  Olin is an active member of the Chlorine Institute, an industry group that develops technology for the safe handling and management of chlorine.  \r\n\r\nStationary Source\r\nThe site produces sodium hypochlorite (bleach) from chlorine and sodium hydroxide (caustic).  These chemicals provide important benefits in critical applications such as water purification and household disinfectants.  Olin's policy is to implement reasonable measures to prevent a release of a hazardous material from occurring, to provide early detection of a release in the unlikely event that one would occur, and to have in place a contingency plan to respond promptly yet safely to such a release.\r\nRegulated Substances Handled\r\nThis Risk Management Plan has been prepared to address the handling of chlorine at the Olin Henderson facility.\r\n\r\nLiquefied chlorine is received in 90-ton rail cars and used in the manufacture of bleach.  Customers use bleach to treat drinking water, wastewater, swimming pool water and industrial water to eliminate and/or prevent the growth of harmful organisms.\r\n\r\nThe maximum intended inventory is managed only through railcar space on the site spur. The maximum number of railcars that can be stored onsite is 400, but"
