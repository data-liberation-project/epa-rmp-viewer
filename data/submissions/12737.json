The Emergency Action Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the PSM/RMP document, which is maintained at the facility and updated as necessary.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n  1.)  To save lives.\n  2.)  To minimize and avoid injuries.\n  3.)  To protect the environment.\n  4.)  To minimize property damage.\n\nPool Chlor of Nevada Inc. maintains a safety committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, chlorine health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate facility changes.\n\nPool Chlor of Nevada Inc. has coordinated emergency response efforts with the local fire department.  In the case of a major chlorine-related emergency, it is the policy of Pool Chlor of Nevada Inc. to evacuate and to allow the fire department to respond to the emergency.\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe Pool Chlor of Nevada Inc. facility has been in operation since 1973.  The facility is located at 5560 Procyon Street in Las Vegas, Nevada  89118.  The system was constructed in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations.\n\nThe Pool Chlor of Nevada Inc. facility receives and repackages liquefied chlorine into small 20 pound cylinders that are then used to treat water at local private residence swimming pools.  The maximum amount of chlorine on site is 8 one-ton containers (16,000 pounds).  The entire system including the fill station, one-ton containers, scrubb"

Misters are used to cool the chlorine containers during high temperatures.\n\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY\n\n*  Worst Case Release Result Summary\n\n      Scenario Description:  Release of the maximum quantity of chlorine that can be stored in a vessel (one-ton container) - 2,000 pounds in 10 minutes.  Since the chlorine system is located outside, no passive mitigation measures were taken into account.  The most pessimistic meteorological conditions were used: 1.5 meters per second wind speed, and F stability.  The Risk Management Program Guidance for Waste Water Treatment Plants reference tables were used to determine the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 3 ppm.  This release reaches off site and may impact population receptors.  No environmental receptors were affected by this potential release.\n\n*  Alternative Release Result Summary\n\n     Scenario Description: A release of chlorine from resulting from a 1/4 inch diameter hole in a pipe.  The release rate of chlorine due to the pressure of the tank is 72 pounds per minute.  The meteorological conditions used were 3 meters per second wind speed, and D stability.  The Risk Management Program Guidance for Waste Water Treatment Plants reference tables were used to determine the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 3 ppm.  This release reaches off site and may impact population receptors.  No environmental receptors were affected by this potential release.\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe Pool Chlor of Nevada Inc. chlorine transfer system has many safety features.  Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system.  For example, the Pool Chlor of Nevada Inc. facility operates in accordance with OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation.\n\nIt is planned to install an emergency shut down switch that will activate (close) a motorized valve on the "
