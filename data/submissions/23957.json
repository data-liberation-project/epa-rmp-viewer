Anhydrous ammonia is an effective refrigerant that has been used for many years by most food processing facilities. Ammonia is normally a gas at ambient temperatures but is handled as a gas liquefied under pressure. The refrigeration system consists of a high-pressure receiver, evaporators, compressors, piping, and valves.\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies: Cream O' Weber is committed to promoting safety for the plant, its employees and the surrounding area. The facility is complying with OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard (PSM), Title 29 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 1910.119, and EPA's Risk Management Program regulations (RMP), Title 40 CFR Part 68. The purpose of these programs is to ensure that the refrigeration system is operated safely in order to prevent releases of ammonia from the system. In addition, these programs serve to develop procedures to minimize releases in the event that they do occur and"

The worst case release is one that is unlikely to occur. The purpose of the worst case release analysis is to support a dialogue with the community on release prevention. It is a conservative analysis and is not to serve as a rational basis for actual emergency response planning.\nThe worst case release scenario (as defined by EPA) is the release of the largest quantity of ammonia from a vessel or process line failure that results in the greatest distance to a toxic endpoint. The worst case release scenario for the refrigeration process is assumed to be a case where the total quantity of ammonia in the largest vessel is released. The release scenario was performed assuming that the vessel was filled to 100% capacity.  There were no passive mitigation systems (dikes, berms, drains, sumps or enclosures) considered in the analysis since the vessel is located outdoors.\n\nI\n\n In addition, Dean Foods has installed a sophisticated system of ammonia sensors that can remotely close certain isolation valves in the event of a small release and thereby limit an accidental release of ammonia. These sensors are capable of detecting releases of ammonia at low levels, and are connected to a computer that will shut certain valves to the system if ammonia is detected. In this way, potential releases of ammonia are minimized.\n\nA possible release scenario is one in which Based exhibits 4-5 in EPA's guidance with a release throw a pressure relife valve, the distance to the toxic endpoint  either urban or rural topography. There are no passive or active mitigation ( dikes, drains, sumps and enclosures) considered in analysis"
