Procedures to prevent releases of materials are designed into processes and employees are trained to take precautionary steps to prevent releases including spill containing material and proper storage of materials. \n\nIn the event of an emergency, all employees are trained to initiate the emergency operation plan.  Small releases will be abated by a select number of employees who have been trained to control and stop releases.  For any other releases, the County of Los Angeles Fire Department will be summoned.\n\nA description of your facility and the regulated substances handled.\n\nHitco manufacturers a wide range of composite structures and high temperature materials for the defense and commercial markets.  Composite structure products include rocket nozzle exit cones, aircraft tail cones, and aircraft hydraulic covers.  High temperature materials include aircraft and racing brakes, insulation blankets systems, and heat resistant cloth.\n\nProcesses involved in the manufacturing of composite structures include, lay-up of the raw material (a cloth impregnated with resin) in a mold, curing of the material in autoclaves, adding attachment hardware to the cured structure, and finally, painting.  Brake manufacturing involves curing raw material into discs and then bathing the discs in various gases to increase the density of the discs.  Heat resistant cloths are produced by leaching silica cloth with acid, and then adding various coatings to improve the cloths heat resistant characteristics.  Insulation blanket systems are made from fiberglass impregnated with resin.\n\nHazardous materials used at Hitco include hydrochloric acid, oils, solvents (acetone, isopropyl alcohol, hexane), prepregs (a cloth impregnated with resin), adhesives, paints, nitrogen gas, carbon"

      "SummaryText": " dioxide gas, hydrogen gas, and propane.\n\nPropane, the hazardous material at Hitco subject to the Risk Management Plan, is used as a process gas in the manufacturing of high temperature brakes and as a fuel for forklifts.  The propane is stored in four 1,150-gallon storage tanks.  Pipes and valves are used to convey the propane from the storage tanks into manufacturing process, while propane for fuel is dispensed directly at the tanks.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps.\n\nThis facility complies with EPA?s accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations. The propane system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with NFPA-58 and state law.\n\nFive-year accident history. \n\nHitco has not had an accidental release of Propane. \n\nThe emergency response program. \n\nIn the event of an emergency involving our propane system, it is our policy to notify the county of Los Angeles Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency. We have discussed this policy with the fire department and members of the fire department have inspected our propane system.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety. \n\nNone."
