      "SummaryText": "OLIN CORPORATION     McINTOSH, ALABAMA\n\nThe Olin facility in McIntosh, AL is a part of Olin Corporation; headquartered in Norwalk, CT. Most of the 278 employees at the McIntosh facility live in Washington, Mobile, and Clarke counties. Olin employees are involved in the communities and care about the environment which all of us in Southern Alabama share and enjoy.\n\nMaintaining open, positive relationships with the communities is a priority at our plant. We understand that we are an integral part of the community. We support the Olin Community Advisory Panel which was formed in the early 1990's and is comprised of community members who represent business, education, religion, and youth interests. Monthly, members gather with plant management to share information on topics of mutual interests. Annually, representatives of the McIntosh panel join interested community members to tour the McIntosh facility.\n\nMany items we use every day depend on the products manufactured at the Olin McIntosh Plant. Our primary products; chlorine, and caustic soda, are used to make everything from paper products, clothing, clean water, household bleach, and pharmaceuticals, to plastics, vinyl products, antifreeze, fuels, and paints.\n\n1.0 ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES:\n\nSince it's beginning, Olin has had a safety and environmental program, which relies on the fundamental belief that all accidents are preventable. Our goal is Zero incidents for environmental, safety, and transportation. To help insure that an emergency situation with offsite implications is unlikely to occur, Olin has put six layers of safety protection in place. Employees, Mechanical integrity, Process Hazard Reviews, Process Controls, Safety Systems, and Emergency Preparedness.\n\nAt the Olin, McIntosh, Alabama facility, we are committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes in a safe and responsible manner. We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emerg"

This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n*A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulation which are chlorine and hydrazine\n*A summary of results from our assessment of the potential offsite consequences from accidental chemical releases\n*An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\n*A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule of which is zero\n*An overview of our emergency response program\n*An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment\n*The detailed information (called data elements) about our risk management program\n\nBesides the Chlor Alkali processes, Olin also operates a facility for Arch Chemical Company (formerly Olin Speciality Chemicals) for the blending and storage of hydrazine components for the United States Air Force. These components are used in the Titan space launch vehicles, which have been the Air Force's principle launch system since the mid 1960's. They are also used in satellites for positioning and to operate on-board power systems.\n\nIn our processes, we use the following RMP covered chemicals that EPA has identified which are Chlorine and Hydrazine compounds.\n\nTOXICS\nChlorine is shipped primarily by rail car. \n\nHydrazine is unloaded/loaded, blended, and stored and shipped in trucks and cylinders. The three hydrazine components handled include: Methyl hydrazine, Dimethylhydrazine, and Hydrazine.\n\nAlso included in the RMP list of Regulated Substance and handled at the McIntosh facility, but exempt from the regulation are Hydrogen, and Hydrochloric Acid solutions.

This product is shipped by pipeline to near industrial neighbors to be used as fuel or processed to a liquid form. Hydrochoric Acid solution is regulated by RMP at 37% concentration or greater. The guidelines at McIntosh is that we do not receive shipments of acid that exceed that range.\n\nOur accidental release prevention programs and our contingency planning efforts help us effectively manage the potential hazards that are posed to our employees, the public, and the environment by our use, manufacturing, or handling of these chemicals. There have been no RMP releases in the past five years.\n\nAs part of our prevention efforts, we have implemented the following prevention steps:\n*Site wide chlorine monitors and area perimeter hydrazine monitors\n*Automatic shut off valves for loading operations\n*Well trained work force"
