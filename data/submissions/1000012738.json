A key element of its protection program is the development and implementation of plans to prevent accidental chemical releases.  In addition, if an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to respond in an organized and effective manner.  \n\nThe Cognis Corporation Maudlin, SC facility accident prevention and emergency response programs have been developed in accordance with federal and state regulations, industry standards, and guidance from Greenville County emergency response organizations.    Although the facility's programs have been highly successful - the facility has never had a significant chemical release - the facility continually seeks ways to improve its prevention and response programs.  \n\nThis document, the Risk Management Plan (RMP) for the facility, was prepared to comply with federal regulatory requirements regarding the prevention of accidental chemical releases (40 CFR Part 68 Accidental Release Prevention Requirements).  The purpose of the regulation is to reduce the potential for an accidental chemical release and strengthen emergency response planning at the facility and within the community.  The RMP describes the incident at the facility which would have the most catastrophic effects (the worst case) and several scenarios of lesser magnitude (alternative cases).  Although it is technically infeasible for the worst case described in this report to occur, worst case information is provided to support conservative emergency response planning.  In this way, the community is well prepared to respond to the lesser magnitude scenarios, which are more likely to occur.\n\nCOGNIS CORPORATION\n\nCognis Corporation is a global company with North American Headquarters in Cincinnati, Ohio.

The RMP rule classifies these chemicals as toxic substances.  There are no regulated flammable substances at the threshold quantity at this facility.  Since ethylene oxide and propylene oxide are used in the following processes, these processes are covered by the RMP Rule:\n\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS \n\nFollowing EPA guidance, the facility performed an offsite consequence analysis (OCA) to determine the potential for an accidental release of a regulated substance that could have an impact on the public or the environment.  The OCA consists of evaluating both worst-case scenarios (WCSs) and alternate release scenarios (ARSs).  Based on facility design and prevention programs, the facility does not believe the worst-case release scenario could ever occur.  Although it is also highly unlikely that the ARS would occur, the ARS represents a release that is more likely to occur during the lifetime of a facility like the Mauldin facility. \n\nThe main objective of performing the OCA is to determine the distance at which certain effects might occur to the public because of an accidental release (called the endpoint distance).  The concentration at the endpoint represents the maximum concentration below which nearly all people can be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing irreversible or serious health effects or symptoms which could impair the ability to take protective action. \n\n\nW"

      "SummaryText": "ORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS \n\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) at the Mauldin facility is a catastrophic failure in the ethylene oxide (EO) storage tank resulting in a release of 185,385 pounds of EO over a 10-minute period.  The EO tank is below grade in an open vault, which serves as a dike.  In the event of a release, the vault/dike would contain the released EO, which would evaporate, forming a vapor cloud.   EPA defines the toxic endpoint as that point where the concentration of EO is 50 ppm (0.090 milligrams per liter).  Although the facility has numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for administrative controls or active mitigation measures were taken into account when calculating the distance to the endpoint.  In other words, the facility has provided the worst case estimate of the impact area.\n\nThe facility has modern, redundant systems designed to prevent this scenario from ever happening.  These systems are described in further detail in the section on Chemical Specific Prevention Steps.\n\n\nALTERNATE RELEASE SCENARIOS \n\nThe alternative release scenario (ARS) for EO is a failure of the seal in the loading arm boom attached to the rail car during the EO unloading process.  The 1-minute release duration is the approximate time needed for engineering controls to stop the release.  Failure of the seal was chosen as the potential release because, historically, seals have been a release point for operations of this type in the chemical industry.  \n\nThe ARS for propylene oxide is a failure of the seal in the loading arm boom attached to the rail car during the PO unloading process.

Collectively, these programs prevent accidental releases caused by equipment failure or human error.  Following is a summary of the general accident prevention program at the facility:\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nThe Mauldin facility understands that employee involvement is crucial to the success of an accident prevention program.  The facility aggressively encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation include updating and compiling technical documents, reviewing chemical safety information, and participating in process hazard analyses (PHAs).  Employees have access to extensive process and chemical safety information.  Employee involvement in safety programs is documented in the facility's Process Safety Manual.\n \nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nSafe operation of a process starts with a detailed identification of the hazards associated with the process.

To do this, each process at the facility is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe facility primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of trained personnel who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  The team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nImplementation of mitigating options in response to PHAs is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the facility periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nIn order to operate a process safely, facility personnel need accurate, detailed information ab"

These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. Specific departments within the facility are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety data.  A table summarizing the reference documents and their location is readily available in the Process Safety Section of the PSM Manual. \n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs). For specific process areas, the facility has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) within the batch cards and operating procedures. The facility ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\nThe facility also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  The information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.

These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The procedures are maintained current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change (MOC) process that is explained in greater detail in a subsequent section.\n\nIn addition, the facility maintains batch cards and operating procedures that provide guidance on how to respond to upper and lower limit exceedances for specific process or equipment parameters.  This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the facility has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in facility operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate adequate knowledge to perform duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  Refresher training for all operators is conducted every 3 years.  Each training program includes a method of verifying that the operator understood the training through verbal confirmation and written tests.

Facility personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\nThe facility conducts a PSSR for any new process or process modification that requires a change in process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are prepared before placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves as a quality assurance function by requiring verification that process safety management and accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe facility has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.

Written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training.  Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended, and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels).  If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service. If the required parts or equipment are not available, an MOC team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment until the required deficiency can be corrected.  The equipment will not be placed back into service unless the MOC team can adequately address the modifications required for the safe operation of the equipment. \n\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance.

To prevent such mistakes, the Mauldin facility has a comprehensive system to manage changes to processes.  This system requires that changes to process equipment, chemicals, technology and procedures be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided with the necessary training on the change.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nThe facility promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or could have resulted in, a serious situation, e.g. a fire or explosion, a toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.
