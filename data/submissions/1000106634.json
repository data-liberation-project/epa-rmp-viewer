At the El Dorado Plant, the policies will be implemented through the Standard Operating Procedures, Process Technology Descriptions, Process Hazards Reviews, Training Procedures, Compliance Audits, Safe Work Practices, and Management of Change Procedures.  These procedures are provided in hard copy form to all employees.  Employee Involvement Policies encourage improvement ideas from all employees and provide for employee participation in all aspects of Accident Prevention Activities.  \n\nPrevention Programs dealing with Maintenance and Contractor Safety are provided by Service Level Agreements (SLA) with the site landlord, Lanxess, and are described by their procedures.  Emergency Response is also provided via SLA and is described in the sitewide Emergency response Procedures.\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION\n\nThe Chemours El Dorado Plant consists of process equipment located on 8.8 acres of land leased from Lanxess at their South Plant Site.  The Lanxess South Plant Site is a total of 430 acres located in Union County, south of the town of El Dorado, AR.  The Fluorine Chemicals operations were purchased from Lanxess in 2008.  Lanxess operated these facilities until the sale to Chemours.  Lanxess continues to operate other processes on the site which are considered to be a separate stationary Source for the purpose of 40CFR part 68.\n\nThe Chemours"
