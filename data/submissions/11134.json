The refinery has also developed  Preventative Maintenance and Malfunction Abatement Plans for key processes to prevent, detect, and correct malfunctions or equipment failures which could result in excess emissions.  \n\nMaintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their job in a safe manner.  Written procedures help ensure that work performed is in a consistent manner and provides a basis for training.  Safe work practice procedures, developed by BP Amoco Toledo Refinery, are supplemented by original equipment manufacturers (OEM) manuals, which provide detailed instructions for maintenance, inspection and testing of all refinery plant and equipment.  \n\nInspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended, and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels).  If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing  the equipment back into service (if possible), or a Management of Change (MoC) team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\n\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance.  The BP Amoco Toledo Refinery incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs.  This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\n\nSafe Work Practices\n\nThe BP Amoco Toledo Refinery has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.  Examples of these include (1) control of entry/presence"

These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance are performed safely.\n\n\nManagement of Change\n\nThe BP Amoco Toledo Refinery has a comprehensive system to manage changes that will impact the covered processes.  This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions outside the original equipment design range), procedures and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nThe BP Amoco Toledo Refinery promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts, identify root causes and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  Serious incidents or near-misses are investigated by a team incorporating an independent leader and/or team member(s), while"

Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked in a database (GIRS) until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings.  Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHA's and PHA revalidations.\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the BP Amoco Toledo Refinery periodically conducts an audit to determine whether procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.  Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years.  Both hourly and management personnel participate as audit team members.  The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to refinery management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked in a database (CARTS) until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.  The last audit was conducted during April, 1998.\n\nThe Coker No.3 Unit is a new process plant that was commissioned in May 1999, and therefore has not been subject to the three year compliance audit.  However, the Coker's prevention program was audited by both a pre-startup safety review (PSSR) and by Stage 5 of BP's Project Safety Review (PSR) procedure shortly before commissioning.\n\nBesides the compliance audits, BP Amoco Toledo Refinery has an ongoing program of theme audits to assure that a range of health, safe"

The accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all Program Level 3 RMP-covered processes at the refinery.  Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by (1) equipment failures and (2) human errors.\n\nIn addition to the accident prevention program activities, the BP Amoco Toledo Refinery has safety features on many units to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences (i.e. mitigate) of a release.  The following types of safety features are used in various processes:\n\nRelease Detection\n  Hydrocarbon detectors with alarms\n  Toxic gas detectors with alarms\n\nRelease Containment/Control\n  Process relief valves that discharge to a flare system to capture and incinerate episodic releases\n  Scrubbers to neutralize chemical releases\n  Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated)\n  Automated shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high level, high temperature)\n  Vessel to permit partial removal of the process inventory in the event of a release (e.g., dump tank)\n  Curbing or diking to contain liquid releases\n  Redundant equipment and instrumentation (e.g., uninterruptible power supply for process control system, backup firewater pump)\n  Atmospheric relief devices\n\nRelease Mitigation\n  Fire suppression and extinguishing systems\n  Deluge systems for specific equipment\n  Trained emergency response personnel\n  Personal protective equipment (e.g., protective clothing, self-contained breathing appara"

With a continually maturing process safety program in place at the refinery to prevent process related incidents, the refinery has significantly improved performance in reducing the frequency of even small accidental releases.\n\nBP Amoco Toledo Refinery has experienced five RMP reportable incidents over the past five years, but none of these incidents have resulted in any off-site impact to the community surrounding the refinery, including no injuries or property damage to refinery neighbors.\n\nExcept for one of the five incidents, any impacts have been confined to on-site property damage to refinery plant and equipment.  One incident, involving a compressor explosion at the Isocracker 2 plant in May 1995, resulted in two operator injuries.  Every incident is investigated very carefully to determine ways to prevent similar incidents from occurring, and these findings are implemented and shared with all employees.\n\nThese five incidents involved the release of flammable vapors to the atmosphere for very short periods of time, of the order of less than a minute or two, before the vapors ignited.  The subsequent fires sometimes burned for several hours while refinery operators and emergency responders contained the incidents to prevent escalation and allowed the fuel to burn out safely without impact to local communities.  During these periods, industrial hygienists carefully monitored the air downwind to ensure no harm from the vapors or combustion products to local neighbors.  These combustion products are not RMP regulated substances.\n\nThe following table is a summary of the number of RMP covered incidents that have occurred during the past 5 years: \n\n                          Number of RMP Events                 Number of RMP Events\n                             with On-site Ef"

This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as employee training and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our goal is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, our trained employees will immediately respond to control and contain the release.\n\n\nSafety Performance\n\nThe BP Amoco Toledo Refinery has proven the dedication to Safety First in many ways recently.  The last lost time injury to a BP Amoco employee at Toledo occurred in 1995 and since then, Toledo employees have worked 4.5 million safe work hours without a lost time accident.   Injury frequency rates for employees have been reduced by 82% over the last ten years to the point where Toledo is now in the top quartile of the US refining industry for safety performance.   Industry recognition of this performance has resulted in Toledo receiving National Petroleum Refiners Association  (NPRA) Safety Awards every year for the last three years.\n\nBP Amoco Toledo Refinery contractors are also committed to Safety First"

      "SummaryText": "in their work at the refinery and have experienced similar performance improvement over time.   A major construction project and a major maintenance overhaul project at the refinery have recently been completed with exemplary safety performance by the contractors.   There was only one lost time injury during the period of both projects, which started in September 1997 and ran through April 1999, and the injury frequency rate was significantly below the construction industry average.   Contractors at Toledo have now worked 2.1 million safe work hours since the last lost time accident.\n\n\nEnvironmental Performance\n\nBP Amoco Toledo Refinery is committed to the protection and respect of the environment within which the refinery operates.  We operate in such a manner as to minimize the refinery's impact on the environment while competitively producing quality petroleum products.  We strive to continually drive down our environmental impact by reducing waste, emissions and discharges, and using energy efficiently. \n\n\nPollution Prevention\n\nBP Amoco Toledo Refinery is involved in a number of pollution prevention and waste minimization programs.  The company is proud to have volunteered to participate in the Ohio Prevention First pollution prevention initiative to reduce statewide emissions.  BP Amoco Toledo Refinery committed, by the year 2000, to reduce reported Toxic Release Inventory (TRI) emissions by 50%, compared with 1988.  The refinery exceeded that goal and has now reported a TRI emissions reduction of 68% in 1998.\n\nBP Amoco Toledo Refinery was also proud to have received the 1998 Ohio Governor's Award for Outstanding Achievement in Pollution Prevention for our Flare Flowmeter Project.  This project is a state-of-the-art gas flow monitoring system that is uniquely applied to our flares and 16 flare feed lines.  The project has reduced emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) and criteria air pollutants by approximately 5,000 tons per year.  BP Amoco Toledo Refinery al"

The refinery most recently invested another $75 million on specific environmental controls as part of the Toledo Repositioning Project.  Past investments have dramatically reduced emissions in many categories.  Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) emissions (i.e. benzene, xylene, and toluene) have been reduced 90% since 1990.  This VOC reduction was instrumental in allowing Lucas and Wood Counties in Ohio to be reclassified by the U.S. EPA as achieving attainment levels for ozone. \n\n\nISO 14001 Certification\n\nIn 1998, BP Amoco Toledo Refinery became one of only two petroleum refineries in the United States to have it's Environmental Management System (EMS) achieve ISO 14001 certification.  The Environmental Policy is the main ISO 14001 EMS element which describes the framework for a facility's overall commitment to the protection and respect of the environment.  Each Toledo Refinery employee must know and strive to achieve the refinery's environmental policy of: No Damage to the Environment, Comply with Regulations and Continual Improvement.\n\nWith consideration for the above achievements, the employees of Toledo Refinery have demonstrated a true commitment to the protection of the environment.  Their efforts have allowed the refinery to go beyond compliance and to achieve continual improvement of  our environmental performance. \n\n\nCommunity Liaison\n\nBP Amoco Toledo Refinery places high priority on effective communication with its neighbors.  The Refinery has a philosophy of being open and honest and nurtures a proactive community outreach program.\n\nBP Amoco Toledo Refinery maintains two groups which"

This group's members include officials from the City of Oregon such as the mayor, city councilmen, finance director, fire and police chiefs and school superintendent.  Representatives from the Lucas County Health Office, Toledo Division of Environmental Services, the Ohio EPA, and the Village of Harbor View also attend its quarterly meetings.\n\nRecognizing the need for dialogue with everyday citizens, the Refinery established the Citizens Advisory Panel in 1997.  This group is comprised of private citizens and small business owners and meets monthly.  Its meetings have been used not only to discuss issues peculiar to BP Amoco, but have served as a forum for broader community topics.\n\nBoth groups have provided an excellent vehicle to address issues concerning the refinery as well as providing a conduit for questions, concerns, and comments from the community.  A great part of being a good neighbor is maintaining good communications.  To this end, the Community Advisory Board and Citizens Advisory Panel serve well.\n\n\nPublic Risk Communication\n\nIn line with the refinery's proactive community outreach policy, BP Amoco Toledo Refinery participated in a public roll-out of information concerning Risk Management Planning during May 1999.  The refinery was part of a nine member coalition of industrial and municipal facilities which operated under the aegis of the Lucas County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  This coalition was supported by representatives of Ohio EPA, emergency response agencies, local government, and a public interest group (Ohio Citizen Action), and had been meeting since February 1998 with the aim of determining compliance with the RMP rule and communication to the public.  \n\nThe LEPC established two groups: \n\n* a Technical Work Group (led by BP Amoco) which addressed the compliance issues, risk assessments, and impact zones\n* a C"
