The only chemical present above threshold levels is chlorine which is gas liquified by pressure. A total of 5 to 6 cylinders of 2,000 lbs. each is stored on site. Conventional equations were used as shown on the forms. Additional information requested about the facility and chemical use are as follows:\n\n- The City of Ashland has accidental release and emergency response policies in place at the WTP. As detailed in Section 9, the WTP is part of the county-wide Disaster and Emergency Services (DES) group which has a plan for an accidental chlorine release. This includes staging locations, emergency measures and public communication plans. \n\n- The WTP produces potable water for city residents. Chlorine is used as part of the disinfection process.\n\n- The worst case chlorine release scenario involves a 10 minute release of chlorine. Under this scenario, chlorine could travel 1.3 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public. Up to 3,000 residents live in this area.\n\n- The WTP has taken proactive steps to prevent an accidental chlorine release. Operators have gone through emergency management training and regular maintenance is perormed on th equipment. In addition, the chlorine is fed by vacuum to add additional security. If the vacuum is broken, chlorine will not leak unless the containment vessel has ruptured.\n\n- As detailed previously, the WTP emergency response program is coordinated with the county-wide plan. Initial ER is provided by the Ashland Fire Department and the communication plan includes coordination with local television and radio stations as well as door to door contact of residents in the effected area.\n\n- The city is reviewing the continued use of chlorine as a disinfectant. If gaseous chlorine is determined to be the best disinfectant, an emergency scrubber system will be investigated. New equipment will also be installed in the next 2 ye"
