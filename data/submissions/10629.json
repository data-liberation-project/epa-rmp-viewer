These fluids are utilized for performance testing of submerged liquefied gas pumps and power recovery turbine generator sets. These liquefied gases are stored in four tanks; one 15,000 gallon LNG tank, one 8,500 LPG tank and two 11,500 gallon LN2 tanks.\n\nThe worst case release envisioned at the facility is total release from a LNG or LPG storage tank or large flow line, with a discharge in excess of 5,000 gallons of liquid at one time. An alternate spill is considered to be from a small flow line releasing less than 5,000 gallons of liquid. Any liquid  spill is contained by dykes, and the entire area is covered by a deluge system that will maintain all storage tanks at an acceptable temperature in the event of fire.\n\nThe general accident release prevention is in complete adherence to standards and requlations established for the industry i.e. NFPA, OSHA, EPA, ASME, API, etc. These criteria are supplemented with in-house policies and procedures that are maintained and enforced without exception. Early warning and emergency shut-down systems are in place and operating. These systems are periodically tested to assure proper operation. Also, independent test and inspections are conducted on a scheduled basis, to verify their operations.\n\nCryodynamics' Emergency Response Program provides instructions to all employees and visitors. It is well documented and maintained as part of our overall quality management system that is certified to ISO  9001:1994. This program h"

This was undertaken to continue our accident free operations that we have enjoyed throughout the division's history of more than 25 years. There are no additional up-grades planned at this time; however, safety concerns are an ongoing task, and as deficiencies in our system are identified they will be rectified."
