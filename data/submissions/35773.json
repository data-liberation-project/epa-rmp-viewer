The facility serves domestic and international markets.\n\n2.0  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Programs\n\nAt Chevron Oronite Company, LLC - Oak Point Plant, we are committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes (especially those using hazardous substances) in a safe and responsible manner.  We use a combination of procedures, accidental release prevention programs, fire prevention programs and emergency response training and planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment.    We have had one accident in the past five years that involved a covered process.\n\nWe  take a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.

A second employee was also sent to the hospital for observation but was released after approximately one hour and returned to work the same day.  No other persons on-site or off-site were injured or affected and there was no property damage from this incident.  Additional details are provided in Section 6, Accident History.\n\n5.0  Planned Changes To Improve Safety\n\nThe recent release of Methylamine at our facility has prompted us to take several measures to improve safety for all of our hazardous processes, including those that involve RMP regulated chemicals.  Improvements that are being evaluated, or have already been implemented include:\n  Revision of the Methylamine tank truck unload procedure to require use of breathing air.\n  Implementation of a project to simplify the Methylamine storage facility piping.\n  Review and updating of the emergency response procedures to ensure they reflect current \n     practices and contact information.\n  Plans for more plant drills on hazardous release response to increase awareness of, and\n     reinforce knowledge of the roles and responsibilities plant personnel have during emergency\n     response.  \n  Individual departments, such as the Environmental Team, may increase drills to improve their\n     knowledge of hazardous processes and the potential consequences involved.\n  Guide Sheets that summarize essential emergency response procedures will be made available to \n     help ensure that critical emergency response tasks are carried out and not overlooked."
