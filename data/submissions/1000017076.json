      "SummaryText": "The ADM Decatur Corn Processing Plant has developed a Risk Management Plan (RMP) which covers a single Level 3 program:\n\n\n\n1)  The storage of \"Natural Gasoline\" containing > 10,000 lbs of pentane (a \"flammable chemical\") is used to denature ethyl alcohol (aka ethanol)  prior to being stored for load-out.  The following elements are addressed in the programs:\n\n\n\n\n\n1.    Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies [40 CFR 155(a)&(e)]\n\n\n\nPreventing the release of flammable chemicals is of paramount importance at the Corn Plant due to the serious acute health or catastrophic effects that may result from exposure to an explosion.  Management has made it clear that all leaks are to be taken seriously and that operation of the systems is expected to be performed in a careful and professional manner.  Emergency response policy is predicated on the serious nature of any flammable chemical leak, and stresses the importance of calling in properly trained and equipped professionals when a leak is beyond the capabilities on on-site employees.  The plant maintains an emergency response plan\n\n\n\n\n\n2.    Stationary Source and Regulated Substances  [40 CFR 155(b)]\n\n\n\nThe Corn Plant is owned by Archer Daniels Midland Company and is located at 4666 Faries Parkway, Decatur, Illinois, 62526.  The facility utilizes the wet corn milling process to produce two primary products:  high fructose corn syrup and fuel-grade ethanol. Biological fermentation and thermal distillation are utilized to produce ethyl alcohol from a corn starch slurry.  The 200 proof ethyl alcohol is made non-potable by the addition of 5% natural gasoline. \n\n\n\n\n\n3.    Worst Case Scenario and Alternative Release Scenarios [40 CFR 155(c)]\n\n\n\nEPA has requested that Offsite Consequence Analysis information not be provided in the executive summary due to security concerns.\n\n\n\n\n\n4.    General Accidental Release Prevention Programs and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps  [40 CFR 155(c)]\n\n\n\nThe accidental release preventio"

Five-Year Accident History  [40 CFR 155(d)]\n\nIn the past five years from the date of this plan, the Corn Plant has had no covered releases.\n\n\n\n\n\n6.    Planned Changes to Improve Safety  [40 CFR 155(f)]\n\nGeneral safety planning and improvement programs are in place through various safety committees including the Emergency Action Planning committee.  \n\n\n\nThe plant is also implementing Environmental Management Systems to identify and mitigate risks.  \n\n\n\nThe plant has also instituted a Management of Change (MOC) process to ensure issues affecting RMP are reviewed and addressed."
