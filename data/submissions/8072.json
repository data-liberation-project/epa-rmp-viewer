This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\nWe also have a thorough emergency response plan in place in which our employees and local responders are familiar with through periodic training.  Should a release occur that requires emergency response, the Jefferson County LEPC and Jefferson County Fire company stand ready to work with us to implement this plan and provide highly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities encompass manufacturing of Ammonium Nitrate Fertilizer.  We have 2 regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include Ammonia (anhydrous), Nitric acid and Nitric oxide  [Nitrogen oxide (NO)].  Ammonia (anhydrous) is used to manufacture Nitric Acid (<80 percent) and manufacture Ammonia nitrate solutions.  Nitric oxide  [Nitrogen oxide (NO)] is used to manufacture Nitric Acid (<80 percent).\n\nThe maximum inventory of Ammonia (anhydrous) at our facility is 64,623,674 lb. (32,311.8 tons) while the maximum inventory of Nitric oxide  [Nitrogen oxide (NO)] at our facility is 500.00 lb.\n\n3.    The Worst-Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used t"

The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario submitted for Program 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from the Ammonia Terminal Process.  In this scenario 60,000,000 lb. (30,000 ton) of Ammonia (anhydrous) is released.  The toxic liquid released is assumed to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to evaporate over 10 minutes.  The released quantity has not been limited by a system of administrative controls.  At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of >25 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Ammonia (anhydrous) involves a release from the Ammonia Terminal Process.  The scenario involves the release of 12,500 lb. (6.25 tons) of Ammonia (anhydrous).  Toxic liquid is assumed to be released to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated after 15 minutes.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L of Ammonia (anhydrous) is 0.81 miles (4,277 feet).\n\n4.    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with API and ASME. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source for the Program 3 processes at our plant: 1) the Ammonia Terminal Process and 2) the Ammonia Loading and Storage (Spheres) Process.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nLaRoche Industries, Inc.
