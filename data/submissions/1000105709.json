PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nMPLX is continually striving to make the Champaign LP Terminal the safest and most reliable workplace possible for its employees, neighbors and community.\n\nIn an effort to improve and promote system safety, MPLX actively seeks employee input on process safety improvements. All Process Safety Events (as identified in API 754) are electronically recorded, reviewed, and/or investigated via a root cause analysis (TapRooT) per corporate policy. The Champaign Fire Department is contacted regarding participation in site emergency response training and/or drills. Additionally, MPLX will work cooperatively with the community to address any concerns."

In addition to the presence of appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of butane, an Emergency Response Action Plan (ERAP)/Smart Plan is in place for the Facility and response activities are coordinated with Champaign Fire Department.\n\nC. FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe Champaign LP Terminal has an excellent record of accident prevention. The Terminal keeps records for all incidental and significant chemical releases inclusive of any root cause analyses and associated, follow-up actions where appropriate. This is a new butane tank blending process; consequently, there have been no accidents within the past five (5) years resulting from the release of materials resulting in consequences covered under the EPA RMP reporting requirements.\n\nThe Terminal tracks all process incidents per API 754 guidance to track and respond to leading and lagging indicators.\n\nD. EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe Champaign Terminal is identified as a Non-responding Stationary Source.  As previously noted, the Facility's emergency response plans are coordinated with the Champaign Fire Department and Champaign County Emergency Management Agency. An ERAP/Smart Plan is in place to inform employees what to do in case of a release or fire, and subsequently implement emergency response notification procedures.\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving the Champaign LP Terminal butane tank blending system, it is the policy of the Facility to initially contact the Champaign Fire Department and request their assistance. The Facility maintains a trained (annually) incipient fire and 1st Responder Operations capability.\n\nThe Champaign Fire Department participates in annual butane re"

The Champaign Terminal and its employees are committed to the standards required by these management programs. In addition to the above elements, MPLX also has specific prevention measures that are employed as part of the Terminal's operating procedures and engineering and administrative controls to help prevent,  identify, contain/control, and reduce the consequences of a release. These are summarized as follows:\n\nGeneral Risk Reduction and Safety Measures including:\n\n-Engineering and construction in accordance with recognized industry and company standards;\n-Equipment properly designed with protection from overpressure (pressure safety relief valves, etc.);\n-Updated technical drawings, Piping & Instrument Diagrams and Process/Block Flow Diagrams;\n-Operating systems monitored and controlled by trained Operators;\n-Redundant control systems;\n-Manual shutdown devices for critical systems;\n-Scheduled inspection and testing of safety devices;\n-Limited/secured facility access;\n-Regular safety meetings and safety awareness programs;\n-Routinely scheduled safety inspections and audits; and\n-Frequent unit surveillance by operators.\n\nGeneral Release Mitigation including:\n\n-Process and remotely operated shut-offs to limit release quantity (also actuated via a fusible element);\n-Offload station check valve to minimize pull-away impacts;\n-Strategically located valves to isolate leaks; and\n-Smart-Hose with design break-away and self-closing valves on each end (also pull-away protection.)\n\nGeneral Emergency Response including:\n\n-Emergency alert system;\n-Periodic emergency training for employees;\n-Communication systems with local emergency responders and regulatory agencies; and\n-Emergency drills/training wi"

Safety at the Facility depends upon the manner in which butane is handled as well as the various safety devices incorporated into the design of the process. Furthermore, comprehensive training is provided to employees, which reinforces the safety policies and procedures of the Butane Tank Blending Process.\n\nThe Butane Tank Injection is a batch-type process passed on seasonal RVP adjustments. Butane is received by truck (transports) and piped directly to and injected into the gasoline recirculation line. The butane is pumped by the tanker for direct injection into gasoline lines feeding the product storage tank(s). Process safety controls include a skid emergency shutoff valve with multiple, manual actuators and fusible element along with a Smart-Hose, low emission hose coupler, and thermal/hydrostatic reliefs. Access to the Champaign LP Terminal is restricted to authorized employees, management personnel and authorized contractors/visitors.\n\nB. GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION MEASURES\n\nThe Champaign LP Terminal accidental release prevention and emergency planning/response programs help MPLX effectively manage the hazards posed by the regulated substance to the Terminal employees, surrounding public, and environment. The covered process is regulated by the EPA RMP regulation 40 CFR Part 68, as well as the OSHA Process Safety Management standard 29 CFR 1910.119 and the Illinois EPA. The following accident prevention program elements are in place at the Champaign LP Terminal:\n\n1) Employee Participation;\n2) Process Safety Information;\n3) Process Hazard Analysis (PHA);\n4) Standard Operating Procedures;\n5) Training;\n6) Contractors;\n7) Pre-startup Safety Review;\n8) Mechanical Integrity with Preventive Maintenance;\n9) Hazardous Work Permits"
