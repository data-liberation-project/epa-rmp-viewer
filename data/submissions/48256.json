Accordingly, ESG has developed a proactive safety and environmental programs, which rely upon active employee participation and management leadership and support.  This same proactive philosophy was employed in the development and implementation of the Tupelo Wastewater Treatment Plant RMP for the chlorine and sulfur dioxide systems.  ESG Operations, Inc. has determined that the OSHA Process Safety Management standard also applies to the chlorine and sulfur dioxide storage and chlorination/dechlorination processes and therefore has prepared this RMP to comply with the RMP Program 3 requirements.  By doing so, ESG affirms its proactive safety and environmental philosophy and acknowledges the inherent value of full RMP compliance.\n\nThe RMP prevention program is arguably the most important element of the rule.  Its program elements require the active participation of facility employees and management in conducting activities aimed at preventing accidental releases of chlorine and sulfur dioxide, regulated chemicals under the RMP regulation.  If prevention activities could be completely successful, there would be no need for emergency response activities, since no releases would occur.  Accordingly, a well-developed and properly implemented prevention program will lower the possibility of an accidental release and minimize the consequences of a release should one occur.\n\nESG Operations, Inc. takes an active role in preventing accidental releases by ensuring that its employees are well-informed regarding th"

The chlorine storage and chlorination process has not changed since the time of the first RMP submission in June 1999.  The employees that work on the systems are properly trained in the safe operation and handling of these systems.  Refresher training is provided to the employees annually.  They are aided in this work by standard operating procedures.\n\nESG Operations, Inc. management understands its duty to provide a safe working environment and to take measures to prevent accidents which may have an effect on the surrounding community.  Additionally, ESG Operations, Inc. has established procedures for emergency notification and response. \n\n2.0 Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Tupelo Wastewater Treatment Plant owned by the City of Tupelo is located at 2062 International Drive in Tupelo, Lee County, Mississippi.  The Tupelo WWTP treats wastewater through a series of physical and chemical treatment operations.  ESG operates the City of Tupelo\u00bfs two-stage activated sludge wastewater treatment plant consisting of rectangle clarifiers, with traveling bridges.  The project also operates and maintains approximately 50 lift stations and various lagoons throughout the county.  The plant is designed to treat an average daily flow of 10.5MGD and a peak average daily flow of 12 MGD.\n\nThe Tupelo WWTP utilizes chlorine as a biocide in the treatment of wastewater.\nThe chlorine is stored in one-ton cylinders with a maximum intended inventory of 6 containers (12,000lbs) on site.  In addition, the Tupelo WWTP utilizes sulfur dioxide for the dechlorination of treated effluent.  The sulfur dioxide is stored in one-ton containers with a maximum intended inventory of four containers (8,000 lbs) on site.  Therefore, the Tupelo WPCP is regulated under the RMP rule due to the volume of chlorine and sulfur dioxide stored and used"

The program is described in detail in the manual and meets the requirements of 40 CFR 68.95, which includes facility notification to emergency responders and evacuation procedures.  The goals of the program are to protect onsite employees from the hazardous effects of chlorine or sulfur dioxide release and to minimize the effects of such releases on the general public.  This program is routinely reviewed and updated to reflect personnel and regulatory changes.\n\n6.0\tPlanned changes for Improved Safety\n\nIdeas for changes to improve safety are actively sought from employees.  Employee participation meetings which focus on safety issues are held regularly at the Tupelo Branch WPCP.  Employees are encouraged and trained to recognize hazards and to present ideas to eliminate them or to minimize the potential consequences of such hazards.\n\nAs part of the development of the Tupelo WPCP program, the PHA was revalidated with key employees to meet the prevention program requirements.  As the equipment and the process has remained the same from the time the first PHA was performed in 1999, the PHA review/revalidation conducted did not result in any new findings or recommendations.  The recommendations from the PHA conducted in 1999, 2004 and in 2007.  The findings of subsequent compliance audits were reviewed for completion."
