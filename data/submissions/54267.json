The facility maintains a freezer area of 6.5 million cubic ft. which is used to store perishable products.  Freezers at the facility operate at 0\u00b0F or below.  The facility has approximately 54 dock doors to aid in the transportation of products.  In order to maintain freezer and cooling conditions, anhydrous ammonia is used as a refrigerant.  The refrigeration system is a closed loop industrial refrigeration system. The ammonia is not used or mixed in any manner with other chemical processes.\n\nFACILITY CONSTRUCTION: The facility was designed and constructed in accordance with various Mechanical Building Codes depending on the timing.  These codes and guidelines outline requirements for the safe operation of ammonia refrigeration systems.\n\nSAFETY FEATURES:  The ammonia refrigeration system has many safety features.  Safeties include but are not limited to pressure relief valves, stop valves, ammonia detectors, and computerized refrigeration monitoring system as well as trained and experience operators.  Much of the safety associated with the system is also inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system.  For example, the facility operates in accordance with OSHA\u00bfs Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals, 29 CFR 1910.119) and EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP, 40 CFR Part 68), as well as California\u00bfs Accidental Release Prevention Program (Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5).  \n\nMANAGEMENT\u00bfS COMMITMENT TO SAFETY:  Management takes safety very seriously and mandates that the facility maintain a safe working environment for employees, community and products at all times.  Employees are trained on all safety issues relative to their duties and tasks and made aware of all required regulated safety"

The Committee also may conduct a safety walk-through at various times to look for possible unsafe conditions or procedures that may exist in and around the facility.  \n\nManagement also provides the necessary resources, monetary or with the proper personnel, to ensure that all elements within the regulations are adhered to.\n\nMANAGEMENT SYSTEM:  A Management System has been developed and implemented to ensure that each element within PSM, RMP and CalARP regulations are properly addressed.  Each person is assigned components and is expected to aid in the development and implementation of the components as a whole.  The group works as a team to ensure that not only all elements are met but also to ensure that:  (1) Employees participate in the development and implementation of the programs (2) Aid in gathering Process Safety Information, (3) Operating procedures are developed and certified annually, (4) Safe Work practices are enforced, (5) the proper personnel serve as members of the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) and the all recommendations from the PHA are addressed in a timely manner,  (6)  Affected employees are properly trained as well as those whose jobs are working on or near the refrigeration system are appropriately trained, (7) Contractors are qualified to work on or near the refrigeration system and are informed on potential health risks associated with the system,  (8) Hot Work Permits are properly filled out and all persons affected by the work are aware of potential hazards, (9) Compliance Audits are performed and recommendations from the audits are assigned to proper personnel, and are addressed in a timely manner., (10)  Management of Change and Pre-Startup Safety Reviews are filled out and reviewed prior to con"

Investigations are utilized to improve employee actions during an emergency. \n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:  There have been no reportable ammonia related accidents, incidents or releases at the facility during 2003 thru submission date April - 2008.  \n\nEMERGENCY ACTION PROGRAM:  The facility has established an Emergency Action Plan pursuant to CalOSHA, CCR Title 8, Section 3220 and 29CFR 1910.38. The Plan explains actions employees, contractor employees, and visitors take in the event of an emergency which include steps to take in the event of a fire, earthquake, tornado, ammonia release, etc. \nThe Emergency Action Plan states that all employees shall: \n1)\tNotify a supervisor or main office personnel to begin the facility evacuation steps and set in motion the public announce (PA) system,\n2)\tNotify the appropriate emergency responders, \n3)\tNotify and aid (if possible) other employees at the site, contractors or visitors of emergency as they evacuate the building, \n4)\tAssist in a safe and orderly evacuation, \n5)\tGather and remain at the designated assembly area(s) for a head count.  \n6)\tRemain at the assembly area until a Supervisor instructs otherwise.  \n\nThe Emergency Action Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year. \n\nPREVENTION PROGRAM 3:  \n1.

Process Hazard Analysis: A formal study of the ammonia refrigeration system with management, safety, and maintenance personnel was conducted using the HAZOP method to evaluate the potential hazards of the system. \n\n4. Operating Procedures: Written standard operating procedures have been developed and are developed as needed for the ammonia refrigeration system to ensure safe operation of the system.

Description of plans to improve safety:  Improve Preventative Maintenance documentation for all material handling equipment, continued employee safety meetings, continued training for the Refrigeration Operators.  \n\nWorst Case Scenario\nThe total ammonia charge at Los Angeles Cold Storage consists of approximately 22,000 lbs.  The Low Temperature Pump Receiver (LTPR) is the largest vessel in the system; however the facility has a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP-Isolation and Pump Down of LPTR-1-located in the System Entire-Refrigeration SOPs/Isolation and Pump down of LPTR-1) which demonstrates that the facility DOES NOT pump down to this vessel.  Therefore, during a system pump down the High Pressure Receiver is used.  The High Pressure Receiver has a capacity of approximately 8,900 lbs at 80% of anhydrous ammonia.  Thus the maximum capacity of the High Pressure Receiver at 80% full of anhydrous ammonia was used in the Worst Case Scenario resulting in a release of 0"

      "SummaryText": ".9 miles.   \n\nAlternative Case Scenario\nLos Angeles Cold Storage considered the following alternative release scenarios for anhydrous ammonia and selected a scenario that was more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario and that would reach an endpoint offsite.  A minimum of five years accident history was considered during the Alternative Case Scenarios.  *NOTE: LACS has not had a reportable release of anhydrous ammonia within the past five years. \n\n\nRelease Scenarios Considered: \n1.\tTransfer hose release due to split or sudden hose uncoupling, \n2.\tProcess piping release from failure at flanges, joints, welds, valves and valve seals, and drains or bleeds. \n3.\tProcess vessel or pump release due to cracks, seal failure, or drain, bleed, or plug failure. \n4.\tVessel overfilling and spill, or over-pressurization and venting through relief valves or rupture disks.  \n\nAfter much consideration and review of all Alternative Scenarios listed above, LACS chose an ammonia release from failure of valve seal as the most likely Alternative Scenario to occur and/or reach a Toxic Endpoint receptor.  The estimated distance to Toxic Endpoint is 0.1 miles.  According to Region I LEPCs Implementation Guidance Document, Section 4.4 Estimating Off-Site Receptors part (B) paragraph 2, LACS will report 0.5 miles as the distance to Toxic Endpoint rather than the 0.1 mile as EPA\u00bfs RMP Comp modeling program calculated.  \n\nAll sensitive receptors have been identified and placed on the Alternative Scenario Map within a 0.5 mile radius from LACS.
