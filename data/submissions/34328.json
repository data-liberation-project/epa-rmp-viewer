The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities encompass finishing textile fabrics.  We have two (2) regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances are chlorine and sulfur dioxide (anhydrous).  The chlorine is used for water and wastewater dechlorination while the sulfur dioxide is used for wastewater treatment.\n\nThe maximum inventory of chlorine at our facility is 10,000 pounds while sulfur dioxide is present at our facility in a maximum quantity of 8,000 pounds.  The Dan River Inc. - Brookneal Plant has never experienced a release of either chlorine or sulfur dioxide.\n\n3.  The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidential release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1967 Edition.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nDan River Inc. - Brookneal Plant maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensu"
