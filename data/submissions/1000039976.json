TVA conducted comprehensive analyses of the process to ensure that hazards\n\nassociated with the process were identified and controlled effectively. The Hazardous and Operability Study\n\n(HAZOP) analysis methodology was used to assess the potential hazards of the process. The study was\n\nconducted by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering, control logics, and process\n\noperations. Findings resulting from the analysis were addressed. The HAZOP analysis was conducted on\n\nJanuary 15-17, 2002 and a pre-startup HAZOP review was conducted on March 31, 2004.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures ? TVA has established and maintained procedures for safely conducting activities within\n\nour covered process. The procedures cover various operational phases including initial startup, normal startup,\n\nnormal shutdown, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, and startup following a\n\nturnaround or emergency shutdown. The information is readily available to operators and maintenance\n\npersonnel involved in the process and the information is periodically reviewed to assure it is current.\n\n\n\nTraining ? TVA?s training program is comprehensive and is implemented to ensure that all personnel involved in\n\nthe operation and maintenance of the process are properly trained in the safe operation and maintenance of the\n\nprocess and knowledgeable of the hazards of the process. The personnel are provided with refresher training\n\nat least every three years or more often if needed.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity ?

Equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are\n\ncorrected promptly and safely.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change ? TVA maintains written procedures to manage changes in the process equipment,\n\nprocedures and monitoring technology which assures that any changes meet regulatory requirements.\n\nPersonnel whose job tasks are affected by a modification in the process are promptly apprised of the\n\nmodification and provided training to address the modification.\n\n\n\nPre-Startup Review ? A pre-startup safety review was conducted prior to the startup of the new process.\n\nEstablished pre-startup safety review procedures assured that construction and installation of covered process\n\nequipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for a safe startup prior to placing equipment\n\ninto operation and all elements of the RMP are in place.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits ? TVA conducts environmental and safety audits on a regular basis and will determine\n\nwhether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented. The audits will be conducted at\n\nleast every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits will be promptly and safely\n\nimplemented.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigations ?
