The system is checked on a regular basis to ensure it is functioning properly and in good repair.\n\nThe facility has an emergency evacuation plan that includes ammonia leaks.  If an ammonia leak or an alarm indicating an ammonia leak is observed by facility personnel, the decision to evacuate the building is made by management.  Professional emergency responders are called to assist with the ammonia leak as necessary. \n\nThe management at Eckert Cold Storage is committed to safety.  The emergency action plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration systems at 757 Moffat Boulevard in Manteca, California was constructed in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations including the Uniform Fire and Mechanical Codes at the time of construction.  \n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is a closed system that cycles the refrigerant from liquid to gas and back again.  The system, consisting of vessels, piping, valves, and process equipment, cycles 12,000 pounds of ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for dock operations, cooler and freezer storage. The majority of the system is located in the engine rooms including vessels and compressors.  The condensers are mounted on the roof, and the evaporators are located in their respective cold storage areas.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe Eckert Cold Storage amm"

For example, the facility operates in accordance with Cal/OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation.  The facility conducts maintenance and any necessary repairs in house.\n\nThe facility including the ammonia system was designed and constructed in accordance with the Uniform Mechanical Code, which specifically outlines requirements for the safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system.  These safety features include ammonia sensors in the engine rooms as well as sensors near the evaporators, and automatic shut down systems.  In addition, the majority of the ammonia is maintained inside the engine rooms and just outside of the engine room (condensers and vessels).  All pressure vessels are equipped with pressure relief valves that are commonly piped and vent to atmosphere.\n\nIn addition to the Uniform Mechanical Code, Eckert Cold Storage has developed a preventive maintenance program to complete regularly scheduled inspections and tests of the ammonia refrigeration system as well as repairs as needed to process equipment.\n\nEMERGENCY ACTION PLAN\n\nThe Eckert Cold Storage facility has an emergency response plan in effect.  The Emergency Action Plan (Plan) has been developed by Eckert Cold Storage and is included in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the PSM/RMP/CalARP document which is maintained at the facility.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n  1.) To save lives.\n  2.) To minimize and avoid injuries.\n  3.) To protect the environment.\n  4.) To minimize property damage.\n\nThe Eckert Cold Storage facility maintains a safety committee whose members include the designated incident commander for the facility and the maintenance department at a minimum.

In addition, there have been no injuries resulting from an ammonia release, nor any releases or A?near missesA? that warranted an internal incident investigation.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe Process Hazards Analysis Revalidation study (performed on April 30, 2009), including a Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) study and a Facility Inspection, provided mitigation measures to improve safety at the Eckert Cold Storage facility located at 757 Moffat Boulevard in Manteca, California. The Eckert Cold Storage safety committee is planning to complete several items over the next year, as a continual effort to provide a safe work environment for their employees.  These changes include the following items:\n\n1. Continue to train all employees in the facility safety plan/programs.\n\n2. Continue to have employee involvement in safety plan development.\n\n3. Continue employee involvement through safety team participation.\n\n4. Continue internal and external safety audits/inspections and implement changes as needed.\n\n"
