Anhydrous ammonia (NH3) is a gas at ambient conditions. The ammonia refrigeration system is used to control the processing and room temperature for plasma-derived and related products. It is a closed system that contains approximately 182,000 pounds of ammonia in various physical states (gas, liquid, and saturated vapor). The vessel that can contain the largest volume of ammonia is the high-pressure (HP) receiver. The vessel operates at approximately 150 to 180 pounds per square inch gauge (psig) and can contain as much as 48,502 pounds of liquid ammonia. However, during typical operation, the vessel holds about 10,000-15,000 pounds. Most of the ammonia equipment is located indoors. The HP receiver, condensing towers, some chillers, and most piping runs are located outdoors.\n\n\n\nAmmonia is the oldest and most common refrigerant in general industrial use throughout the world. It is a high capacity refrigerant that operates at reasonable pressure. At this facility, personnel exposure to more than a small leak is rare because ammonia operates within a closed system of vessels, piping, and equipment and its self-alarming properties allow for immediate detection and response.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.2 PROCESS DESCRIPTION\n\nA refrigeration system is used to reduce the temperature of a heat source. A mechanical refrigeration system is a closed system that cycles the refrigerant, ammonia, from liquid to gas and back again. As the refrigerant absorbs large amounts of heat from the "

      "SummaryText": "source, it changes from liquid to gas. At a different part of the system, the refrigerant releases heat as it is condensed back into a liquid. This system is referred to as having two sides: a low pressure or low side, where the refrigerant absorbs heat as it evaporates, and a high pressure or high side, where the refrigerant vapor releases heat as it is condensed back into a liquid. The system basically moves heat from the low side to the high side. Refrigeration is maintained by isolating the low side in some form of insulated enclosure where goods or processes can be chilled or frozen.\n\nThe low side of the refrigeration system typically uses one or more evaporators to remove heat from the space or products to be cooled. An evaporator contains a set of continuous coils through which the refrigerant flows. Due to the low pressures and corresponding low temperatures maintained in the evaporator, the liquid refrigerant quickly evaporates, absorbing a great deal of heat from the surrounding area. To increase the rate of heat removed, the evaporator uses an electric fan to move warm air over the coils of cold liquid ammonia.\n\nThe low and high sides of the refrigeration system are separated by the compressor and the expansion valve. The compressor is the driving force of the system. It pulls refrigerant vapor from the evaporator (low side) at a rate that will maintain the evaporator pressure required for the desired operating temperature. At the same time it pressurizes the warm vapor and forces it into the condenser and the high side of the system. Refrigeration compressors on the market today are screw type, reciprocating, and centrifugal.\n\nExpansion valves regulate the flow of liquid refrigerant from the high side to the low side by causing a large pressure drop. These valves are located between the receiver (high side) and the evaporator (low side). These valves, coupled with the capacities of the compressor, can help regulate the pressure of the evaporator thereby "

      "SummaryText": "creating the cooling capabilities of the system. The high side of the refrigeration system consists of a condenser and a receiver. Warm refrigerant vapor enters the condenser after it has been pressurized by the compressor. A condenser will typically use air and water to cool the warm ammonia as it passes through a series of tubes within the condenser. As the cooling medium of air and water draws the heat from this vapor, the refrigerant condenses into a liquid and flows to the receiver. The receiver serves as a holding tank for the liquid refrigerant being fed to the low side. It also serves to hold the bulk of the refrigerant in the system when it is not in operation.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.0 POTENTIAL RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nCSL Behring's refrigeration system is a totally closed system. Historically, releases of ammonia from industrial refrigeration systems most often occur from leaking valves, malfunctioning pressure relief devices, or inadvertent releases during repair activities. While these incidents can impact employees, this facility has never experienced a release of a reportable quantity that represented an off-site impact (i.e., beyond the property line).\n\n\n\nThe off-site consequence modeling consists of both a worst case and an alternative case release scenario for the refrigeration system at the facility.  EPA's \"General Guidance on Risk Management Programs for Chemical Accident Prevention\" (April 2004) was used as the primary source to determine the downwind distances for each scenario.\n\n\n\n2.1 WORST-CASE RELEASE\n\nQuantity Released\n\nThe Worst-Case release scenario is a release of the total quantity of ammonia from the largest vessel (High Pressure Receiver) in the ammonia refrigeration system in 10 minutes, taking into account administrative controls that limit the maximum quantity in the vessel. The receiver cannot hold the system's entire ammonia inventory of 182,000 pounds as currently designed, so this amount was not assumed to be released for the worst-case scenario. \n"

The alternative release scenario chosen for this facility is that of a 0.25-inch diameter orifice leading to an airborne release, representative of a pump seal leak, a gasket rupture, pinhole leak due to corrosion, flange seal leak, valve bonnet seal leak, small vessel release etc. (this is representative of many release scenarios discussed during the Process Hazard Analysis). It is assumed that this release is from the high side of the system, therefore at a maximum pressure of 150 psig. The release scenario is assumed to last approximately 60 minutes (in which time the entire charge will be released). Passive mitigation was considered for the release as some ammonia equipment is located inside of building walls.\n\n\n\nRelease Rate Calculations\n\n\n\nFor modeling the alternative release scenario, the RMP regulation allows typical meteorological\n\nconditions at the facility to be used. For the alternative release scenario, a wind speed of 3\n\nmeters/second and neutral conditions, D stability, were used. The release rate is derived using the\n\nfollowing steps:\n\n\n\nArea of the release orifice from a 0.25-inch diameter hole is calculated as follows:\n\n\n\n  HA=eD^2/4 = ex0.25 in^2/4 = 4.91x10^-2in^2     \n\n\n\nThe \"General Guidance on Risk Management Programs for Chemical Accident Prevention\" uses the\n\nBernoulli equation for predicting the rate of release of liquid from a vessel. This is a very\n\nconservative equation in that it assumes that the release is on the liquid side of a vessel or a rupture of\n\na very short pipe. This equation does not take into consideration any flashing at the orifice or\n\npressure drop of a long pipe-run, which would reduce the rate of release. The following is a\n\nsimplified version of the Bernoulli equation (based on the derivation in Appendix E of EPA's\n\nGeneral Risk Management Guidance document referenced below), incorporating chemical-specific\n\nfactors for ammonia:\n\n\n\n QR2 = HA x 203 x sqr Pg = (4.91x10^-2 in ^2) x (203) x sqr 150 psig "

      "SummaryText": "\n\n\nRelease Duration\n\nThe first 10 minutes of the release for solutions under ambient conditions is required for estimating the off-site consequences, because the toxic component in a solution evaporates fastest during the first few minutes of a spill, when its concentration is highest.\n\n\n\nPassive Mitigation Measures\n\nIf the largest vessel in the process is stored in an enclosure (building), the release rate to the outside atmosphere will be considerably less than if it were stored outside. In case of a release inside a building, the building can be considered to provide passive mitigation, unless:\n\n\n\n?    The building may fail as a result of the release. This is unlikely except in the case of a large vessel in a very small room. As a rough rule of thumb, if the room volume divided by the quantity of ammonia released is less than the value of 0.1, there is a possibility that the release of ammonia will cause failures such as windows blowing out or doors blowing open.\n\n?    The release takes place facing an opening in the building (door or windows). In this case, the door or windows will be assumed to be open, and the ammonia will be released through these openings.\n\n\n\nSince the largest vessel, the High Pressure Receiver (HPR) is located outside, a release from the vessel would not be mitigated by the building however, there is an emergency ventilation system in place which will automatically vent the ammonia vapors to the outside. Thus, passive mitigation effects were not taken into account for the worst-case scenario.\n\n\n\nMeteorological Conditions\n\nFor the worst case scenario, a wind speed of 1.5 meters/second and stable conditions (F class stability) were used, based on EPA requirements.\n\n\n\nRelease Rate Calculations\n\nThe initial release rate is derived by dividing the total quantity released evenly over a 10-minute duration. The High-Pressure Receiver is not capable of holding the system's entire ammonia charge of 182,000 pounds. The High-Pressure Receiver only holds 48,5"

This release rate will be used to determine the potential downwind distance for the Worst-Case scenario based on the EPA guidance document reference graphs (See Appendix B).\n\n\n\nRural vs. Urban Topography\n\nThe local topography surrounding the facility was classified as Urban. Urban means that there are many obstacles in the area immediately surrounding the release including skyscrapers, buildings, or trees. Rural means that there are few buildings or other obstacles in the immediate area. A facility's topography is classified as urban by using the following guidance below:\n\n\n\nIf 50% of the landmass within a 1-mile radius can be described as indicated below, the area can be classified as urban:\n\n?    Heavy industrial (large chemical, other manufacturing facilities, 3-5 story building, flat roofs, grass and trees extremely rare); or\n\n?    Light-to-moderate industrial (rail yards, truck depots, warehouses, industrial parks, minor fabrication, 1-3 story buildings, flat roofs, limited grass and trees); or\n\n?    Commercial (offices and apartments, hotels 10-story heights, flat roofs, limited grass or trees); or\n\n?    Compact residential (single and some multiple family dwellings closely spaced, 2-story or less, alleys pitched or flat roofs, limited lawns and few old established trees, no driveways).\n\n\n\nIf none of the above applies the area is classified as rural.\n\n\n\nEstimation of Distance to Toxic Endpoint\n\nThe following source was used to identify the distance to the toxic endpoint of 200 ppm (0.14 mg/L).

Passive mitigation measures were\n\nnot considered as this release could occur outside. This release rate can then be used to determine the\n\npotential downwind distances for the alternate release scenario.\n\n\n\nEstimation of Distance to Toxic Endpoint\n\n\n\nThere are multiple references that can be used to identify the distance to the toxic endpoint (0.14 mg/L). This source uses EPA-approved reference tables:\n\n?    EPA's \"General Guidance on Risk Management Programs for Chemical Accident Prevention\", April 2004, Exhibit E-3[5]. The RMP*Comp Model developed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and EPA was used to prepare the data in this guidance document.\n\n\n\nTable 4-2 shows the methodology and the results of a 60-minute release (at 110 lbs./min) causing a release of up to 6600 pounds of ammonia from the Processing System. The atmospheric stability class of \"D,\" in an urban area was used with a wind speed of 2.8 meters per second and no passive mitigation effects taken into account. Because wind direction does not impact the downwind distance to the toxic endpoint in this study, the resulting plume is round.

In an effort to minimize the probability and severity of an ammonia release, a prevention program that satisfies the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals standard (29 CFR 1910.119) has been implemented. The key components of the prevention program are summarized below:\n\n\n\n? The development, documentation, and availability of critical process safety information regarding ammonia, the design basis of the system, and the equipment. This information is used in an effort to fully understand and safely operate the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\n? The development of an employee participation program, which includes employees throughout the organization and from a cross section of areas within the plant (i.e., production and maintenance). This program also assumes that employees that utilize the ammonia system and are most knowledgeable about it are best able to easily, effectively, and regularly recommend changes or improvements which enhance safety.\n\n? The performance of a formal process hazard analysis (PHA), using the \"What-if...\" technique. A team with expertise in engineering, operations, maintenance, and safety evaluated the existing refrigeration system in depth and developed recommendations designed to enhance the safety and operability of the system. The PHA addressed: (1) process hazards; (2) previous incidents, if any; (3) engineering and administrative controls applicable to the hazards; (4) the consequence of control failure; (5) facility siting; (6) human factors; and (7) a qualitative evaluation of possible safety and health effects of control system failures. The PHA resulted in multiple procedural "

These recommendations are in the process of being resolved and many changes have already been implemented. The PHA will be updated and revalidated every 5 years.\n\n? Written operating procedures (OPs) were prepared that are designed to provide the basis for proper and safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system. The OPs include procedures for normal operation, startup, shutdown, emergency operation, and emergency shutdown. They also describe safe operating limits for temperature and pressure, the consequences of operating outside these safe operating limits, and a description of safety systems and how they operate.\n\n? Refrigeration system operators receive refresher training at least every 3 years. The training content is based upon the process safety information and operating procedures. The training program is designed to ensure that the operators understand the nature and causes of problems that may arise from system operation as well as the potential hazards particular to ammonia and the refrigeration process.\n\n? Formal authorization systems (i.e., management of change procedure, pre-startup safety review) are in place that are designed to ensure that system changes or expansions are as safe as the original design and that an independent recheck, prior to start-up, confirms that the changes are consistent with the engineering design and safety requirements.\n\n? Events that might (or did) cause an accidental or unexpected release of ammonia are subjected to a formal investigation. The objective of the investigation is to address issues in such a way as to prevent recurrence.\n\n? Contractors that are hired to work on, or adjacent to, the refrigeration system are \"pre-qualified\" based upon their knowledge of ammonia refrigeration, understanding of applicable codes and standards, and their demonstrated ability to work safely.\n\n?

Periodic walk-throughs occur to find unusual or increasing vibration, incipient leaks, corrosion, or other indications of potential upsets or failures that could lead to a release.\n\n? Replacement of pressure relief valves every 5 years.\n\n? Numerous safety systems including pressure relief valves, monitors, ammonia vessel level controls, and safety interlocks are used in the refrigeration system.\n\n? Periodic inspection and calibration is performed on liquid level sensors, atmospheric sensors, temperature and pressure instruments, switches, and shutdown devices that have safety implications.\n\n? Periodic inspections are performed for major powered equipment, including compressors, pumps and large fans, bearings, couplings, shaft seals, mountings, etc., for vibration or incipient mechanical failure.\n\n? Proper design including adherence to recognized safety codes, such as the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR).\n\n? Adherence to fire codes and preparation for fires, storms, or events which could impact the ammonia system.\n\n? Planning with the local fire department to ensure a rapid response to potential incidents involving the system or external events, such as floods or tornadoes.\n\n? Prevention program compliance audits performed every 3 years to verify that the elements are being properly implemented. Any issues found in an audit are addressed in accordance with an action plan.\n\n\n\n4.0 ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe facility has not experienced a release of ammonia within the past 5 years that has resulted in on-site death, injury, or significant property damage or off-site death, injury, evacuation, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n\n\n5.0 EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGR"
