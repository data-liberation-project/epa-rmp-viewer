Manager\n\n\n\nRisk Management Plan - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\n\n1. The Facility Policy\n\n\n\nThe owners, management, and employees of Cotton Growers Cooperative are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n\n\n2.Facility information\n\n  *The primary activity at the facility is the storage of fertilzers for sale to farmers.\n\n  *Anhydrous amonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application for crop\n\n   production nutrients.\n\n\n\n3. The worst-case release scenario and alternative release scenario:\n\n\n\n a. The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.\n\n b. The alternative release scenario based on the most likely potential incident is a release from a break in a transfer hose. The distance to the endpoint  is 1.3 miles.\n\n\n\n4. The accidental release prevention program\n\n\n\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, Kk-611.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".\n\n\n\n5. The Five-year Accident History \n\n\n\na. There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\n\n\n\n? Have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor\n\n? To our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6. The Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\nThe facility has:\n\n\n\na. A written Emer"

Planned Changed to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
