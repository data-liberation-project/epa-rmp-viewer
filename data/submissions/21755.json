A preventative maintenance program has been in place for some years already and to date we have experienced no ammonia discharges.  \nOffsite Consequence Analysis:\nWorst Case Scenario?computed using RMP comp software.  Urban setting was chosen because of steep terrain with heavy ground cover on West side and along the peninsula on the East side of Gibson Cove.  Scenario assumes a catastrophic failure of High Pressure Receiver.  Quantity was computed using a full high pressure receiver plus the normal condenser load.\nAlternate Case Scenario? computed using RMP comp software.  Urban setting was chosen because of the steep terrain with heavy ground cover on the West side and along the peninsula on the East side of Gibson Cove.  Scenario assumes a ? inch liquid feed line breaks inside a plate freezer and the plant is evacuated leaving liquid pumps running until Low Pressure Accumulator low level float switch opens which removes power from ammonia pumps. \nOutline of company plans to install remote refrigerant isolation and dump systems.\nA system is presently being designed for our facility that would allow the isolation of the high-pressure receiver, the main storage vessel for our refrigerant,\nfrom the rest of the system.  This would minimize the volume of ammonia that could be discharged from a catastrophic failure.  This system would also incorporate a means to dump the entire system refrigerant charge into water.  \nCompany Emergency Response Plan:\nIt is Cook Inlet Processing's policy to contact the Kodiak Fire Department in the event of a major ammonia release.  Our maintenance personnel will remain available to aid the fire departments efforts through their knowledge of our particular system. \n    \nNotification Procedures:\nPlant proce"

      "SummaryText": "dures:\nAn audible alarm (busy signal bell) will sound whenever ammonia is detected in the compressor room to alert plant personnel of a possible problem.  If evacuation is necessary all personnel will be notified via the plant intercom system.  Evacuation will progress in accordance with company Safety Manual instructions.\nKodiak Fire Department:\nAs soon as it is determined that there is a release beyond the capabilities of our maintenance staff to contain the Kodiak Fire Department will be notified by use of the 911 system.         \nThe Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation, National Marine Fisheries Service and Kodiak Fishmeal Company will all be notified via telephone and / or in person as needed.  National Marine Fisheries Service and Kodiak Fishmeal Company are within the impact area of our worst case scenario and will be notified at any time a situation would arrise requiring notification of outside responders.\n\nPrevention and Response:\nIn November of 1999 C.I.P. was actively involved with the Kodiak Hazardous Materials (HazMat) Project sponsored by the Alaska DEC, Division of Spill Prevention and Response.  All available management and maintenance personnel attended the various training exercises that were made available.\nThrough regular individual and group safety / training meetings the maintenance staff is given instruction in standard operating procedures, emergency procedures, use of standard safety practices and personal protective equipment.  The Kodiak Fire Department has been contacted and has agreed to provide instruction in the use and maintenance of company owned SCBA's."
