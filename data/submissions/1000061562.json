These are Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC) and Vinyl Chloride Monomer (VCM). A description of the covered processes is included in this summary.\n\n\n\nRMP-Covered Materials:\n\n\n\nThe facility has five RMP-covered materials on site exceeding the RMP-specified regulatory threshold quantities. These materials are chlorine, anhydrous hydrogen chloride, vinyl chloride, propylene, and chloroform.\n\n\n\nChlorine is a greenish-yellow gas; it's heavier than air; it has the strong odor of household bleach; it is corrosive. Chlorine is used as a drinking water disinfectant; making household bleach; making plastics and other chemicals. Formosa uses this material in the manufacture of vinyl chloride.\n\n\n\nVinyl Chloride monomer is a colorless gas; it is heavier than air; it has a sweet odor; it is flammable. Formosa manufactures and uses this material in the production of polyvinyl chloride.\n\n\n\nAnhydrous Hydrogen Chloride is a colorless gas; it is heavier than air; it has an irritating, pungent odor; it is corrosive.

      "SummaryText": "ding tanks and centrifuges, where the slurry is dewatered and the PVC wet cake is produced. Water is pumped to the biotreatment plant. PVC wet cake is dried in either cyclone or fluidized bed dryers. Air vented from the cyclone dryers is passed through a water scrubber and PVC resin is screened by sieves and pneumatically conveyed to storage silos. Each silo vent is controlled with a bag or cartridge filter dust collector. Rail cars and trucks are used to deliver finished products to customers from the facility. \n\n\n\nThe PVC Unit also maintains necessary utilities equipment to aid in process operations, such as cooling towers and recovery devices.\n\n"
