The City developed and implemented the Process Safety Management/Risk Management Prevention Program that provides a systematic approach to employee involvement, safety awareness, emergency response, risk management, and program assessment.\n\nPLANT DESCRIPTION:\n\nThe Otay Water Treatment Plant, commissioned in the early 1900?s, treats water for the southern portion of the City of San Diego and for sale to other agencies. The Otay Water Treatment Plant has a maximum water treatment capacity of 40 million gallons per day (MGD), with a future capital improvement project goal of expanding capacity to 60 MGD.  The Otay Water Treatment Plant is located adjacent to the southern end of the Lower Otay Reservoir within the City of Chula Vista, and is surrounded by unincorporated portions of San Diego County.  The surrounding terrain is relatively hilly and is experiencing rapid residential and commercial development. The Arco Olympic Training Center and two correctional facilities are within 3 km of the plant. The Otay Water Treatment Plant currently uses chlorine to disinfect water from the Lower Otay, Morena, and Barrett Reservoirs system and the California Aqueduct, making it suitable for use in the City of San Diego's drinking water distribution system and for sale to other agencies.  The chlorine is received in one-ton pressurized liquid containers at the secured Chlorine Storage Room of the Chlorine Building. The Chlorine Storage room is equipped to store a maximum inventory of 22 containers for a total of approximately"

The most recent upgrades were implemented in 2005 (see Table 3-1 in Section 3).\n\nCOMMITMENT:       \n   \nThe Otay Water Treatment Plant has a well trained and committed operations and maintenance staff with a record of over 30 years of using chlorine safely.  To support the efforts of continued safe handling and use of chlorine at the Otay Water Treatment Plant, senior management has committed to the development of a comprehensive Process Safety Management Program under the guidelines of State and Federal mandates which has involved complete engineering reviews of the chlorine storage and feed system and design certification.\n\nPROGRAM COMPLIANCE:\n\nThe Risk Management Prevention and Process Safety Management Programs have been developed and implemented.  The Risk Management Prevention Program is in fulfillment of the requirements of 40 CFR PART 68 within Section 112(r)(7) of the Clean Air Act and the California Accidental Release Prevention Program regulations (Title 19, Chapter 4.5 of the California Code of Regulations).  The Process Safety Management Program is in fulfillment of the Occupational Health and Safety Administrations (OSHA) 1910.119, as well as Cal/OSHAs California Code of Regulations, Title 8, Section 5189, Process Safety Management of Acutely Hazardous Materials. \n\nAs with the use of any hazardous chemicals, the use of chlorine in this treatment process poses the potential for an accidental release that could have offsite consequences. It is for this reason that several years ago, under the provisions of the Risk Management Program Rule (40 CFR PART 68), an assessment of potential offsite consequences of accidental release scenarios of chlorine to the surrounding environment was conducted at the Otay Water Treatment Plant. Under the provisions of the rule, the treatment process at the Otay Water Treatment Plant is considered a"

Incorporated into the Risk Management Plan (RMP) was the analysis of potential offsite consequences of an accidental chlorine release. This analysis produces information related to the residential population and public and environmental receptors which may be affected in the event of a accidental chlorine release. \n\nSAFETY ELEMENTS:\n\nSafety elements can be defined as either administrative or engineering controls.  Administrative elements include; 1) procedural requirements, 2) training, 3) operator certification, and 4) the City?s policy and commitment of resources.  Engineering elements include physical modifications or facilities to 1) detect, 2) contain, 3) treat, 4) warn, or 5) eliminate a potential incident. The following engineering upgrades were made to enhance the management and mitigation of an accidental chlorine release (see Table 3-1 in Section 3 for dates of implementation/review):\n\n1) Chlorine leak detection sensors have been installed throughout the chlorine container storage room and feed system, which activate an alarm in the plant when low-levels of chlorine are detected. \n\n2) A computerized process control program allows the Duty Plant Operator to see immediately from the Operations Control Room what part of the chlorine feed system is alarming, (and at what chlorine concentration) without leaving the control room. \n\n3) An automatic chlorine shut-off system was installed to minimize a chlorine release by enabling the operator to stop the chlorine feed at the cylinder in the event of a release.  \n\n4) Engineering upgrades to the Chlorine Building have been implemented to allow for containment of a chlorine release, eliminating the free discharge of chlorine gas to the atmosphere.  \n\n5) A `scrubber system?, capable of neutralizing 2000 pounds of chlorine, was installed.

This system automatically contacts relevant responders (HIRT and/or plant staff) in the event that a chlorine concentration threshold is detected by the gas sensors in the Chlorine Room.\n\nThe following administrative safety controls have been implemented: \n\n1) Several safe-work-practices for the operations and maintenance sections have been developed in conjunction with other safety programs to insure employees work and respond to incidents safely.. The Otay Water Treatment Plant, in conjunction with the Water Department Emergency Management Coordinator, have developed and tested a Chlorine Emergency Response Plan.  The Chlorine Emergency Response Plan was developed to support the Water Plant staff in the event of a chlorine release in which additional resources are required to mitigate the situation. The San Diego Fire Department?s Hazardous Materials Incident Response Team (HIRT) is dedicated to respond to the plant in the event of an incident which exceeds the response capabilities of the plant staff. The Otay Water Treatment Plant maintains a Business Plan that identifies evacuation points on the site and provides additional emergency information about chlorine and additional contacts if needed. All personnel assigned to this site are trained and certified on the provisions of this Business Plan.\n\nACCIDENT HISTORY:\n\nWithin the last five years at the Otay WTP, no reportable injuries related to chlorine or accidental releases of chlorine occurred that required plant evacuation or resulted in off site consequences. The City maintains comprehensive Incident Investigation and Emergency Response Programs in the event of an incident. Ongoing Emergency Response training and operator and staff certification assure that plant personnel maintain familiarity with safety and emergency procedures and available emergen"

The City of San Diego Water Department Safety Committee and Emergency Management Coordinator are currently reviewing the audit documentation.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\n\nThe City of San Diego has trained and certified all plant staff to the level of first responder. Additional support will be provided by the San Diego Fire Department?s Hazardous Materials Incident Response Team (HIRT). In the event HIRT is required, plant staff can mobilize all necessary resources with a single radio or telephone call. In addition, an automated dialing system has been installed. This system automatically contacts relevant responders (HIRT and/or plant staff) in the event that a chlorine concentration threshold is detected by the gas sensors in the Chlorine Room.  All relevant design and operations of chlorine facilities at Otay WTP have received thorough review by the Fire Department prior to construction or implementation. Fire Department staff have worked closely with plant staff to develop a thorough familiarity with the operation of chlorine facilities in order to facilitate efficient emergency response.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES:\n\nAs mentioned in the Safety Elements Section 3, numerous engineering controls to mitigate and/or neutralize a chlorine release have been implemented at the Otay WTP. Currently, no major capital improvements projects related to chlorine safety or release mitigation/ neutralization are needed nor planned. The City of San Diego Water Department and the Otay Plant staff are committed to providing `state of the art? facilities that produce high quality drinking water while protecting the environme"
