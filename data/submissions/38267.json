      "SummaryText": "Fort George G. Meade is a Department of the Army facility whose mission is to provide base operations support for facilities and infrastructure, quality of life and protective services in support of Department of Defense activities and Federal agencies.  One facet of this support is the operation of a Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) and a Water Treatment Plant (WTP).  Both facilities use chlorine for disinfection and store quantities of chlorine which are over the Risk Management Plan (RMP) threshold.\n\n\nWWTP\nFour 1-ton cylinders (8,000 pounds) containing chlorine are in-line at the scale room, which is closed to the outdoor environment.  Each of the cylinders has a container valve and an isolated valve which is connected to a manifold header valve by flexible metal tubing.  Additionally, the system maintains line-traps which are used to remove impurities and reduce corrosion.  As a safety measure, chlorine sensors and audible alarms are maintained and tested once a month to ensure proper working order.  \n\nAll WWTP personnel have been certified by the Maryland State Board of Waterworks and Waste system Operators as Class 5A Operators or Class 5A Temporary Operators.  Additionally, all government staff receive annual 8-hour HAZWOPER refresher training.\n\nThe WWTP is in the process of installing security monitors around the perimeter of the plant.  It is expected that this system will be operational by the end of Fiscal Year 2004.  This measure will further ensure the safety of the plant and prevent intrusion.\n\n\nWTP\nThree 1-ton cylinders (6,000 pounds) containing chlorine are located in the scale room, which is closed to the outdoor environment.  Standard operating procedure is to have two cylinders on-line supplying chlorine to the chlorinators and one on stand-by.  Each of the cylinders has a container valve and an isolated valve which is connected to a manifold header valve by flexible metal tubing.  Additionally, the system maintains line-traps which are used to r"

Additionally, all government staff receive annual 8-hour HAZWOPER refresher training.\n\nThe WTP is currently only accepting well water for treatment.  This practice lowers turbidity in the water and is an operational change but has not lead to an overall decrease in chlorine storage or usage.  The WTP is however actively testing a calcium hyper-chloride pellet system for use in the disinfection process.  This change would eliminate the use of chlorine at the facility. \n\n\nEmergency Response\nThe Fort Meade Fire and Emergency Services (FES) Department maintains the emergency response plan for accidental releases of chlorine at both the WTP and the WWTP.  The FES response procedures for accidental releases of chlorine are contained in the Hazmat Response Procedures for Wastewater Treatment Plant and the Hazmat Response Procedures for Water Treatment Plant documents, dated January 1999.  Emergency response procedures for accidental releases of hazardous substances are outlined in the Installation Spill Contingency Plan (ISCP) developed in November 1998.  The FES maintains the Computer-Aided Management of Emergency Operations (CAMEO) software package available to responders and follows Army Regulation AR420-90 (which includes the National Fire Protection Association codes) for inspection, testing, and maintenance of its equipment.  The RES completes weekly inspections and calibrates monitors every thirty days, and protective suits are inspected and tested every 6 months.  \n\nWTP and WWTP personnel are trained in the use of escape masks.  If a release occurs, plant personnel utilize the escape masks and evacuate the facility immediat"

      "SummaryText": "ely.  The Fort Meade FES has the ability to shut off the flow of chlorine in the case of a leak.  Although the FES is the first responder they have a mutual aid agreement with the Anne Arundel County Fire Department to provide back-up support in the event of an emergency release.  There were no reportable chlorine accidents at the WWTP or WTP in the last five years.\n\nThe Environmental Quality control Committee (EQCC) at Fort Meade maintains and RMP Subcommittee whose roles and responsibilities are outlined in the EQCC Charter (Appendix D).  The chair of the RMP Subcommittee is the Air Program Manager."
