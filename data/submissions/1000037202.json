To manufacture these quality pulps to specific customer specifications, Rayonier uses four chemicals subject the Risk Management Plan (RMP). The Fernandina Mill is classified as NAICS Code 32211 and is consequently subject to the Program Level 3 requirements of RMP.  These same four substances are also subject to Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations and are listed below:  \r\n1. Ammonia (anhydrous)\r\n2. Chlorine\r\n3. Chlorine dioxide\r\n4. Sulfur dioxide (anhydrous)\r\nAmmonia and sulfur dioxide are used to make up cooking acid for pulps.  Chlorine and chlorine dioxide are used as bleaching chemicals in the process. \r\nThe current quantity of chlorine dioxide reported in this update for the chlorine dioxide covered process is significantly lower than the reported quantity in the previous RMP submissions. This change is the result of the exclusion of the chlorine dioxide inventory in the unit\u00bfs main storage tank.  The concentration of chlorine dioxide in the main storage tank is 0.8% or 8 ppm chlorine dioxide. This concentration is below the 1.0% minimum level specified in the RMP regulation. The 1009 pounds of chlorine dioxide reported in this update represents the calculated quantity of chlorine dioxide in the mill\u00bfs ClO2 generators. The generator system produces ClO2 at concentrations above 1% and the contents are subject to the RMP regulation.\r\n\r\n1.3    OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nReporting requirement removed. \r\n\r\n\r\n1.4   PREVENTION PROGRAM - PROGRAM 3\r\n\r\nRayonier Performance Fibers Fernandina Mill is subject to both EPA and OSHA process safety management regulations.
