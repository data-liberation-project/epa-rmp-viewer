If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the proper authorities as outlined in our emergency response plan.\n\nSibley Generating Station uses propane for back up fuel for power generation.  The propane system contains three 18,000 gallons propane tanks and associated piping, valves, and other miscellaneous equipment.\n\nSibley Generating Station uses aqueous ammonia - 30% for water treatment.  The ammonia system contains one 7,000 gallon tank and associated piping, valves, and other miscellaneous equipment.\n\nThe worst-case scenario.  Our worst-case scenario for propane is the failure of one 18,000-gallon storage tank resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.   The toxic endpoint distance was determined using Multi-Energy method and the distance to the endpoint is 0.24 miles.  Since this facility is located in a relatively remote, unoccupied area, the worst-case scenario would not affect anyone beyond our property.\n\nOur worst-case scenario for ammonia is the failure of one 7,000-gallon storage tank resulting in a vapor cloud release.   The toxic endpoint distance was determined using  ISCST3 and the distance to the endpoint is 0.25 miles.  Since this facility is located in a relatively remote, unoccupied area, the worst-case scenario would not affect anyone beyond our property.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps.  This facility complies with EPA\u0012s accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.  \n\nFive-year accident history.  We have never had an accident involving propane that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or shelterings in place.\n\nThe emergency response program.  In the event of an emergency involving our propane or ammonia system, it is our policy"
