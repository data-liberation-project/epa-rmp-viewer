Executive Summary\n\nThis program is intended to meet the spirit and intent of the following regulations:\n- California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program - Title 19 CCR, Chapter 4.5\n- Federal EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) - Title 40 CFR \u00a768\n- California Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 8 CCR \u00a75189\n- Federal Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 29 CFR \u00a71910.119\n\nHereafter this program will be referred to as the RMP-PSM program.\n\nThis program is intended to be a \"living document\". As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible and updated as necessary. To accomplish this, City of Hanford Wastewater Treatment Plant has elected to use PSMWriter, software developed and distributed by Resource Compliance, Inc. This software will assist us with updating, maintaining, scheduling, and tracking RMP-PSM related activities. \n\n1.1 City of Hanford Wastewater Treatment Plant, Risk and Process Safety Management Program\n\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that City of Hanford Wastewater Treatment Plant has updated their unified RMP-PSM Program. This program has been prepared to address the risks involved in operating and maintaining the following process which has the presence of hazardous chemicals above threshold quantities: \n\nProcess Name               | Process Chemical                | Process Quantity(lbs.)\nChlorine System              Chlorine                                    24,000\n\nOur RMP-PSM program promotes overall plant, worker, and public safety. The program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of hazardous chemicals. Overall, the program is designed to prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, illnesses, and physical property damage.\n\nOur company has many policies and procedures in place to promote overall plant, worker and public safety.

The facility has a chlorine system that is used as needed to disinfect wastewater in several different areas of the wastewater treatment plant:\n \nSecondary Sedimentation Basins\nChlorine Basins\nThe re-circulation structure\nOxidation Ditch\n \nChlorine System Equipment\nThe process operates as follows: six ton containers are connected to the wastewater treatment process through process tubing and piping. Chlorine gas is withdrawn from the ton containers by vacuum. This vacuum opens the vacuum regulator diaphragm and withdraws the chlorine gas from the ton containers at a controlled feed rate set by the operators with the use of the chlorine feed regulator and rotameter mounted to the wall. The gas is injected into the feed water line where it becomes a chlorine/water solution and is distributed to the location where it is needed in the treatment process. The analyzers monitor chlorine concentrations in the water and relay the information to the chlorine feed regulator in order to determine whether more or less chlorine should be injected.\n \nProcess Chemistry\n\nAt the City of Hanford Wastewater Treatment Plant chlorine gas (Cl2) is used for disinfection of water distributed to residential and irrigation customers. The chlorine, when added to water, yields both hydrochloric (HCl) and hypochlorous (HOCl) acid (see chemical equation below) in aqueous solution. This combination is effective for killing bacteri"

Note that the equation below is easily reversible which results in \"off-gassing\" of chlorine gas from water that contains high concentrations of the acids.\n\nThe chlorination process begins with the chlorine gas being drawn from the ton containers through a pressure reducing valve, reduced to vacuum at a vacuum regulator valve mounted inside a chlorinator, metered through a manually-adjusted rate valve, and finally injected into water. \n\nSafety Systems\nThe City of Hanford Wastewater Treatment Plant is equipped with multiple self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBAs) for changing the tanks. \nAll ton containers are chocked and stored securely in the chlorine storage area or the chlorine building pursuant to Sections 2.6, 2.7, and 2.8 of the Chlorine Institute's Chlorine Manual. The chlorine building is not exposed to vehicular traffic and is locked after normal working hours. \nChlorine is fed through a vacuum regulator that ensures that the tubing containing chlorine operates in a vacuum. In the event that the vacuum is lost, the regulator will shut off chlorine feed.\nEach chlorine ton container at the City of Hanford Wastewater Treatment Plant is protected from overpressure with three (3) fusible plugs on each side of the container (6 total). The fusible plugs consist of a brass plug with a fusible metal insert that is designed to melt between 157\u00baF-170\u00baF.\nVarious analog gauges are installed throughout the chlorine process for continuous monitoring of container weight and pressure. The ton containers in the chlorine building are also placed on a load-cell scale for additional container weight monitoring.\nEmergency eyewash and safety showers are located in various areas throughout the facility including in the chlorine building and can be used to decontaminate if chemical exposure occurs. \nThe chlorine building is equipped with an emergency ventilation fan that is interlocked with the chlorine detection system and automa"

The ton containers in the storage area are not interconnected to the ton containers being utilized in the chlorine building, but are co-located in such a way that it is foreseeable that multiple containers could be involved in a simultaneous release. Therefore, all ton containers at the City of Hanford Wastewater Treatment Plant are considered a single process.\n\n1.3 General Accident Release & Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\n1.3.1 General \n\nWe inform our employees engaged in process operations of the dangers of an accidental release of chlorine in annual safety meetings. During these meetings we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\n\nCity of Hanford Wastewater Treatment Plant has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the chlorine process. These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release. The results of the analyses are reported in PSMWriter and hard copy binders. \n\n1.3.2 Chlorine\n\nThe chlorination process at the City of Hanford Wastewater Treatment Plant facility is an integral part of the overall business. The chlorination process utilizes six 2,000 lbs. containers, with another three containers stored outside in the chlorine storage area. Process management is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential danger of a chlorine leak. \n\nCity of Hanford Wastewater Treatment Plant personnel monitor the chlorination process. In addition, the process is checked frequently by our outside water treatment contractor. This contractor also assists in performing the annual mechanical integrity review of our chlorine equipment. \n1.4 Five Year Accident History\n\nCity of Hanford Wastewater Treatment Plant has had no accidental release with"
