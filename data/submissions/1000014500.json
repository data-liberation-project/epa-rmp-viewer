The facility operates on a continuous basis, with the majority of the personnel on-site during the day shift (0730 - 1600 hours) and a smaller on-site population on the off-shifts. The processes that are utilized on-site are batch type chemical reactors to produce a wide variety of pharmaceuticals. These operations are closely monitored/audited by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The site operations in general are not regulated under the requirements of the Risk Management Program however, two chemicals involved in the production of selected pharmaceuticals are maintained at the facility at or above the regulated thresholds. \n\nOne chemical is Ammonium Hydroxide (ammonia concentration of 29%). A review of the production operations and regulated chemicals led to the development of a worst case scenario for potential releases that could affect the environment and/or off-site personnel. The worse case scenario release of Ammonium Hydroxide (ammonia concentration of 29%) would result from the rupture of the Ammonium Hydroxide storage tank. The liquid would be contained on site, but could produce a vapor cloud. \n\nThe other chemical is Hydrochloric Acid (stored in a liquid form @ 37% concentration). The worst case scenario release of hydrochloric acid would result in a rupture of the storage tank causing the liquid to spill into the diked area around the storage tank. An alternative Hydrochloric Acid release scenario was defined where a leak would result in a 40 gallons per minute release for 10 minutes.  Modeling suggests that the scenarios defined above could potentially result in a cloud within 0.5 and 0.3 miles with theretically no impact to residential communities and most within the site property boundary.  All scenarios are considered unlikely; however, the plant has developed a working Emerg"
