(Sekisui).\n\n\n\nThe Sekisui Mt. Pleasant, Tennessee facility has been in operation since January 2007.\n\n\n\nSekisui is strongly committed to protecting facility personnel, the public, and the environment from workplace and accidental release hazards. This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. Unforeseeably, if such releases do occur, our emergency response policy requires immediate notification to the proper authorities and evacuation of the affected area. Safety, environmental protection, and risk management programs are fully implemented and coordinated with the Maury County Emergency Management Agency, LEPC, (Local Emergency Planning Committee), and other emergency responders for emergency planning and response efforts.\n\n\n\nB. Description of stationary source and regulated substances handled\n\n\n\nThe Sekisui facility manufactures plastic resins for automotive and commercial/industrial packaging applications. The plant operation includes two reactors that employ isobutane and isopentane as manufacturing aids.\n\n\n\nPiocelan is a plastic pellet made of polystyrene/polyolefin resin that can be produced in different densities. This process involves mixing resin with other additives and isobutane, or isopentane.  This mixing of products is conducted in one of the two plant reactors. The storage quantities of isobutane and isopentane each exceed the RMP threshold level of 10,000 lbs.  Isobutane is a flammable gas stored in a pressurized 12,000 gallon tank on site at 50 psi.  The isobutane storage and piping system includes a low pressure pump station, unloading station, and gas de"

The isopentane storage and piping system includes a low pressure pump station, unloading station, and gas detection devices.\n\n\n\nIn accordance with the requirements of the RMP regulations, the off-site consequence analyses for the isobutene and isopentane storage tanks were conducted. The USEPA RMP Comp program was used to analyze the worst-case and alternative release scenarios. \n\n\n\nThe worst-case release scenarios for isobutane and isopentane were based on the release quantity of each chemical equal to the full capacity of its storage tank resulting in a vapor cloud explosion. The estimated end point distance associated with the vapor cloud explosion resulting from the alternative case scenario was 0.3 miles from the storage tank location for isobutane and 0.09 miles for isopentane. \n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenarios for isobutane and isopentane were based on the piping leak duration of 10 minutes with a total release quantity of 1150 lbs for each chemical. The estimated end point distance associated with the vapor cloud explosion resulting from the alternative case scenario was 0.09 miles from the storage tank location for isobutane and 0.03 miles for isopentane. The release scenario details are found in the RMP Report.\n\n\n\nC. General accidental release prevention program and specific prevention steps\n\n\n\nIsobutane and isopentane are regulated substances under both the EPA RMP and OSHA process safety management (PSM) rules. Therefore, Sekisui has developed a comprehensive program to meet the requirements under the RMP and PSM standards. Key components of the accident prevention and safety program include: safety information documentation, periodic hazards review with the facility staff, implementation of proper operating procedures, regular operator training, comprehensive equipment maintenance program, established change management procedures, frequent RMP "

This analysis is performed to identify, evaluate, and control the hazards involved in the process. \n\n\n\nFor safely managing the plant production activities, Sekisui maintains written operating procedures. These procedures address all modes of operation including initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and startup after a turnaround. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\n\n\nThe employee training covers the following aspects of health and safety program: safety philosophy, general safety rules, reporting of safety hazards, emergency procedures, and hazards communications. In addition to the training received upon employment, further training is given if an employee is exposed to a previously unrecognized hazard, or if an employee is reassigned to a job that involves exposure to new hazards. Our safety manual contains documentation of safe work practices, health and safety hazards, descriptions of the use and care of personal protective equipment, and emergency procedures in case of spills or releases. The safety manual also covers the emergency and first-aid procedures. Records for all employees are maintained documenting that each employee has received and understood the required training.\n\n\n\nSekisui carries out and documents maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations. Process equipment examined include, among others, isobutane and isopentane storage vessel, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, and controls and pumps.

Process operators, maintenance personnel, or any other employees affected by the modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of changes and provided the necessary training.\n\n\n\nRMP compliance at the facility is monitored through an RMP audit performed at least once every three years in accordance with 40 CFR 68.79. A report of the findings is generated following the audit, and any deficiencies and/or recommendations are promptly addressed and documented.\n\n\n\nProcedures on incident investigation, reporting, and documentation have been developed in accordance with 40 CFR 68.81. Investigation details of any incidences will be documented using RMP requirements.\n\n\n\nSekisui believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort. Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements. In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP program, including information resulting from process hazard analyses.\n\n\n\nD.
