Our local fire department is fully trained to handle all emergencies pertaining to our anhydrous\nplant, including all necessary inhilation gear and safety suits.  They understand all shut off systems, and the\ndangers involved with this gas.  All employees of Farmers Elevator of Fortuna have been thoroughly trained in\nhandling anhydrous ammonia in our bulk systems.  We are constantly checking valves, gauges, hoses , bear-\nings and pins tp make sure they meet the highest safety standards.  We keep the area free of all flammable\ndebris, and make sure hoses are not in a position to be ran over or caught on vehicles passing through the\nload out areas.  All safety signs and water baths are in place as well as safety goggles and gloves.  Every-\nthing is readily available in case of emergency.  We are continually training our employees on all safety as-\npects.  We have an independent consulting firm that constantly monitors our plant to make sure we are in\ncompliance with all OSHA safety standards."
