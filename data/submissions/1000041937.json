Safety is ensured through careful prevention measures and emergency planning. The intent of our prevention program is the minimization of all risks that could possibly lead to an accidental release. The program focuses primarily on the mechanical integrity of the process equipment and the training of the operators. The emergency response plan focuses on minimizing the potential impacts of an accidental release. This is done by coordinating actions with the Suwanee Fire Department.\n\n2.The stationary source and required substances handled\n\nSchwan\u00c2\u00bfs Frozen Distributors is a handling facility for frozen goods.\nThe regulated substance handled at this facility is ammonia. Ammonia is used as a refrigerant in the plant cooler and freezer system.\n\n3.The worst case release scenario and the alternative release scenario, include administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario.\n\nWorst Case Scenario: Failure of the high pressure receiver for the main engine room when filled to the greatest amount allowed would release 10,500 pounds of ammonia. Company policy limits the maximum filling capacity of this vessel to 50%. It is assumed that the entire contents are released as a vapor over a ten minute time span and are subjected to a wind speed of 1.5 m/s with a stability class of F. The distance to the toxic endpoint for the worst case scenario is 0.4 miles.\n\nAlternative Scenario: The lifting of a pressure release valve on the ammonia storage vessel for the new engine room. Relief valves allow the escape of ammonia at a flow rate of 180.8 lbs/min. Weather conditions are assumed to be average values of 3 m/s wind speed and stability class D. The valves are assumed to be open 75% of the time during the release as the press"

The distance to this endpoint is 0.1 miles and extends beyond the facility boundary. \n\n4.The general accidental release prevention program and the specific prevention steps.\n\nSchwan\u00c2\u00bfs Frozen Distributors believes that the best way to prevent an accidental release is by being proactive in its approach to safety. This facility maintains information about the proper use of its equipment and the possible hazards. By following set operating procedures and maintenance routines, the process equipment within the facility will continue to operate in optimum condition. Additionally, the release prevention program is constantly being improved by sustained employee training and regular compliance audits. Compliance with all applicable state codes and regulations ensures the continued safety of Schwan\u00c2\u00bfs employees.\n\n5. Five year accident history\n\nSchwan\u00c2\u00bfs Frozen Distributors has not experienced any accidents within the last five years that either led to a significant release of ammonia or had the potential to lead to such a release.\n\n6.The emergency response program\n\nA well planned emergency response program can make a tremendous difference in the potential off-site impacts of an accidental release. Swift, efficient actions can minimize the damage to both human population and the natural surroundings. To this end, Schwan\u00c2\u00bfs Frozen Distributors has coordinated emergency response efforts with the Suwanee Fire Department and has instructed employees on the proper actions to take in the event of an accidental release.\n\n7.Planned changes to improve safety at this time\n\nThere are no planned changes to improve safety at this time."
