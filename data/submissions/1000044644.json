      "SummaryText": "DTE Stockton, LLC is a 49.9 megawatt (MW) (net), biomass-fired, electrical power generating facility. The plant burns agricultural and urban wood biomass in a stoker-type boiler to generate high pressure steam which drives a turbine generator. The project is located on the South side of W. Washington St., just West of Port Road 23 within the Port of Stockton in central San Joaquin County.  Immediate surroundings also include the confluence of the San Joaquin River and the Stockton Deep Water Ship Channel.\r\n\r\nAnhydrous ammonia is used at the plant to control emissions of NOx in the boiler flue gas. This air pollution control process consists of a 14,994 gallon storage tank, a pumping and vaporization skid, associated conveyance piping, and a blower and injection manifold. The structural integrity of all elements of the ammonia system are ensured by proper design and construction plans which were certified by licensed Professional Engineers. The structural integrity continues to be verified via regular inspections. The materials are in compliance with industry codes and standards. The facility also follows a mechanical integrity program which requires regular maintenance on each element of the system.\r\n\r\nLiquid ammonia arrives at the facility by truck by Certified Ammonia Transporters. DTE Stockton personnel observe the unloading process which is governed by the facility's Ammonia Tank Loading Operating Procedure. The ammonia injection process is regulated automatically based on instantaneous NOx emissions. The Facility's operators also have the ability to control the system in manual. In the event of a leak, ammonia sensorsstrategically located in the vicinity of the ammonia system would alarm the CRO immediately. During a minor leak, the Control Room Operator would isolate the system and have maintenance correct the issue. A major leak is prevented via operator training and sound operating procedures, automated shut-off valves, pressure relief valves, and regular ma"

All site personnel and contractors are trained in the key elements of the Emergency Action Plan and safe evacuation procedures.\r\n\r\nThere have been no accidents or releases within the last 5 years.\r\n\r\nCommitments made under the State of California's RMP and their related activities are being implemented at this time. Current applicable codes and regulations are being reviewed to determine if other commitments need to be made to achieve increased operational safety for the ammonia system."
