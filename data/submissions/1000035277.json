      "SummaryText": "KMX Chemical Corporation is a technologically innovative corporation that is introducing new methods and equipment to handle the separation of economically important process streams in a more energy efficient and environmentally friendly manner.           It is the intent of the KMX Chemical Corporation to operate in such a manner as to provide a safe working place for its employees and contractors as well as minimizing threats to the neighboring community and any emergency responders.                                                                                                                                                                   KMX works at reducing the potential spread of an incident. KMX recognizes that damage to the environment must be held to a minimum. It is accepted that cleanup procedures may take longer than the initial incident. In order to achieve the minimum damage to the environment (air, water, or ground), it is acknowledged that a higher level damage to property may have to be accepted.                                                                                                                                                                            KMX Chemical Corporation is involved in the recycling of low weight alcohols, antifreeze, ether, hydrocarbons, and other chemicals from a diverse group of industries. The recycled products go into such uses as antifreeze, windshield washer fluid, automotive starter fluids, inks, paint strippers,etc..                                                                                                                  The extremely hazardous substance that is handled at the New Church plant is Diethyl Ether. The reason for listing this chemical is because it is extremely flammable and it is stored in quantities above 10,000 pounds. The process stream is received in railcars as a mixture of diethyl ether, ethanol, and water. This material is separated into the pure components by fractional dis"

      "SummaryText": "tillation. The purified diethyl ether (used mainly in automotive starting fluids) is loaded either into railcars or over-the-road tankers for shipment. Normally, up to two (2) railcars containing up to 175,000 pounds diethyl ether are stored on site.         The worst case release scenario would involve the total failure of a diethyl ether railcar (Very unlikely - the railcars have a design presure of 100 psig and a safety reieif pressure setting of 75 psig. The normal operating pressure of a railcar is 1 - 4 psig.). The EPA model indicates that a vapor cloud explosion could travel 0.4 mile frfom our railcar loading station. This could impact about 6 homes in a residential area as well as a commercial building. However, our warehouse and the former packaging facility on our site would shield these properties from any explosion. All transfers to and from the railcar are monitored.                               The alternate case release scenario involves the failure of a loading hose from the railcar, a more probable occurrence. The EPA model indicates a release from a hose could cause a vapor cloud explosion that could travel 0.1 mile and would be totally contained on site.                                                                                                                                                           KMX Chemical Corporation complies with all federal (EPA and OSHA), state (Virginia DEQ air and water) and Accomac County zoning regulations. In addition to the EPA risk management plan, KMX New Church complies to the OSHA process safety management plan.                                                                                                                                                          KMX Chemical Corporation has not had any reportable chemical releases since the New Church VA plant was purchased in 2004.  KMX has made a number of equipment and process improvements in the interim period and will continue programs to improve pe"
