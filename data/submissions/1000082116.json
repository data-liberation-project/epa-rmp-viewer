Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\nP2930 Process - Program Level 3\r\nFacility ID #1000001066253\r\n\r\nTHIS IS A NEW PROCESS\r\n\r\nWe at Cytec Solvay Group are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety. This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances; and ensure the safety of employees and neighbors.\r\n\r\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nThe Willow Island Plant's Polymer Additives Unit manufactures polymer additive products, including ultraviolet light absorbers, antioxidants, anti-static agents, and depressant reactants.  P2930 is an intermediate product currently being manufactured at another location which is used at other Solvay sites to produce materials sold to the aerospace industry.  The Willow Island Plant proposes to manufacture P2930 in its Polymer Additives Unit in Building 82.  The process is located in Building 82 bays 28 through 32, floors 1 through 3 and the north yard adjacent to those areas.\r\n\r\nThe P2930 process uses chloroform which will result in the creation of a Program 3 Stationary Source at the facility. \r\n\r\n3. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nThe facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements of \r\n40 CFR part 68 of the EPA. The process was designed and constructed in accordance with ASME, NFPA and other nationally recognized safe design standards. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our facility.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Informati"

This includes access to SDSs for all materials handled. \r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\r\n\r\nPHAs are conducted in accordance with regulatory, company and business unit requirements, including compilation of Process Safety Information and participation including hourly personnel.  Action items from the PHAs are entered into an electronic follow up system to be tracked to completion.  The most recent PHA for the P2930 process was completed in August 2019 and used the What If/Checklist methodology.  PHAs are revalidated at least every five years.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\n\r\nThe facility maintains written operating procedures that address various modes of operations, such as start up, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and startup following a shutdown.  These procedures are available to all operators for operating and training purposes and are periodically reviewed and certified annually as current and accurate. \r\n\r\nTraining\r\n\r\nThe facility has a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating the P2930 process.  This training program includes new hire orientation, classroom and on-the-job training.  Topics include an overview of the process and its hazards and the operating procedures.  Operators demonstrate their competency by examinations or field demonstrations and are given periodic refresher training.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity / Preventive Maintenance Program\r\n\r\nWritten mechanical integrity procedures follow consensus standards and corporate requirements, and recognized and generally accepted good engineering practices.  These include periodic inspections of equipment and piping systems as well as preventive maintenance routines on instrumentation and other systems.  These routine"

Training for individuals involved in maintenance activities includes an overview of the process and its hazards.\r\n\r\nManagement of Change (MOC)\r\n\r\nThe facility has a written MOC procedure to manage changes to chemicals, process technology, equipment, and procedures.  These changes are reviewed for potential impact on safety, health and the environment prior to being approved for implementation.  All approved changes are communicated to affected employees.  MOCs are tracked and documented using an electronic change management program.  \r\n\r\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSR)\r\n\r\nPSSRs are conducted on new processes and on modifications to existing processes.  These PSSRs confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into service.  Action items identified in the PSSR are tracked to completion using an electronic follow up system.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits\r\n\r\nThe Willow Island Plant currently has processes covered by OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation (1910.119) which are subjected to a compliance audit every three years.  These audits are certified by site management and action items are tracked to completion in an electronic follow up system.  The P2930 process will be included in subsequent audits and incorporated into this audit schedule.  The next compliance audit is scheduled for July 2020.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation\r\n\r\nThe facility has written incident investigation procedures and will promptly investigate any incident that results in, or could reasonably have resulted in the accidental release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are conducted to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the situation from reoccurring. All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\n\r\nEmployees are encouraged to participate in all aspects"
