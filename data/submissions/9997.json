The Aurora Cooperative emergency response plan involves the response services available in the community.  Aurora Cooperative bulk Anhydrous Ammonia facilities have been strategically located to provide a local retail facility for this form of affordable nitrogen fertilizer for agriculture.  This facility located in Ong is made up of one (1) 30,000 gallon, one (1) 26,000 gallon, and one (1) 18,000 gallon pressurized storage vessel and two loadout risers.  It serves the southern Clay County area.  This facility is normally unmanned except during fertilizer season, although the grain elevator and office located on the same property are normally manned during business hours.  The offsite consequence analysis includes the consideration of two anhydrous ammonia release scenarios, identified as \"worst case release\" and \"alternative scenario\".  The first scenario is defined by EPA, which states that the \"owner or operator shall assume...maximum quantity of the largest vessel...is released as a gas over a 10 minute period\", due to and unspecified failure.  The alternative release scenario is difined as \"more likely to occur than the worst case scenario\".  Atmospheric dispersion modeling has to be performed to determine the distance traveled by the anhydrous ammonia released before it's concentration decreases to a \"non-toxic\" level.  For this purpose, Aurora Cooperative has chosed to use RMP-Comp Version 1.05 to determine the distance to the toxic endpoint (.14 mg/l or 200 ppm) and to determine the population affected by a potential release using maps extracted from Landview 3 software.  The worst case release scenario for Aurora Cooperative - Ong facility involves the failure of the 30,000 gallon pressurized storage vessel while it contains 85% (maximum allowed capacity) of it's capacity.

      "SummaryText": "ative release scenario is based on the failure of a three inch transfer hose, assuming the complete failure of the in-line check valve and that the excess flow valve in the storage vessel takes two minutes to close and stop the flow.  This location also has a bulk propane storage facility located on property contiguous and adacent to the above mentioned property, seperated only by a street.  Aurora Cooperative Bulk Propane plants are strategically located to provide a source of home heating fuel, and fuel for grain dryers and irrigation for agriculture.  This facility, located in Ong, Nebraska serves southern Clay County.  This plant is made up of one 18,000 gallon pressurized storage vessel and related pump and plumbing.  The worst case scenario for a release of this product is based on a failure of this 18,000 gallon tank while it is filled to it's maximum allowable capacity of 85%.  The alternative release scenario is based on a failure of a three inch transfer hose with the assumption that the in-line check valve fails completely and the excess flow valve takes two minutes to close.  RMP-Comp Version 1.05 was used to determine the distance to the overpressure endpoint (1 psi) for both of the above scenarios."
