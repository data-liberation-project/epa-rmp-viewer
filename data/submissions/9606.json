This scenario assumes that 450,000 pounds of anhydrous hydrogen chloride would be released and evaporates within a 10-minute period.  Under the EPA default worst weather conditions, the hydrogen chloride gas cloud would travel a distance greater than 25 miles before the concentration diminished below the toxic endpoint concentration of 0.030 mg/L.

Environmental receptors within this distance include a state park and wildlife sanctuary.\n\nAn alternate release scenario for hydrogen chloride that was selected involves a =-inch hole in the discharge piping of the HCL Column Reflux Pumps.  It is estimated that approximately 7,300 lbs. of hydrogen chloride would be released over a 10-minute period.

Oxy Vinyls, LP, referred to as \"OxyVinyls\", is a joint venture between Occidental Chemical Corporation (a subsidiary of Occidental Petroleum Corporation) and The Geon Company. This facility is located in Deer Park, Texas on Tidal Road and is entirely within Shell's chemical complex.  The Deer Park VCM Plant, part of the Houston Operations, produces vinyl chloride for use in the manufacture of polyvinyl chloride.  This facility was constructed in 1980 and was purchased from Shell in 1986.  The facility employs approximately 70 full-time employees.\n\n1.  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at the Stationary Source  (' 68.155(a))\n\nOxyVinyls is committed to operating the Deer Park VCM Plant in a manner that is safe for its workers, the public and the environment.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal, State and local rules and regulations, industry standards and best practices.  As part of this commitment, OxyVinyls has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility that includes the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  One component of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that provides the basis for managing risks at the Deer Park VCM Plant.  The RMP complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirement Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule), OSHA 1910.119.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMP plan requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at the Deer Park VCM Plant.\n\nThe Risk Management Program at the Deer Park VCM Plant consists of the following three elements:\n \n7 A hazard assessment to (a) help the facility and community understand the potential off-site consequences of hypothetical accidental releas"

In fact, the VCM Plant has a comprehensive safety and environmental program in place, establishing many levels of safeguards against release of a hazardous substance as well as injuries and damage from such a release.\n\nOxyVinyls' policy on the use of hazardous substances: Before using a hazardous substance at the Deer Park VCM Plant, less hazardous alternatives are always considered.  When a hazardous substance is used at the Deer Park VCM Plant, the plant personnel review the potential for an accidental release of this substance that could adversely affect plant workers, the public and the environment, and takes steps to prevent any such effects.  This is accomplished through the facility's Management of Change (MOC) and Process Hazard Review (PHR) procedures that are followed for all new installations or modifications of existing processes.\n\nOxyVinyls strives to prevent accidental releases of the hazardous substances used at the facility by implementing reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances.

OxyVinyls also uses the Corporate Fire, Safety and Environmental (FS&E) Guidelines when designing new or modifying existing processes.  Each project is thoroughly reviewed before approval. In addition, the facility requires the documentation of standard operating procedures and training of affected employees with regard to these procedures as part of the MOC procedure.    The facility mechanical integrity program provides an ongoing process to verify the mechanical integrity of the equipment, piping and instruments to prevent the release of hazardous substances.\n\nOxyVinyls' goal is to minimize impacts from accidental release should they occur.  In the event of an accidental release, the Deer Park VCM Plant controls and contains the release in a manner that will be safe for workers and will minimize the impact to the public and the environment.  The facility maintains an active Emergency Response Team that is on call at all times to respond to accidental releases of any hazardous chemical handled by OxyVinyls facilities.  OxyVinyls also has established a Special Situations Center in the Dallas corporate office and at the facility to assistant workers, their families, and the public during and after all emergencies. In addition, OxyVinyls has a leadership role in Channel Industries Mutual Aid (CIMA).  This is a state chartered non-profit mutual-aid cooperative combining the fire fighting, rescue, hazardous material handling and emergency medical capabilities to its members in the Houston Ship Channel area. Along with the CIMA organization, the plant takes an active role in the local emergency planning committee for Deer Park.  The facility promotes the use of the CAER Phone Hotline number to inform citizens of any unusual plant event and actively works with the Deer Park Citizen's Advisory Council.\n\nAn OxyVinyls Emergency Response Plan"

This plan outlines the responsibilities and actions required for control an emergency within the boundaries of the facility.  If the emergency extends beyond or could potentially extend beyond the plant boundaries, the Deer Park Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) is notified and a statement of the type of emergency and any community protection factors are recommended.\n\nThe facility has implemented a Voluntary Protection Program (VPP) in which employee participation at all levels is required in designing, implementing and maintaining safety programs.  Safety is a primary concern in our facility and is demonstrated by our selection by OSHA in Sept.1997 as an OSHA Star facility under OSHA's Voluntary Protection Program (VPP).\n\nTo effectively implement these policies, OxyVinyls has established a management system headed by the Health, Environmental and Safety (HES) Departments to oversee safety and environmental-related activities. \n\n2.

Vinyl chloride from these intermediate storage tanks is pumped to larger storage tanks at another facility approximately =-mile away.  Vinyl chloride is produced and handled in several process areas at this site.  Since these areas are inter-connected by piping, they are considered one Vinyl Chloride process.  Based on the RMP criteria for process program levels, this is considered a Program 3 process.\n\n3.   The Worst-Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternate Release Scenario(s), Including Administrative Controls and Mitigation Measures to Limit the Distances for Each Reported Scenario (' 68.155(c))\n\nThe facility performed off-site consequence analyses of accidental releases of regulated substances to estimate potential affects to the public or the environment.  The RMP rule requires the off-site consequence analysis to evaluate a \"worst-case release scenario\" and an \"alternative release scenario\".  OxyVinyls does not expect a worst-case release scenario to ever occur given the multiple levels of protection in place to prevent such a scenario.  The alternative release scenarios that have been developed are based on more likely potential accidental releases.  These have been shared with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) to assist them in improving the community emergency response plan.  \n\nDistances to toxic and flammable endpoints were calculated based on the EPA RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.  The meteorological data used for the modeling was the EPA default for the worst case scenario and EPA suggested values for the alternative release scenario. The Landview.

It is estimated that approximately 3,000 lbs. of chlorine liquid would be released over a 5-minute period.  Active mitigation accounted for in the analysis includes operator intervention to shut-off an emergency isolation valve.  No credit is taken for passive mitigation.  Under the EPA alternate release weather conditions, the chlorine gas cloud would travel a distance of 0.40 miles before the concentration of chlorine diminished below the toxic endpoint concentration of 0.0087 mg/L (3 ppm).  U.S. Census data indicates that no residences would be affected by this release.  There are no environmental receptors within this distance from the release point.  A potential public receptor would be the surrounding industrial facilities.\n\n3.2  Toxic Substances - Chloroform\nThe \"worst-case scenario\" for chloroform would not be as great as for hydrogen chloride; therefore, a description of this scenario is not included in the plan.  An alternate release scenario for chloroform that was selected involves a 1-inch hole in the discharge piping of the EDC Light Ends Column Reflux Pumps.  It is estimated that approximately 15,000 lbs. of chloroform would be released as a 39.5% mixture.  This liquid would form a pool and evaporate over a 15-minute period.
