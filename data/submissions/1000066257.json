      "SummaryText": "Cascade View, LLC operates a controlled atmosphere fruit storage facility in a rural area located a few miles northeast of Selah, WA by State Route 821.  The facility typically is loaded during the autumn over a several month period, and then the fruit is held in storage for several months.  The last room may be held till close to the next fruit loading season.  During the loading and unloading times there are forklift and truck drivers at the facility.  A refrigeration technician checks the operation of the system several times during the week, often times several times per day, while continuous monitoring and alarming is done by the facility computer control system.  Much of the time the facility is unattended, and due to the rural location there are very few people in the area.\n\n\n\nAmmonia is used as the refrigerant in the system.  Ammonia is a colorless gas with a pungent odor that is irritating to the eyes, nose and throat.  It is present as both a liquid under pressure and as a vapor in the system.\n\n\n\nTo maintain a safe facility operation Cascade View has developed an emergency action plan that provides instructions to all employees of what actions to take if an ammonia release is detected.  All refrigerated areas in the facility are monitored by an ammonia detection system, which will automatically shutdown and pump out any alarming area.  Any alarm would also be sent to the refrigeration technician by a dial-up modem.  Also, the computer system will notify the refrigeration technician on any alarming or out of normal condition in the system (temperature/pressures).  All employees at the facility receive annual training on the emergency action plan.\n\n\n\nThe facility is complying with both State and Federal regulations regarding ammonia  used as a refrigerant, and has in place both the OSHAs Process Safety Management standard (PSM) (29 CFR 1910.119) , and EPA?s Risk Management Program (RMP) (40 CFR, Part 68).  These programs are readily available to on-site pers"

      "SummaryText": "onal to help in maintaining a safe operating facility.  As required by the RMP an Off-site Consequence Analysis has been done for the facility to determine what impact the Worse Case, and the more realistic Alternate Case releases of ammonia would have to the surrounding area.\n\n\n\nThere have been no reportable releases of ammonia from the system during the last five years (or the life span of the facility).\n\n\n\nTo deal with any possible release of ammonia Cascade View maintains an ongoing relationship with an experienced refrigeration contractor in Yakima, WA and with the Selah Fire, and Yakima County fire departments.  In the event of a significant accident, the fire department emergency response is about 5 minutes away, ownership and refrigeration contractor is about 15 minutes away."
