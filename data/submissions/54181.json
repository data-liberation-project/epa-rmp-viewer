ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY POLICIES\n\nAES Cayuga LLC recognizes management's responsibility in protecting it's employees, equipment, property, and the environment against the hazards of an unintentional ammonia release. The safety and health of all employees and the public is very important.  The control of accidents has been and will continue to be a basic responsibility of all personnel in the facility.The AES Cayuga LLC PSM/RMP program assigns and documents the specific responsibilities for developing, implementing and integrating the OSHA PSM and the EPA RMP standards into its safety program.  The AES Cayuga LLC PSM/RMP program focuses attention on \"Making PSM/RMP the way we manage\" our ammonia based process rather than a project we expect to complete and put on the shelf when the filing date has passed.\nAES Cayuga LLC believes that Employee Participation is the key to a successful program.  Operating level employees, particularly the Operators and Maintenance personnel, will be deeply involved in the PSM/RMP program development, implementation and integration and they will assume a major responsibility for operating the ammonia process safely.\nThe AES Cayuga LLC Emergency Response Program has been developed with the complete cooperation and support of the Lansing Volunteer Fire Department.  All AES Cayuga LLC employees have received documented emergency response training.\n\nII.  STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nAES Cayuga LLC operates a Fossil Fuel Power Generating Station.  Ammonia is used to control Nox emissions in their stack gas.   Anhydrous Ammonia is the only Hazardous Material on site in amounts above the threshold quantity.\n\nIII.  SUMMARY OF WORST CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nWorst case scenario and alternative case scenario data can be viewed onsite by request.\n  \nIV.   DESCRIPTION OF THE AES Cayuga LLC ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nAES Cayuga LLC conducts an annual training and response exerc"

AES Cayuga LLC considers the PSM/RMP manuals to be a collection of \"living\" documents that must be updated and revised regularly to maintain their viability.\nAES Cayuga LLC emphasizes and insists on ?employee participation\" from the ammonia system refrigeration system operators in all aspects of the development, implementation, and integration of their PSM/RMP program.\nAES Cayuga LLC provides a comprehensive, training program with full documentation specific training modules for each ammonia system employee.\nAES Cayuga LLC maintains a pro-active \"open-door\" policy toward neighbors and concerned community citizens.  Facility tours and risk management discussions are scheduled and conducted upon written request.\n\nV.  FIVE YEAR ACCIDENTAL RELEASE HISTORY\n\nThere have been no releases of ammonia that resulted in an injury, or that had an off-site impact, or that resulted in significant property damage either on-site or off-site.\n\nVI. Emergency Response Program\n\nFacility employees have been trained to respond to accidental ammonia release.  The site emergency plan has been coordinated with the community emergency plan under the jurisdiction of the Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC) and the Lansing Volunteer Fire Department.\n\nVII.  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nAES Cayuga LLC recognizes that (even though their Ammonia release and injury experience has been excellent) their PSM/RMP program will provide much needed improvement to their safety effort. The PSM/RMP program is considered to be a set of \"living\" documents and procedures that will require constant attention, development, and revision before \"Safety\" becomes second nature.\nAES Cayuga LLC expects to improve safety perform"

Both the Maintenance and Ammonia System Operators will be deeply involved in Verifying the P&ID's, Developing and updating the Standard Operating Procedures, and performing the documented Preventive Maintenance Inspections.\n(2)    The AES Cayuga LLC PSM/RMP Program will increasingly become:  (a) computer based,  (b) user friendly,  (c) based on specific training by qualified trainers,  (d) revised and re-written to minimize paperwork and maximize documentation, and   (e) revised and re-written to be understood and used by the operating level employees.\n(3)   All recommendations developed during the HAZOP were designed to improve the safety of the AES Cayuga LLC facility.  AES Cayuga LLC has evaluated each recommendation in a timely manner and has implemented those recommendations that will reduce the possibility of a release and/or mitigate the consequences of an unintentional release."
