If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Clay County LEPC and Hastings Rural Fire Department, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.  Facility Information\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the manufacture of irrigation systems.  Anhydrous ammonia is used to blend fertilizer for sale to local farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and blended into fertilizer for crop production nutrients.\n\nThe maximum quantity stored would be 51,000 pounds in our 11,000-gallon storage tank. The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a semi load holding 40,000 pounds.\n\n3.  The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario.\n\na.  The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of the storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 51,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the storage tank.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 0.68 miles.\n\nb.  The alternative release scenario is based on the rupture of a pipe or hose (or the most likely potential incident).  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm)  is 0.27 miles.\n\n4.  The Accidental Release Prevention Program.\n\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".\n\n5. The Five-year Accident History.\n\na.  There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years.\n\n6.  The Emergency Res"

A written Emergency Action Plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\nb.  provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA);\n\nc.  have coordinated Emergency Response with the Clay County LEPC and Hastings Rural Fire Department.\n\n7.  Planned changes to improve safety.\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
