Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of the contractor's safety performance is carried out. SI Group has a policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards associated with the contractor's work and the corresponding processes. Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response in the event of an accidental release of a regulated substance. \n\nThe five-year accident history [40 CFR 68.155(d)]: \n\nThere have been no RMP reportable incidents at the Orangeburg facility.  \n\nThe emergency response program [40 CFR 68.155(e)]: \n\nAlthough SI Group has never experienced an event that had an effect off site, it has for many years coordinated its emergency response plans with community response agencies and personnel. The community siren system is tested monthly and the plant alarm system is tested four times per week. The command center personnel perform a weekly test of the equipment to include contacting the local response agency and also receive annual refresher training. Unannounced plant drills are conducted to test the system and personnel to ensure the emergency response system will be effective. \n\nPlanned changes to improve safety [40 CFR 68.155(f)]: \n\nSI Group is committed to improving our safety systems. In an effort to continually improve our systems, SI Group has an internal process for reviewing all of our safety systems. Additionally, all process changes regarding the RMP processes are reviewed by the site management team prior to making any change. This provides expert review from each critical discipline, i.e. personnel safety"

      "SummaryText": "ency planning. {RMP Rule Preamble FR 31683}. Although worst cases scenarios are required by the regulations to promote a creative dialog, the EPA does not expect industry to consider these events for the purpose of emergency response planning. \n\nThe worst case scenarios for all RMP materials at SI Group's facility would have endpoints off site. This did, as expected by the EPA, prompt an evaluation of the tanks and transportation containers to assure that the worst case events conform to the EPA's assumption, i.e., that these events are improbable and actually represent events that would never be expected to occur. The requirement for RMP materials was evaluated; however, the demands of the production units make storing some materials on site above the threshold quantity a necessity. Based on this evaluation, it was concluded that storage quantities have been minimized and that SI Group's worst case scenarios are all highly improbable or infeasible. \n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps [40 CFR 68.155(c)]: \n\nSI Group has established a strong, comprehensive safety program. This includes process safety, employee health and safety, and emergency action plans that provide a strong and effective prevention and remediation program to minimize the risk of SI Group's operations. The process safety program was developed based upon the requirements contained in the OSHA Process Safety Management regulations, the EPA Risk Management regulations, and the American Chemistry Council's Responsible Care Code of Management Practices. The program is reviewed and modified to continually improve its effectiveness and in turn SI Group's safety performance. Process safety along with employee health and safety programs have been in place for many years and are a result of a corporate culture that continues to commit significant resources to ensure that its operations pose a minimum risk to workers, the community, and the environment.

      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\nThis is an executive summary of the policies, procedures, and activities for compliance with the EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Requirements - Risk Management Program pursuant to Title 40 Part 68 of the Code of Federal Regulations (40 CFR 68) for SI Group\u0092s Orangeburg, South Carolina facility. \n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the stationary source [40 CFR 68.155(a)]: \n\nSI Group is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety. This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that encompasses design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training. In the course of manufacturing the products, flammable and toxic materials as defined in the Risk Management Planning (RMP) list of chemicals are utilized and stored in greater than threshold quantities. Although there have been no incidents associated with SI Group operations, the RMP regulations require these materials to conform to Program 3 requirements. Thus a Hazard Analysis, a prevention program, and an Emergency Response Program are in place for all RMP materials on site. \n\nThe stationary source and regulated substances handled [40 CFR 68.155(b)]: \n\nSI Group manufactures pharmaceuticals and specialty chemicals at the Orangeburg, South Carolina facility. The raw materials stored on site for the manufacturing of the products include isobutylene, hydrogen, propylene, propylene oxide, monoethylamine, anhydrous hydrogen chloride, anhydrous ammonia, and a mixture containing hydrogen cyanide (50% conc.). These are all regulated chemicals under the RMP regulation. \n\nThe worst case scenarios represent very low probability events and in some cases are scientifically infeasible. The RMP regulations require the worst case scenarios principally to support a dialogue between the source and the community on release prevention, and not to serve as the sole or primary basis for local emerg"
