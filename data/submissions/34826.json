Ethylene oxide is also repackaged for use in sterilization of medical implements and spices. BCP Ingredients commitment to providing a safe, healthy work environment for employees, as well as providing a safe, healthy environment for the surrounding community is supported by the incorporation of the latest technology in process controls, active mitigation, passive mitigation, and monitoring detection systems.
