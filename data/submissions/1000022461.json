All processes that occur have to do with changes of state between liquid and vapor phases and their impact on heat transfer. \n\nThis refrigeration plant has a three temperature system for greater operating efficiency, the 1st temperature being +15 deg F, also referred to as high temperature, for general refrigeration, the 2nd temperature being -28 deg F. called low temperature, for the storage freezers and the 3rd temperature being -45 deg F. also called low temperature, for the low temperature Belt Freezer. The High Temperature System, +15 system includes all equipment fed from the High Temperature Accumulator (V-15) which includes the ten Cooler Evaporators, along with the plate and frame heat exchanger. The -28 deg F Low Temperature Systems is fed from the Low Temperature Accumulator (V-14). This vessel provides for the eight Freezer Evaporators. The -45 deg F Low Temperature Systems is fed from the Low Temperature Accumulator (V-21). This vessel provides for the two Belt Freezer Evaporators.\n\nTo continue this description we will start at the screw compressors, there are seven total, three compressors are Low Stage or Boosters and four are High Stage.\n \nThe three Low Stage Compressors (LS-1 - LS-3) draw low pressure gas (LSS) Low Stage Suction from either V-14 or V-21 Low Temperature Accumulators into the compressor where it is compressed by rotating screws. This produces a medium pressure; medium temperature vapor designated Booster Discharge (BD), which flows to V-15, the High Temperature Accumulator for cooling.\n\nThe four High Stage Compressors (HS-1 thru"

This hot high pressure gas which also referred to High Stage Discharge or Hot Gas (HSD, HG) travels to the three Evaporative Condensers.\n\nThe Evaporative Condensers, (EC-1 thru EC-3) are where all the heat picked up by the ammonia in the system is removed by the evaporation of water. Once the heat is removed the ammonia vapor condenses inside the condenser coils becoming a high pressure liquid called Condensate Drain (CD), later referred to as HPL. This liquid then flows by gravity to the Thermosyphon Vessel (V-17).\n\nThe Thermosyphon Vessel (V-17) serves two purposes; first it serves as a storage vessel for the high pressure liquid ammonia, at +95 deg. F/ 181 psig of pressure. But it primary function is to provide liquid ammonia for the cooling of the compressors. The compressors are cooled by circulating liquid ammonia Thermosyphon Suppy(TSS) down to the compressor oil coolers/heat exchangers, where it flashes/boils off, cooling the oil that has absorbed the heat of compressing the ammonia gas. This HP ammonia vapor, designated Thermosyphon Return (TSR), from the oil coolers then circulates by natural convection back up to the this Vessel and the process is repeated. CD/ ammonia stored in the Thermosyphon Vessel also flows through one line to the Vertical Receiver (V-16), which is discussed shortly. V-17 is connected by an equalization line to the HSD from the compressors to the evaporative condensers. This allows pressures to/from both sides of the evaporative condensers to balance, allowing liquid to freely flow down from them to the vessel.\n\nV-16, the Vertical Receiver stores CD from the Thermosyphon Vessel. The Vertical Receiver is the main storage site for liquid ammonia used in the plant. Liquid ammonia is stored at +95 deg. F/ 181 psig of pressure and is designated as High Pressure Liquid, (HPL). From this vessel the ammonia is transferred to the High Tempera"

These rooms are maintained at a temperature between -10 and -20 deg. F. These coils also operate at approximately a three to one recirculation rate. Additionally these coils are attached to an overd suction header or \"leg\"; this header is fitted with a liquid pump. The liquid pump recirculates overfeed liquid from the suction of each coil back to the coils liquid supply line. The header is also fitted with a level probe; this probe maintains a liquid level via the LTRL line, and pumps excess refrigerant back to the V21 recirculator. The gas exiting the header is combined with any liquid returned via the liquid pump and is designated Low Temperature Re-circulated Suction (LTRS) and is drawn back to V-21.\n\nHeat Exchanger (V-13) takes waste heat from the system and uses it to heat a glycol, water mix which is circulated to transfer heat to under-floor piping in the freezers to prevent the ground from freezing under the concrete floor and causing damage.\n\nThe Anhydrator (V-20) is a small vessel that removes water and other impurities from the ammonia in the refrigeration system. This is achieved by taking waste heat from the HG/HSD from the compressors and boiling off liquid ammonia at a very low temperature by using the suction provided by the Low Temperature Accumulator (V-14).\n\nOil Pots, (V-18 and V-19) are small vessels that receive refrigerant oil circulating in the system and isolate it for transfer and removal from the system.\n\nAdditional Features: Pump Out (PO), this circuit allows for rapid removal of liquid ammonia and oil from all major pieces of equipment in this system.

Inspections of chemical storage areas and process systems are offered annually to the local fire department.\n\nPersonnel Roles\nIn the event of a chemical release the Gerber ERT will be dispatched to assess, mitigate and clean up the release.  The incident command system will be put into place.  Members of the ERT have completed IC training.  Should additional resources be needed the ERT will request site security to call 911 for assistance from local fire departments and/or medical services.\nThe site Gerber Emergency Management Team will assume an additional support and management role.  This role will include resource allocation, logistics, data, documentation, and communications both internal and external.\n\nRecognition and Prevention\nEmployees are trained to recognize a chemical emergency during their job orientation and hazard communication training.  Employees and supervisors are instructed to call for the ERT if a release cannot be contained without potential exposure.  Between Gerber employees and site security, chemical process systems and chemical storage are monitored around the clock seven days a week (24/7).  Preventative maintenance is performed on the anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system.  The site has a Risk Management Plan and a Process Safety Management Plan for the anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system.\n\nSafe distances and places of refuge\nIn the event of a chemical release inside a building, which has the potential to create an unsafe atmosphere, the refrigeration building will be evacuated.  In the event that the chemical release would not pose an inhalation hazard, the area of the spill and an appropriate buffer zone will be evacuated until the spill can be cleaned up. Should a site wide chemical emergency occur, the maintenance departments will shut down air handling systems as needed.  In the event of an exterior exposure the employees will be di"

During a chemical emergency security shall be used to ensure that effected areas are kept clear of unauthorized individuals. Supplemental security may also be provided by supervisors and ERT.  Access to an emergency scene is limited to members of the ERT and local emergency resources that may have been requested.\n\nEvacuation routes and procedures\nEvacuation routes are posted for sheltering in place and evacuation from buildings.  Supervisors are responsible for assisting in the evacuation and determining that all employees are accounted for. \nProcesses that could pose further danger if left unattended will be shut down according to emergency shut down procedures prior to operators evacuating (if the procedure can be performed without risk of exposure to the operator).  Evacuation drills are practiced annually and evacuation routes are reviewed for effectiveness.  \nSafe areas will always be upwind of the release.\n\nDecontamination \nDecontamination of people, property and personal protective equipment is the responsibility of the ERT and is performed after a chemical release clean up. Decontamination water is neutralized or contained and treated as hazardous waste in accordance with hazardous waste regulations.  Decontamination is performed by Gerber employees trained in decontamination procedures with assistance from the local fire department as needed.  Decontamination occurs as people and property leave the contaminated area and after the clean up is complete. \n\nMedical Treatment and First Aid\nAny Gerber Products Co. employee who is exposed to inhalation chemical levels will be sent for medical evaluation and treatment.

If any further treatment is needed, individuals will be sent to Gerber Memorial Hospital.  \n\nEmergency alerting and response procedure\nEmployees working in an area with a chemical spill or release are instructed to notify site security by calling the internal emergency number 62233.  Witnessing a release may include hearing an alarm from a sensing monitor.\nUpon being notified security will utilize the public address system to dispatch the emergency response team, and to notify employees on the type of emergency and provide further instructions. \nShould a chemical release have the potential to migrate off Gerber property individuals in the community adjacent to the property will be alerted.  Relevant data will be supplied to the police department by the site HSEO or his designee.  The police department will then have the task of notifying the effected community.\n\nCritique of response and follow up\nAs soon as possible following a response to a chemical release a team will convene to critique the response.  The team will be composed of members of management, ERT and the affected operations.  The purpose of the critique is to gather data for performance improvement should another event occur.  In addition the root cause or causes of the release will be investigated to provide corrective measures to prevent future releases.\n\nPPE and emergency equipment\nEmergency equipment for response to chemical releases is stored in a controlled area and is inspected at least monthly and after each use.  Equipment is removed from service should anything be found during an inspection that could negatively effect the use of the equipment.
