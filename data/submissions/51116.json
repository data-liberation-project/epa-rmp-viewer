This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training and consideration of safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous chemicals. However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain release.\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\nChevron Phillips Chemical Company LP Sweeny Complex consists of eight operating units linked by multiple pipelines. The complex, near Old Ocean, Texas, is at the intersection of State Highway 35 and FM 524, about 60 miles southwest of downtown Houston. The complex also operates a terminal and storage facility, along with the pipelines that connect this facility to the main plant and its markets. The complex produces 4.5 billion pounds of ethylene per year. In our process, we use the following chemicals the EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release:\n\nToxics: Chlorine \n\nFlammables: Normal Butane, Ethylene, Propane, Ethane, 2-Butene-trans, 1-Butene, 2Butene-cis, Butene, Isobutane, 2-Butene, Hydrogen, Isopentane, Methane, Pentane, 1,3-Butadiene, Propyne, Isoprene, 1-Pentene, Propadiene, 1,3-Propadiene, 2-Pentene(E), \n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program Steps\nThe following is a summary of the General Accidental Release Prevention Program in place at the Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LP Sweeny Complex.

Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) team. Employees have access to all information created as part of the Sweeny Complex's Accidental Release Prevention Program. Specific ways that employees can be involved in the Accidental Release Prevention Program are documented in the Employee Participation Element of the Sweeny Complex Process Safety Management System and in addition, Sweeny Complex has a number of teams to promote both process safety and personal safety. The teams typically involve members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering and plant management.\n\nTwo key areas for employee participation include the Employee Behavioral Safety Process (RAPTOR) and the  Employee HES Excellence Team.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nSweeny Complex maintains a variety of technical documents that are used in the safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Specific departments within the complex are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date Process Safety Information.  Process Safety Information reference documents are readily available as part of the written Employee Participation Plan to help employees locate any necessary Process Safety Information.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).

The teams verify the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\nSweeny Complex also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to confirm the safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nSweeny Complex has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and verify that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nSweeny Complex primarily uses the Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  The team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. The team employs a Layer of Protection  Analysis (LOPA) to assist with this task.\n\nThe PHA Team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution.

This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention. All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA Team findings are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo confirm that process controls and/or process hazards do not deviate significantly from the original design features Sweeny Complex periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating. The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained. Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\nOperating Procedures\nSweeny Complex maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as: (1) Unit startup, (2) Normal operations, (3) Temporary operations, (4) Emergency shutdown, (5) Normal shutdown, and (6) Initial startup of a new process. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate. The procedures are maintained current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the Management of Change process.\n\nIn addition, Sweeny Complex maintains a Process Safety Information document that provides guidance on how to respond to upper or lower limit exceedances for specific process or equipment parameters. This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\nTrainin"

New employees receive basic training in plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) that they have adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to confirm their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nContractors\nSweeny Complex uses contractors as part of its regular work force during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities. Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the plant has procedures in place to verify that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, (6) inform plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work. This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a Process Overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) Emergency Response Plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work. In addition, Sweeny Complex evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of the contractor.

In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.\n\nIncident Investigation\nSweeny Complex promptly investigates all incidents that result in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury. The goal of each investigation is to determine the Root Cause and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to plant management and respective Teams for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation teams findings and recommendations are tracked until these actions have been resolved. The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by these findings. Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years in order for these reports to be available for review during future PHA's and PHA revalidations.\n\nCompliance Audits\nSweeny Complex periodically conducts compliance audits that include the following: Internal PSM and RMP Audits, Designated Self Audits (Safety and Health), and Operational Excellence (OE) Audit (which contains all of the elements of Responsible Care Evaluations).

In addition to periodic LEPC meetings,  Sweeny Complex conducts periodic emergency drills that involve the LEPC and emergency response organizations.  In addition to the LEPC, the Sweeny Complex also has a Mutual Aid System in place.
