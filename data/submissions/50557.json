The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies.\n\nThe Mississippi Gulf Coast Regional Wastewater Authority's Emergency Response Plan is used to provide clear, concise directions during an emergency.  Its function is to prevent physical harm to the staff, the public, or the plant facilities.\n\nThis plan is a key to preparedness and was developed using EPA guidelines.  The Emergency Response Plan includes a series of action plans for specific situations and list emergency supplies, emergency organizations, and emergency telephone numbers.\n\nThe Emergency Response Plan is comprised of the following action plans for emergency situations:\n\n*  Emergency Telephone Numbers\n*  First Aid Procedures\n*  Chemical Emergencies\n*  Electrical Emergencies\n*  Weather Emergencies\n*  Material Safety Data Sheets\n\nInsofar as possible, every contingency has been covered under the Authority's Emergency Response Plan.\n\nThe Authority's wastewater treatment facilities have safety systems for the prevention of an accidental release.  These systems include the following:\n\n*  Leak Detector System\n*  Call-Out System\n*  Safety Inspections\n\nThe leak detector system is connected to an audible alarm horn located on the chlorine/sulfur dioxide storage building.  In the event of a leak, the alarm system will activate and alert plant personnel or the call- out man via the plant's automatic dialing alarm system (ADAS).  Responding personnel then implement the Emergency Response Plan and follow the pertinent procedure.\n\nThe call- out system provides the Authority with a dedicated employee available 24 hours a day to respond to emergency situations at the wastewater facilities.\n\nThe safety inspections are conducted by the Safety Committee by use of an inspection check list.  These inspections are conducted on a semi-annual basis.  The inspections are reviewed by each department head and any safety infraction is corrected.  The safety inspection insures that a sa"

The stationary source and regulated substance handled.\n\nWest Jackson County Treatment plant treats domestic wastewater from the city of Ocean Springs and the West Jackson County Utility District.\n\nChlorine is applied to the treatment plant effluent for the purpose of disinfection and sulfur dioxide is used for chlorine removal prior to discharge to the Bayou Costapia.\n\nThe facility stores two one-ton containers of chlorine and two one-ton containers of sulfur dioxide.  This equates to a six-month supply of chlorine and an eight-month supply of sulfur dioxide at present operating conditions.  The facility operates with one container of chlorine and sulfur dioxide on line and one container of chlorine and sulfur dioxide on standby.\n\n3.  The worst-case release scenario:\n\nThe worst-case release scenario was based on the failure of a storage container containing 2,000 pounds of chlorine, with a 10-minute release time.\n\nUtilizing urban conditions with a wind speed of 1.5 meters per second, class F stability, the toxic end point would be 0.0075 at a distance of 5.4 miles.\n\nThe residential population within this distance is 7,500.  Public and environmental receptors within the distance that would be affected include schools, recreational areas, federal wilderness and wildlife refuge.\n\nAlternate-case release scenario number one:\n\nThe alternate-case release scenario was based on the failure of a storage container containing 2,000 pounds of chlorine, with a 10-minute release time.\n\nUtilizing urban conditions with a wind speed of 3.0 meters per second, class D stability, the toxic end point would be 0.0075 at a distance of 2.0 miles.\n\nThe residential population within this distance is 1,500.

Public and environmental receptors within the distance that would be affected include a federal wilderness and wildlife refuge.\n\nThe chlorine/sulfur dioxide building is covered and partially enclosed.  This minimizes the potential for overheating of the ton container.\n\nThe gas feeder on the chlorine container is designed to shut off the supply of gas in case of a line breakage.\n\nThe chlorine/sulfur dioxide building is also equipped with a leak detector system.  In the event of a leak, the alarm will activate, alerting the plant personnel.  This provides for immediate response to a leak by plant personnel.\n\n4.  The accidental release prevention program.\n\nThere are several key steps to the West Jackson County Regional Wastewater Treatment plant's prevention plan.\n\n*  Call-Out System\n*  Leak Detector System\n*  Safety Inspections\n*  Safety Training\n\n5.  Five-year accident history.\n\nThe West Jackson County Regional Wastewater Treatment plant has not had an accidental release of chlorine or sulfur dioxide over the past five years.\n\n6.  Emergency Response Program.\n\nThe Authority participates in the Community Right to Know, SARA Title III, Tier 2.  This is provided to the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency, and the Jackson County Civil Defense.\n\n7.  Safety Improvements.\n\nThe Authority installed a new chlorination and de-chlorination system in December 2002.  Along with the new system, chlorine and sulfur dioxide leak detectors were installed for monitoring of chlorine or sulfur dioxide leaks.  In 2005, the storage building was enclo"
