Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties.  We work with the local fire department and emergency responders to ensure the proper execution of our plan.  The emergency response program will be updated when necessary based on modifications made to facility processes. \n\n6. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\nThe Valero Linden facility has been designed and constructed to meet existing construction and process safety requirements.  Valero Linden will continue to evaluate and implement changes as necessary to improve safety at the facility.  The 2022 PHA listed recommendations for the covered process.  Those recommendations are being evaluated by the Employee Participation Team and an action plan is being developed based on the accepted items."

Changes are reviewed to ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards, and to verify that existing controls have not been compromised by a process change.  \n\n3.8 Incident Investigation\nValero Linden has procedures to promptly investigate any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a release of a regulated substance.  The procedure establishes the minimum guidelines and activities of the incident investigation program in order to reduce the likelihood of repetitive occurrences of events which could reasonably lead to catastrophic releases.  Investigations will be undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent a similar release in the future.  Valero has an active program to distrubute all safety, process and environmental incidents fleet-wide to facilitate sharing of investigation information.\n\n3.9 Compliance Audits\nThe facility will conduct audits at least once every three years of the provisions of RMP to verify that procedures and practices developed under the standard are adequate and are being followed.  The audit will include a review of documentation and process safety information, inspection of the physical facilities, and interviews with all levels of plant personnel.\n\n4. 5-Year Accident History\nThe facility has not had any accidents reportable under RMP. \n\n5. Emergency Response Program\nValero Linden maintains a written emergency response program in its FRP/ERAP.  The purpose of the FRP/ERAP is to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.

The facility also maintains technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, piping and instrument drawings.\n\n3.3 Operating Procedures and Training\nValero Linden maintains written procedures that address all modes of process operations, including normal operations, manual operation and emergency operations/shutdowns.  The facility has developed and implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in facility operations.  \n\n3.4 Contractors\nThe contractor safety procedures establish minimum guidelines and activities in order to assure that the contractor's employees follow safe work practices and procedures.  The procedure includes a contractor screening process and hazard awareness, safety and emergency procedures training.\n\n3.5 Pre-Startup Safety Reviews\nValero Linden conducts a pre-startup safety review (PSSR) for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.\n\n3.6 Mechanical Integrity\nThe facility's mechanical integrity program includes written procedures, training, and regular inspections and equipment testing procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief systems, pumps, emergency shutdown systems, a"

Facility Description and Regulated Substances Handled\nThe Valero Linden facility is a 110 million gallon per year corn-based dry-mill denatured ethanol fuel production plant.  Ethanol is produced through the conversion of corn starch to sugars and then conversion of the sugars to ethanol (i.e., grain alcohol) through a continuous fermentation and distillation process. \n\nRegulated substances stored at the facility include anhydrous ammonia, which is used for pH control and as a nutrient in the fermentation process.\n\n3. Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nValero Linden has programs in place to address accidental release prevention measures required by EPA, process safety management (PSM) requirements from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), and notification requirements of EPA's Emergency Response and Community Right-to-Know regulations.  The facility complies with PSM for the management of ethanol, anhydrous ammonia and denaturant.\n\n3.1 Employee Participation\nValero Linden has developed an employee participation program.  All process safety information, process hazard analysis (PHA) results, recommendations, and action items, incident investigations, compliance audits, operating procedures, emergency response plan, and records of management of change are available to the operating personnel at any time.  The facility maintains an active Safety Committee and all employees participate in weekly work-place safety obsevations and audits.\n\n3.2 Process Hazard Analysis and Process Safety Information\nThe facility utilizes the LOPA PHA methodology.  The 2022 PHA identified the following potential major hazards: toxic release, fire, over-pressurization, corrosion, over-filling and equipment failure.

This summary is presented in response to the requirements of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) under Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 68 (40 CFR 68) and Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act.   The Valero Linden ethanol facility is subject to the RMP rule due to the storage of anhydrous ammonia, a regulated toxic substance, above the threshold quantities.   This RMP submittal is for the 5-year resubmission period.\n\n1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies \nValero Linden is committed to protecting the environment and operating facilities in a manner that promotes the safety of employees and the general public.  Management has adopted and implemented policies that adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.  The design and construction of the facility has incorporated physical and operational safeguards to prevent accidental releases.  Through the proper design, installation, operation and maintenance, inspections and testing of the equipment (e.g., shutoffs, alarms, probes, mechanical integrity, etc.), and the training of our personnel, Valero Linden has minimized the hazard to human health and the environment from fires, explosions, or any unplanned sudden or non-sudden release of hazardous materials.  \n\nIn the event that a release does occur, the facility's emergency response actions are described in its Facility Response Plan (FRP)/Emergency Response Action Plan (ERAP).  The FRP/ERAP includes procedures to coordinate response actions with local emergency response personnel (i.e., law enforcement, fire, and rescue departments, emergency medical services, hospital and government personnel, etc.) as well as any potentially affected neighbors.
