(\"Sterling\") Texas City, Texas facility (\"Texas City Plant\") are engrained in the fundamentals of the process safety prevention program. \n\nIn our Texas City Plant, we presently handle chemicals, which are considered hazardous by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  The same properties that make these chemicals valuable as commodities in the production of consumer products also make it necessary to observe specific safety precautions.  These safety precautions are exercised in the handling and production processes to control human and environmental exposure in an effort to reduce the overall threat to our workers as well as the surrounding communities.  \n\nIt is Sterling's policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws, rules, and regulations.  However, the safe handling of hazardous chemicals is paramount at Sterling and we adhere to standards and recommended practices governing the safe handling of hazardous chemicals to ensure that we have obtained a reasonable level of risk reduction.  Investigation of inherently safer technologies, hazardous chemical inventory reduction and/or elimination studies, and fail safe design applications are a few of the continuous improvements occurring at Sterling.  Safety depends upon our management commitment, the manner in which we handle and process chemicals, the safety devices inherent to our process designs, our operating procedures and philosophies, and the training of our workers.\n\nWe believe that accountability for safety reaches throughout all levels of management at Sterling.  Senior management's commitment and dedication to continued safe operating practices is clearly evident in our organization structure and employee empowerment.

Our participation in VPP is a strong example of management's commitment to the safety of our Texas City Plant.  \n\nWe have made extensive improvements to safety and health programs like process safety (prevention) management, emergency preparedness and response, work permitting, and training. \n\nAdditionally, we believe employee involvement is the cornerstone to continued safe operations.  We call it employee ownership and its success is portrayed through our lower injury rates, fewer incidents, and improved operating efficiencies at the Texas City Plant.  Our employees volunteer to participate in a unique program known as 'Sterling Teams to Enhance Plant Safety' (STEPS).  There are currently six active STEPS teams.  They are: a) Employee Health and Wellness, b) Contractor Safety, c) Employee Involvement and Awareness, d) Voluntary Protection Program (VPP), e) Hazard Recognition, and f) Process Safety Management. The teams present summary reports of their activities and improvements to senior management each month.  \n\nThe Emergency Preparedness and Response Plan outlines procedures for warned and unwarned emergencies that may occur at the plant.  Warned emergencies are usually weather related, such as hurricanes, or freezes.  Unwarned emergencies usually consist of on-site emergencies such as fire, explosion or a chemical release.  Sterling provides the emergency response teams with state-of-the-art equipment and the latest training and procedures.  This ensures prompt mitigation actions during incidents and rapid notification to any surrounding neighborhood that may be inadvertently affected by a plant emergency.\n\nWe maintain policies covering five organizations that make up the overall emergency preparedness and response program for the plant.

The scenario assumes that the total contents of the propylene storage vessel  (130,100 pounds) detonates and results in a destructive blast wave.  The assessment calculated a blast extending out to 1 psi.  The 1 psi damage plot would extend a maximum distance of 0.43 miles from the propylene storage vessel.  \n\nThe EPA rule also prescribes that alternate or more likely accident scenarios involving regulated chemicals are identified.  Each of the regulated chemicals was assessed, using prescriptive EPA scenarios and risk assessment guidelines.  The analysis of the alternate scenarios included mitigation affects from both passive and active safety systems.  \n\nThe results of the alternate scenario analysis are as follows:\n\n1. The inadvertent failure of the 6\" barge transfer hose during offloading of ammonia into the ammonia storage tank was selected as the alternate case for ammonia.  This failure assumes that the hose suddenly uncouples and releases 12,967 pounds of ammonia.

In addition to determining MOC notification needs and authorizing start-ups of facility changes, the MOC Coordinators are responsible for maintaining department MOC logs and records, training employees as needed, and ensuring that necessary changes are made to department procedures and process safety information.  Though not required, many of the MOC Coordinators have also received formal Process Hazard Analysis (\"PHA\") Facilitator training. \n\nDepending on the nature of the change, Sterling identifies three levels of MOC technical / safety reviews.  Level 1 and 2 MOC reviews require the use of a \"Safety/Health/Environmental Checklist\" to discuss potential hazards associated with the change and are documented on the MOC Form.  A Level 3 MOC review requires that a PHA be conducted on the change and that a representative from the Safety & Health Department participate.  The facilitator of each PHA must be qualified to do so per Sterling Safety Procedure SP-0131.  \n\nPrior to the startup of a change to a process covered by OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119, a Pre-Startup Safety Review (\"PSSR\") is held to verify that all appropriate safety information has been updated and that all appropriate reviews are performed and training has been completed.\n\nSterling completed 100% of its PHAs by the May 26, 1997 deadline imposed by OSHA.

Revalidation efforts resulted in the identification of 88 additional recommendations.  The 88 recommendations from these PHAs will also be entered into a tracking database and be the subject of monthly status reports. \n\n\nFive year Accident History\n\nSterling has a very comprehensive Incident Reporting and Investigation procedural process.  It is defined and explained by SP-0112.  Basically, an incident occurs when a deviation from expected performance has been experienced.  Incidents at Sterling are classified into a Class 1, Class 2, or Class 3 incident.\n\nClass 1 incidents are incidents of a minor nature.  A Preliminary Incident Report (\"PIR\") is filled out on these incidents and they are investigated and followed-up.  However, a formal investigation is not required for Class 1 incidents.  Class 1 incidents are reviewed at the Plant Manager weekly staff meeting.  Examples of Class 1 incidents are most first aid injuries, equipment trip outs, minor chemical releases not requiring reports to regulatory agencies, etc.\n\nClass 2 incidents are incidents of a more serious nature.

The plan is now easier to understand and contains all necessary elements to address each type of emergency.  Also in 1995, a drill was conducted using the EPP to determine the effectiveness of the plan.  \n\nIn order to improve emergency response efforts within the plant, Sterling formed the ECC group of volunteers.  The function of this group is to provide: offsite industrial hygiene monitoring during a chemical release incident, perform dispersion modeling in the event of a release, and act as a communications resource to make notifications and provide pertinent information during an incident.\n\nThe ECC group conducts training on their required duties twice a month.  Training items include the use of industrial hygiene monitoring equipment, radio communication equipment, and the CHARM dispersion modeling system.  The ECC group has made good progress in the last year towards fulfilling their role in the emergency response program at Sterling.  This group plans to continue training on their respective duties in order to improve their response efforts.  Incident command training and further dispersion modeling training is planned for the future.\n\nThe Emergency Response Improvement Team (\"ERIT\") was formed to coordinate emergency response activities at the plant.
