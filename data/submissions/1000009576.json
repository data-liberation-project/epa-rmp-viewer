      "SummaryText": "Litchfield Farm Center RMP Executive Summary\n\nSource and Product Description\nThe Andersons Litchfield Farm Center is engaged in the handling, storage, application, shipping and receiving of agricultural fertilizers (liquid and granular), pesticides and miscellaneous farm supplies.  This facility has been operated by The Andersons, Inc. since 1986. The facility manager is Toby Wigent.\n\nThe facility occupies approximately 6 A? acres and is located just north of the village of Litchfield, in Litchfield Township, Hillsdale County, Michigan.  The facility is situated on the southeast corner of M99 (Homer Rd.) and Mosherville Rd. Surrounding neighbors include three houses to the west across M99 and to the north.  A golf course lies directly across the street and there is one residence to the east.  Remaining adjacent land is agricultural.\n\nThe only RMP-regulated material at this facility is anhydrous ammonia.  One 30,000 gallon tank is used for bulk storage of  the material. This tank is on the east side of the facility, away from any buildings.  When filled to the maximum 85% capacity, this tank can hold 25,500 gallons of anhydrous ammonia.  This material is a gas at ambient temperature and pressure.  It is a liquid when stored under pressure inside the tanks.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is not a poison, but it is an inhalation / respiratory hazard.  Ammonia is a toxic material but it has no cumulative toxic effects on the human body.  However, it is acutely corrosive when it comes in contact with mucous membranes, in particular.  Anhydrous ammonia is a non-flammable gas.  Anhydrous ammonia has a strong chemical affinity for water and, therefore, an abundant supply of water is our best defense against a small or large-scale ammonia release.\n\nSummary of Major Hazards\nThe principal causes of ammonia emergencies are ruptured hoses and defective valves, as indicated by the alternative release scenario. The most probable time for an exposure or release to occur will be during a transf"

Flexible hoses and fixed piping must be connected properly.  Hoses are date-stamped and replaced in advance of the expiration date or when defects are observed.  All transfers of ammonia are observed by Anderson personnel.\n\nTransfers from the bulk storage tanks to the nurse wagon loading station occur inside fixed steel pipes and are manually controlled.  Flexible hoses are used to connect from the loading station to the nurse wagons. \n\nWith elevated temperatures that occur during mid-to-late summer, the ammonia gas inside the bulk storage tank can expand, and possibly cause one or more relief valves to open in order to equalize the pressure inside the tank.  The relief valve will reseal itself when pressure is relieved.  These A?eventsA? are very short in duration - a few seconds at the most.\n\nA complete failure or burst tank, as indicated by the worst case scenario, is highly unlikely.  The bulk storage tank was built under strict guidelines established in the ASME pressure vessel code.  The tank is protected by concrete traffic barriers.  All welding and structural work done on the tanks  are performed by certified welders.  \n\nExplanation of How Hazard Releases are Prevented.\nPassive mitigation refers to equipment, devices, or technologies that function without human, mechanical or other energy input.  The passive mitigation systems in place at the Litchfield Farm Center are:\n>  Bulkhead breakaway units located on the connection point to the storage tank. If a delivery truck or nurse wagon were to move before properly disconnecting from the tank, the concrete structure would cause the hose to break at a safe connection point.  At this point, active mitigation would take effect and an excess flow valve, just to the inside of the breakaway would prevent the tank from emptying to the atmosphere.\n\nActive mitigation refers to equ"

      "SummaryText": "ipment, devices or technologies that require human, mechanical or other energy input to function.  The active mitigation systems in place at the Litchfield Farm Center are:\n>  Excess flow valves are located on all outgoing liquid and vapor valves on the storage tank.  They close automatically if the volume of gas or liquid flowing through the line exceeds the normal flow rate.  They wonA?t reopen until the downstream shutoff valve is closed and the pressure equalizes on both sides of the valve seat.  Two principal causes of the excess valve closing are a ruptured hose or a broken pipe or shutoff valve downstream that is opened too quickly.\n>  Back check valves are located on the truck unloading riser and are designed to ensure that the flow goes in one direction only.  This prevents anhydrous ammonia from flowing to the truck from the storage tank.\n>  Pressure-relief valves are located on the top of the bulk storage tank and fixed steel piping to relieve pressure that is too great.  This can be caused by elevated temperatures in the summer or overfilling.  They open directly to the atmosphere at 250 psig and close when the pressure inside the tank drops below this pressure.\n>  Emergency shutoff cord, located along the side of the 30,000 gallon bulk storage tank activates the emergency shutoff valves on the discharge side of the ammonia pump.  This stops the flow of ammonia by remote activation of a spring loaded valve.\n>  An ample supply of water is available near the bulk storage tank from a large water tank to the north.  A nearby water well (100A? to the east) could be utilized to provide water to knock down a vapor cloud.\n>  Spill control kits are located at the facility and include sorbent material, shovels, PPE and disposal containers.\n>  Anderson personnel and truck drivers supervise all anhydrous transfers to and from the bulk storage tank\n\nPrevention Program\nPreventive maintenance is an integral piece of this facilityA?s hazard management program.

The tank and associated plumbing is inspected every five years. Copies of all reports are on file. \n\nSee Steps Taken to Address Hazards for more information on prevention measures and identification.\n\nManagement System\n(see Steps Taken to Address Hazards)\n\nEquipment maintenance\nAll equipment maintenance is formally documented. See the Prevention Program section for further explanation.\n\nTraining\nAll employees receive annual training on anhydrous ammonia, emergency action plan and spill procedures, and hazard communication.  Documentation and attendance rosters are on file at the facility.  \n\nContractors\nAll contractors receive a A?contractor safety reviewA? prior to performing work at the facility.

The audits include a physical walk through of the entire facility and a review of all EPA, OSHA and DOT paperwork and training documentation.  Action items are noted and recommendations are made.

Issues are documented and assigned to employees for follow-up. Records of all meetings are kept at the facility.\n\n\nResponse Action in the Event of a Release\nIn the event of a burst hose or defective valve, employees are instructed to shut down the transfer process and, if possible, approach the shutoff valve from upwind and attempt to turn it off. \n\nFor an uncontainable release, employees will immediately call the police and fire department or other first responders, as appropriate.  All employees, customers and contractors are to be evacuated to an upwind location. Once the response team has arrived, we will work in concert with them to close the valves between the tank and the leak.  In the meantime, a steady spray of water will deluge the ammonia gas plume and knock it to the ground, while chemically binding any free ammonia.\n\nThe employees are instructed to make emergency phone calls in this order: 911, the facility manager, the corporate Safety Department emergency phone number, the MDEQ hotline and the MDA emergency phone number.  All applicable contact names and numbers are found in the facility spill and emergency response plan.\n\nCommunication procedures with responders \nThe local fire department will be invited to tour the Litchfield Farm Center annually.
