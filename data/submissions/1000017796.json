      "SummaryText": "The Osecola Water Treatment Plant handles chlorine in an amount that is considered hazardous by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  The same properties that make chlorine valuable as a disinfectant also require strict observance to certain safety precautions in order to reduce the threat to the employees and surrounding community.  The City of Osceola strives to adhere to all applicable Federal and State rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which chlorine is handled, the safety devices inherent in the design of the facility and the training of the personnel.\n\nThe emergency response program is outlined in the A?Osceola Water Works Emergency Response Plan,A? dated November 17, 2003.  The Emergency Response Plan includes emergency contact information, an inventory of critical equipment and customers, the plantA?s chain of command, response procedures, plans and actions, coordination activities, a notification list and information about the local Emergency Planning Committee.  \n\nThe primary purpose of the Osceola Water Works is to clean and disinfect water to be used by the City of Osceola and rural neighbors for potable purposes.  Chlorine is shipped by truck to the plant in 2,000-pound cylinders.  The chlorine cylinders are unloaded from trucks into the chlorine building, which is a separate from the main treatment plant building.  This building is equipped with a scrubber system to help comply with the EPAA?s Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with state codes and regulations.  \n\nThe Osceola Water Works has not had an accidental release of chlorine within the past 5 years.  All employees have been trained in chlorine response procedures.  The Osceola Fire Department will be notified in the event that outside emergency assistance is warranted."
