      "SummaryText": "Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe North Chicago Water Treatment Plant is required to implement a Program Level 2 prevention program.  Due to the extended protection of  employees and the public, the facility has adopted the policy of implementing a Program 3 prevention program, consisting of 13 elements.\n\nThe emergency response policy consists of training employees in acknowledging and responding to chlorine release alarms, evacuations, and notification of the North Chicago Fire Department.   \n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe North Chicago Water Treatment Plant uses gaseous chlorine, stored in liquid form under pressure, to disinfect drinking water.  The facility stores 1-ton cylinders of liquid chlorine in a storage room that is isolated from the rest of the treatment facility.  Adjacent to the chlorine storage room is an isolated, locked chlorinator room that accepts the chlorine gas from the cylinders located in the adjacent chlorine storage room and mixes the chlorine gas with plant service water to form a concentrated chlorine solution that is in turn, used to dose drinking water for disinfection.  \n\nGeneral Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe Release Prevention Program at the NCWTP consists of 13  elements including 1.  process safety information (collecting and maintaining chlorine process equipment specifications), 2.  process hazard analyses (every 3 years for the chlorine storage and chlorination system), 3.  operating procedures, 4.  training, 5. mechanical integrity, 6. management of change, 7. pre-startup safety review, 8. compliance audits (every 3 years), 9.  incident investigation, 10.  employee participation plant, 11. hot work permits, 12.  contractors, and 13. emergency response plan.\n\nChemical specific prevention steps include testing the chlorine detectors and alarm system monthly and training employees on alarm acknowledgement and evacuation procedures.\n"

      "SummaryText": "\nFive Year Accident History\n\nNo chlorine release incidents have occurred in the past 5 years.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nNCWTP employees are trained to 1.  acknowledge and respond to chlorine release alarms, 2.  to evacuate all portions of the building and grounds, and 3.  notify of the North Chicago Fire Department.   NCWTP personnel are not trained in responding to a chlorine release and are not responsible for emergency responses, other than these three actions.  The North Chicago Fire Department is trained in responding to chlorine releases and is responsible for responding to a release incident.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) completed in 2008 listed several recommendations that the facility has already implemented, or is currently evaluating.  One significant improvement is the monthly testing of the chlorine detectors and alarm system.  Forthcoming changes to improve safety that are currently being considered are:  1.  integrate the chlorine alarm with the existing SCADA control and operator screens, 2.  change the chlorine alarm to be a different sound than general plant alarms, and 3.  develop room specific evacuation plans, with specific  safe meeting areas.  Additional process safety information is to be collected to ensure replacement parts used during routine maintenance do not cause releases.\n"
