(CBI), in compliance with the U.S.\nEnvironmental\nProtection Agency, Clean Air Act 112a, is presented for interested parties.\n     CBI has been in business since 1928, serving businesses and the community for over 70 years. \nCBI\ncurrently employs some 300 personnel on a full or part-time basis.  CBI is the proud sponsor of\nmany youth, civic, academic and public organizations.\n     CBI has built a new, state-of-the-art, refrigeration and warehouse facility for wholesale\ndistribution of pre-processed foods and dry goods.\n     With the construction of the new facility, CBI had the respected design/engineering firm,\nMollenberg & Betz, design, build and certify the ammonia refrigeration system that keeps the\nfrozen foods preserved until shipped to the end user.  CBI has complied with the Occupational\nSafety and Health Safety Administration (OSHA) 29CFR1910.119 Process Safety Management\n(PSM) for Anhydrous Ammonia.  In preparing the PSM it was determined that there was not a\ngeneral hazard to employees at the facility due to the fact that the ammonia is contained within the\nrefrigeration system itself.  The hazard is present to maintenance personnel when performing\nrepairs or replacing valves, gauges, etc. on the system.  This repair work is done in a very well\ncontrolled environment which isolates the repair section and reduces the amount of ammonia lost\nto a very minimum.  Since the facility is new and in very good working condition; it is estimated\nthat less than 20 pounds of ammonia may have been lost from the system per year due to\nmaintenance.  All CBI refrigeration maintenance personnel are well trained, certified by\nMollenberg & Betz, and experienced in ammonia refrigeration systems.  Select CBI maintenance\npersonnel are OSHA 40-Hour Hazwoper Trained for Emergency Response at the facility.  This\ntraining was conducted by TLC Cons"
