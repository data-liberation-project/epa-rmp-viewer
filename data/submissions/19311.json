Worst Case Release Scenario\nThe Worst Case release scenario must consider the largest quantity of a regulated substance handled on site in a single vessel at any time, taking into account administrative controls on the vessel=s contents and usage as per 40 CFR Part 68 Section 68.25.  A one ton container of chlorine is the largest vessel in the chlorine repackaging system.  The one ton container is, at most, filled with 2,000 lb of liquid chlorine.  The Worst Case release scenario for the one ton container of chlorine is the release of the 2,000 lb of chlorine at the rate of 200 lb/min for 10 minutes.  The distance to the endpoint of 3 ppm will extend beyond the boundaries of the stationary source.\n\n3b.

The one ton containers are placed in the Fill Yard.  The one ton containers are then manually rolled to the desired rail location and restrained to prevent movement.  Empty and full twenty pound cylinders are segregated and are restrained in place in an upright position.

      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nThe subject facility handles chlorine which is considered a hazardous material and is a regulated substance and is considered in this Risk Management Plan (RMP).  The properties of chlorine make it necessary to observe safety precautions in handling chlorine to prevent human exposure, and to reduce the threat to the facility's workers and nearby members of the community.  It is the facility's policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the safe procedures used to handle chlorine; the safety devices and systems designed and constructed into the facility; and the training of the pertinent personnel.\n\n2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\nThe subject facility provides chlorination service to swimming pools.  Chlorine is repackaged at the facility from one ton chlorine containers to 20 pound capacity service cylinders.  The 20 pound service cylinders are used by the facility's service staff to  chlorinate customer swimming pools.  The amount of chlorine repackaged per month is seasonally dependent.  The summer months, for obvious reasons, is the busiest time of the year.  Consequently, the quantity of chlorine on site is highest during this period.  The subject facility stores a maximum of 8,000 lb of chlorine.  This amount includes the contents of three one ton containers in storage, 300 twenty pound cylinders, and the one ton container in the repackaging process.  Chlorine is purchased from and delivered by commercial chlorine suppliers.  Delivery of one ton containers is made during normal working hours.\n\nChlorine is repackaged as a liquid from one ton containers into twenty pound net capacity, D.O.T. approved, cylinders.  Any residual chlorine in small diameter, short length piping is directed to a liquid caustic absorption scrubber.  The twenty pound cylinders are transported by company service personnel to custome"
