If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local Fire Company, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment. The primary activity at the facility is the storage and transfer of fertilizers. The maximum quantity stored would be 149,000 pounds in our 3 storage tanks.
