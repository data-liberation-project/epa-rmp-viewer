THE ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES:\n\nJones Dairy Farm utilizes anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant in closed-loop refrigeration systems.  There are two separate closed loop ammonia refrigeration systems on the site (\"West\" and \"East\" systems).  Jones Dairy Farm is committed to protecting its employees, the public and the environment from potential releases of ammonia.  Jones Dairy Farm has given utmost consideration to safety in the design and operation of the refrigeration system.  We have conducted formal Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) and \"What-if/Checklist\" studies of the \"East\" refrigeration system as well as a \"What-if/Checklist\" review of the \"West\" refrigeration system and spent several million dollars in the process of creating the new \"West\" refrigeration system while improving and upgrading the existing \"East\" ammonia refrigeration system.  As a result of information gathered during preparation of this Risk Management Program, Jones Dairy Farm is committing additional resources to further increase employee awareness and equipment reliability and to establish operator training and preventive maintenance programs. As a demonstration of Jones Dairy Farm`s high degree of commitment to public safety and service, Jones Dairy Farm is taking action to decrease the risk of ammonia exposure to the public by implementing recommendations made during the Pr"

Refresher training and emergency evacuation drills are also conducted on a periodic basis to ensure personnel know what to do in the event of an ammonia release.\n\nJones Dairy Farm has an Emergency Action Plan and a team to handle emergencies involving ammonia.  The team is equipped with ammonia respirators and will respond to ammonia releases up to 300 PPM. The emergency plan has been coordinated with the Jefferson County Emergency Planning Commission.\n\n2. THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nJones Dairy Farm is a meat processor.  We cook, cure, smoke, and package pre-processed meats.  We use a refrigeration system to provide cooling and freezing in processing areas of the plant.  The refrigeration system uses anhydrous ammonia, which is the RMP regulated substance.  The maximum quantity of ammonia in the combined systems is approximately 64,295 pounds.  The estimated maximum quantity listed in the prior RMPlan was 94,000 pounds; however, the ammonia calculations were reviewed and found to be inaccurately calculated (vessel levels too high). Therefore, a more accurate (and much lower) ammonia inventory is being reported in this RMPlan resubmission.\n\nIn the refrigeration systems, the liquid is circulated as needed to the evaporators and heat exchangers where heat is absorbed and removed from the medium. The anhydrous ammonia refrigeration systems are closed loop two stage industrial refrigeration systems. The ammonia is not used or mixed in any manner with other chemical processes.\n\n3.

The entire ammonia system has been designed and installed according to guidelines provided by the American Society of Heating Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers, Inc. (ASHRAE) and the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR).  The ammonia refrigeration system is operated and maintained by trained and experienced operators.\n\nA \"Worst-Case Scenario Offsite Consequence Analysis\" and an \"Alternative Scenario Offsite Consequence Analysis\" were performed identifying the public and environmental receptors within the toxic endpoint concentration radius of 200 ppm.  A variety of administrative controls and computerized controls are in place to shut the system down when operating parameters and limits are exceeded.\n\n4. THE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTATIVE STEPS: \n\nThe basic elements of the Program 3 Prevention program have been developed and are now in place. These include:\n\nProcess Safety Information\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nStandard Operating Procedures\nSafe Work Practices\nEmployee and Operator Training Programs\nMechanical Integrity Program\nManagement of Change Procedures\nPre-Startup Safety Review\nPSM Compliance Audit Procedures\nIncident Investigation Procedures\nEmployee Participation Program\nHot Work Permit Procedures\nContractor Safety Program\nEmergency Response Program\n\nAmmonia specific prevention steps include:\n\nAdministrative controls\nOperator Training\nComputerized controls\n\nPreventive Program 3 provides extensive maintenance and operator/mechanic training to ensure that the system's mechanical integrity is maintained for the life of the covered process. Program 3 also incorporates administrative controls when modifications are made to the covered process (ammonia refrigeration system), so the training and preventative programs are updated as the system expands and changes.\n\n5.

      "SummaryText": ":\nJones Dairy Farm experienced one leak of anhydrous ammonia from the refrigeration system in 2011.  For further details on this release, please see Section 6 (Accident History) as sited earlier in this document.\n\n6.  THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\n\nThe Jones Dairy Farm Emergency Action Plan is based on and is in compliance with OSHA's 29 CFR 1910.38 and EPA's 40 CFR 68.93.  The purpose of this plan is to provide the means for rapidly determining the appropriate response for any emergency that may develop at the facility such as an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  We have discussed this program with the local fire department.  The Emergency Action Plan is written and it includes specific actions to be taken in response to an accidental release, procedures for informing the public and local agencies responsible for responding to an accidental release, and information on emergency health care.\n\n7.  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\n\nJones Dairy Farm is incorporating and addressing any recommendations resulting from the Process Hazard Analysis, Offsite Consequences, and program audits. The flexibility of the program allows Jones Dairy Farm to respond effectively to prevent or minimize any potential exposure of Jones Dairy Farm employees, the surrounding public, and/or the environment to a release of anhydrous ammonia. Specific actions taken to improve safety are the implementation of the Program 3 Prevention Program described above, improved operator training, administrative controls, and computerized system controls.\n\nAdditional Notes:  The current Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA), conducted in 2022 was used to update the worst case scenario data for this resubmission. The alternative release scenario was also revised and uses the most recent data from the 2022 OCA.  The new alternative release assumes a more likely scenario (discharge from the largest relief valve) and also reflects more closely the allowances and expectations of an alternative release s"
