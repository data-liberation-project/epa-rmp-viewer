Summerson Wastewater Treatment Facility performed an offsite consequence analysis to estimate the potential impacts of accidental releases of the Chlorine from our process. The regulated substances were evaluated for two possible worse-case release scenarios and alternative release scenarios to account for mixed rural and urban topography.  It is important to understand that the City of Cortland Leroy R. Summerson Wastewater Treatment Facility has invested extensive resources to prevent releases, and the potential for a worse-case release is extremely small.  The alternative release scenario represents a more realistic potential for occurrence and is based on historical data from our process or other similar processes.  By identifying these potential releases, the City of Cortland Leroy R. Summerson Wastewater Treatment Facility has developed an extensive program to prevent such an occurrence.  This program is discussed in detail in the Prevention Program section of this plan.\r\n\r\nThe primary objective of performing the offsite consequence analysis is to determine the distance at which certain effects might occur to the public and/or the environment as a result of an accidental release.  This point is called the endpoint distance.  At distances less than the endpoint distance, the effects would be greater; at distances farther than the endpoint, the effects would be less.\r\n\r\n3.1  Hazard Assessment - Toxic Substances\r\n\r\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with Regulated Toxic Substances is a failure of a full, one ton (2000 lb) cylinder of chlorine and/or sulfur dioxide.

Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, and procedures are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided with any necessary training related to the change.\r\n\r\n4.7  Pre-startup Review\r\n\r\nThe City of Cortland Leroy R. Summerson Wastewater Treatment Facility performs a safety review of all new or modified processes prior to their being placed into service to ensure that these processes have been prepared to operate safely.  This review is designed to confirm:\r\n\r\n* construction and equipment are in accordance with design specifications,\r\n* adequate safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency procedures are in place,\r\n* employee training has been completed, and\r\n* for covered processes, a PHA has been performed for new processes and management of change requirements have been completed for modified processes.\r\n \r\nA pre-startup review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.  The review involves field verification of the construction elements and serves as a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\r\n \r\n4.8  Compliance Audit\r\n \r\nThe City of Cortland Leroy R. Summerson Wastewater Treatment Facility conducts periodic audits of the Disinfection Process to ensure the City of Cortland Leroy R. Summerson Wastewater Treatment Facility"

Summerson Wastewater Treatment Facility Disinfection Process is required by state law, to implement a Program Level 3 Prevention Program which is similar to the OSHA Process Safety Management standard.  The requirements of the OSHA Process Safety Management standard are nearly identical to the RMP Rule Program 3 Prevention Program requirements.  The Disinfection Process Prevention Program consists of the following elements.\r\n\r\n4.1  Process Safety Information\r\n\r\nThe City of Cortland Leroy R. Summerson Wastewater Treatment Facility maintains a variety of technical documents that help ensure the safe operation of our processes.  These documents address:\r\n\r\n* physical properties of hazardous substances handled,\r\n* chemical properties and associated hazards of those substances,\r\n* operating parameters and limitation(s) of the process equipment,\r\n* design basis and configuration of the equipment, and\r\n* specific chemical inventories.\r\n \r\nThe City of Cortland Leroy R. Summerson Wastewater Treatment Facility ensures that the process safety information is available to all City of Cortland Leroy R. Summerson Wastewater Treatment Facility employees, the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), and the local fire department.  The EHS & T Coordinator is responsible for maintaining and updating this information, as needed.\r\nChemical specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).  This information is supplemented by other technical information specific for these chemicals.  Continuous attention is given to revisions and updates on the hazards of chlori"

Information regarding toxicity, environmental impacts, corrosion concerns, inadvertent mixing hazards, and other safety and health concerns are addressed and communicated to the appropriate parties.\r\nThe City of Cortland Leroy R. Summerson Wastewater Treatment Facility also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes:\r\n \r\n* materials of construction,\r\n* design pressures,\r\n* temperature ratings,\r\n* electrical ratings,\r\n* flow limits,\r\n* block flow diagrams,\r\n* consequences of deviation from operating limits,\r\n* safety systems,\r\n* applicable design codes and standards,\r\n* process chemistry, and\r\n* design basis for relief and ventilation systems.\r\n\r\nMany of the operating parameters are included in the operating procedures to aid in the safe and proper operation of the process.  These documents are used to:\r\n\r\n* train employees,\r\n* perform Process Hazard Analyses (PHAs), and\r\n* help maintain the equipment.\r\n\r\nAll the above mentioned information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provide a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the Disinfection Process are not compromised.\r\n\r\n4.2  Process Hazard Analysis\r\n\r\nThe City of Cortland Leroy R. Summerson Wastewater Treatment Facility performed and will periodically update process hazard analyses (PHAs) of the Disinfection Process to help identify process hazards and generate recommendations that might improve the safe operation of the process.  Within this program, the Disinfection Process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\r\nTo perform the PHAs, the City of Cortland Leroy R.

      "SummaryText": "chnique.  The PHAs are conducted using a team of people with experience in engineering and Disinfection Process operation and a leader with experience in process hazard analysis techniques. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and/or mitigation measures, when appropriate.  The team then prepares a written report describing the results of the analysis, including a list of recommendations ranked according to relative risk ratings assigned by the team.  Responsibility to resolve the recommendations is assigned to the EHS Committee and is tracked through completion.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\r\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the City of Cortland Leroy R. Summerson Wastewater Treatment Facility periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the Disinfection Process is no longer in operation.  The results and findings of these updates are documented and retained.  The team findings are forwarded to the EHS Committee for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\r\n\r\n4.3  Operating Procedures\r\n\r\nThe City of Cortland Leroy R. Summerson Wastewater Treatment Facility engineers, operators, and management work together to develop and maintain written operating procedures to define how tasks related to the Disinfection Process operation should be safely performed.  These written procedures address various modes of process operations, such as:\r\n\r\n* normal startup,\r\n* normal operations,\r\n* temporary operations,\r\n* emergency shutdown,\r\n* normal shutdown, and\r\n* initial startup of a new process.\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n The written operating procedures include:\r\n \r\n* steps for safely conducting process tasks,\r\n* applicable process saf"
