The system utilizes recirculated liquid feed to the cold room evaporator coils, direct (thermal) expansion in the air dehumidifier, and flooded configurations for the chillers, milk and crystallizing tanks.  Cold storage room design temperatures are 32\u00a1\u00c6F with a design coil temperature of 20\u00a1\u00c6F (33.5 psig).\r\n\r\nThe Compressor Area is not enclosed, but is covered by a roof canopy.  The High Pressure Receiver (HPR) is located in an open area enclosed on three sides near the Compressor Area.  System components are connected with steel piping approved for ammonia refrigeration service and the system is controlled by the programmable logic controller (PLC), the microprocessors at the screw compressors, safety switches, detection, and control valves.\r\n\r\nThe compressors, pressure vessels, pumps, PLC, high-pressure receiver, and purger are located in the Compressor Area; the condensers are located on the Compressor Area roof; the Ammonia Diffusion Tank is located outside the northeast corner of the Dry Storage building; the evaporator coils are located in their respective cold rooms; the Milk Tanks are located east of the Processing Room; and, the Crystallizing Tanks are located north of the Whey Building.\r\n\r\nSee P&ID's for equipment layout.\r\n\r\n \r\nThe Primary System Components include the following:\r\n\r\nQUANTITY\tDESCRIPTION\r\n4\tMedium Temperature Reciprocating Compressor Packages\r\n3\tMedium Temperature Screw Compressor Packages\r\n3\tEvaporative Condensers\r\n1\tHigh-Pressure Receiver\r\n1\tSuction Accumulator\r\n1\tRecirculator Package w/ (2) Ammonia Pumps and (1) Oil Pot\r\n1\tLiquid Transfer Unit\r\n1\tWater Chiller w/ Surge Drum (SD1)\r\n1\tGlycol Chiller w/ Surge Drum (SD4)\r\n3\tBrine Chillers w/ Accumulators (SD3, SD5, SD6)\r\n1\tAir Dehumidifying Coil w/ Surge Drum (SD2)\r\n10\tMilk Tanks w/ Surge Drums\r\n4\tCrystallizing Tanks w/ Surge Drums\r\n12\tEvaporator Coils - C"

      "SummaryText": "P1) is pumped to the Liquid Transfer Unit (LTU).  Once the LTU liquid level rises to a setpoint, a level sensor opens the three-way solenoid valve, allowing hot gas from the high side discharge of the compressors to drain the liquid in the LTU to the High Pressure Receiver (HPR).   As the liquid level in the LTU drops, the three-way valve changes position and transfers ammonia vapor through the MTS line back to the Recirculator Package.\r\n\r\nHigh-pressure, high-temperature ammonia vapor discharge from the compressors provides hot gas defrost for the evaporator coils, brine chillers, and operation of the automatic liquid transfer system.  The heat of compression in the compressor discharge is removed in the Evaporative Condensers.  An equalizer line between the condenser discharge and the High Pressure Receiver ensures that equal pressure is maintained between the two points to ensure proper liquid draining.\r\n\r\nAn Autopurger periodically removes noncondensibles from the system.  The Ammonia Diffusion Tank is maintained full of water to absorb a system overpressure release from the vessel pressure relief valves.  Emergency E-stop switches are located at the perimeter of the Compressor Area for emergency shutdown.  Ammonia sensors in the Compressor Area, HPR Area, and production areas trigger audible/visual notifications.\r\n\r\nThe operation staff consists of the Maintenance Manager and Refrigeration Operator/Mechanics.  Staff is responsible for the operation and some of the maintenance of the refrigeration system, as well as the daily monitoring.  Most service and repair activities are contracted to a qualified refrigeration contractor.  \r\n\r\nSafety systems include:\r\n\r\n\u00a1\u00e0\tDual pressure relief valves on all pressure vessels;\r\n\u00a1\u00e0\tAmmonia diffusion tank (all relief valve discharge lines lead to the diffusion tank for mixing with water in the event of a release from a component relief valve);\r\n\u00a1\u00e0\tCompressor safety cutouts and control panels to shut down the compressor operation"

Prior to entering the evaporator coils, the ammonia expands and flashes to saturation temperature as the pressure is reduced through the respective expansion valves.  The resulting low-pressure liquid ammonia absorbs heat from the space as the liquid ammonia evaporates in the coils.\r\n\r\nThe HPR also provides high pressure liquid ammonia to the chiller plate and frame heat exchanger surge drums, the milk and crystallizing tanks surge drums, and the air dehumidifier in the Whey Building.  Liquid injection cooling (LIC) is also provided by the HPR for screw compressor oil cooling.\r\n\r\nHigh temperature saturated ammonia vapor (HTRS) is returned from the cold room evaporator coils and the brine and glycol chillers to the Recirculator Package vessel.  Medium temperature suction (MTS) returns saturated ammonia vapor from the air handling units, milk and crystallizing tanks, and the air dehumidifier to the Suction Accumulator (SA1), where the vapor is separated from the liquid.\r\n\r\nAs liquid ammonia accumulates in the Suction Accumulator, the liquid is transferred to the Recirculator Package (RP1) via the HTRS line and a pressure differential.  Ammonia vapor (MTS) is provided to the high temperature reciprocating compressors from the Suction Accumulator (SA1) and to the medium temperature screw compressors from the Recirculator Package (RP1).  If configured as a swing compressor, RC5 is provided suction vapor for compression from the Suction Accumulator or the Recirculator Package, depending on the operation configuration.  Currently, the system is configured and operated as a single stage system.\r\n\r\nExcess accumulation of liquid ammonia in the Recirculator Package (R"
