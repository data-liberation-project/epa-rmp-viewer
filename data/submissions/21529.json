      "SummaryText": "The accidental release prevention and emergency response policy for West Bend Elevator is the following:  West Bend complies with requirements for anhydrous ammonia storage and it is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state and local laws.  If an emergency were to occur, signs are posted that refer to Ken Poeppe who is employed by West Bend Elevator.  Ken will decide what steps need to be taken in the event of an emergency.  This facility is a wholesale business providing products for the production of grain and livestock enterprises.  Our worst case scenario is failure of one of our anhydrous ammonia storage tanks when filled to the greatest amount allowed.  This would result in a vapor cloud explosion.  According to EPA look-up tables, the distance to the endpoint is 4.4 miles.  There are an estimated 4000 people within this radius.  Schools, residences, recreation areas, and major commercial, office or industrial areas included in this radius.  This facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rules and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.  The anhydrous ammonia plant is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with regulation and state laws.  We have never had an accident involving NH3 that caused death, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or shelterings in the past 5 years.  In the event of an emergency involving our NH3 system, it is our policy to notify the Emmetsburg Fire Dept. and request that they respond to the emergency.  We have discussed this policy with the County Disaster Coordinator, Emmetsburg Fire Chief and members.  The Emmetsburg fire department has inspected our facility and is familiar with it.  We have no plans to improve or change our plans.  We review the plans annually or sooner if necessary."
