Contract employees are informed of known potential hazards related to the contractor's work and the process. This information is shared via safety indoctrinations as well as safe work permitting. Contractors are also informed of emergency response procedures and plan should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\n\n4. Five-year Accident History\nTrinseo, Dalton, GA Site has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years. Due to the stringent release prevention policies, there have been no accidental releases as defined by the RMP rule of regulated substances during this period.\n\n5. Emergency Response Program\nTrinseo, Dalton, GA Site has a written emergency response plan and procedures addressing accidental releases of regulated substances. The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, use of emergency response equipment, emergency response training, notification to local emergency response agencies and the public, evacuations, as well as post-incident remediation of affected areas.\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, the emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and maintained. In addition, the Emergency Response plan is reviewed on a regular interval and updated to reflect changes at the stationary source. Employees are training on the Emergency Response Plan on a regular interval as well.\n\n6. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\nThe site continues to be committed to making continual progress toward our goal of no accidents, injuries or harm to human health and the environment.  A \u0093Top Ten\u0094 program is used to proactively identify and implement safety improvements.
