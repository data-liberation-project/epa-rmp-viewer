This plan has been endorsed by the City staff responsible for the operation and maintenance of the Parsons Avenue Water Plant.  The Parsons Avenue Water Plant has procedures in place, including both onsite activities and coordination with offsite responders, that must be followed in the event of a chlorine release.

The Parsons Avenue Water Plant has a design capacity of 50 million gallons per day (MGD) and treats ground water to drinking water standards.  Facilities are provided for the handling and utilization of chlorine in one-ton containers.  The Chlorination Facility is located in the Chlorine Room, adjacent to the Chemical Building, and includes a loading and unloading area, as well as a storage area for the one-ton containers.  \r\n\r\nThe chlorine ton containers are stored inside the Chlorine Room.  The doors and windows in these rooms are normally kept shut. A monorail and hoist assembly is provided for the handling and transfer of the one-ton containers to the storage facilities from open top delivery trucks or from storage to the scale assemblies for process use.   Administratively, provisions are made to house eighteen (18) one-ton containers of chlorine, twelve (12) of these are on trunnions on the floor of the Chlorine Room and the remaining six (6) are on scales.  However, the maximum intended inventory of chlorine at the Parsons Avenue Water Plant is twenty (20) full one-ton containers of chlorine or approximately 40,000 lbs of chlorine.\r\n\r\nThe Chlorine Room is eq"

Normally, all six containers are connected to the container mounted vacuum regulator check valves, with  only two of the one-ton containers in operation at a time, one for the pre- and one for the post chlorine feed points. When the in service container approaches empty, the container is shut off and the next full container in the bank is opened and put in service. \r\n\r\nThe plant is feeding chlorine as a gas under vacuum.  Vacuum chlorine feed reduces the likelihood of a release to the environment.  The chlorine gas is reduced to a vacuum of 20-25 inches of mercury at the container-mounted vacuum regulator check. The facility has two pairs of chlorinators, one designated for pre-chlorination, and the other designated for post-chlorination.  Four water injectors are provided for solution chlorine feed at various process locations.  \r\n\r\nThere are a total of 15 W&T Acutec 35 chlorine gas detector units (cgdu) in the plant one of which is in the scrubber stack. There are 3 subsystems present: chlorine room, filter building and basement, basin complex, and Recarb building. There are 2 passive sensors in most chlorine gas detection units.

Therefore the Parsons Avenue Water Plant has developed an Emergency Action Plan to ensure employee safety instead of an Emergency Response Program, as allowed by 40 CFR 68.90(b).  The Parsons Avenue Water Plant facility Emergency Action Plan outlines actions required to respond to a chlorine emergency and has coordinated this plan with City of Columbus Fire Department - Haz Mat Station 4.  The Fire Department personnel are the designated first responders in the event of a chlorine emergency.   Parsons Avenue Water Plant employees are not designated responders to a chlorine release.  As specified in 40 CFR 68.90, Parsons Avenue Water Plant's Emergency Action Plan meets the exception listed in 40 CFR 68.90(b) and therefore, the facility is not required to have the Emergency Response Program of 40 CFR 68.95.\r\n\r\nA\u00a768.155(g) Safety Improvements\r\n\r\nRecommendations for safety improvements were identified in the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) which was completed per OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119(e) in November of 1999 and a PHA Re-validation completed in January 2005.
