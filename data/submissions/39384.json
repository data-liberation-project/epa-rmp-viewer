The plant uses chlorine to treat the city's drinking water. The water \ntreatment plant holds safety as its first priority, especially when it comes to chlorine. The\nmaximum inventory is 6 tons and the treatment plant limits the maximum number of cylinders\nin use at any one time to two.\n\nThe Altus Water Plant follows a strict operation, safety and maintenance program to minimize\nthe liklihood of an accident occuring at the facility. Because of the strict implementation of the\nabove mentioned programs, this facility has not had a release within the last five years.\n\nThe Altus Water Plant holds refresher training and refresher courses for the personnel at the \nfacility regarding the chlorine system and its concerns and Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus\n(SCBA). However, if an accident occurred, the Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC)\nand the Altus Fire Department would be notified and would respond immediately.\n\nThe Altus Water Plant has no current plans to change the chlorine process in the foreseeable\nfuture."
