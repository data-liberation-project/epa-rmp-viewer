Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at the Facility\nThe Merom Generating Station is committed to providing a safe environment for its employees, contractors, visitors, neighbors and surroundings.  This includes the prevention of accidental releases of any substance as well as the regulated substance: anhydrous ammonia.  The Merom Generating Station has several policies in place to provide guidance and training for maintaining a safe environment.  In the event of a release or emergency, the Merom Generating Station has established a Standard Operating Procedure for emergency responses as well as several others for their on-site Emergency Response Team.  The Merom Generating Station has dedicated Administrative Bulletin #24 in the Manual of Administrative Bulletins to Corporate Safety and Health Policy.  The plant has an additional policy book, Merom Generating Station Plant Policies, which includes sections on safety and training.  Additional training and safety procedures have been established in response to bringing ammonia onto the plant site.  \n\n2.  Facility Information and the Regulated Substances Handled\nThe Merom Generating Station is located approximately six miles west southwest of the City of Sullivan in Sullivan County, Indiana, and consists of two identical 535-MW coal-fired steam electric generating units.  Both units began commercial operation in the early 1980s.  \n\nEmissions are controlled by: electrostatic precipitators (ESP) to reduce particulate, a flue gas desulfurization (FGD) system for SO2 reduction, reagent injection system for H2SO4 and mercury reduction and a Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) system which utilizes ammonia as the reagent to react with the catalyst to reduce NOx.  The ammonia used in the SCR process is the regulated substance for this program.  Merom Generating Station has two 45,000 gallon tanks on site.  The tanks are filled to a maximum of 79%, or"

General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nThis facility complies with several rules and regulations that apply to the storage, handling and use of anhydrous ammonia including OSHA PSM.  Merom Generating Station retained the services of a consultant to assist in the development of a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA).  The PHA was performed using the What-if method to identify hazards and to establish plans to prevent process problems.  Preventative maintenance and continual employee training are on-going to ensure a safe environment.  Plant personnel are trained specifically on procedures in dealing with ammonia handling, use and storage.  A higher level of training is provided to employees responsible for operation and maintenance of the ammonia process.  \n\n4.  Five-Year Accident History\nMerom Generating Station has had no accidents in the past five years stemming from accidental releases from the covered process that resulted in death, injury, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite death, injury, evacuation, shelter in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n5.  The Emergency Response Program\nThe emergency response for an ammonia release includes notifying authorities through the 911 system.  In addition, the Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC) will be notified directly by the Boiler House Shift Supervisor.  Site personnel have been trained to respond to an emergency in the event one would occur.  Plant supervisors will authorize the use of audible alarms for plant safety personnel to respond and for plant personnel to take necessary precautions for personal safety.  Public notification may include the use of phones, possible door to door notification, and activation of the county emergency tone system.\n\n6.
