The Union Carbide facilities at South Charleston, Institute, Technology Park, Massey Yard, and New Yard share leveraged support and management and are collectively called West Virginia Operations (\u00c2\u00bfWVO\u00c2\u00bf).\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nWVO is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. If such a release should occur, our highly trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  We are also an active member of the Kanawha/Putnam Emergency Planning Committee which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Technology Park is a 651-acre complex housing pilot plants, research and development laboratories, and an engineering center.  \n\nUnion Carbide, a subsidary of the Dow Chemical Company, currently has 4 RMP regulated substances present in 1 covered pilot plant process at the Technology Park.  Union Carbide handles and stores threshold quantities of the following EPA RMP-regulated flammable substances at the Technology Park:  \n\u00c2\u00bf Propylene\n\u00c2\u00bf Ethylene\n\u00c2\u00bf Isopentane\n\u00c2\u00bf 1-Butene\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe Technology Park has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies, there have been no accidental releases as defined by the RMP rule of regulated"

      "SummaryText": "se plans are developed and coordinated with the Kanawha/Putnam Emergency Planning Committee and the community.\n\nThe Technology Park carries a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.  The plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, emergency drills are conducted to enhance skills and tactics for responding to an accidental chemical release.  Critiques are held on drills and actual events.  Emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced. In addition to the on-site emergency squad, Union Carbide staffs a Distribution Emergency Response Team (DERT) in the Kanawha Valley that responds to accidental releases from transportation equipment throughout the continental United States\n\nKanawha/Putnam EPC is the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) with which our emergency plan has been coordinated and verified.\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nA number of process safety improvements have been made to the Polyolefins Process R&D Pilot Plant to improve the operational safety of the facilities since the last RMP submittal in 2004.  An ethylene truck unloading hose was equipped with a truck-end emergency shutdown valve to allow isolation from the truck to the ethylene storage tank in the event of a hose failure during unloading.  The operation of the carbon monoxide storage facility was changed to eliminate 90% of the material transfers that had been occuring between the tank truck and storage tubes.  This change also reduced the amount of carbon monoxide actually valved into service at any given time by more than 50%.  The carbon monoxide ta"

A number of relatively low level pressure relief valve vent stacks on the ethylene storage system were re-piped into a common vent header that is tied into an elevated vent stack for better dispersion from operating areas.  A number of manual vent valves on the carbon monoxide storage system were combined into a common vent header that is tied into an elevated vent stack.  An existing dry catalyst waste collection and deactivation drum was replaced with a robust waste tank that mixes the dry catalyst with oil for safer disposal.  An oxygen alarm was installed on the unit's plant nitrogen supply header to alert operations in the event of oxygen contamination.  Explosionproof emergency lights were installed in Building 773 operations area to provide lighting in the event of a power failure."

These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation\nUnion Carbide Corporation believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility\u00c2\u00bfs implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses in particular.  Operators, Maintenance and Engineering Staff personnel participate in process hazard analysis, developing and improving operating procedures,accident investigations, safe work permitting, lockout tag out, hot work, self assessments, audits, emergency drills, pre-start-up safety reviews and management of change.  \n\nContractors\nOur company hires contractors to perform specialized maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is performed.  West Virginia Operations has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related the contractor\u00c2\u00bfs work and the processes.

Key elements include:\n\nProcess Safety Information\nWe maintain a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes. Examples include Material Safety Data Sheets for all the hazardous chemicals, Equipment Design Specification sheets, Reactive Chemicals Test results, and many others. This information is maintained up-to-date and is available to operating personnel.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified, evaluated, and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses include: Checklists, What If/Checklists (combined), HAZOP\u00c2\u00bfs, Audits, Reactive Chemical/Process Hazard Analyses, Chemical Exposure Index, Fire & Explosion Index, and Layers of Protection Analyses. The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at regular intervals.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  The Polyolefin Pilot Plant had a Process Hazard Analysis on 11/9/2005 shortly after the June 2004 EPA RMP update and another revalidation on 10/29/2008.  \n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Union Carbide Corporation maintains written operating procedures.
