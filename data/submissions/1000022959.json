The training program satisfies the requirements of A\u00c2\u00a7 68.71 of the RMP Rule and is comprised of the following:\n\no Initial employee training\no Training provided in response to equipment or process changes, as \n  identified under the MOC program;\no Periodic refresher training; and\no Training documentation.\n \nAll operators receive initial training in safe work practices and basic operating principles prior to assignment.  The operators receive training specific to the operations of the process once they are assigned.  Various means are used to verify competency, but primary emphasis is placed on on-the-job observation by supervisors.  Documentation of the training is forwarded to the Learning Center for filing and tracking.\n \nIn addition to on-the-job training, UPI personnel are trained in basic safety courses on an ongoing basis.  All operating division employees and all building wardens in non-industrial areas of the plant are designated potential first responders.  Courses they take include: Principles of Accident Prevention, CPR, First Aid, and First Responder Training.

Management systems are in place and prevention programs are fully implemented to protect the public, our personnel and the environment.  \n\n\nAlternative Release Scenario\n\nOffsite consequence analysis is also a useful tool in helping UPI to coordinate with the Contra Costa County Health Services Department (CCCHSD) Incident Response Team in emergency response planning.  To do this, UPI modeled a series of three potential alternative release scenarios (ARS) to establish a reasonable outer bound for emergency response planning and to provide for explaining potential hazards to the community.  CCCHSD guidance calls for modeling the ARS using very conservative meteorological conditions for emergency response planning purposes.  The US EPA, in its guidance for modeling the ARS, suggests the use of more typical (average) me"

Additionally this distance reduction has resulted in a 46% reduction in the estimated residential population within the worst-case endpoint zone.\n\nThe liquid hydrogen process worst-case scenario does not result in any residential population within the endpoint distance zone.\n\nUSS-POSCO Industries (UPI) has a long-standing commitment to business principles which promote the safe, ethical operation of its steel manufacturing facilities in Pittsburg, California.

The vessel sits on a concrete pad that is surrounded by a locked fence topped with razor wire and a canopy over the tank. \n\nThe amount of ammonia stored in the supply vessel is limited to less than 50% of the vessel capacity, by volume.  The management control to maintain this inventory is that:\n\no Ammonia is ordered only when the tank volume is less than 15% \no Ammonia supplier is contracted to only deliver tank trucks of 3,750 gallons\nand process is under watch during filling process to insure less than 50% fill.\n\nThese controls result in a maximum inventory ammonia inventory of 5,550 gallons (28,000 pounds at 25oC).  The threshold quantity for anhydrous ammonia under the RMP rule is 500 pounds.\n\nThey Hydrogen's largest vessel quantity is: 10,630lbs with a total of hydrogen on site to 15,930lbs (with both vessel totals).    There are no administrative controls in place for the larger hydrogen tank, however there is a sensor that alerts Supervisors and Delivery Company of low Hydrogen.  After alert, the Supervisor confirms with Delivery Company that a determined amount of Hydrogen will be delivered.  We consider this an Administrative control, however during an audit conducted by CCHS it was an action item to state that No administrtive controls are in place in the larger hydrogen tank.  \n\nWorst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nThe worst-case scenario as defined by the EPA, is an extremely unlikely event due to many factors, including the age of the process equipment, the prevention program, and the management system.  The worst-case scenarios for the UPI facility are a 10 minute release from anhydrous ammonia storage (Toxic Release Scenario).  When determining the quantity released in these worst-case scenarios administrative controls that limit the maximum allowable inventory in the process was included.  Maximum inventory of anhydrous ammonia is limited to less than 50% of vessel capacit"

SafeTrax has been instrumental in helping UPI keep all of the requirements in one location for our employees, via a secure Username and Password.  The RMP submittal copies are contained in SafeTrax.  \n\nPrevention Program:\n \nMany of the processes, including the RMP covered processes are also regulated under the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation, 29 CFR Part 1910.119.  The release prevention program at UPI was developed to prevent onsite and offsite impacts to people and the environment.  Therefore, this facility has developed a release prevention program to comply with both the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) rule and the OSHA PSM requirements.  The release prevention program includes the following elements: process safety information, PHA, operating procedures, training, mechanical integrity, management of change, PSSR, compliance audits, incident investigation, employee participation, hot work permits, contractors, and others.\n\nThe prevention program elements represent an integrated system of administrative controls intended to ensure the safety of workers, the public, and the environment.  Many of these prevention program elements (e.g., PHAs, compliance audits, incident investigation) result in the development and implementation of additional safeguards (i.e., administrative and engineering controls).
