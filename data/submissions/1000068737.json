Robinson Cavern #1 has not had any accidents meeting the conditions of the RMP rule to be reported in the five-year accident history.  \r\n\r\n1.6 Emergency Response Program Information\r\n\r\nBecause Robinson Cavern #1 is an unmanned facility, the Robinson Fire Department provides and coordinates emergency response for releases of RMP regulated substances for Robinson Cavern #1 in conjunction with the Robinson Refinery ERT. Robinson Cavern #1 handles incidental releases with their own personnel or by Robinson Refinery ERT.  Robinson Refinery Security Operations Center maintains a response matrix for managing emergency response to the Robinson Cavern #1.  To manage emergency response activities, Robinson Cavern #1 provides the Robinson Fire Department a facility tour and update briefing as requested.\r\n\r\n1.7 Planned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nRobinson Cavern #1 constantly strives to improve the safety of its operations through periodic safety reviews, the incident investigation program, and soliciting safety suggestions from employees. Robinson Cavern #1 resolves all findings from PHAs, some of which result in modifications to the process."

The findings are forwarded to Robinson Cavern #1 management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.\r\n\r\n1.4 Chemical-specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nThe process at Robinson Cavern #1 has hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation. The accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all EPA RMP-covered processes at the Robinson Cavern #1. Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios of flammable substances caused by equipment failures or human errors.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the accident prevention program activities, Robinson Cavern #1 has safety features in many areas to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of a release. The following types of safety features are used:\r\n\r\nRelease Detection\r\n\r\nHazardous atmosphere detectors throughout the process piping areas\r\n\r\nFire Detection Eyes monitoring the cavern domes and Knock Out Drum 1\r\n\r\nRelease Containment/Control\r\n\r\nProcess relief valves that discharge to the refinery flare system to capture and incinerate process materials to prevent over pressure damage to equipment\r\n\r\nManual and automatic valves to permit isolation of the process\r\n\r\nAutomated shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high level, high temperature)\r\n\r\nRedundant equipment and instrumentation where needed (e.g., uninterruptible power supply for some critical"

This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented. Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change. Affected chemical hazard information, process technology information, and equipment information, as well as procedures are updated to incorporate these changes. In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided with any necessary training on the change.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation\r\n\r\nRobinson Cavern #1 promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury. The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team, which may include contractors, documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to Robinson Cavern #1 management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete.

Written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training. Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended, and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels). If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or a management of change team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\r\n\r\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance.

In addition, Robinson Cavern #1 evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor. Robinson Cavern #1 personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to insure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\r\n\r\nPre-startup Safety Review\r\n\r\nRobinson Cavern #1 conducts a pre-startup safety review for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information (not required for replacement in kind). The purpose of the review is to ensure safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service. This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.

New employees receive orientation training, which includes, but is not limited to, the following topics: Process Overview, Employee Involvement, General Safety Rules, Safe Work Permit, Lockout/Tagout, and Blinding and Line Breaking. After successfully completing this training, an Robinson Cavern #1 Operator Trainee is paired with a qualified Robinson Cavern #1 Operator to learn process specific duties and tasks. Trainees spend time with all qualified Robinson Cavern #1 Operators before training is complete. After trainees demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, the trainee's performance and knowledge are reviewed by qualified Robinson Cavern #1 Operators and a vote is taken to determine if he/she is qualified to operate the Robinson Cavern Facility.\r\n\r\nIn addition, all Robinson Cavern #1 Operators periodically receive refresher training on operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.

Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the recommendations is documented and retained.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\n\r\nRobinson Cavern #1 maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. Procedures are periodically reviewed by a designated group of operations personnel and annually certified by the Robinson Operations Specialist as current and accurate. Procedures are kept current by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made to the process. In addition, the Robinson Cavern #1 operating procedures provide guidance on how to respond to events that result in exceeding safe operating limits for specific process or equipment parameters. The written operating procedures are readily available to the on-duty Robinson Cavern #1 Operator and for other personnel"

For specific process areas, Robinson Cavern #1 has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in the Robinson Cavern #1 Operations Manual. Robinson Cavern #1 ensures that the process is maintained within these limits by using process controls and monitoring instruments, operating procedures, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\r\n\r\nRobinson Cavern #1 also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis\r\n\r\nRobinson Cavern #1 has a comprehensive Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) program to help ensure that hazards associated with the process are identified and controlled. Within this program, the covered process and any future processes are systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage those hazards.\r\n\r\nRobinson Cavern #1 primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform this evaluation. HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques available. The analysis is conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as recommends accident prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\r\n\r\nThe PHA report is forwarded to the MPL Stoy Area Manager"

Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team, incident investigation, and compliance audit teams. Employees have access to all information created as part of Robinson Cavern #1's accident prevention program. Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained online and is available to all personnel. In addition, Robinson Cavern #1 has a number of initiatives that address process safety and employee safety issues. These initiatives include teams which promote both process and personal safety, such as the monthly Safety and Operations Meetings with management and hourly employees. Management groups typically have members with various areas of expertise, including operations, maintenance, and management.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\n\r\nRobinson Cavern #1 keeps a variety of technical documents at the Robinson Cavern #1 that are used to help maintain safe operation of the process. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. Specific Robinson Cavern #1 Operations personnel are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information. A table summarizing the reference documents and their location is readily available as part of the MPL Document Management System to help employees locate any necessary process safety information.\r\n\r\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in safety data sheets (SDSs).

Robinson Cavern #1 utilizes engineering controls, inspection programs, and detailed procedures as a means to prevent accidental releases. In the event of a release, Robinson Refinery, as primary monitoring resource for Robinson Cavern #1, is instructed to communicate with Crawford County 911 dispatch to initiate Robinson Fire Department response.  Robinson Refinery ERT is dispatched via automatic aid with Robinson Fire Department.  MPL employees have coordinated emergency response to the facility with the Robinson Fire Department and Robinson Refinery ERT.\r\n\r\n1.2 Robinson Cavern #1 Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nRobinson Cavern #1 is a butane storage facility with an underground mined storage cavern. The storage cavern is used to store butane, for use in MPL's Robinson, IL refinery. The butane is covered under the RMP rule and is present at the Robinson Cavern #1 above the EPA threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds.\r\n\r\nRobinson Cavern #1 does not have any toxic substances regulated by the RMP rule in sufficient quantity to be covered by the RMP rule for toxic substances.\r\n\r\n1.3 Accidental Release Prevention Program\r\n\r\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the Robinson Cavern Facility. Because the process at the Robinson Cavern #1 that is regulated by the RMP rule is also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) process safety management (PSM) standard, and because the OSHA PSM requirements are very similar to the EPA RMP requirements, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements. The PSM program at this facility has been extended by the Robinson Cavern #1, where necessary, to satisfy EPA's Program Level 3 accident prevention program requirements.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\n\r\nRobinson Cavern #1 encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety manag"
