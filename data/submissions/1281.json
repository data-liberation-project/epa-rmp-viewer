      "SummaryText": "The Industrial and Domestic Water Treatment Plant (I&D) has been providing potable water since 1947.  As part of the treatment process I&D uses chlorine for disinfection at a rate ranging from 500 lbs. per day to as much as 1500 lbs. per day depending on demand and source water quality.  The chlorine is received by truck in 2000 lbs. containers.  In 1997, I&D completed the construction and commissioning of a new chlorine storage and handling facility.  Design of the new facility included the option of withdrawing the chlorine either in the liquid or gasous state.  Withdrawing the chlorine in the liquid state allows the number of containers required to be open to be limited to two.  By minimizing the number of open containers, the risk and magnitude of a potential release is also minimized.  The facility is also equipped with multiple chlorine leak detectors and a Supervisory Control and Data Aquisition System (SCADA).  The SCADA system allows plant operations personnel to monitor the status of many functional and safety systems during operation.  In February, 1999, I&D completed its \"Program 2\" - Risk Management Plan (RMP) in accordance with section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act.  Although, I&D is not subject to the OSHA process safety management standard, the RMP was developed using the general structure of 29 CFR 1910.119.  The RMP includes the following 14 elements: 1) Introduction, 2) Employee Involvement, 3) Process Safety Information, 4) Process Hazard Analysis, 5) Operating Procedures and Practices, 6) Employee Training, 7) Contractor Information, 8) Pre-Startup Safety, 9) Mechanical Integrity, 10) Non-routine Work Authorization, 11) Change Management, 12) Incident Investigation, 13) Emergency Preparedness, 14) Compliance Audits.  It is not intended that the information provided within these elements be all-inclusive for every conceivable scenario.  However, it is the intent of the plan to provide a systematic approach to defining, understanding, operating, mai"

Although highly unlikely, the bases for this scenario is the requirement of 40 CFR '68.25 for the entire contents of the largest full container on site to completely empty its contents within a 10 minute period.\n\nThe distance to the toxic endpoint of the \"worst-case\" release scenario has been determined to be 5.7 miles from the I&D Water Treatment Plant\n\n    Alternate Release Scenario\n\nWith regard to the possibility that any release of chlorine gas could occur at the I&D Water Treatment Plant, the \"alternate\" scenario has been determined to be a shearing off of a 1/4 inch I.D. flexible connector between the container and manifold.

In addition, work performed on equipment subject to cause a release requires a minimum of two personnel.  Personnel are also required to wear Self Contained breathing Apparatus throughout the course of work associated with chlorination equipment.  Critical work on the chlorination system has also been limited to the regular 8 hour work day to insure that sufficient personnel are immediately available should a release occur.\n\nSince 1995, only one accidental release of chlorine gas has occurred.  During the construction of the new chlorine facility in 1997, the contractor failed to remove all of the air inside a new pipe line prior to pressure testing.  At approximately 100 psi, the new line failed.  The failure was violent enough to damage an adjacent chlorine solution line.  Nearby staff closed the chlorine containers and stopped the chlorinators within approximately one minute.  The concentration of chlorine in the solution line was approximately 0.02 percent by weight and the broken line released approximately 0.5 pounds of chlorine.  While rushing in to assist in the repair of the line, a contractor's employee was injured by inhalation of residual chlorine vapors.  The employee was taken to the hospital and released two days later.  To reduce the risk of such events from occurring in the future, all work on or around the chlorine system is required to be performed under the watch of I&D plant personnel.\n\nThe Risk Management Plan has been issued to the Chatham Emergency Management Agency and coordinated with the Haz-mat division of the Savannah Fire Department.
