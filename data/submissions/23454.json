Pierce, Florida\nExecutive Summary\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nAllied Universal Corporation's accidental release risk management plan involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and maintenance and management practices.  The elements of the plan are intended to prevent and minimize the accidental releases of extremely hazardous substances (chlorine, anhydrous ammonia and sulfur dioxide) used on site.  The Allied facility emergency response program involves the preparation of response plans that are tailored to the facility and the emergency response services available in the community.  Allied's emergency response program is in compliance with the EPA and OSHA Emergency Response Program requirements and is modeled after the One Plan.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE FACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nAllied Universal Corporation repackages chlorine and sulfur dioxide into 150-pound cylinders and one ton containers.  In addition, chlorine is utilized by Allied to manufacturer 10.5%-15% (by weight) sodium hypochlorite, and sulfur dioxide is utilized to manufacturer 40% (by weight) sodium bisulfite.  The facility includes a sidetrack for unloading 90-ton chlorine and sulfur dioxide railcars. A production building is used for packaging the cylinders and ton containers and for sodium hypochlorite and sodium bisulfite production.  All instrument controls for the chlorine and sulfur dioxide railcar unloading, cylinder and ton container packaging and sodium bisulfite production are located in the packaging building. The instrument controls for sodium hypochlorite manufacturing is located in the sodium hypochlorite manufacturing area.  Anhydrous ammonia is stored onsite in a 12,000-gallon aboveground storage tank.  Anhydrous ammonia is repackaged into 150-pound cylinders.  The facility is staffed during all hours of operations.\n\nBased upon the program criteria as set forth in the Risk Manageme"

      "SummaryText": "nt Rule, including EPA's definition of a covered process, the chlorine, ammonia and sulfur dioxide processes at this facility are subject to Program 3 planning.\n\nWORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nAn offsite consequence analysis was conducted that included consideration of two chlorine and one sulfur dioxide release scenarios, identified as worst-case release and/or alternative scenario.  The worst-case scenario is defined by EPA, which states that the owner shall assume that the maximum quantity in the largest vessel is released as a gas over 10 minutes, due to an unspecified failure.  Because the probability of such a release occurring is very remote, an alternative scenario, defined as more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario, was also analyzed.\n\nAtmospheric dispersion modeling was performed to determine the distance traveled by the chlorine and sulfur dioxide releases before its concentration decreases to the toxic endpoint selected by EPA.  The American Industrial Hygiene Association defines toxic endpoint as the maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms which could impair an individual's ability to take protective action.  \n\nThe worst-case release scenario at Allied's Ft. Pierce facility involves the failure of a 90-ton railcar of sulfur dioxide. Although Allied utilizes numerous administrative controls and active mitigation systems to minimize the consequences of such a release, no credit was taken for any mitigating factors in calculating the extent of the release.  This is in accordance to the EPA Risk Management Program worst-case scenario requirements (40 CFR \u00a768.25).   \n\nFor sulfur dioxide, when atmospheric dispersion modeling for the worst case scenario was performed using the RMP Guidance Program for Wastewater Treatment Plants, the distance"

An estimate of residential population potentially affected of 162,515 was obtained using current census data.  \n\nThe alternative release scenario for sulfur dioxide involves the rupture of the flexible connections connected to the chlorine railcar, possibly due to human error, overpressurization or split or uncoupling due to equipment failure.   The amount of chlorine released is 8000 lb., at an average rate over five minutes (duration of the release) at 1600 lb./min (RMP Guidance Program for Wasterwater Treatment Plants).  Using RMP*Comp, the toxic endpoint distance of 0.6 miles was calculated, and an estimate of residential population potentially affected of 0 was obtained using the most recent census data. \n\nThe quantity of sulfur dioxide released would be mitigated by actuation of the actuator valve between the railcar unloading hose and the railcar valves.  Sulfur dioxide gas detectors are located in the area, and will sound an alarm if sulfur dioxide is released.  An additional mitigation system is the remote emergency shut-off valves installed at the facility.  Shut-off valves automatically stop the flow of chlorine from the railcar.  This will reduce significantly the amount of sulfur dioxide release in the case of a flexible connection rupture.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for chlorine involves the rupture of the flexible connections connected to the chlorine railcar, possibly due to human error, overpressurization or split or uncoupling due to equipment failure.   The amount of chlorine released is 1250 lb., at an average rate over five minutes (duration of the release) at 240 lb./min (Estimating the Area Affected by Chlorine Release, ed. 3; Chlorine Institute Pamphlet 74, Chlorine Institute: April, 1998).

The operators wear escape respirators and eye protection during connection/disconnection of the chlorine supply and movement of the one-ton containers of sulfur dioxide.  Employees are trained on the hazards and toxic properties of chlorine and sulfur dioxide, presence of the gas detectors, equipment design and specifications and proper and safe handling procedures.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nOne accidental release of chlorine occurred at the Ft. Pierce, Florida facility October 20, 1999.  As required by law, the chlorine release was reported to the U.S. National Response Center and the Florida State Warning Point.  There were no deaths, and only one public responder was injured.  Facility personnel were evacuated.  Both facility personnel and public emergency responders responded to and stopped the chlorine release.  It was determined that a one ton container valve had failed.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe facility has an emergency response plan, which has been reviewed and updated in April of 2001.  The plan includes the following elements: \n\n\u00b7 description of chlorine properties,\n\u00b7 recommended first aid for chlorine exposures,\n\u00b7 a list of all emergency equipment onsite and where such equipment is located, \n\u00b7 list of onsite and offsite emergency response personnel and contact numbers, \n\u00b7 detailed description of company personnel, \n\u00b7 government agencies that must be contacted in the event of a release, \n\u00b7 procedures for handling the release, \n\u00b7 evacuation plans,\n\u00b7 rescue of any personnel overcomed by chlorine, anhydrous ammonia and sulfur dioxide.  \n\nThe remainder of the emergency response plan describes the training program for onsite emergency response personnel and the requirement for the conducting of emergency drills annually to evaluate tr"

The actuator is installed between the flex hose and the angle valves on the chlorine and sulfur dioxide railcar.  These valves, when actuated, would prevent a release of chlorine and sulfur dioxide from the railcar at any point in the process.  Railcar platforms were installed at the chlorine and sulfur dioxde railcars to provide easy and safe access to the railcar manway during emergencies.  In addition, a chlorine, sulfur dioxide and sodium bisulfite scrubbing system has been installed for the chlorine and sulfur dioxide packaging building and bisuflite production tanks.\n\nAmmonia scrubbing system has been installed.  Gas detection alarms as well as a roof to cover the ammonia storage tank have been planned for purchase and installation by the end of 2001."
