Thrive Freeze Dry facilities dry everything from bulk ingredients to enzymes and probiotics to freeze-dried meals and dog treats. This facility also has the capability to store finished goods in freezer rooms prior to shipment.\nAnhydrous ammonia is utilized in chambers as part of the freeze-dry process as well as maintain blast freezer and freezer room temperatures. Process 1 is a two-stage, closed loop, mechanical refrigeration system. Anhydrous ammonia is used as the refrigerant in the Thrive Freeze Dry refrigeration system and is the only regulated substance.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\nThrive Freeze Dry has implemented the Process Safety Management (PSM) rules and regulations to prevent or minimize accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. The prevention program consists of mechanical integrity, safe operating parameters of process equipment, and training measures for personnel operating or maintaining the covered process to name a few. Additional details of the prevention program are detailed below.\n\n\u0095 Process Safety Information\nMaintain current and complete refrigeration system technical and equipment information.

Thrive Freeze Dry investigates releases and near misses that could have resulted in a release of anhydrous ammonia. Recommendations are addressed and corrected by facility management. Reports are kept for five years.\n\n\u0095 Training\nThrive Freeze Dry certifies operators following completion of operator training and confirmation of the operator's ability to apply what they have learned. Refrigeration operators are given initial training on hazards of anhydrous ammonia, an overview of the Thrive Freeze Dry refrigeration system, and emergency operations to name a few. To ensure compliance with the procedures, refresher training is conducted as required. Where possible, training utilizes direct experience in the field to facilitate task understanding and address multiple learning methods.\n\n\u0095 Employee Participation\nThrive Freeze Dry employees help to improve and maintain the prevention program in multiple ways. Refrigeration operators participate in the process hazard analysis by providing system expertise. Refrigeration operators help develop operating procedures as well as ensure they reflect the true operating instruction.
