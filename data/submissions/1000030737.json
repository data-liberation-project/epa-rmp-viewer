      "SummaryText": "FACILITY DESCRIPTION\n\nThe North Texas Municipal Water District is a Wylie entity that treats water, wastewater, and solid waste for four counties in the north Texas area. The Wylie Water Plant is located in Wylie, Texas at 810 North Highway 78. The facility is owned and operated by the North Texas Municipal Water District (NTMWD).\n\n\n\nCOMPLIANCE\n\nNTMWD maintains compliance with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (USEPA) regulations for the prevention and mitigation of accidental releases of extremely hazardous substances under section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act.   Facilities covered by the regulations (40 CFR 68) are required to implement a risk management program and submit a description of the program (called a risk management plan, or RMP) to USEPA.  \n\n\n\nThe Wylie Water Treatment Plant (WTP) falls under this regulation because of the onsite storage and use of chlorine and ammonia.  The amounts stored for both chemicals exceed the threshold limits specified by the USEPA, thereby making the facility subject to compliance with the regulation.  \n\n\n\nNTMWD first submitted a RMP for the Wylie WTP to USEPA in 1999.  RMPs must be updated and resubmitted to USEPA every five (5) years.  RMPs must also be updated and resubmitted due to any change that requires a revised hazard review or a revised off-site consequence analysis. \n\n\n\nThe Wylie WTP is resubmitting their RMP in 2012 due to changes in the processes that required an updated Hazard Review.  The following information summarizes the 2012 update and resubmission:\n\n\n\nREGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Wylie Water Treatment Plant uses chlorine combined with ammonia to disinfect water.  Water is treated at the plant and subsequently pumped into the distribution network of pipelines, pump stations, and storage tanks.\n\n\n\n1. Chlorine\n\nWTP Plant II has a maximum storage quantity of 720,000 tons of chlorine.  The chlorine is stored in two to four Department of Transportation certified 90-ton rail cars.

A release of chlorine gas could potentially occur at the chlorine storage area or at the chlorine process areas.\n\n\n\n2. Anhydrous Ammonia\n\nWTP Plant I has a maximum storage quantity of 38,760 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  Anhydrous ammonia is stored two, 3,800 gallon tanks. The total amount of anhydrous ammonia exceeds the threshold limit of 10,000 pounds set by the USEPA.  \n\n\n\nWTP Plant II has a maximum storage quantity of 93,840 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.

      "SummaryText": ", NTMWD updated the offsite consequence analyses at the Wylie WTP by identifying and documenting a worst case scenario (chlorine) and an alternate release scenario for chlorine and ammonia.   EPAs RMP*Comp and other guidance were used as the model for the resubmission.  \n\n\n\nThe results of this review are documented and are maintained as part of the RMP records.  Any changes resulting from this review are reported in this resubmission.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe Wylie WTP was reviewed for the period from November 2010 through November 2015.  During this period of time, two accidental releases of chlorine that qualify for inclusion in the Five Year Accident History. Both incidents occurred in January 2015, and involved minor employee exposures to chlorine gas. In each case, the employee was sent to the emergency room for observation and both were cleared to return to work. Because each employee was issued a prescription for an inhaler medication, the accident would qualify as an OSHA Recordable Injury.\n\n\n\nThe exposures occurred within the containment building used to house the chlorine tank cars and the releases were mitigated by the scrubber system. No chlorine gas escaped the building.\n\n\n\nPREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe NTMWD maintains a consistent accidental release prevention program to eliminate or minimize releases of chlorine and anhydrous ammonia at the Wylie WTP.  The program consists of seven elements:\n\n\n\n1. Safety Information\n\nNTMWD has maintained information concerning process chemicals, technology, and equipment as part of their risk management program at the Wylie WTP.  The information is made available to employees and contractors at the Wylie WTP who will work in the chlorine and ammonia process area.  Emergency response planners can also use the information to develop training programs and procedures.\n\n\n\n2. Hazard Review\n\nA hazard review of chlorine and ammonia processes and procedures is conducted at least every five (5) years to evaluate potential c"

In May 2012 a revised chlorine and ammonia process hazard analysis using the \"What-If/Checklist\" method was conducted by the Wylie WTP plant management and staff familiar with the process, operation, and maintenance.  Existing precautions were reviewed and determined to be adequate.  Potential changes in operating, maintenance, and other process safety management procedures that could further improve the overall safety of the chlorine and ammonia systems were identified.\n\n\n\nThe results of this review are documented and are maintained as part of the RMP records.  \n\n\n\n3. Operating procedures\n\nNTMWD have developed and implemented written operating procedures that provide instructions and step for conducting activities associated with the chlorine and ammonia processes at the Wylie WTP consistent with the safety information. Wylie WTP operating procedures include startup, shutdown, and emergency operating procedures, and describe how the system should be operated in order to minimize the chances of an accidental release. The procedures also emphasize safety considerations during operation and address hazardous situations that can occur and how to correct them.\n\n\n\n4. Training\n\nAll the Wylie WTP staff currently involved in chlorine and ammonia processes have been trained in the classroom and/or during on-the-job training in an overview of the processes and in the operating procedures, as is new staff assigned to the processes.  Training includes emphasis on safety and health, hazards, emergency operations including shutdown, and safe work practices.  Refresher training is provided at least every three years to ensure the Wylie WTP staff understands and adheres to current operating procedures.  \n\n\n\n5.

The program addresses equipment testing, inspection, and preventive maintenance schedules, and documentation of equipment testing, inspection, and preventive and corrective maintenance activities. \n\n\n\n6. Compliance audits\n\nUSEPA's risk management rule requires that the Wylie WTP complete a compliance audit for its risk management program at least once every 3 years. The primary goals of conducting a compliance audit are to verify compliance with risk management rule requirements and good process safety practices, identify process safety or program deficiencies and develop corrective actions, and increase safety awareness among Wylie WTP staff.  \n\n\n\nThe Wylie WTP plant management and staff familiar with the processes operation and maintenance conducted an audit in May 2012. The results of this audit, in addition to recommendations made, are documented and are maintained as part of the RMP records. \n\n\n\n7. Incident Investigation\n\nThe Wylie WTP management investigates each incident that resulted in or could reasonably have resulted in a catastrophic release of chlorine or ammonia. A process to identify the underlying causes of incidents and implement procedures for preventing similar events has been developed. \n\n\n\nAn incident investigation team will be established following criteria established in the Wylie WTP risk management program.  As part of the investigation, an incident report will be prepared to recommend system changes (i.e., operational modifications, additional training and competency requirements), to prevent a similar incident from occurring in the future. The incident investigation report and any changes resulting from the report will be reviewed with all staff members who operate and maintain the applicable system.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\n\nAn Emergency Response Plan (ERP) has been developed for the Wylie WTP, which provides specific emergency response procedures "
