      "SummaryText": "The water treatment plant (WTP) in Unalaska, Alaska stores and uses chlorine, a regulated substance by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA).  A maximum of thirty (30) 150 lb cylinders are stored at the facility for a total of 4,500 lbs of chlorine.  The chlorine cylinders are co-located and interconnected, which qualifies as a process subject to the Risk Management Program (RMP) developed by the EPA.  Chlorine is stored over the threshold value of 2,500 lbs listed for the RMP rule, and 1,500 lbs listed for Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation.\n\nCHLORINE STORAGE PROCESS ASSIGNED AS PROGRAM LEVEL 2\nOnce it was determined that chlorine cylinder storage was considered a process at the facility, the next step in the RMP development was assigning a program level.  For this, modeling of a worst-case release was performed using RMP Comp, an off-site consequence analysis software developed by the EPA.\n\nThe modeling determined North Pacific Fuel (commonly referred to as Crowley) and Rowland Iron Works, each with housing units are public receptors within the distance to the endpoint for a worst-case release.  The worst-cast scenario was defined as release of chlorine from 1 cylinder (150 lb) for a 10 minute duration using a wind speed of 1.5 meters per second set by the EPA.  The release was modeled in an enclosed space with direct contact with the outside air.  The WTP is located in a remote and uninhabited area, so rural surroundings was assigned for the topography.  \n\nThe facility is not subject to the OSHA PSM standard because it qualifies for an exemption for normally unoccupied remote facilities. \n\nSince there are public receptors that could be impacted during a worst-case release and the process was exempt from the PSM standard- a Program 2 level was assigned to chlorine storage at the Unalaska WTP.\n\nWATER TREATMENT AND CHLORINE STORAGE\nUnalaska\u00bfs economy is based on commercial fishing, fish process"

The community enjoys a strategic position as the center of a rich fishing area and for transshipment of cargo between Pacific Rim trading partners.  There are 10 major docks in Unalaska, to support the processing and trade activities.  The island operates 6 fish processing facilities to process commercial catches.  Between the industrial and domestic users, the community treats and distributes over 1 billion gallons of water each year.\n\nWater treatment is provided at the Pyramid Control Plant.  The treatment plant is located in a remote and uninhabited area in the mountains approximately 2 miles south of the developed town site.  Access to the site during the winter is unreliable. As such, the facility requires extra chlorine storage to protect against a scenario where employees would be unable to travel to the treatment building to replace empty chlorine cylinders.  \n\nWater treatment consists of providing chlorine for disinfection before distribution.  The treatment building serves as storage for the chlorine gas cylinders.  Operators typically perform routine checks at the plant twice per week- once for 20 minutes and once for 2 hours.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION \nTo protect against the accidental release of chlorine, the following safety and engineering controls for the storage area are in place:\n- an evacuation fan connected to a gas monitor with local and remote alarms\n- a sprinkler system for the building\n- posted signs warning of the presence of chlorine\n- chains for the cylinders to prevent tipping accidents\n- vapor tight caps on the valve threads for empty and full cylinders\n- fall protection caps on each cylinder not in use at the facility  \n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nAn emergency action plan was developed for the water utility in 2004.  The plan outlines procedures for the response to various emergency scenarios which may impact the ability of the water utility to deliver"

The following paragraphs summarize the goals and procedures developed in the emergency action plan.  \n\nCoordination: Emergency response procedures have been coordinated with the local fire department and Public Safety Department.  However, the fire department does not have a HAZMAT team to respond to major chlorine leaks, so the water treatment operators are designated as the first responders for the repair and response to a chlorine release.\n\nTraining: Employees are trained via-in house training at least twice a year on the various aspects for chlorine use and handling.  The entire staff is also 40-hr Hazardous Waste Operator and Emergency Response (HAZWOPER) certified and maintains the annual 8-hour refresher course.  The staff is trained to use safety equipment which includes goggles, respirators, and self contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) suits and kits for use when responding to a chlorine release.\n\nDrills: On the job and hands-on training begins after safety material has been covered.\n\nPublic notification: Evacuations of the water treatment plant facility and the Crowley facility would be coordinated with the Public Safety Department, and City emergency responders.  The procedure for public notification of a boil water notice would be initiated if warranted.\n\nAlert systems:  The water treatment plant is equipped with a gas monitor which activates an evacuation fan and local and remote alarms.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nTo date there have been no recorded incidents pertaining to the storage of chlorine at the facility.\n\nPREVENTION PROGRAM AND PLANNED IMPROVEMENTS\nAs a result of the RMP submission, a hazard review was completed, operation and maintenance procedures were reviewed, and a compliance audit was conducted for the water treatment plant facility.\n\nThe major hazards that were identified for the facility incl"

To address the hazards identified, several process controls are in use at the facility.  These process controls include: manual shutoffs for the chlorine equipment; chlorine gas detectors and alarms to alert employees of a release; emergency power to maintain essential equipment in the event of a power outage; and emergency air supply for employees in the event of a chlorine leak.  The water treatment plant also has a sprinkler system.  The facility will be replacing the chlorinators at the plant by June 10, 2006.  As part of this project, the facility will assess the need for additional fire protection in the chlorine room.\n\nThe staff has also recently reviewed the operating procedures for the water treatment plant.  Classroom and on the job training is provided to educate employees on the use, handling, and storage of chlorine at the facility.  Employees must demonstrate an understanding of the training and pass oral tests during the classroom training sessions.  No changes to the operating procedures were recommended from the review.\n\nAs part of the maintenance review the regulators, tubing, manifolds, rotometer, injectors, pumps, scales, and alarms were all inspected or tested in late November, 2005.  Inspections are performed on a scheduled and ongoing basis.\n\nA water master plan was completed in 2004 which identified the need for gas cabinets in the storage area and emergency shutoff valves installed on each chlorine cylinder.  These process controls are scheduled to be purchased and installed by November 2007.  The water master plan was used as a compliance audit for the purposes of the RMP submission."
