Chlorine is a hazardous substance that must be handled properly in order to prevent accidental releases and injuries. It is the policy of the 5N Plus, Inc. (5N Plus) facility located in Fairfield, Connecticut to conduct all operations (including the gallium trichloride system) in a safe manner. This policy extends to all employees and contractors at the facility.\n\n\n\n5N Plus implements this policy towards chemical and general safety through ongoing employee participation, training, written operating procedures, maintenance, inspections, safety committee meetings, and safety reviews/evaluations. These programs are in effect at the facility to prevent the accidental release of chlorine. In the event of an chlorine accident, the facility has an Emergency Action Plan to notify the appropriate authorities and safely evacuate the facility.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\n\n5N Plus is located at 515 Commerce Drive, in Fairfield, Connecticut. The area immediately surrounding the facility is urban with a mixture of light commercial and industrial areas. The chlorine equipment (cylinders, cabinets, etc.), as part of the overall gallium trichloride system, was constructed in accordance with applicable federal, state, and local regulations.\n\n\n\nThe primary business and mission of 5N Plus facility is to sustainably develop, produce and commercialize specialty metal and chemical products tailored to meet customer requirements. The facility operates the gallium trichloride process utilizing a maximum of approximately 5,000 pounds of chlorine, a regulated substance. The gallium trichloride process, consisting of cylinders, reactors, tubing, valves, and scrubbers, flows chlorine gas into various reactors containing gallium metal to create gallium trichloride.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AN"

      "SummaryText": "D CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nIn order to operate the gallium trichloride process safely, the facility complies with the following risk management regulations:\n\n\n\n1) OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM)\n\n2) EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP)\n\n\n\nThese regulations impose numerous requirements on the facility to ensure the safety of the public and onsite workers. The following summarizes the key compliance programs that have been implemented by 5N Plus to prevent the accidental release of chlorine from the facility. The Operating Procedures program ensures that the chlorine equipment is operated in a safe manner. The Training program ensures that personnel fully understand how to perform their jobs in a safe manner. The Mechanical Integrity program ensures that the chlorine equipment and gallium trichloride process equipment is in proper working condition based upon routine testing, inspections, and maintenance according to manufacturer's specifications and industry standards. The Management of Change program ensures that process modifications are implemented in a safe manner. The Pre-Startup Safety Review program ensures that adequate safety measures are in place before chlorine is introduced into a new or modified process. The Hot Work Permit program ensures that 5N Plus's employees and contractors perform hot work (e.g. welding on or around the chlorine equipment) in a safe manner. The Contractor Safety program ensures that contractors understand the hazards of chlorine and must take specified precautions to safely complete job requirements.\n\n\n\nIt is important to note that the chlorine equipment and gallium trichloride process equipment has been designed with several safety features to prevent the accidental release of chlorine. For example, the chlorine cabinets are equipped with safety mechanisms that will stop the flow of chlorine if conditions exceed designated safety limits. The facility has also installed chlorine sensors at strategic locations thro"

When the detectors alarm at 2 ppm and 3 ppm, they terminate the supply of chlorine to the processing area in which the detection occurred. This prevents the quantity released from escalating. \n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThere have been no releases of chlorine that exceeded the reportable quantity of 10 pounds within the last five years (October 2006 - October 2011). In addition, there have been no injuries resulting from any chlorine release.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe facility has an Emergency Action Plan (plan) in effect at the facility. This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n- save lives;\n\n- minimize and avoid injuries;\n\n- protect the environment; and\n\n- minimize property damage.\n\n\n\nSince facility personnel will not respond to a chlorine release at the facility that poses a health or safety threat, the Plan provides the notification procedures and evacuation routes for emergencies that may arise at the facility. This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations. Facility personnel receive annual training regarding the emergency evacuation procedures.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nThe Process Hazard Analysis, performed in four separate sessions on July 15, 20, and 29, and September 8, 2011, generated mitigation measures (recommendations) to improve safety at the 5N Plus facility located in Fairfield, Connecticut. The mitigation measures include additional training, development of additional operating procedures, key maintenance-related tests/inspection, and enhanced emergency response policies and procedures. The 5N Plus safety committee is completing these recommendations as a continual effort to provide a safe work environment for their employees. Recommendations resulting from the study have a due date of 12 months from the study or 9/8/2012.\n\n"
