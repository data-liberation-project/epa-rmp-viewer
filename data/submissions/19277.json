All applicable procedures of 40 CFR 68.170 are addressed in the\nplan, which seeks to provide for employee safety, public health and response agency\ninteraction.\nThe Town Creek Water Treatment Facility disinfects water pumped from the Ocmulgee\nRiver.  Chlorination processes include liquid chlorine cylinders, chlorination equipment,\ninstrumentation, electrical equipment, and process specific safety equipment.  \n\nThe chlorination process accidental release modeling was performed for the respective area\nto determine potential consequences associated with operating failures resulting in\naccidental chlorine release.  The first \"worst case\" scenario, defined by the EPA, states that\n\"the owner or operator will assume that the . . . maximum quantity in the largest vessel . . .\nis released as a gas more than ten (10) minutes.\"  The \"alternative scenario\" is \"more likely\nto occur than the worst-case release scenario.\"  The Town Creek Water Treatment Facility\nhas no accident history, since it is a new facility.\n\nIn each case, atmospheric dispersion modeling was performed to determine the distance\ntraveled by the chlorine released before its concentration decrease to a theoretical \"toxic\nendpoint.\"  This is defined by the American Industrial Hygiene Association as \"the\nmaximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals\ncould be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing life-threatening\nhealth effects.\"  The residential population within a perimeter corresponding to the toxic\nendpoint distance was defined to estimate the population potentially affected.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario for the Town Creek"
