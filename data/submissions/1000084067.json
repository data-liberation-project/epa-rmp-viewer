The facility implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of the hazardous substances. These controls include training programs for personnel; programs to help ensure safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the processes; and programs to evaluate the hazards at the facility.\n\n\n\nIn the event of an accidental release, the facility will control and contain the release in a manner that will be safe for workers and will help prevent injury to the public and/or the environment. The Naheola Mill provides response training for upset conditions to facility personnel, designates an incident commander to oversee response activities, and coordinates response efforts with the local emergency response organizations.\n\n\n\nIn order to effectively implement these policies, the facility has established a management system directed by the Vice President/Mill Manager.\n\n\n\n2.0    THE NAHEOLA MILL & ITS REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nMILL DESCRIPTION\n\n\n\nThe Naheola Mill manufactures, among other products, tissue, towels and paper board and pulp. It is located on the Tombigbee River near Pennington, Alabama. \n\n\n\n\n\nHardwood and Softwood pulps are bleached using chlorine dioxide.\n\nMost processes operate 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and 52 weeks a year.   Portions of the production equipment are shut down periodically for maintenance or cleaning.  The entire facility is generally shut down only once per year for maintenance.\n\n\n\nSUBSTANCES & PROCESSESS REGULATED UNDER RMP\n\n\n\nThe Naheola Mill stores one chemical above the threshold limits of 40 CFR 68.130.  A summary of the RMP-regulated processes and substances is given below.  \n\n\n\nChlorine Dioxide Generator and Associated Chlorine Dioxide"

      "SummaryText": " Storage:  An R8 process is used to generate chlorine dioxide on-site for subsequent use in the pulp mill.  In this process, methanol is added to a heated solution of sodium chlorate and sulfuric acid in a reaction vessel which is under a vacuum.  The resultant chlorine dioxide gas is absorbed in cold water and then stored at strengths of 0.95% - 1.25%..  RMP calculations were based on a strength of 1.3% as a conservative approach due to limitations set in the RMP eSumbit program.\n\n\n\n3.0    ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n    \n\n    Beginning in 1992, the facility formalized this prevention program for the Chlorine Dioxide Solution System to comply with the Occupational Safety and Health Process Safety Management (PSM) prevention program. In 1996, the EPA RMP rule established that a Program Level 3 Prevention Program would become a requirement for these processes as well. The facility's Program Level 3 Prevention Program under the RMP rule is essentially the same as the OSHA PSM Program, except that the program also focuses on protecting the public and the environment.\n\n    \n\nProgram Level 3 Prevention Program\n\n    The following sections briefly describe the elements of the Naheola Mill Program Level 3 Prevention Program that addresses the EPA RMP rule prevention program requirements for the Chlorine Dioxide Solution Systems.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n     PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n    \n\n INTRODUCTION\n\n    \n\n    At the Naheola Mill, the facility takes a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  The management systems address each of the key features of successful accident prevention programs including:\n\n    \n\n    ?    Process safety information (PSI)\n\n    ?    Process hazard analysis (PHA)\n\n    ?    Operating procedures (OP)\n\n    ?    Training (Trg)\n\n    ?    Mechanical integrity (MI)\n\n    ?    Management of change (MOC)\n\n    ?    Pre-startup review (PSSR)\n\n    ?    Compliance audits (CA)\n\n    ?    Incident investigation (II)\n\n    ?    Employee participation (EP)\n\n    ?    Hot work permits (HW)\n\n    ?    Contractors (Contr)\n\n    \n\n    The indi"

      "SummaryText": "vidual elements of the accident prevention program work together to prevent accidental chemical releases.  The company and employees are committed to the standard that these management systems set for the way the facility does business, and have specific accountabilities and controls to ensure that the facility is meeting their own high standards for accident prevention.\n\n    \n\n4.0    FIVE - YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n    \n\nNaheola Mill has demonstrated a good record of accident prevention.  There have been no RMP reportable accidental releases at the Naheola Mill during the past five years. \n\n    \n\n    5.0    EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nIn accordance with Sections 68.90 and 68.95 of the RMP rule, the Naheola Mill maintains an Emergency Response Plan. The Emergency Response Plan provides the essential planning for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations. Furthermore, the facility coordinates with applicable community emergency response plans and local responders.\n\n    \n\n    6.0    PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nGeorgia Pacific Naheola Operations has established safety procedures in place and plans to continue to develop and improve those safe work practices.\n\n\n\n\n\n"
