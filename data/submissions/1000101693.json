The Facility has a fixed inventory of pentane. Pentane is received by truck and stored in one 90,000-gallon pressurized storage vessel and subsequently injected into one gasoline pipeline.\r\n\r\nThe facility has 3 operators at a time that could be at the facility to operate the pentane system.  The remainder of the FTEs reported at the site are located at the facility buildings, but are not operating the pentane system. \r\n\r\nTwo requirements of this section specifically apply to operations at the Facility:\r\n\r\n1. Purpose and General Duty Clause - The essence of the general duty clause is that an owner/operator that stores and uses hazardous chemicals in any quantity has a fundamental obligation to ensure a safe operation and to have plans in place in the event of an accident to appropriately manage the situation.\r\n\r\nSunoco is committed to ensuring the safe operation of the Facility, as well as all of its other operations, to ensure a safe workplace for employees and a safe location for neighbors in the community. Sunoco has procedures in place to prevent accidents and is committed to emergency preparedness both for the Facility and community-wide and coordinates with the Berks County LEPC/West Side Regional Emergency Management Agency and the Township of Spring Fire Rescue Services.\r\n\r\n2. Risk Management Plan - The primary function of the Facility is to act as a flammable liquid storage and distribution facility. Due to\r\nthe flammable effects associated with pentane, it is necessary to observe certain safety precautions to prevent unnecessary human\r\nexposure, to reduce the threat to employee health, and to minimize t"
