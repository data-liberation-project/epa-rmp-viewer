Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies\n\nJohn Soules Foods is committed to both the safety of our employees and that of the surrounding public, including both human health and the environment.  Safety is ensured through careful prevention measures and emergency planning.  The intent of our Prevention Program is the minimization of all risks that could possibly lead to an accidental release.  This program focuses primarily on the mechanical integrity of the process equipment and the training of its operators.  The Emergency Response Plan focuses on minimizing the potential impacts of an accidental release.  This is done by coordinating emergency actions with the Red Springs Fire Department and ensuring that employees are trained on the proper response to an emergency situation.\n\n2.    The stationary source and regulated substances handled\n\n?    John Soules Foods is a meat processing facility\n?    The regulated substance at this plant is ammonia.  Ammonia is used as a refrigerant in the plant cooler and freezer system.\n?    The maximum quantity of ammonia stored at this facility is 63,000\n\n3.    The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario, including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario.\n\nWorst-Case Scenario: The event that was modeled was the complete evacuation of the High Pressure Receiver and Thermosyphon Reservoir (HPR-01), which can hold 23,000 lbs of Ammonia.  It is assumed that the entire contents are released as vapor over a ten minute time span and are subjected to a wind speed of 1.5 m/s with a stability class of F.  The distance to the toxic endpoint for the worst-case scenario is 2.74 miles, with 5,037 people within the affected radius.  \n\nAlternative Scenario: The lifting of a pressure relief valve on the high pressure receiver in the engine room.  Relief valves allow the escape of ammonia at a total flow rate of 100.2 lbs/min.  Weather conditions are assumed t"

The distance to this endpoint is 1,060 ft and extends beyond the facility boundary.  Based on the U.S. Census 2000, approximately 14 people live within this radius of the distance to the toxic endpoint.\n\n4.    The general accidental release prevention program and the specific prevention steps\n\nJohn Soules Foods believes that the best way to prevent an accidental release is by being proactive in its approach to safety.  This facility maintains information about the proper use of its equipment and the possible hazards.  By following set operating procedures and maintenance routines, the process equipment within the facility will continue to operate in optimum condition.  Additionally, the release prevention program is constantly being improved by sustained employee training and regular compliance audits.  Compliance with all applicable state codes and regulations ensures the continued safety of John Soules Foods.\n\n5.    Five year accident history\n\nIn the last five years, the John Soules Foods facility has not experienced a significant accidental ammonia release.\n\n6.    The emergency response program\n\nA well planned emergency response program can make a tremendous difference in the potential off-site impacts of an accidental release.  Swift, efficient actions can minimize the damage to both human population and the natural surroundings.  To this end, John Soules Foods has coordinated emergency response efforts with the Red Springs Fire Department and has instructed employees on the proper actions to take in the event of an accidental release.  John Soules Food maintains a well trained emergency response team and has a written emergency response plan which specifies the details of the actions that will be taken in the event of an accidental release.\n\n7.    Planned Changes to improve safety\n\nThere are no planned"
