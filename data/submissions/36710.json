Simplot Company facility at Lathrop, California.\n\na) Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies: \nThe J. R. Simplot Company Environmental policy (EN 01.1) states \"It is the policy of the J. R. Simplot Company to manufacture, handle, transport, store and dispose of all substances safely and in compliance with the requirements of federal, state and local environmental laws while reducing the risks to human health, safety and the environment.\" \n\nThe J.R. Simplot Company, Lathrop, California facility is committed to being a responsible community partner.  Emergency response planning and training is current and ongoing for all employees who handle hazardous materials. \n\nEvery effort is made to prevent accidental releases and, in the very unlikely event of a catastrophic release, to be prepared to keep offsite consequences to a minimum.  The local and county emergency offices are informed of all substances manufactured, stored, and handled at this facility, and we fully cooperate with all inspections and requests for information from the regulatory community. \n\nb) The stationary source and regulated substances handled:\nThe J. R. Simplot Company, Lathrop facility produces fertilizer, industrial chemicals, and feed supplements. Only two of the listed chemicals in 40 CFR 68.130, anhydrous ammonia and ammonium hydroxide, are processed, stored, and handled in quantities exceeding threshold limits for this report.\n\nc) The general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\nAnhydrous ammonia and ammonium hydroxide are used and stored in a small area of the plant and employees assigned to these areas are trained to understand the hazards involved and to handle them safely.  Employees receive initial training and an annual refresher appropriate to the job when hired or when re-assi"

The training includes methods to avoid accidental releases of hazardous materials, emergency response, safety, security, and spill control strategies. \n\nIn addition to training, the following precautions are taken in areas where ammonia is handled:\n\"    Pipes carrying anhydrous ammonia are clearly labeled and have pressure relief valves.  \n\"    Ammonia and ammonium hydroxide tanks are blocked to prevent vehicles from striking them.  Vehicle access permits required to enter any area handling hazardous materials.\n\"    Material specifications policy is in place to prevent replacing parts with inadequate material.\n\"    Scheduled work orders in the computerized maintenance management system serve as preventative maintenance tools to ensure storage and conveyance integrity, including ammonia tank testing and regular inspections.\n\"    Written design review procedures, used whenever changes are made to applicable equipment or piping, prevent failure due to improper engineering of modifications.\n\"    Line-breaking and hot work permits are required before starting work.\n\"    A thorough hazard analysis is performed before operating any new process that handles ammonia products. \n\nd) The five-year accident history:\nIn the specified time period, the Lathrop plant has had no accidental releases of ammonia or ammonium hydroxide with offsite consequences as defined by CFR 68.42.\n\ne) The emergency response program:\nThe J. R. Simplot Company, Lathrop facility has an emergency Hazardous Materials Response Team consisting of 35 employees (26 hourly, 5 supervisory, 4 management).  Training is conducted at least once each calendar year and in accordance with CAL-OSHA regulations.  The team uses the written Emergency Response Contingency Plan to plan for possible releases at the Lathrop site.  The plan contains instructions for responding to such an emergency including contacts with outside emergency response authorities, emergency response team and chain of command, procedures for evacuation, shut-dow"

The release of any regulated substance in a reportable quantity would be reported as required by law and emergency response coordinated with local authorities to ensure the safety and security of the community.\n\nf) Planned changes to improve safety:\nSafety rules and training are updated on a regular basis to assure that they continue to meet new applicable regulations and that they ensure an adequate level of safety and security for employees and visitors or contractors on the site.  Safety training is mandatory for all employees and refresher courses on all key areas are planned for each quarter. \n\nPlanned overall improvements include increased safety and security training at hourly and supervisory levels, and continuing review of the contractor safety program, with emphasis on safety and security in ammonia handling and associated areas.  \n\nThe J. R. Simplot Company, Lathrop plant, will continue to be vigilant in environmental compliance, safety, and security in all processes, plants, and equipment."
