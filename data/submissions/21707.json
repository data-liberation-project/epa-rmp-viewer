The Facility Policy\n     The owners, management, and employees of The Ellsworth Coop at Blackwolf are committed to the prevention of any accidential releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire company, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.  Facility Information\n     -The primary activity at the facility is the storage and marketing of grain.\n     -Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application for crop production nutrients.\n     -The maximum quantity stored would be 96,306 pounds in our two 11,000 gallon tanks.  \n\n3.  The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario\n     a.  The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank release as as gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 48,000  pounds, which represents the volume of the storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint is 1.5 miles.\n     b.  The alternative release scenario  is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200ppm) is .83 miles.\n\n4. The employees at our facility are trained in safety information, hazards, operating procedures and maintenance practices.  Employees always wear goggles and gloves while filling nurse tanks.  Clean safety water is always present during ammonia operations.\n\n5.  The Five-year Accident History\n     This facility is a new addition to the Ellsworth Coop and there have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia  that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge since operations have begun.\n\n6.  The emergency response program\n     -The facility has:\na.  A written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38;\nb."
