The property management company, G&K Management, utilizes the services of a professional refrigeration contractor, Mericle Mechanical to maintain and operate the ammonia refrigeration systems.  Regular checks are made of the systems to ensure it is functioning properly and in good repair.\n\n\n\nThe facility has an emergency evacuation plan that includes ammonia leaks.  If an ammonia leak or an alarm indicating an ammonia leak is observed by facility personnel, the decision to evacuate the building is made by management.  Professional emergency responders and the facility's professional refrigeration service firm are called to assist with the ammonia leak.  If an ammonia leak exceeds 25 parts per million in the engine rooms, an audible/visual alarm is triggered.  At 250 ppm all refrigeration equipment in the engine rooms is de-energized.\n\n\n\nThe management at G&K Management and CLW Foods are committed to safety.  The emergency action plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\n\nThe facility is located at 3425 East Vernon Avenue in Vernon, California, which is approximately 2.1 miles west of Interstate 710 and 1.7 miles southeast of the Interstate 5 - Interstate 10 - Highway 60 interchange. The area immediately surrounding the facility is urban.  The facility has four ammonia refrigeration systems on site.  The facility utilizes two independent ammonia refrigeration systems (BK West Medium Low Temp System and BK West Frigo System) for dock operations, process equipment, and cold storage.  The remaining two systems (CKE York System and CKE Frigo System) have been pumped down and are n"

The majority of the refrigeration equipment is located inside the engine rooms.  Each system is a closed loop refrigeration system similar to a residential refrigerator.  There are no emissions or planned releases of ammonia.\n\n\n\nThe maximum intended inventory of ammonia for the two operating systems is as follows:\n\n\n\nBK West Frigo System - 8,000 lbs.\n\nBK West Medium/Low Temp System - 3,350 lbs.\n\n\n\nNote: The BK West Frigo and the BK West Medium/Low Temp Systems are located in the same engine room on the west side of the facility.  The systems are co-located and are thus considered as one process.  The CKE Frigo and CKE York systems are pumped down but are still onsite.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nThe facility utilizes ammonia leak detectors that are located in the engine rooms and the loading dock and have the capability of: 1) triggering an audible/visual alarm, and 2) disabling electrical equipment in the engine room.  \n\n\n\nEach pressure vessel is equipped with pressure relief valves that automatically engage to vent excess pressure to protect the integrity of the vessel.  All pressure relief valves in the BK West refrigeration systems feed into a common header that vents into a diffusion tank.   \n\n\n\nThe refrigeration systems were designed in accordance with the codes applicable at the time of installation including the Uniform Mechanical Code, the Uniform Fire Code, ANSI/ASHRAE, and local City of Vernon building and electrical codes.\n\n\n\nIn the event of a power failure, ammonia operations would automatically shut down (solenoid valves close, compressors shut down, condenser fans and water pumps shut down, spiral freezers shut down, etc.), thereby limitin"

The only composition change that occurs within the systems are phase changes, as ammonia is cycled through various stages of liquid and vapor, similar to a household refrigerator.  Any leaks are noted during daily operation by plant personnel and repaired immediately.\n\n\n\nLevel indicators are located on vessels maintaining a liquid level. Pressure indicators are located throughout the process. The level and pressure indicators allow operators to monitor system operations and to determine potential adverse situations in the event of deviations from standard or acceptable operating conditions. Regular system inspections also permit operators to monitor operations.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThere have been no significant releases of ammonia that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 100 pounds or the state requirement mandating immediate reporting of any release or threatened release of a hazardous material in the past five years (November 2007 to November 2012).  In addition, there have been no injuries resulting from an ammonia release, nor any releases or \"near misses\" that warranted an internal incident investigation.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe facility has an emergency evacuation plan that includes ammonia leaks.
