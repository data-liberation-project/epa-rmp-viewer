      "SummaryText": "CITY OF PAPILLION CHLORINE LEAK INVESTIGATION AND STOPPAGE\n\n\n\nGENERAL:\n\nThe goal of this manual is to minimize an operator's risk of chlorine exposure. The best action an operator can do is to remove himself from the area of the leak and call for help. The section will outline the proper procedure for investigating a chlorine leak as well as the necessary steps to stop the leak. Leak investigation and or repair should only be done by trained operators. Operators first aware of the leak should evaluate the situation to see if action can be taken to minimize the leak from a safe distance.\n\n\n\nSAFETY EQUIPMENT:\n\nSCBA (self-contained breathing apparatus) and level \"A\" protective suit for leaks with unknown concentrations or concentrations 40 ppm. Full back up of trained personnel required, full backup will require a fire department hazmat team to be present and will be in command of the scene.\n\n\n\nChlorine concentrations may vary within a room, use additional protection when in doubt.\n\n\n\nA portable leak detector should also be used.\n\n\n\nLEAK INVESTIGATION:\n\nAll known or possible leaks shall be investigated through the use of aqua ammonia vapor. A plastic squeeze bottle containing commercial 26 degree Baume aqua ammonia will be used to direct ammonia vapor towards the suspected leak. Care must be taken to avoid getting any of the liquid portion of the aqua ammonia on piping, the liquid should not come in contact with brass or copper. If a leak is found, actions need to be taken to isolate the leak until repairs are made.\n\n\n\nLEAK STOPPAGE OR REPAIR:\n\nChlorine Containers: The type of chlorine cylinders that the City of Papillion water treatment plant uses are one ton chlorine cylinders. We have the necessary emergency kits to stop leaks in this type of cylinder. Included with the kits are instruction manuals describing how to properly use the kits. \n\n\n\nThe City of Papillion does not own any of the cylinders in which the chlorine is shipped. If a leak occurs on one of these cy"

The supervisor or another trained operator will assist another trained operator in leak classification. Leak areas should not be entered unless there is another trained and equipped operator present. Each leak will be classified into one of three categories, the severity of the leak will determine the class. The three classes are as follows:\n\nClass 1: No alert. The chlorine leak in minor (less than 40 ppm) and can be brought under control.\n\nClass 2: Alert status. The chlorine leak has the potential to become uncontrollable. In its present state the chlorine leak can be controlled. Concentration is unknown or more than 40 ppm. Personnel are being safely removed from the danger area.\n\nClass 3: Evacuation. The chlorine leak is not controllable and may affect City of Papillion personnel or surrounding community.\n\n\n\nRESPONSE TO ALARMS:\n\nThe response to a chlorine alarm is to first make sure that all personnel are safe. Leak repairs shall be made according to the requirements of this manual. All unplanned leaks shall be reported to the plant supervisor as soon as possible. The responses shall be first to protect the safety of all person, secondly the leak should be limited and/or vented from a safe distance as possible. The leak area shall not be entered for the purpose of investigation or repair unless instructed by your supervisor.\n\n\n\nClass 1: During normal and non- working hours the operators under direct supervision of the supervisor shall normally take actions necessary to safely bring the leak under control an"

Other operators shall be informed a Class 2 leak has occurred and should evacuate or be prepared to evacuate on a moment's notice. \n\nDuring non-working hours the supervisor will be notified of the Class 2 leak and make the appropriate calls for assistance and actions that need to be taken.\n\nClass 3: During normal working hours the operators and or their supervisor shall call 911 then take immediate action (within a safe distance) to limit the leak as much as possible. Other operators shall be informed that a Class 3 leak had occurred. They shall evacuate their area and go to the predetermined meeting point, such as an interior room if it is safe to do so or the parking lot in a position that is upwind from the leak. \n\nDuring non-working hours the supervisor shall call 911 and then take immediate actions (within safe distance) to limit the leak as much as possible and assist with emergency response procedures.\n\n\n\nRESIDENCES:\n\nShelter: The normal method of handling any leak that may threaten the surrounding community will be to notify the fire and police departments and advise all residents within ? mile of the affected area be sheltered. This mean that all windows shall be closed and cent systems shut down and wait for further information.\n\nEvacuation: If a leak of massive nature occurs and shelter would not provide adequate protection, the evacuation of the surrounding community may be necessary. Coordination with the fire and police departments is essential if evacuation becomes necessary.\n\n\n\nOUTSIDE ASSISTANCE:\n\nIf a Class 3 leak occurs, outside assistance is required.

If a chlorine gas leak is present in the chlorine storage area, first thing is to put on your S.C.B.A (self-contained breathing apparatus) then you may enter the room and shut the valve on the chlorine cylinder or cylinders that have the leak. Allow the room to air out with the help of the exhaust fan after the room is safe of all gas you will now be able to determine what the cause of the leak was and make the proper repairs.

If there is a chlorine gas leak present in the control room first you need to shut off the supply from the tank and those are located in the storage room on the south side of the tanks labeled 1,2,3,4. After the chlorine supply is shut off you must shut off the water supply which is located behind the chlorine scrubber unit.  Allow the room to be properly vented before entry, an S.C.B.A may be needed for entry.

Once all parts are replaced make a note of what was used so new parts can be ordered to ensure we always have what we need in stock.  \n\nC. Once all repairs have been made you will now need to charge the system back up with only water to start ensure there are no leaks present. If no leaks you can now turn on the chlorine valves then once again check for leaks. If no leaks are present you are now back to normal operations.\n\n\n\n68.54  Employee Training\n\nEmployee training is always on going. When a problem occurs the operators that are on duty are there to fix it and the information is passed on to the next shift in case the problem happens again. All information is shared with all operators and sometimes if needed a step by step process is shown to ensure all operators are instructed on what to do if the problem happens to them. All repairs are logged into our maintenance records. When production slows in the winter months the operators attend continuing education classes provided by the state. \n\n\n\n68.56 (a) Maintenance \n\nAll mechanical components of the chlorine system are checked in the fall of each year.
