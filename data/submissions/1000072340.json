The facility receives hydrogen, propane, propylene, and methane in bulk form, stores it in a tank, and then transfills it into cylinders for distribution to customers by truck.  The facility also receives hydrogen chloride, ammonia, chlorine, sulfur dioxide, and boron trichloride in cylinders for distribution to customers by truck.  \n\n\n\n\n\nRegulated Substances\n\n\n\nThis facility uses, manufactures, or stores a chemical listed in part 68 of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, beyond a threshold quantity, as established by the EPA; \n\nhydrogen, propane, propylene, methane, ammonia, chlorine, sulfur dioxide, hydrogen chloride, and boron trichloride.   \n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Policy\n\n\n\nPraxair is dedicated to being the best performing industrial gas company in all aspects of our business, including safety, health, and environmental affairs. Our safety, health, and environmental policy call for a commitment to protecting the health and safety of our employees, neighbors, and the surrounding environment. This policy is the basis for engineering and construction programs that produce equipment and process systems that minimize the possibility of accidental chemical releases and operational safety programs that ensure safe operation of our facilities. Praxair is committed to the continuous improvement of these programs.\n\n\n\nPraxair is an active member of the American Chemistry Council and subscribes to the council's program of Responsible Care; Employee Health and Safety Code of Management Practices.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevention Program\n\n\n\nIn accordance with OSHA's Process Safety Management standard and EPA's Risk Management Program rule, the Morrisville, PA facility has a comprehensive accident prevention program in place. This program is built around process safety concepts such as:\n\n- Technical documentation of Process Saf"

      "SummaryText": "ms (July 1998).\n\n\n\nPraxair has established a local Emergency Assistance Program (LEAP) to provide emergency response expertise for the unique industrial gas products and equipment we handle.  All LEAP employees are trained in their role in the emergency plan and emergency drills are conducted at least annually.  In addition, Praxair has in place a detailed site and community emergency response plan that meets the requirements of OSHA 29 CFR 1910.120(q) and EPA RMP 40 CFR 68.95.  Praxair employees will respond to most incidents involving toxic materials, but may evacuate and coordinate with public first responders for major toxic incidents or for fire incidents.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nPraxair has a commitment to safety that is expressed in a company-wide goal of \"Zero/Zero\", which means zero accidents and zero injuries or illnesses at each and every location. We look to constantly improve the safety of our processes using recommendations developed through the prevention program and a program soliciting safety suggestions from our employees.\n\n"
