The daily average finished product fuel throughput is 150,000 gallons, with a maximum daily throughput of 320,000 gallons. The Pueblo facility has two permanent 30,000-gallon butane tanks  for blending.\nRegulated Substances Handled & Covered Process:\nAlta Fuels Pueblo uses one chemical (butane) that is subject to reporting under this filing to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  \n\nThe Pueblo facility includes two permanent 30,000-gallon butane tanks used to inject butane into their gasoline loading operations for blending. Each butane tank will be administratively controlled to an 85% level limit, has excess flow valves on the vapor and liquid lines and has three (3) pressure relief valves set at 250 psig. Butane is unloaded from a tankwagon into either tank and stored liquefied under pressure; the tanks are manifolded such that one can be online while the other is being filled.  Liquid butane is pumped from the online tank through a loading rack meter to an inline mixer where it is blended with gasoline immediately prior to loading the outbound gasoline tankwagons.\n\nAlta Pueblo has implemented the Program Level"
