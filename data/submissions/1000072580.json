Alta Pueblo is a non-responding facility for releases of the RMP-listed chemicals, so the site utilizes an Emergency Action Plan (EAP).  \n\n\n\n\n\nStationary Source:\n\nThe Alta Fuels (Alta) Pueblo, Colorado facility is a gasoline blending facility with approximately 430,000 gallons of capacity, blending diesel, ethanol, and blend stock gasoline. The daily average throughput is 180,000 gallons, with a maximum daily throughput of 320,000 gallons. The Pueblo facility is adding two permanent 30,000-gallon butane tanks to their operations for blending.\n\nRegulated Substances Handled & Covered Process:\n\nAlta Fuels Pueblo uses one chemical that is subject to reporting under this filing to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  \n\n\n\nThe Pueblo facility includes two permanent 30,000-gallon butane tanks used to inject butane into their gasoline loading operations for blending. Each butane tank will be administratively controlled to an 85% level limit, has excess flow valves on the vapor and liquid lines and has three (3) pressure relief valves set at 250 psig. Butane is unloaded from a tankwagon into either tank and stored liquefied under pressure; the tanks are manifolded such that one can be online while the other is being filled.  Liquid butane is pumped from the online tank through loading rack meter 7 to an inline mixer where it is blended with gasoline immediately prior to loading the outbound gasoline tankwagons.\n\n\n\nAlta Pueblo has implemented the Program"

These items, their specific requirements, and how the Alta Pueblo complies with the requirements are addressed in the individual procedural documents.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Alta Pueblo has had zero RMP reportable incidents in the previous five years.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Alta facility has developed a written EAP that includes activation of the local emergency notification system and calling 911 from a safe location [29 CFR 1910.38(c)(1)] and directing an evacuation, including exit route assignments [29 CFR 1910.38(c)(2)]. All employees are trained to assist other employees in a safe and orderly evacuation [29 CFR 1910.38(c)(2)]. Should the scope of any incident exceed the capability of Alta staff, such as a large flammable gas release, fire, or explosion at the facility, the employee discovering emergency shall follow the protocol provided in the Emergency Action Plan to notify facility personnel, isolate the covered process if safe to do so, evacuate the facility and perform headcount at the designated muster point, and contact emergency responders. \n\nEmergency exit routes are through any available gate for this outdoor location and muster points for each facility are identified in the Facility Maps provided in Appendix O. In addition, designated muster points are identified by signs at each facility. Note that there are no facility processes that would require continued operation during an emergency. \n\n\n\nPurple K fire extinguish"

Facility employees should only administer the fire extinguishers if the fire is within the capacity of the extinguisher and if the employee is trained to do so [29 CFR 1910.119(n)]. \n\n\n\nAlta is equipped with spill-cleanup materials for containment and cleanup of minor spills. These materials include, but are not limited to, petrochemical \"soak\" pads, containment booms, rags, and hay bales. For additional details on spill prevention measures, including spill response activities, refer to the facility's Spill Prevention, Control & Countermeasure Plan. \n\n\n\n\n\nAlta Pueblo is committed to improving our safety systems and continues to address remaining low-priority recommendations identified in the initial Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) for this covered process. Future changes will be reviewed under the Management of Change (MOC) element and will address potential changes to improve safety as part of the MOC process.\n\n\n\n"
