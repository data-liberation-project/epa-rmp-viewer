      "SummaryText": "ELANTAS PDG, Inc. is one of the world-wide leaders in the development and manufacture of specialty polymers for application in the electrical and electronic industries.  Applications include electrical insulation in household appliances (e.g. motors), in heavy duty electrical equipment (e.g. transformers), and in automotive applications.  The facility has been located in north St. Louis since 1934.\n\nELANTAS PDG Inc. operates according to certain guiding principles.  Two of these are Safety and Environment.  This means that they are committed to protecting the environment, the community, their employees and their property from any harm that may occur as a result of its operations.  In addition, the company is committed to developing their processes to avoid adverse affects to the environment and their employees during normal operations, as well as, emergency situations. \n\nThe companyA?s Emergency Response Plan is implemented to comply with their guiding principles so that all potential hazardous conditions will remain within the plant boundaries.  The result is that there is reduced risk to the health and safety of the general public as well as to their employees.  In situations involving rescue and medical activities, the preservation of life is considered to be of prime importance.  Thus, these activities have priority over all other aspects of an emergency situation.   \n\nAll ELANTAS PDG, Inc. personnel are given applicable emergency response training annually and upon hire.  The training curriculum and course content are based on the job requirements, as well as, any special hazards associated with emergency situations.  Emergency drills and exercises are conducted periodically to identify gaps in the emergency plan, training, personnel, and/or response equipment.   To further strengthen the safety program, the company has established a Safety Committee to provide input on these and other safety issues.  This committee is a representation of all non-management emp"

      "SummaryText": "loyees that meets once per month.   \n\nELANTAS PDG, Inc. uses greater than one-thousand raw materials in its manufacturing operations.  Of these, only Toluene Diisocyanate (TDI) is covered by the Risk Management Program under 112(r)7 of the Clean Air Act.  TDI is used on site to manufacture polyurethane wore enamels used primarily in the automotive industry.  \n\nTDI is a liquid at ambient temperature and freezes at 53 A?F.  It is received on site by tank trucks and is off-loaded in a diked area to a 12,000 gallon storage tank.  The tank is surrounded by secondary containment and stores the TDI between 70 and 100 A?F.  The TDI is handled in a totally enclosed system that is hard piped to one of several process vessels where it is reacted with other chemicals to form a polyurethane resin.  During these processes, the TDI is completely reacted and no free isocyanates remain.  \n\nThe worst-case release scenario was determined not to have an offsite impact, as determined using The Society of Plastics IndustryA?s manual customized for TDI users, based on EPAA?s OCA Guidance.  ELANTAS PDG, Inc. has had no accidental releases of TDI in the past five years.  Should such a release occur, our Emergency Control Group will coordinate emergency response activities with the local fire and police departments.  \n"
