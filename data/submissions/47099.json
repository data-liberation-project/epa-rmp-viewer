The program was prepared by committee of employees from varying disciplines and responsibilities within Polk County.  A similar committee will participate in updates and modifications to the program.  Process safety information presents information on the characteristics, hazards, and recommended handling methods of chlorine.  All process equipment has been presented and described.  Process flow and piping and instrumentation diagrams are included.  Process hazardanalysis procedures are presented, which include development of PHA team, method of conducting PHA, PHA reporting and recommendation implementation requirements, procedures for operating equipment and systems of covered processes, procedures for training new and existing employees in the classroom and on the job, procedures for contractor safety requirements and qualifications, prestartup safety reviews and checklists of covered processes, procedures for inspecting and ensuring the mechanical integrity of equipment and systems of covered processes, procedures for permitting and monitoring hot work in areas of covered processes, procedures for managing changes in equipment and processes, procedures for investigating incidents that resulted in an accidental release, and procedures for conducting compliance audits of facilities utilizing covered processes.  Schedules and documentation requirements for each of these tasks are presented in detail and are paramount to the functional success of the program.",

      "SummaryText": "Polk County Utilities Central regional WWTF is located at the north end of Vaughn Road in Winter Haven, FL.  The facility treats domestic wastewater from a portion of southwest Winter Haven, FL.  Up to four one-ton cylinders of chlorine gas are stored and used at the facility for process chlorination.  All cylinders are equipped with pressure release valves and automatic shutoff valves.  On-site chlorine monitors provide remote sensing for chlorine leaks.  There has not been any accidental release of chlorine at this site.  Polk County Utilities is in compliance with OSHA PSM and EPA RMP requirements for Program 3 processes.  A procedural plan is established for training staff on operation and maintenance, pre-startup safety reviews, mechanical integrity checks, hot work, managing changes of equipment, conducting incident investigations, contractor work, compliance audits, hazard assessments, and hazard analyses on chlorination equipment and effects of accidental releases.  Polk County Emergency Management provides emergency response services upon notification by Polk County Utilities staff or others of an accidental release at the facility.  Polk County Utilities staff are trained equipment maintenance and failure repair.  Emergency Management staff will direct Utilities' staff when to enter the site of an accidental release for investigation and repair of a release.  Self-contained breathing apparatus will be used by all staff when entering the site.  Dispersion modeling was performed using ALOHA algorithms.  A worst-case accidental release scenario of 2,000 pounds of chlorine gas in ten minutes results in a 3.1-mile radius zone of impact that could affect a population estimate of 14,316.  Seven alternative case accidental release scenarios of 317 up to 4,320 pounds of gas over 27 to 60 minutes result in 0.2 to 1.2 miles radii zones of impact which could affect population estimates of 24 to 2,041.  No environmental receptors are within any accidental release scena"
