The NextEra Corporate environmental organization provides support to the site in the form of advice and direction on regulatory compliance issues, budgeting and procurement of environmental services, and assistance in development of new programs.  They also ensure the site RMP program is effectively implemented, and employees are appropriately informed and trained on the site process.  Trinity Operating shares a similar health and safety policy as NextEra Energy and both commit to high standards of safety and health for employees, their families, the surrounding community, and the end customer.  Both NextEra and Trinity Operating believe it is the responsibility of the company to provide the facilities, equipment, tools, procedures, safety programs and training for employees to work injury free.  They hold each employee responsible for following appropriate safety rules and planning each work activity using appropriate risk assessment, good judgement skills, and a sincere dedication to work safety.  Their health and safety goal is to prevent all injuries or near misses at work and work \u0091Zero Today\u0092.  Trinity Operations and NextEra Energy will periodically review the covered process for opportunities to improve the safety of the process.  \n\nThe TexRock Compressor Station is a field compressor station that supports the movement of natural gas from the gathering system to a receipt facility.  The site operates one natural gas-powered reciprocating compressor and two electric driven reciprocating compressors. The compressors raise the pressure of the produced gas from the well heads sufficiently to be able to deliver to the suction side of the next downstream facility.  The site processes high H2S natural gas liquids (NGLs) by reducing the pressure to evaporate the H2S from the liq"

The NGL is considered a flammable mixture which has components above one percent and the mixture meets the NFPA-4 criteria.  The ASTs are connected using open pipes and are administratively limited to a maximum NGL volume of 85%.  Therefore, each AST can contain 35,700 gallons of NGL which equates to a total of 383,223 lbs. NGL in the two ASTs.  The process exceeds the 10,000 lbs. threshold for flammable mixtures (using the entire mixture weight) and triggers the RMP rule.  Since the two ASTs are atmospheric the process does not meet the PSM applicability criteria.  \n\nThe TexRock Compressor Station NGL is an RMP Program 1 covered material, the site is generally unmanned, and has a program in place to comply with the RMP Program 1 requirements.  A worst-case scenario was generated through RMP Comp, and all applicable station information submitted to the EPA\u0092s Central Data Exchange via RMP eSubmit. \n\nThe TexRock Compressor Station is scheduled to come online mid-summer 2023; therefore, the station does not have an accident history.  \n\nThe TexRock Compressor Station has emergency response procedures that are communicated to all personnel that come onsite.  The procedures include information on site hazards and appropriate notification and response steps for a regulated release and any adverse conditions.  The station is not permanently manned, but all personnel that are periodically at the facility are trained on the chemicals at the station and have the ability to communicate to the control room in Houston, TX at all times.  The process is continuously monitored for any pressure releases and/or adverse conditions 24 hours a day by the Houston control room.

The Fire Marshall / Emergency Management Coordinator for the Atascosa County Local Emergency Planning Commission has also received communications on the new TexRock Compressor Station and the amount of NGL present.   Site personnel are trained to notify the Paisano Volunteer Fire Department in case of any NGL release and/or fires and work with them to restrict access to the remote facility.  Primary process control will be handled by the Houston, TX control room with secondary control by local personnel when appropriate and safe in adverse conditions.
