Due to our stringent release prevention policies, no incidents, as defined by the RMP rule, have occurred in the past five years.\r\n\r\n\r\n6.  EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\r\n\r\nSaputo developed an Emergency Action Plan (EAP) to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency actions including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, and notification of local emergency response agencies and the public.\r\n\r\nTo ensure proper functioning, our personal protective equipment and ammonia detection system are regularly inspected and serviced.  In addition, the EAP is reviewed and updated as needed to reflect any pertinent changes taking place.\r\n\r\n\r\n7.  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nSeveral developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program.  Recommendations resulting from the PHA and the Compliance Audit will be addressed in a timely manner."

These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits\r\n\r\nThese audits are carried out once every three (3) years to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  Any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation\r\n\r\nSaputo promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in, a catastrophic release.  These investigations are conducted to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent a future release.  All reports are retained for a minimum of five (5) years.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\n\r\nSaputo truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.

Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is performed.

All elements of these standards have been combined to create one program document herein referred to as the RMP PSM.  \r\n\r\nAPLLICABILITY:  The refrigeration system at this facility is subject to the RMP and PSM requirements since the system charge exceeds the threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia per 29 CFR 1910.119(a) and 40 CFR 68.10.  The boundaries of the covered process are defined by the components of the refrigeration system and include interfaces with other media (brine, glycol, and utilities) where the potential for an accidental release exists.  \r\n\r\nSaputo's RMP is comprised of the following sections which are summarized below.\r\n\r\n1.\tAccidental release prevention and emergency response policies\r\n2.\tStationary source and the regulated substances handled\r\n3.\tWorst-case and alternative release scenarios\r\n4.\tGeneral accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention\r\n5.\tFive-year accident history\r\n6.\tEmergency response program\r\n7.\tPlanned changes to improve safety\r\n\r\n\r\n1.

This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.

STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\r\n\r\nOur facility's primary activity encompasses cheese manufacturing.  The plant is located at 317 Rosera Street, Lena, Wisconsin.  The area is zoned for industrial use. This facility processes milk into cheeses and packages the cheeses.  The cheeses are then distributed to wholesale and retail units.  There is one RMP-regulated substance, anhydrous ammonia, used at the plant to provide refrigeration for production and warehousing.  The inventory of ammonia at our facility is 25,940 pounds.\r\n\r\n \r\n3.  WORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\r\n\r\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) is defined as the release of the largest quantity of ammonia from a vessel or process line failure that results in the greatest distance to an endpoint.  For the WCS, the high pressure receiver, containing a maximum inventory of 11,685 pounds and limited by administrative controls (written procedures), was assumed to have released its contents over a 10-minute period.\r\n\r\nThe alternative release scenario (ARS) is one that is more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario.  For the ARS, chosen from the Process Hazard Analysis, a leak in a high pressure liquid line would result in a release of ammonia outdoors.  To limit the duration of the release, plant personnel would use controls and mitigation system within 10 minutes of leak detection.\r\n\r\n\r\n4.  GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION\r\n\r\nThe following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our facility.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\n\r\nSaputo maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with the refrigeration process.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis\r\n\r\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to e"

The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\n\r\nSaputo ensures that operators are trained and understand the SOPs associated with the processes.
