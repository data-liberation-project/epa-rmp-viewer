The program is also inteneded to provide management with assurances that SNWS is in compliance with accident prevention regulation promulgated by the state and federal agencies.\n\nA PSM manual has been compiled to outline the standards and procedures to be used for implementing an accident prevention program at this facility.  The manual is intended to serve as a reference resource for management, and as a \"road map\" to provide guidance for employees as they implement the program.  The manual contains separate sections to address the specific reuirements of each program element.  The manual is a \"controlled document\" with limited circulationdue to security consideration.\n\nThe Prevention Program contains the following elements: 1) Introduction, 2) Employee participation, 3) Process safety information, 4) Process hazard analysis, 5) Operating procedures, 6) Training, 7) Contractors, 8) Pre-startup safety review, 9) Mechanical integrity, 10) Hot works permits, 11) Management of change, 12) Incident investigation,  13)  Emergency planning and response, 14) Compliance audits, and 15) Trade secrets.",

      "SummaryText": "The Southern Nevada Water System (SNWS) is a water utility facility that uses chlorine as a disinfectant to produce potable water.  SNWS is the primary potable water supplier in southern Nevada.  Our mission is to \"provide a safe and reliable water supply\" to the water purveyors in the region.\n\nThe senior management team at SNWS is committed to protect the health and wellness of employees and others from exposure to chemicals.  The senior management has set a goal to achieve full compliance with the applicable federal OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) and EPA Risk Management Plan (RMP) programs, as well as the State of Nevada Chemical Accident Prevention Program (CAPP).  \n\nSuch management commitment to total chemical safety is demonstrated by: 1) the hiring of a chemical engineer who is dedicated to the evaluation and improvement of the water treatment process, 2) a process safety engineer is now permanently assigned to SNWS to work on the PSM, RMP, and CAPP programs compliance, 3) developing a comprehensive program to ensure that the chlorine process design and changes, process technology, hazard analysis, operational and maintenance activities and procedures, and training programs are systematically evaluated and implemented, 4) coordinating with local emergency responder, i.e. local fire department and the National Park Service, on the emergency response program, 5) practice an open door policy where employees are encouraged to discuss any issues with their respective supervisors and managers, 6) relying on the vigilance of employees to follow the safe work practices, to do the right thing, and to remain safe through continuous education and training efforts.\n \nCurrently the SNWS has the capacity to produce 750 million gallons per day (MGD) of potable water between two separate water treatment facilities.  Both facilities are located in remote areas of Clark County, Nevada, away from populated areas.  One of the two water treatment facilities uses chlorine to "

      "SummaryText": "disinfect water taken from Lake Mead.  Chlorine is a regulated substance under the OSHA PSM and the EPA RMP programs.   \n\nThe SNWS water treatment process starts by pumping water from Lake Mead into and through a production building, where the water undergoes an initial phase of disinfection with ozone gas.  As an additional disinfectant, chlorine gas is then added to the water in the back end of the same production building.  To ensure the water quality for the water users, enough chlorine must be added to maintain a sufficient \"chlorine residual\" throughout the plant and distribution system.  After the disinfected water exits the production building, it flows through an aeration channel into \"flocculation basins\", where small particles in the water are mixed together to form larger particles called \"floc\".  Polishing of the water is done through multi-media filtration where the flocs are removed.  The potable water is now ready for distribution to Boulder City, Clark County, Henderson, Las Vegas, North Las Vegas, and outlying areas.   \n\nLiquid chlorine is shipped to SNWS by way of trailer transporters and kept in an enclosed building.  The chlorine building has equipment for unloading the trailers and to evaporate the liquid chlorine for use as a disinfectant.  Access to the building is restricted to authorized SNWS employees.  This treatment facility also maintains an onsite meteorological monitoring station.  The prevailing winds at the lakeside facility are to the north-northwest, towards the Saddle Island cove and Lake Mead area.\n\nThe chlorine facility was designed and constructed in accordance with National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) standards, and complies with EPA?s Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.  \n\nThere is a multitude of technological steps incorporated into the chlorine system to ensure chemical safety: 1) the entire process inside the chlorine building is monitored and controlled remotely "

The Clark County Fire Department (CCFD) inspected the SNWS? Lake Mead facility on July 8, 2003, and the CCFD Hazardous Material Unit visited the same facility from 12/09/2002 to 12/11/2002.  SNWS has also conducted evacuation drill, and the public announcement system is tested monthly.\n\nThe SNWS will continue to execute the current chemical safety program to stay in compliance with all applicable federal, state, and local requirements.  Process hazard analysis (PHA), procedural review, maintenance activities, and trainings are ongoing.  To achieve desired integration and uniformity among the various emergency response plans mandated by different agencies, SNWS will review the RMP chlorine emergency response plan with the chemical emergency response plan under the auspices of the Department of Homeland Security."
