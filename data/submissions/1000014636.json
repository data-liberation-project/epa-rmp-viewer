The emergency response policy at the facility is to immediately notify the Acadia Parish Office of Emergency Preparedness through 911.\n\n\n\nThe stationary source consist of two(2) one (1) ton cylinders of chlorine.\n\n\n\nThe worst case release scenario would consist of a rupture of the one ton cylinder allowing all of the cholirine inside to be relesed in ten minutes, which would create a cloud of chlorine with a radius of 1.3 miles and an affected population of 8,7000 people.  There are no passive mitigation measures in place to affect the severety of the release.\n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario consist of a fusible plug blowing out of the chlorine cylinder.  It will take approximately an hour for offsite responders to respond to the release.  It will have a release rate of 2 lbs/min and will have a radius of effect of 0.1 miles and effect 90 people.  There is no active or passive mitigation in place at the facility.\n\n\n\nProper training of operators and maintenance personnel prevents accidental release and chemical specific hazards.\n\n\n\nThere has been two accidentents at the facility in the past eight (10) years.  One accident took place on November 10, 1977 at approximately 2;00 pm in the afternoon.  The event involved improper opening of a valve on the one ton cylinder and resulted in a very short release (<10 sec) before the leak was stopped.  The worker went to a doctor after his shift was over. The other accident took place on February 17,2007 at approx. 8am. The event involved improper opening of a valve on the one ton cylinder also, and resulted in a short release (<15 sec) before leak was stopped. Worker went to emergency room and released same day.\n\n\n\nThe emergency response at this facility is handled by "
