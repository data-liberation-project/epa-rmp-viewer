Facility accidental release and emergency response policy.\n\nThe management and employees of AgriPride FS, Inc. are committed to the \nprevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release \nshould occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Nashville Fire Department, \nWashington County Local Emergency Planning Committee or other authorities, to mitigate any \nrelease and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment. \n\n2. The stationary source and the regulated substances handled.\n\nThe primary activity at the facility, which is located at  9993 St. Rt.127 North, is the storage \nand distribution of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, \nand distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.  The storage and \nhandling system consists of 1- 6,000, 1 - 12,000, & 1 - 30,000 gallon storage tanks, loading risers, \nassociated plumbing and nurse tanks.  Access to the site is restricted to authorized \nfacility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.\n\nThe maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia that can be stored would be 500,000 \npounds, this includes the amount of anhydrous ammonia that could be stored in nurse \ntanks.\n\n3. The accidental release prevention program.\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable \nstate codes and regulations.  This facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety \nRequirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by \nThe American National Standards Institute, Inc. as adopted by state regulation and the \nstandards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR \n1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".  Compliance with these \nregulations and on-going training of our employees make up our accident release prevention \nprogram.  \n\n4. Five year accident history. \n\nThe following is a list of acci"

One employee was hospitalized.\n\n5. The emergency response program.\n\nThe facility has:\n- a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38;\n- provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-\nknow information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving anhydrous ammonia, it is our policy to notify the \nNashville Fire Department and Washington County LEPC and request that they respond \nto the emergency.  Our emergency action plans have been coordinated with both the fire \ndepartment and LEPC.\n\n6. Planned changes to improve safety. \n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are \nperformed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no specific safety \nrecommendations for implementation at this time."
