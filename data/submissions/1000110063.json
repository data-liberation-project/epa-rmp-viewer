This commitment is supported by senior management and is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as employee training and in considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our facility.  The facility does not anticipate having any type of uncontrolled release.  However, if an uncontrolled release does occur, the personnel at the facility will evaluate the situation, take actions within the capabilities of the plant, and notify the necessary outside agencies.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\nThe Port Hudson Terminal Facility off loads butane and natural gasoline transport trucks into eight 90,000-gallon water capacity storage tanks and delivers these products to customers via pipeline.  These materials are considered flammable mixtures containing substances such as methane, ethane, propane, iso-butane, n-butane, iso pentane, n pentane, and hexane. The Port Hudson Terminal Facility does not use or store any regulated toxic substances above the EPA set threshold levels.\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\nMultiple storage vessels within the process were evaluated for the worst case and alternative release scenarios.  Results of the worst-case release scenario indicate that the process is subject to RMP Program Level 3 requirements.  Details of the worst case and alternative release scenarios are included with the backup documentation associated with this RMP plan.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\nThis facility is regulated by 29CFR 1910.119 (Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemical), 1910.38 (Employee Emergency Plans), as well as other federal, sta"

Process safety information, consisting of technical standards, specifications and levels, promotes safe process design and operation.  Process hazard analysis evaluates hazards against safeguards needed to mitigate likelihood of an accidental release. Process changes are managed through the management of change procedure, by considering the impact that a change will have on the rest of the process.  For new or significantly changed processes, a pre-startup safety review is conducted as a final check to enable safe start up.  \n\nThe employee participation program promotes the development of necessary expertise, experiences, judgment, and proactive initiative within the workforce.  A comprehensive training program ensures that employees are knowledgeable about the processes they are responsible to operate and control.  Operating procedures explain correct startup, operation and shutdown procedures for various equipment in the process.  The hot work program is in place to promote safety of jobs involving potential ignition sources.  The mechanical integrity program ensures that equipment is maintained inspected and tested for ongoing safety.  A contractor safety evaluation program is in place to ensure hire of contractors that will not compromise job or facility safety.   \n\nThe facility has a policy of investigating every incident, which may have possibly resulted in a release, to prevent a similar accident from recurring.  The facility has established an audit procedure to assure the continued integrity of the prevention program.\n\n5 YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThe Port Hudson Terminal has not had any RMP-reportable accidents within the last five years. \n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nThis facility is a non-responding facility and has coordinated with the local fire departm"

However, the facility does maintain an emergency response plan that serves as guidance for facility employees to notify first responders, secure critical operations before evacuation, evacuate the facility, and account for personnel, among other items.  Facility personnel are trained in procedures and use of equipment appropriate to their role in response to small accidental releases.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nNGL Supply Terminal Company, LLC will continually strive for safety improvement.  Periodic process safety inspections and Process Hazard Analysis will be conducted followed with timely response.  NGL shares lessons learned from other similar facilities as appropriate to prevent similar incidents."
