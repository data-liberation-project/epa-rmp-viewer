      "SummaryText": "The Gibson Gas Plant (Gibson Plant or Facility) utilizes more than the threshold quantity of a \"regulated flammable substance (10,000 pounds)\" in the processing of natural gas, where natural gas liquids (NGL) are extracted from the inlet gas using a cryogenic process and treated by a glycol dehydration unit prior to being delivered to the pipeline for further market distribution.  The Gibson Plant also includes an amine treatment system.  Therefore, this Facility is subject to the Risk Management Plan (RMP) requirements codified in Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations Part 68 (40 CFR 68) administered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).\r\n\r\nThe Gibson Plant has not had an accidental release of a regulated substance where exposure to the substance, its reaction products, overpressure generated by an explosion involving the substance, or radiant heat generated by a fire involving the substance led to any off-site death, injury, or response or restoration activities for an exposure of an environmental receptor for the period of five (5) years prior to June 2013.  In addition, the estimated flammable endpoint for a worst-case release is less than the distance to any public or environmental receptor.  Furthermore, emergency response procedures have been coordinated between the Facility and local emergency planning and response organizations.  Therefore, the Gibson Plant is subject to Program 1 requirements as stated in 40 CFR 68.10. \r\n\r\nThe Gibson Plant employs six (6) full-time employees on-site who will ensure the proper operation and maintenance of the Facility. \r\n\r\nEnLink Midstream Operating, L.P. (EnLink), formerly Crosstex Energy, last submitted an RMP 5-year update to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) in June 2013 for the Gibson Plan.  The current RMP includes administrative updates associated with the change from Crosstex Energy to EnLink.  \r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\r\n\r\nThe Gibson Plant maint"

NGL is a regulated flammable mixture that is an aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbon mixture.  The regulated flammable chemicals contained in the NGL mixture include methane, ethane, propane, isobutane, N-butane, isopentane, and N-pentane.  The maximum inventory of NGL at the Facility at any given time is 4,364 gallons (17,118 lbs).  \r\n\r\nGibson Plant representatives have reviewed all chemicals used and/or stored at the Facility and determined that there are no RMP regulated toxics present above RMP threshold quantities.\r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nBecause the Facility is regulated under RMP Program Level 1, it is not subject to the RMP Prevention Program required under 40 CFR 68.  However, the Facility is subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) program. The Gibson Plant's PSM Plan is kept on-site as a separate document. \r\n\r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nThe Gibson Plant has not had any accidental releases of NGL occur that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on-site, or off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or any environmental impact for the period of five (5) years prior to June 2013.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\n\r\nBecause the Gibson Plant is regulated under RMP Program Level 1, it is not subject to the RMP Emergency Response"

In addition, operating procedures and equipment design codes and standards associated with the operations at the Facility are maintained. Furthermore, the Facility has coordinated emergency response with the Terreborne Parish Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and the East Gibson Volunteer Fire Department.  The East Gibson Volunteer Fire Department is designated as the first responder in the event of NGL release.   \r\n\r\nA site map, MSDSs, and a list of chemicals kept on-site are maintained at the Facility, along with their PSM Plan, which is kept on-site as a separate document.  \r\n\r\nSAFETY IMPROVEMENTS\r\n\r\nMaintenance checks, compliance audits, management of change procedures, and incident investigations will identify changes to improve safety.  The Gibson Plant has a continued commitment to update equipment and improve safety pertaining to the covered process when necessary."
