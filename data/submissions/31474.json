(Vintage) is the owner of the Santa Clara Valley Gas Plant (SCVGP).  Vintage adheres to written operating procedures to protect its employees, environment, property, and the general public from any off-site impacts that could occur as a result of operations at the plant.  Vintage operates its facilities in compliance with applicable federal, state, and local safety, health, and environmental regulations, which serves to reinforce its long-standing commitment to worker and public safety at their facilities.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention such as personnel training, building safety into the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility.  The Vintage philosophy is to implement engineering and administrative controls to eliminate preventable releases of regulated substances, as well as non-regulated substances.\n\nThe Vintage SCVGP Emergency Response Plan incorporates coordination with local emergency response agencies as well as the use of employees trained to recognize and respond to the hazards of a chemical release and the use of response procedures to mitigate the release of such chemicals to the environment.  The highest priority in an emergency response is for the safety of responding emergency personnel as well as affected and non-affected personnel.  Response procedures are implemented according to what is appropriate based on a hazard assessments performed at the scene of the incident.  Vintage will always attempt to have a Joint Incident Command structure in place to assist emergency response personnel in the immediate control of any release.  Priorities for response are based on life, environment and property, in that order.\n\nManagement supports the safety of the plant by having management representation (Pipeline Foreman) on site at the plant and by providing annual training for its e"

Torrey Canyon Road dead-ends into Guiberson Road at the entrance to the facility.  The facility is relatively remote and bounded by undeveloped private property on the south and southeast and citrus groves on the northeast.  A dry creek wash (Torrey Canyon Wash) is located along the northeast boundary of the facility.\n\n1.3 Regulated Substances\nRegulated flammable mixtures containing methane, ethane, propane, butane, pentane and iso-pentane are present at the facility.  No regulated toxic substances are present at the facility in excess of the threshold quantities establish by this regulation.  The elements of the company?s PSM and accidental release prevention program are summarized below:\n\n1.4 Summary of Accidental Release Prevention Program\nThe Santa Clara Valley Gas Plant is subject to RMP requirements as well as OSHA?s 29 CFR 1910.119 Process Safety Management of highly hazardous chemicals (PSM).  The Santa Clara Valley Gas Plant, by complying with the PSM and RMP standards, has implemented all of the requirements of the RMP Program 3 prevention program.\n\nCompliance with PSM?s comprehensive program ensures the operating integrity of the plant processes that handle flammable materials.  The objective of the company?s PSM program is to prevent unwanted releases of hazardous chemicals.  To control these types of hazards, Vintage has proactively identified, evaluated and developed operating and maintenance procedures to prevent, or at least mitigate, the release of chemical"

An effective PSM program requires a systematic approach to evaluating the entire chemical process.  The various lines of defense that have been incorporated into the design and operation of the process to prevent or mitigate the release of hazardous chemicals have been evaluated and tested to assure their effectiveness at each level.  The elements of the company?s PSM are discussed further, below.\n\nProcess Safety Information - This includes complete and accurate written information concerning process chemicals, process technology, and process equipment of the natural gas processing system in the plant.  The PSI manual is readily available to employees. \n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA ) ? An initial PHA was performed at the plant to identify and analyze the significance of potential hazards associated with the processing or handling of flammable materials.  The PHA is revalidated every 3 years and assists the company and its employees in making decisions for improving safety and reducing the consequences of unwanted or unplanned releases of flammable materials.  As part of the company?s PSM compliance of various elements a cross functional team performs the PHA.  \n\nOperating Procedures - As part of the PSM program, all operating procedures for the natural gas processing system are documented and accessible to employees whose work involves this system.  Each operator has his/her own set of operating procedures for easy access and notations.  As needed, changes or updates to the natural gas processing system operating procedures are incorporated under the company?s management of change program and operators are trained annually on the operating procedures.\n\nEmployee Training - Personnel performing operations or maintenance on the natural gas process system must be qualified to perform their assi"

Training includes operating procedures, maintenance procedures, HAZWOPER, Emergency Response, Fire Prevention Plan, HazComm, Lock out/Tagout, and other training as applicable and required by Federatl and State OSHA.\n\nMechanical Integrity - Under the PSM program, equipment used to process, store, or handle flammable materials has to be designed, constructed, installed, and maintained to minimize the release of such chemicals.  As required, elements of the mechanical integrity program include identifying and categorizing equipment and instrumentation, inspections and tests and their frequency; maintenance procedures; training of maintenance personnel; criteria for acceptable test results; and documentation of manufacturer recommendations for equipment and instrumentation.  \n\nManagement of Change - Changes to a process must be evaluated thoroughly to fully assess their impact on employee safety and health and to determine needed changes to the process.  The company has established and implemented a management of change program for any changes that are not ?replacements in kind?.  These changes include process chemicals, technology equipment and operating and maintenance procedures, and changes to facilities that affect the natural gas processing system.  A log is kept to document the MOC and safety meetings are held to inform all employees of the change. \n\nPre-Startup Safety Review - Vintage performs a pre-startup safety review for new facilities and for modified facilities when the modification is significant enough to require a change in the process safety information.  A PSSR is performed prior to start up of new processes which require a hazardous material above the regulatory threshold and anytime the facility undergoes modifications.

The audit is used to gather facts and information to verify compliance with the PSM standards.  The audit includes an evaluation of the design and effectiveness of the PSM program and a field inspection of the safety and health conditions and practices to verify that the PSM program elements are effectively implemented.  The audit is documented and the last two audits maintained in the files.\n\nIncident Investigation ? A crucial part of Vintage?s PSM program is a thorough investigation of all incidents that caused, or could have potentially caused a release of hazardous chemicals.  The investigation seeks to identify the chain of events and root causes so that corrective measures can be developed and implemented to prevent reoccurrence.  Vintage uses a team of employees to conduct the investigation and documents the findings and recommendations.  These are shared with employees in safety meetings to educate them in how to avoid another incident in the future.  \n\nEmployee Participation Plan ? Vintage employees participate in every element of PSM.  Employees are included in PHA revalidation teams; incident investigation teams; they assist in writing operating and maintenance procedures, conducting compliance audits, attending training, screening contractors and reporting on contractor performance, maintaining both the PSI and Mechanical Integrity information, and initiating MOC and PSSRs are needed.  \n\nCompany Supervisors attend and participate in safety meetings conducted by Contract Supervisors as needed to review Company environmental and safety policies prior to contract personnel performing major work or operations presentin"
