An effective PSM program requires a systematic approach to evaluating the entire chemical process.  The various lines of defense that have been incorporated into the design and operation of the process to prevent or mitigate the release of hazardous chemicals have been evaluated and tested to assure their effectiveness at each level.  The elements of the company\u00bfs PSM are discussed further, below.\n\nProcess Safety Information - This includes complete and accurate written information concerning process chemicals, process technology, and process equipment of the natural gas processing system in the plant.  The PSI manual is readily available to employees. \n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA ) \u00bf An initial PHA was performed at the plant to identify and analyze the significance of potential hazards associated with the processing or handling of flammable materials.  The PHA is revalidated every 3 years and assists the company and its employees in making decisions for improving safety and reducing the consequences of unwanted or unplanned releases of flammable materials.  As part of the company\u00bfs PSM compliance of various elements a cross functional team performs the PHA.  \n\nOperating Procedures - As part of the PSM program, all operating procedures for the natural gas processing system are documented and accessible to employees whose work involves this system.  Each operator has his/her own set of operating procedures for easy access and notations.  As needed, changes or updates to the natural gas processing system operating procedures are incorporated under the company\u00bfs management of change program and operators are trained annually on the operating procedures.\n\nEmployee Training - Personnel performing operations or maintenance on the natural gas process system must be qualified to perform their assi"

Training includes operating procedures, maintenance procedures, HAZWOPER, Emergency Response, Fire Prevention Plan, HazComm, Lock out/Tagout, and other training as applicable and required by Federatl and State OSHA.\n\nMechanical Integrity - Under the PSM program, equipment used to process, store, or handle flammable materials has to be designed, constructed, installed, and maintained to minimize the release of such chemicals.  As required, elements of the mechanical integrity program include identifying and categorizing equipment and instrumentation, inspections and tests and their frequency; maintenance procedures; training of maintenance personnel; criteria for acceptable test results; and documentation of manufacturer recommendations for equipment and instrumentation.  \n\nManagement of Change - Changes to a process must be evaluated thoroughly to fully assess their impact on employee safety and health and to determine needed changes to the process.  The company has established and implemented a management of change program for any changes that are not \u00bfreplacements in kind\u00bf.  These changes include process chemicals, technology equipment and operating and maintenance procedures, and changes to facilities that affect the natural gas processing system.  A log is kept to document the MOC and safety meetings are held to inform all employees of the change. \n\nPre-Startup Safety Review - Vintage performs a pre-startup safety review for new facilities and for modified facilities when the modification is significant enough to require a change in the process safety information.  A PSSR is performed prior to start up of new processes which require a hazardous material above the regulatory threshold and anytime the facility undergoes modifications.

Contractor safety and environmental provisions must meet or exceed Company requirements and satisfy applicable Federal, state and local laws and regulations.  The Company audits its contractors in several areas, including job safety performance, qualifications, and training programs to name a few areas of the audit.\n\n1.5 Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\nIn addition to implementation of the PSM elements, Vintage has implemented specific safety features for the prevention, detection and control of releases or regulated (and other) substances at the Santa Clara Valley Gas Plant.  The following is some of the control and detection equipment located in and around the facility to minimize the risk of an accident involving hazardous materials at Santa Clara Valley Gas Plant:\n\u00bf\tRelief and/or safety valves\n\u00bf\tHigh temperature alarms and/or shutdowns\n\u00bf\tFlame detectors\n\u00bf\tCombustible gas detectors\n\u00bf\tSmoke detectors\n\u00bf\tFire Protection System\n\u00bf\tEmergency Shutdown Systems (ESD)\n\u00bf\tLeak Detection System\n1.6 Five-Year Accident History\nThe Santa Clara Valley Gas Plant has had no incidents with off-site impacts involving a regulated substance as defined in the regulation in the past five years.\n\n1.7 Emergency Response Program Summary\nVintage has written emergency response procedures to address hazards that may be encountered during response or follow-up of an emergency at the Santa Clara Valley Gas Plant.  These emergency response procedures address the following issues: 1) releases of regulated substances, including the possibility of fires or explosions; 2) proper emergency rescue, first aid and medical treatment for exposure; 3) notification of local emergency response agencies; 4) evacuation plans for the Santa Clara Gas Plant and methods of accounting for facility personnel after an evacuation; and 5) post-incident cleanup/decon"
