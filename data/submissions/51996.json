The reason for submitting this RMP is to comply with the mandatory five years update.  This facility has two refrigeration systems using anhydrous ammonia as the refrigerant.  The amount of anhydrous ammonia contained in one of the systems is above the EPA threshold reporting quantity.\n\nPilgrim's Pride is committed to the safety of its partners and the surrounding community.  This commitment includes both human health and the protection of the environment.  Safety is ensured through careful preventive measures and emergency planning.  The intent of our release prevention policy is to minimize all potential risks that could possibly lead to an accidental ammonia release.  This program focuses primarily on the safe operation and the mechanical integrity of the process equipment.  The Emergency Response Plan focuses on reducing the potential impact of an accidental release.  This is done by coordinating emergency actions with the Mt. Pleasant Fire Department and ensuring that employees are trained on the proper response to an emergency situation.\n\nBecause anhydrous ammonia is listed by both the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as a hazardous chemical, our accidental release prevention policy is designed to comply with the Process Safety Management (PSM) and Risk Management Program (RMP) regulations of these two agencies.  These regulations are designed to prevent the accidental release of ammonia and minimize negative consequences in the event that a release should occur.  Our emergency response policy is designed to comply with all government emergency response regulations.\n\nAn offsite consequence analysis was performed for this site, including consideration of ammonia release scenarios as \u00bfworst case release\u00bf and \u00bfalternative release scenarios\u00bf. We do have several passive and active mitigatio"

They were also instrumental in developing the Process Safety Information.  Anhydrous ammonia pipes and valves are labeled and equipment information has been compiled.  The Company follows the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines for safe operations and preventative maintenance of the refrigeration equipment.  In addition, the facility has procedures in place for notifying contractors and their employees of the hazards pertaining to the system, as required under the regulations.  Chemical-specific exposure prevention steps include availability of self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) and air purifying respirators for the refrigeration partners, and awareness of the hazardous and toxic properties of anhydrous ammonia.  We also provide HAZMAT training on an annual basis for our Emergency Response team.\n\nIn accordance with the PSM and RMP regulations, the Company performs periodical audits and hazard reviews to enhance"
