      "SummaryText": "The Mankato Water Treatment Plant has developed this Risk Management Plan because of the amount of chlorine that is kept on-site.  Chlorine is used as a disinfectant in water treatment.  Up to four one-ton chlorine cylinders are stored at the plant.  A Risk Management Plan is required by EPA rules (40 CFR 68) when a facility stores greater than 2,500 pounds of chlorine at any one time.  Phase 1 of a facility upgrade was completed in 2007 which added a separate chlorination building with a gas scrubber.\n\nThe Water Treatment Plant operates and maintains the chlorination system under its Process Safety Management (PSM) program, which was developed to comply with OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.119.  The PSM program is designed to operate and maintain the system and the equipment in a manner that will reduce the possibility of a chlorine release.  There have been no accidental releases or injuries associated with the chlorination system.\n\nIn the event of a chlorine release, the plant has coordinated emergency response efforts with the Mankato Department of Public Safety."
