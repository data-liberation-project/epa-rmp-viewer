      "SummaryText": "The flour mill has chlorine gas on site in the form of one ton containers. We work together with our\n\nchlorine supplier(Repco) and the local fire department to establish effective procedures for\n\nan immediate response and action in the event of an accidental release of chlorine gas. We have\n\nwritten procedures for the handling of chlorine and conduct annual employee training on the hazards\n\nassociated with chlorine and the safe handling of chlorine. Our chlorine monitoring system monitors\n\nany potential leakage in the chlorine storage areas and near agitator. We are committed to the safety of\n\nour employees and our community. The flour mill provides top quality flour to a number of food\n\ncompanies in the Midwest. We use chlorine gas to bleach certain brands of flour and adjust their\n\npH. We typically store 8 one ton chlorine containers on site of which we have 4 connected and\n\navailable for use at any one time. The containers are stored in an isolated block room. Preventative\n\nmeasures include; training our employees in the safe handling of chlorine, coordinated training with\n\nour local fire department, chlorine monitoring equipment in the chlorine room and in the basement\n\nnear the agitator, emergency shutoff valves, high temperature switch interlock, blower/agitator\n\ninterlock, monitoring and maintenance in coordination with our supplier, Repco. Our\n\npiping is designed for use with chlorine gas and is inspected regularly. We continually strive to\n\nimprove the safety of our employees and community with safe handling and usage of chlorine at\n\nour mill"
