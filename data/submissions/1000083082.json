Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by a qualified refrigeration contractor or employees with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner. We complete daily, periodic and annual inspections of all equipment. In addition we replace SRV's and do Mechanical Integrity Inspections at 5 year intervals. \r\n\r\nManagement of Change\r\nWritten procedures are in place at A Sambado & Son, Inc. to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  We complete annual and 5 year reviews.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\r\n\r\nPre-startup Reviews\r\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at A Sambado & Son, Inc..  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits\r\nA Sambado & Son, Inc. conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.

Anhydrous Ammonia is the greenest and most efficient refrigerant available. It's naturally occurring in our environment.\r\n\r\nThe Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario are included in filing and only summarized here. External Events analysis was included in all PHA's and are typical for the cold storage and processing industry. \r\nTo evaluate the worst case scenarios, alternative release scenario analysis we have used the EPA's RMP*Comp software.  The EPA's Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration was used as a reference.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\r\n\r\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from the largest vessel.  In this scenario Ammonia (anhydrous) is released from the largest High Pressure receiver #5.  The toxic liquid released is assumed to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to evaporate over 10 minutes. All liquid releases can be contained on-site. \r\n\r\nThe alternative release scenario for Ammonia (anhydrous) involves a gas release typical of a compressor shaft seal failure. In normal use compressor shaft seals indicate replacement is needed long before a release would occur.\r\n\r\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.
