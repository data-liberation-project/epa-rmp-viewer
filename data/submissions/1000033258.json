We use a combination of accidental release prevention and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as the environment. \n\n\n\n2.0 Stationary Source and regulated Substances\n\n\n\nThe Louisville Packaging site blends and packages a variety of refrigerant gases. In our process, we use the following chemicals that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release.\n\n\n\nChemical---use of substance\n\n\n\nDifluoroethane---Blending Operation\n\nN-Butane---Blending Operation\n\n\n\nNOTE: N-Butane will be received in a trailer containing a mix between N-Butane and ISO- Pentane. N-Butane makes up around 76% which is about 25,000 lbs. ISO-Pentane makes up around 24% (7920 lbs) which is less than the threshhold of 10,000 lbs. \n\n\n\n3.0 General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nOur company maintains a number of accident prevention programs, which implement specific prevention steps in order to ensure safe operation of all processes. The accident prevention programs in place are in compliance with OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) rule and EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) rule. \n\n\n\nAs part of our prevention efforts, we have implemented the following chemical-specific steps:\n\n\n\n    -Operators trained on processes prior to start up    \n\n        -all new or modified processes have pre-start up safety inspections\n\n    -perform process hazard analysis on new and installed systems\n\n    -materials installed pass quality assurance inspection\n\n    -personnel turnover is controlled to maintain adequate experience and       knowledge for safe operation\n\n    -all processes i"
