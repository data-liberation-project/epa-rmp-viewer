It is the goal of the program to reduce the risk to employees and the public of injury or death from accidental releases of chemicals used at the facilities, in particular chlorine gas.\n     The program covers the following areas in individual sections:\n           Management System\n           Employee Participation Plan\n           Process Safety Information\n           Process Hazard Analysis\n           Operating Procedures\n           Training\n           Contractor Safety\n           Pre-Startup Safety Review\n           Mechanical Integrity\n           Management of Change\n           Incident Investigation\n           Emergency Planning and Response\n           Compliance Audits\n     Each of these areas addressed the aspects of controlling the risks associated with the safe handling of chlorine gas at the West Hawaii Utilities Wastewater Treatment Facility.\n     The management system designates the Utilities Manager as the person overall responsibility for the program.  The various other responsibilities are shared between the water and wastewater field engineers.\n     The employee participation plan designates which employees are to be included in reviewing and implementing the other sections of the plan.  It covers all of the remaining sections.  It includes all employees who may be impacted by the use of the chemical.\n     The Process Safety Information includes procedures for reviewing the accuracy of all process diagrams and piping and instrumentation diagrams.  These are to be reviewed and updated by the Field Engineer-Wastewater with assistance from all the operating personnel.\n     The Process Hazard Analysis section outlines the methods to be used for evaluating the hazards associa"

It also provides for continuing training to maintain proficiency in responding to emergencies and safe handling practices.\n     The Contractor Safety section addresses the need to communicate the risks and hazards of the chemical processes to any contractors which may be working in or near the area of the chemical use.\n     The Prestartup Safety section addressed the need to perform a prestarup inspection before beginning the operation of the chemical feed system, either as an initial startup or restart after repairs.\n     The mechanical interity of the equipment and system is verified byusing the procedures of the Mechanical Integrity section.  This outlines the steps that the Field Engineer and Maintenance Mechanic will use to verify that the equipment is always in proper working order and has been maintained as recommended by the manufacturer.\n     The Hot Work Permit section describes the need to monitor the hot work, which may be performed in the designated risk areas.  It details the methods to be followed to prevent damage to the chemical system during hot work operations.\n     The Management of Change section details the procedures to be followed if any process changes or equipment changes reviewed and verified that they will not increase risk to the system by altering the characteristics of the equipment.\n     Any accidenta"

It details the procedures for forming a response team and for reviewing and updating the plans.\n     The Compliance Safety Audit section covers the procdures to be used by the audit team to review all aspects of the program to ensure compliance with the requirements of the plan.\n     All these sections together comprise the risk management plan for West Hawaii Utility Company.\n     The main chemical of concern for West Hawaii Utility Comapany is chlorine gas, which is used a a disinfectant at the WBRWRP.  \n     In completing this plan the worst-case release investigated was for a one-ton container losing all of its contents in 10 minutes at the WBRWRP.  This would affect an area with a radius of 3.0 miles aroung the plant.  The alternate release would be a reduced leak from a container, most likely caused by the breaking off of a valve.  This release would have a duration of 23 minutes and affect an area with a radius of 0.4 mile from the plant.\n     Control and prevention measures which are part of this program include the inspection of all containers delivered to the facilities.  The routine servicing of all components of the metering system are also included.\n     The most likely time for an accidental release would be during container changing operations.  To reduce this possibility, self contained breathing apparatus are made available while changing containers.  This will allow them to make any necessary repairs or adjustments to the systems immediately and therfore limit the amount of any leak.  It will also reduce possible harm to the attending employees.\n     There have been no significant releases from the system over the past five year "
