The same properties that makes chlorine valuable as a water treatment chemical as a water treatment chamical, also makes it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling chlorine.  Overall, the prevention of unnecessary human exposure, reducing the threat to our own personal health as well as our co-worker, and reducing the threat to nearby members of the community is the main goal of incorporating this risk management plan into our dily operations.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.  Safety devices inherent in the design of this facility, with the safe handling procedures that we utilize, and the training of our personnel.\n\nOur Emergency Response Program was originally developed in 1999 with the assistance of Environmental Data Services, Inc and has since been reviewed and the emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of the Mountain Home Fire Department, Then the notification of the Director of Water & Sewer Services , Then notification of the Baxter County 911 System for 911 call out to the affected population.  The Mountain Home Fire Department and Mountain Home Police Department will help to notify and evacuate any potentially affected neighbors by utilizing vehicles with PA Mounted systems.  The 911 System will also notify Baxter County Offices of Emergency Services.\n\nThe Primary purpose of this facility is to Treat the Water by Utilizing the Chemical Chlorine for Disinfection.  Chlorine is received in by indivdual one ton cylinders at the 994 Water Plant Road Location and stored until needed.  Chlorine is fed into the water system by automatic feeders with a vacuum system.  All cylinders operate on a vacuum system.  This vacuum system will prevent the continual operation of the system if there is and increase or decrease in operating pressure on the cylinders or lines.

The maximum amount of chlorine on hand at any one time is 8000 lbs.  2 cylinders are connected online with only 1 cylinder feeding at a time, an automatic switchover valve is connected to the system that allows the feeding cylinder to switch to the second cylinder when the first tank empties.\n\nThe worst-case scenario is failure of our largest storage tank, when filled to the greatest amount allowed, would release 2000 lbs of chlorine from the chlorine storage area at 994 Water plant road location.  If is assumed that the entire contents are released as vapor.  This location is classified as urban.\n\nThis chlorine feed system was constructed in 1991 and is in compliance with all applicable regulations for water treatment facilities.  We have had no accidental releases of chlorine in the last 5 years.  The automatic vacuum system limits the amount (if any) that escapes during operational periods."
