      "SummaryText": "Petal Gas Storage Company (PGS), receives, stores, and distributes natural gas. Utilizing pipelines, compressors, and a storage cavern artificially created in the Petal Salt Dome geologic formation, PGS ensures that a steady reserve of natural gas is available for periods of high demand throughout the Eastern United States. During the storage phase, natural gas is compressed into the salt dome storage cavern to a maximum pressure of 3,250 psi, and the cavern is capable of safely storing 4.2 billion cubic feet of compressed natural gas. The cavern is over 4000 feet below land surface, and is surrounded by a highly compacted, naturally occuring, salt formation. During the distribution phase, natural gas is allowed to flow from the cavern into the pipeline system, through the compressors which regulate the pressure of the gas as it enters the pipeline system. There are no \"processes\" per se at the facility, with the exception of small glycol units which dry the gas as it is released from the cavern. The gas is contacted with Triethylene Glycol (CAS 107211) which absorbs the water from the gas."
