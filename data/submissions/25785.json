If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the Armstrong Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.\n\nThis facility is a farmer owned cooperative.  We sell agricultural products to members and non-members.  We sell NH3 for the sole purpose of fertilization of farm ground.  This facility consists of one 18,000 and one 26,000 gallon tank plumbed together and twenty-five 1000 gallon nurse tanks.\n\nOur worst case scenario would be the sudden release of the two main storage tanks when they were filled to capacity. This facility uses administrative controls of filling tanks to a maximum of 85%.  According to EPA look-up tables, the distance to endpoint would be 6.9 miles with an approximate population of 1720 people.  \n\nOur alternate scenario would be the accidental pull-away by a receiving transport without disconnecting the transfer hose.  According to EPA look-up tables the endpoint would be 1.3 miles with an approximate population of 55 people. This facility has an active mitigation control consisting of an excess flow valve.  All employees working at this facility have been trained on how to respond to this type of scenario.\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rules and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.\n\nWe have never had an accident involving NH3 that caused death, injuries, property or environmental damage or evacuations.\n\nIn the event of an emergency at our NH3 plant, it is our policy to notify the Armstrong Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.  We have discussed this policy with the fire department and members of the fire department have inspected our NH3 facility.\n\nThere are no planned changes of our procedures or policies.\n\n"
