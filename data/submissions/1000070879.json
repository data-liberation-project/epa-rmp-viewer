(Air Liquide) Bayport steam methane reforming (Bayport SMR) process  in located within the Air Liquide Bayport complex  in Pasadena, Texas.  The Bayport SMR process involves the reforming natural gas feedstock into pure hydrogen. Bayport SMR is considered the \"covered process\", as defined under the accidental release prevention regulations, as a \"flammable mixture\" process having  in excess of 10,000 pounds.\n\n \n\nRegulated Chemical\n\nThe SMR process is designed to provide an efficient production of high purity hydrogen product using natural gas feedstock.  Purified hydrogen is sold to Industrial customer(s).  The Bayport Hydrogen Plant also produces steam and electricity, sold directly to nearby industrial customers.  The Bayport SMR is designed for continuous operation and is designed for inherently safe operation.\n\n \n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\n\nAir Liquide's Bayport SMR is covered by EPA's accidental release prevention program regulations and is subject to OSHA's process safety management (PSM) standard.   The Bayport SMR process is closely monitored and controlled to prevent accidental releases to the environment.  \n\nThe flammability of the process makes it necessary to put in place safety precautions to prevent unnecessary human and environmental exposure and to reduce the potential threat to personnel and nearby members of the community.  Air Liquide's policy is to comply with all applicable federal and state rules and regulations. The summary below discusses the process safety system in place to implement the accidental release prevention program.\n\n \n\nProcess Safety Information (PSI)\n\nAir Liquide keeps a variety of technical documents onsite electronically that are used to help maintain safe operation of its processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, equipment design/configuration information, specific chemical "

The covered process underwent an initial process hazard analysis (PHA) in September 2006 and continues to undergo periodic PHA and PHA re-validations at least every five years.  The PHA team consists of members with the appropriate experience to define the hazards.   The PHA team will review findings and develop a resolution action plan for each item, which will be documented, tracked and ultimately closed in the Air Liquide action item tracking system. \n\n \n\nOperating Procedures\n\nAir Liquide maintains written procedures that address various modes of hydrogen purification process operations, such as (1) unit initial startup; (2) unit normal and temporary operations; (3) unit shutdown; (4) emergency shutdown; (5) startup following an emergency shutdown; and (6) process deviation, consequence and action.  These procedures are used by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. These procedures are reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.\n\n \n\nTraining\n\nAir Liquide has implemented a training program for all employees involved in operating the hydrogen purification process.  All employees receive a combination of classroom, computer-based (CBT) and hands-on training that addresses such topic as:  general orientation, site rules and practices, process safety information, normal and emergency operating procedures, health and safety consideration, use of safety procedures and equipment, incident investigation and emergency response.  In addition, all operators are required to attend refresher training at least every three years.  Training is documented and tracked the electronic learning management system.\n\n \n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nAir Liq"

The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests; (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures.  In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process equipment. \n\n \n\nThe MI program assists with the verification and suitability of new and existing process equipment and, as well as quality control of spare parts and modifications to existing process equipment.\n\n \n\nManagement of Change\n\nAir Liquide's management of change (MOC) procedure has established the requirements for ensuring that proposed process or equipment changes or changes indirectly affecting processes are evaluated, approved, and documented prior to implementation through the use of a management of change process.  The MOC procedure outlines the requirements for documenting, evaluating the impact, and approving planned changes  All MOC's are submitted, reviewed by subjective matter specialist (such as Engineering, Risk Management, Operations, Health and Safety), approved, tracked, and closed.  Personnel whose assigned job functions are impacted by the MOC, are briefed and /or trained in the MOC requirements.\n\n \n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\nAir Liquide ensures the safety of new/modified facilities or processes before placing those facilities or processes into service through the use of pre-startup safety reviews (PSSRs).

Compliance audits are conducted at least every three years.  Resolutions to the recommendations are documented, tracked and closed.\n\n \n\nIncident Investigation\n\nAir Liquide defines management systems and establishes the requirements for communicating, investigating and reporting of incidents at all facilities through the use of an Incident Investigation and reporting procedure.  Air Liquide documents incident and subsequent investigation, follow up actions, and closure.  Results of findings and corrective actions are shared with employees who could be affected by the findings. \n\n \n\n Employee Participation\n\nAt the Bayport SMR, employees are expected to participate in accidental release prevention program (PSM/RMP).   Employees are trained on and are provided access to the hydrogen process safety information.  The specific ways an employee can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in the Employee Participation plan.  Forms of participation include being part of a PHA, a PSSR, and/or being involved in incident investigation. participating in the review of the covered process operating procedures annually to ensure they are correct and recommend any necessary changes.\n\n \n\nSafe & Hot Work Permit System\n\nAir Liquide has a safe & hot work permit system in place to help ensure worker and process safety.
