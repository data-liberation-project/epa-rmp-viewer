      "SummaryText": "Introduction\nThe Whiting Clean Energy, Inc (WCE) facility is located in Whiting, Indiana, owned and operated by Primary Energy Inc., operates a Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) system which utilizes anhydrous ammonia for reduction of oxides of nitrogen (NOx) emissions. This anhydrous ammonia is stored in a 13,000-gallon storage tank located at the facility. At full capacity, the tank can store 57,140 pounds of anhydrous ammonia. Since the facility will be storing more than 10,000 lbs of anhydrous ammonia, the storage of anhydrous ammonia is subject to United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) regulations codified in 40CFR Part 68.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is an easily liquefiable colorless gas with a sharp, intensely irritating odor. It is listed by the USEPA as a regulated toxic substance for release prevention.\n\nRelease Prevention and Emergency Response Policy\nPursuant to the Risk Management Plan (RMP) regulations (40 CFR Part 68) and the Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29 CFR 1910.119), Primary Energy Inc. has developed a comprehensive PSM written program to protect employees and the surrounding community from exposure to anhydrous ammonia.  The facility completed a Process Hazards Analysis (PHA) for anhydrous ammonia using the industry standard What-If?/Checklist Analysis developed through the International Institute for Ammonia Refrigeration. The PHA was completed in April 2001 using technical and operations staff from the facility as well as experienced facilitators from URS Corporation, an outside consulting firm.\n\nPrimary Energy Inc. is committed to the safe operation of SCR anhydrous ammonia system at the WCE facility. Primary Energy Inc.\u00bfs implementation of the PSM program includes employee education in the hazards of anhydrous ammonia and measures that can be used to reduce employee and community exposure to accidental releases of ammonia. The plan includes preventive maintenance programs (mechanical integr"

The program also includes specific requirements for safe work practices (such as safe approaches to welding and similar hot work) and safety requirements for contractors who may be hired to work on the systems. The PSM program also includes a program for the evaluation of contractors. \n\nThe PSM written program incorporates the WCE facility\u00bfs comprehensive emergency response plan in concert with the adjoining B. P. Amoco Whiting Refinery facility.  The PSM places special emphasis on handling accidental releases of ammonia and coordination of emergency response with local fire departments and other emergency response organizations such as the Lake County LEPC.\n\nPrimary Energy Inc. completed a compliance audit of the PSM program in the third quarter of 2002. \n\nAs part of the RMP requirements, Primary Energy Inc. undertook a review of the potential offsite consequences of the accidental releases from the 13,000-gallon anhydrous ammonia storage tank.  Although such a release is highly unlikely, the regulation requires this review. \n\nWorst-case Release Scenario\nAs required by USEPA regulations, the worst-case release scenario was assumed to be the complete loss of contents of the 13,000-gallon storage tank containing 57,000 lbs of anhydrous ammonia.  In this analysis no passive mitigation measures were assumed. The USEPA guidance for defining a worst-case release scenario for unmitigated release of gas is to estimate the release rate over a 10-minute period of the largest quantity resulting from a pipe or vessel failure.  Thus, the ammonia emission rate from the worst-case rel"

The model predicted a downwind distance of 2.8 miles as the distance to the toxic endpoint due to the specified worst-case release. Based on LandView III output, the total population within the potential exposure area is 30,000 with the following public receptors being potentially impacted \u00bf schools, residences, recreation areas and industrial areas. It should be noted that the potential offsite impact due to a release is greatly minimized on account of the location of the WCE facility which is bounded by Lake Michigan on the north and east. Since almost 40 percent of the area within the circle of influence defined by the distance to the toxic endpoint as the radius is over Lake Michigan with the majority of the remaining area of influence bounded by an industrial estate, potential offsite impacts are greatly reduced.\n\nPrimary Energy Inc. employees thoroughly inspect the anhydrous ammonia system per the recommendations of the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) and the provisions of the written Process Safety Management (PSM). This greatly minimizes the chance that the tank will fully discharge its contents in a release and minimizes the potential for an offsite impact.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario\nFor the Whiting facility, the alternative release scenario was assumed to be the structural failure of a 2-inch pipe filled with anhydrous ammonia liquefied under pressure at 25 psig beyond the confines of the concrete dike. Assumed active mitigation (e.g., use of emergency shutdown systems etc.) starts within a reasonable time after the accidental release begins. For this analysis, the total release duration is assumed to be the time period from the beginning of the release event until the release is totally contained. The total"

Thus, the ammonia emission rate from the alternative release scenario is given as the loss of 18,000 lbs of ammonia averaged over a 15-minute period, (i.e., 1,000 lbs/min).\n\nThe WCE facility has installed a water curtain system that is designed to mitigate accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. The system consists of spray nozzles three feet above the roof. In the event of an accidental release, water spray is directed downward so that the entire perimeter of the roof is covered with water. The water absorbs ammonia molecules forming ammonium hydroxide. However, no experimental studies determining the percent reduction in the release rate due to the use of such water spray systems are known. Therefore, the percent reduction in the ammonia release rate is not estimated for this RMP. The release rate of 1,000 lbs/min is used for the OCA. \n\nUSEPA\u00bfs public-domain RMP*Comp model was used to determine the distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/lit (or 200 ppm). The model predicted a downwind distance of 0.2 miles as the distance to the toxic endpoint due to the specified alternative release.

The scope of the PSM program encompasses various facets of release prevention; e.g., it engenders employee participation, increases employee awareness about the hazards of handling anhydrous ammonia, establishes safe standard operating procedures and enhances access to process safety information. In April 2001, Primary Energy Inc. performed a HAZOP Process Hazards Analysis (PHA) on the SCR anhydrous ammonia system with the help of outside consultants in order to review operating procedures, equipment maintenance schedules, operational safeguards and identify action items to render the process safer. Following the PHA, the WCE facility developed a written PSM program with the help of outside consultants. The written PSM program provides the procedural backbone for safe operability functions (i.e., continual review of safe operating procedures, review of mechanical integrity of equipment, improved maintenance schedules, increased training, better access to process safety information and hazard awareness for both employees and onsite contractors, and effective emergency response planning), and allows Primary Energy Inc. to maintain, review and evaluate the program on a periodic basis.\n\nFive-year Accident History\nThe SCR anhydrous ammonia process became operational in the first quarter of 2002.
