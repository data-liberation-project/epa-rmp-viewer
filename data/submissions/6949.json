An outline of the Risk Management Program is provided in Figure ES-1. \n  The disinfection process (i.e., chlorine system) is covered under this regulation at the Jefferson\n  Parish West Bank Water Treatment Plant (WTP).\n\n  To meet the regulation requirements, this binder contains useful information on the chlorine\n  system. The technical information herein may be used as a training reference in initial and\n  recurring operator and maintenance training. Training on process fundamentals, operations, and\n  maintenance, coupled with the recommended process modifications discussed below, will reduce the potential\n  hazards to plant personnel and the surrounding community.\n\n  An Emergency Response Program and an Incident Investigation Program are included. These two programs should be\n  an integral part of both initial and recurring training. A Risk Management Plan (RMP), in the\n  format required by the EPA, is included at the end of the main body of this\n  document.  It consists of a summary of data elements as required by EPA for inclusion in a\n  public access database. The RMP is intended to inform the public of the West Bank WTP's\n  proactive stance toward protection of the environment and the surrounding community.\n\n  Hazard Assessment\n  The Hazard Assessment is comprised of a Worst Case and Alternative Release Scenario for the\n  chlorine system, as well as a 5-Year Accident History for the same. The Hazard Assessment was\n  conducted as an initial screening procedure as part of determining which Program Level (I, II, or\n  III) the West Bank WTP falls.  Residences lie within the EPA-defined endpoint concentrations of\n  the plant's Worst-Case releases. Therefore, the plant is ineligible for Program I.  The West Bank\n  WTP is operated by public "

The Hazard Assessment is provided in\n  Sections 1 through 3.\n\n  Worst Case Scenario\n  The Worst Case Scenario is defined as a ton container (2,000 pounds) of chlorine being released\n  by a catastrophic event within a 10 minute duration. A mitigation factor of 0.55 is allowed for\n  this process due to the building which encloses the chlorine system. This scenario was\n  developed and modeled using the EPA approved RMP Comp model. The toxic endpoint for\n  chlorine was determined to be 0.9 miles by RMP Comp at the 3 ppm concentration specified by\n  the EPA.  It should be noted that at this concentration, a person may be exposed for up to one\n  hour without suffering permanent injuries (ERPG-2).\n\n  Alternative Release Scenario\n  The Alternative Release Scenario of chlorine was also modeled using RMP Comp. An estimation\n  of approximately 348 pounds of chlorine gas released was derived from the scenario of a\n  vacuum regulator check unit failure.  The toxic end point for the ARS was determined to be 0.30\n  miles by RMP Comp.\n\n  5 Year Accident History\n  Two (2) qualifying chlorine accidents has been documented within the past 5 years.  In 1996, a\n  minor release of chlorine occurred resulting in two (2) on site injuries.  In 1997, a second incident\n  occurred resulting in a small release, during which one (1) person was injured on site.\n\n  Management Program\n  The Management Program consists of the Document Management System described below:\n\n  Document Management System\n  A Document Management System was established to attribute responsibility for the\n  development, implementation, and maintenance of the Risk Management Program. The\n  Program must be updated every three years, or any time a covered process undergoes a physical\n  or administrative modification.  The Document Management System is largely a function of the\n  Risk Management Program Team, descr"

Each has an entire chapter devoted to it in this RMP, and is described in\n  more detail below.\n\n  Safety Information\n  Safety Information is divided between Chemical Safety Information and Process Safety Information.

This information was compiled from numerous sources, and is intended to be a one-stop source for the reader seeking data on this compound. The physical data will provide useful\n  information in the inevitable event the plant process is modified, thereby requiring revisited\n  dense gas dispersion modeling.  It is also imperative that plant operators and managers are\n  appraised of the potential health hazards and exposure limits associated with this chemical.\n\n  Process Safety Information\n  Process Safety Information was meticulously compiled on each system studied. Basic\n  specifications on each process are included in this document for easy reference. Details such as\n  Maximum Intended Inventory, Safe Upper and Lower Temperatures, Safe Upper and Lower\n  Pressures, and Codes and Standards Used to Design, Build and Operate the Process are\n  provided in this section.

The Hazard Review technique\n  used was a hybrid Hazard and Operability Study (HAZOP), in the form of a \"What If\" analysis.\n  The \"What If\" was developed from HAZOP experience at similar chlorine systems. The Hazard\n  Review team consisted of plant management, process operating and maintenance experts,\n  outside process design engineers, and consultants knowledgeable in the Hazard Review process\n  itself.\n\n  Recommendations\n  The result of the Hazard Review is a set of recommendations for the plant to implement.  Rule\n  40 CFR 68.50 requires Jefferson Parish to ensure that problems identified are \"resolved in a\n  timely manner.\"  For those items that can not be promptly resolved, it is recommended that a\n  schedule be developed that addresses those issues, with responsibility for each assigned to the\n  appropriate personnel.  \n  Please note that these are not the recommendations of Camp Dresser & McKee, Inc.  Rather,\n  they are recommendations developed by the Hazard Review Team with a consensus from all\n  team members.  CDM's role was to facilitate the Hazard Review process. \n  Recommendations are summarized below:\n  ~ Examine design of scrubber as possible leak mitigation and/or use of alternative\n      disinfectants.\n  ~ Evaluate cylinder loading/unloading system improvements (currently use forklift).\n  ~ Develop additional empty cylinder storage capacity and protection.\n  ~ Develop forklift/combustible storage area separate from chlorine facility.\n  ~ Place redundant detectors in chlorine room.\n  ~ Install an exterior alarm/warning light system interlocked with chlorine detectors.\n  ~ Label piping with contents and flow directions.\n  ~ Review venting system on vacuum regulators (follow manufacturers recommendations).\n  ~ Locate SCBAs in a more accessible area.\n  ~ Turn cylinder valves off and cap in the event of hurricane/floodi"
