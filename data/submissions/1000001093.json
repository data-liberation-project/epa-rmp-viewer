Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Virginia Occupational Safety and Health (VOSH) procedures have served as guidelines and standards in the development of this program and are adhered to.  The Plant emergency response policy involves the creation of an emergency response plan which will incorporate response capabilities available both internally and from the community.\n\nB.\tThe Carvins Cove Filtration Plant was established in 1946 to disinfect and treat drinking water for the City of Roanoke as well as selected areas of other localities.  The Plant is located at 8192 Angel Lane in Roanoke County, Virginia.  Chlorine gas is used to disinfect finished drinking water.  The chlorination system includes a chlorination supply room which contains gas chlorine cylinders, the initial components of the gaseous chlorine distribution system and safety equipment; an instrument room which contains a flow recorder, various electrical panels and additional safety equipment.  The amount of chlorine actually utilized is two one-ton cylinders of chlorine with two additional cylinders serving as reserves.  There are approximately 10 other one-ton cylinders in storage.   The facility is manned 16 hours per day by water treatment operators with approximately 10 employees on daylight shift and 3 employees on the night sheet.  All process areas are continuously monitored through the use of control center monitoring as well as hourly walk-throughs by employees.\n\n\nC.\tThe offsite consequence analysis includes the consideration of two chlorine release scenarios, identified as \u00c2\u00bfworst case release\u00c2\u00bf and \u00c2\u00bfalternative release scenario\u00c2\u00bf as well as one \u00c2\u00bfworst case scenario\u00c2\u00bf for chlorine gas.

The alternative release submitted has been deemed by the Water Authority as a scenario which is more likely to occur than the worst case scenario.  \n\nEPA guidelines and tables were utilized in determining the distance traveled by the hypothetical chlorine released before its concentration decreases to the \u00c2\u00bftoxic endpoint\u00c2\u00bf.  The residential population affected was determined through overlaying a circle with a radius corresponding to the toxic endpoint distance over a map and utilizing U.S. Census Bureau data to develop accurate estimates of the potentially affected population.  The atmospheric data used for both scenarios was that found in the EPA\u00c2\u00bfs Offsite Consequence Analysis literature.\n\nWhen the worst case scenario for chlorine was performed using the EPA defined assumptions, a toxic endpoint of 0.92 miles and an estimate of residential population potentially affected of was obtained.  The EPA defined reduction for the presence of an enclosure of 0.55 was utilized in deriving this distance.  The alternative release scenario involves the assumed rupture of the flexible connections connected to two one-ton cylinders through an accidental action of an employee or degradation of the line.  The amount of the chlorine calculated to be released was 4000 lbs. at an average rate over one hour of 240.0 lbs./min.  The typical meteorological data used were Stability E, wind speed of 3.0 m/s, average air temperature of 62oF, and 63% average humidity.  The estimated distance to the toxic endpoints was calculated to be 0.20 miles.  The presence of the enclosure was also considered to derive this distance.  \n\n\n\nD.\tThe general Water Authority accidental release prevention program is based on the following key elements:\n\u00c2\u00bf\tHigh level of operator training\n\u00c2\u00bf\tPre"
