The SCRWTP receives raw water from a well filled located north of the Golden Gate Canal in the vicinity of 7th Street SW and 10th Street SE and reverse osmosis wellfield located on the North east side and South side of the water treatment plant. A total of 14 million gallons of ground storage capacity is located on the plant site.  \n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\nCollier County Water Department is in compliance with the Chemical Accident and Prevention Provisions 40 CFR 68.  The Water Department in coordination with the Risk Management Department regularly conducts reviews of the chlorination system as well as administrative, technical, operating and maintenance procedures.  The SCRWTP has both passive and active mitigation by containing the chlorine in an enclosed building and an emergency chlorine gas scrubber. \n\nEmergency Response Program\nIn regards to emergency response all employees at the SCRWTP are trained in emergency protocols if an accidental release was to occur based on the facilities written emergency response plan.  The Water Department also regularly meets with the local fire department and hazmat team to make them aware of the locations of chemicals on site and quantities stored.  These meetings involve a detailed discussion of a release scenario and the roles that would be played by Plant Personnel and Emergency Responders.  This cooperation provides additional resources to the facility in the event of an emergency release in regards to stopping the release and community emergency response activities.\n\nRegulated Substances\nThe primary activity at the SCRWTP is to treat raw water to meet all potable drinking water standards.  Chlorine is the only 40 CFR 68 regulated substance at the facility.  Chlorine is present in a maximum quantity if 13 one ton cylinders consisting of compressed liquefied "

The purpose of its usage is as a disinfectant in accordance with water treatment requirements.\n\nFive Year Accident History\nNo accidents involving a regulated substance have occurred in the past five years.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nThe Process Hazard Analysis team most recently met in February 2011.  Improvements to be implemented as a result of this meeting are as follows:\n1. In the event of an accidental release to be better prepared in regards to response\na) Update Emergency Action Plan to establish a two mile safe zone and provide alternate   meeting points.\nb) Update Emergency Action plan to address contractors and personnel tracking on site\nc) Enforce sign in/out policy for all persons not assigned to the plant\n2. To increase visitor awareness of process chemicals on-site\na) Make available copies of RMP safety program to all visitors / contractors on site\nb) Provide awareness training to Public Utilities Employees that regularly visit the SCRWTP, but are not regularly assigned.\n"
