      "SummaryText": "Missouri Smelting Technology, Inc. (MOST, Inc.) is a secondary aluminum smelter that utilizes chlorine to treat molten aluminum.  The chlorine treatment system utilizes liquid chlorine stored in 1-ton cylinders.  A maximum inventory of three (3) 1-ton cylinders, or 6,000 pounds is stored onsite at any time.\n\nThe facility has taken the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68.  Employees are trained to recognize the hazards of the process and all changes to the process are reviewed to ensure that the safety, health, and environmental consequences of the change are addressed prior to the implementation of the change.  The facility is also subject to OSHA's PSM rule.\n\nThere have not been any accidental releases of chlorine over the last five years with offsite consequences.  Nevertheless, the facility has an emergency action plan and written operating procedures that address emergency shutdown procedures.  Evacuation drills are periodically conducted and the facility communicates regularly with the local fire department and LEPC.\n\nAs a result of our most recent process hazard analysis, several modifications have been implemented or are in the process of being implemented to reduce the overall risk.  Included are the development of new operating procedures and modification of existing operating procedures.  In addition, a site security plan is being developed.\n\nMost's chlorine treatment system was developed utilizing numerous safety checks and release mitigation mechanisms.  The automatic shutoff valves will shut down the chlorine feed system in seconds in the case of a release.  Mechanical integrity inspections and preventive maintenance ensure the operational integrity of the process.\n"
