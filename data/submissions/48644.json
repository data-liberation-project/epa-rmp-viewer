Ammonia is not produced at the  facility. It is received via rail and cargo trucks as a liquefied compressed gas. Anhydrous ammonia is blended with water to produce aqueous ammonia at the facility. Ammonia is stored in ASME code pressure vessels and the storage and handling system meets OSHA, EPA and ANSI K61.1 requirements.\n\n3. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nAirgas Specialty Products Inc. has implemented the accidental release prevention requirements set forth in 40 CFR part 68 and Process Safety Management requirements set forth in 29 CFR 1910.119.\n\n4. Five-year Accident History\nThe S. St. Paul, MN facility has not had any RMP defined accidents in the past five years.  In addition, the facility has not had any Reportable Quantity (RQ) releases in that period.\n\n5.  Emergency Action Plan\nAirgas Specialty Products Inc. has a written Emergency Action Plan to manage accidental releases of ammonia. The plan includes procedures for informing all onsite personnel, notification of emergency response agencies and neighbors. It also includes suggested personal protective equipment, e"
