Box 550\nBethlehem, GA 30620\n\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees that Harrison Poultry, Bethlehem, Georgia is complying with OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard (called Process Safety Management or PSM), Title 29 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 1910.119, and EPA's Risk Management Program regulations (called RM Program), Title 40 CFR Part 68, to deal with the risks involved with the storage, handling, and processing of hazardous chemicals. In this way, we promote overall plant, worker, and public safety. These programs enable our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents. Overall, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, and illnesses and avoid physical property damage. Our safety programs are applied to any activity involving hazardous chemicals including any use, storage, manufacturing, handling, or the on-site movement of such vessels which are interconnected and separate vessels which are located such that a hazardous chemical could be involved in a potential release shall be considered a single process.\n\nOur safety programs prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices which govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment. These rules are detailed and improved as necessary. They are also communicated to and accepted by all employees at the facility.\n\nWORST CASE SCENARIO:\n\nFailure of the high pressure receiver containing 14,550 lbs of ammonia with the receiver quantity limited to 80% of the vessel capacity by facility procedures resulting in a ten minute release. Under the worst-case weather conditions, ammonia could travel 2.2 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public. This scenario is unlikely for the foll"

      "SummaryText": "owing reasons: worst-case weather conditions are uncommon; the vessel located in a protected area below the evaporative condensers, was recently installed with all new valves and piping to industry standards for the manufacture and quality control of pressure vessels, thus a mechanical failure is unlikely; ammonia is not corrosive in this service; pressure safety valves limit operating pressure in this vessel; the accident prevention program in place at the facility including the mechanical integity program for regular maintenance, inspection and testing, and replacement of equipment, if necessary; and the emergency response plan and equipment in place at the facility.\n\nALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCERNARIO:\n\nFailure of a compressor or high pressure cutout switch causes a safety valve to release ammonia to the atmosphere at a rate of 26 lbs, per minute for 60 minutes before detection and control, resulting in a 1560 lbs of an ammonia release. Under common weather conditions, ammonia could travel .1 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public. This particular case was chosen as an alternative scenario because of th number of compressors with pressure switches that could be stuck or possibly mechanically fail. This scenario is unlikely for the following reasons: travel and activity within the compressor room is restricted; the facility accident prevention program in place including operating procedures require maintenance personnel to be present 24 hours a day, and the mechanical integrity program for regular maintenance, inspection, and testing, and the replacement of equipment if necessary; and the emergency response plan and equipment in place at the facility.\n\nACCIDENT HISTORY:\n\nThere were no reportable accidents in the past five years. Beyond those five years there were two reportable accidents, and only one resulted in a minor injury to one worker.\n\nOn July 6, 1999, a holiday period, 125 lbs was relesed during a ten minute interval with no kn"

      "SummaryText": "own risks or required evacuation.\n\nOn March 29, 1999, a vessel overpressure occurred causing a oil pot's safety valve to release approximately 200 pounds of ammonia gas to the atmosphere. The release during working hours required a plant evacuation and one worker incurred minor injuries.\n\nWithin the past five years, the ammonia refrigeration processes have had no accidental releases that have caused offsite impacts provided in the risk management program rule {40 CFR 68.10(b)(1)}.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM: \n\nThis facility emergency response program is based on the OSHA requirements for Emergency Action Plans (29 CFR 1910.38 and 1910.119) This plan is coordinated with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and the local fire department. We conduct annual drills for implementation of the emergency response plan at the facility with the participation of the LEPC and the fire department. The facility has an action plant to alert the community of an emergency. The last training exercise at the plant was on January 22, 2005."
