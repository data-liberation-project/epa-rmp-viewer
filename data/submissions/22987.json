Ammonia falls under the RMP Program 3 prevention program, which is identical \nto the OSHA PSM program.  EPA has stated that if the process is in compliance with \nOSHA PSM, it is in compliance with RMP Program 3.  Thus, Kraft's ammonia PSM has \nbeen reviewed and determined to be complete for the RMP document. \n\nThere are several aspects of the prevention program that are key:\n\n1.\tThe Utility Service Area design (USA) serves as an excellent safeguard for \nplant personnel because it greatly reduces the amount of ammonia piping \ninside occupied rooms.  Since most of the pipe work is out of the way of \npeople and the machinery and so there is less of a chance of an ammonia \nrelease.\n\n2.\tThe plant maintains good training, certification and employee awareness of \noperating procedures. \n\n3.\tAn electronic control monitoring system is in place for monitoring the \nentire engine room process.  \n\n5.0\tFive-year Accident History\n\nThe review of this facility's accident history includes the following range of dates: June 22, \n1994 - June 21, 1999.  There have been no releases at this facility as defined in 40 CFR \nPart 68.42(a).\n\n6.0\tEmergency Response Program \n\nAs mentioned earlier, this facility has developed an emergency response in which plant \nemployees are divided into various management and response teams.  There are eight in-\nplant contacts for an emergency, a list of these contacts can be found in the Emergency \nResponse Plan.  There are also back-up personnel in the event that the primary incident \nresponse personnel cannot be contacted.  The emergency response plan includes \ninformation about the frequency of employee emergency response training, as well as a \ndetailed description of the training content.  There are also specific procedures to follow in \nthe event of a fire"

The SIC code \nfor the primary process at this facility is 2023.  This facility is capable of producing various \ndairy products including cheese for consumer intake.  Many areas of the plant are \nrefrigerated to preserve the dairy products. Some of these areas include coolers, chillers, \nstorage tanks and some processes.  The plant also produces some pasta products. \n\nKraft Foods has one regulated substance under 40 CFR 68, anhydrous ammonia, at this \nlocation.  Ammonia is used as a cooling agent for the refrigeration of the food products in \nthe various areas described above.\n\nThe ammonia threshold for triggering applicability to 40 CFR 68 is 10,000 pounds. The \nquantity of ammonia stored on-site is approximately 115,300 pounds. Thus, 40 CFR 68 is \napplicable to Kraft Foods in Springfield, MO.\n\n3.0\tWorst-case and Alternative Release Scenarios\nThe ammonia refrigeration system has associated hazards that can potentially affect on-site \nemployees and the general public if there is a release from the system. Although the \nalternative release scenario is more likely, the US EPA requires one worst-case and one \nalternative release scenario be reported for each regulated chemical. Described below are \nthe associated hazards and the worst-case and alternative release scenarios for each \nregulated chemical.\n\nAmmonia \n\nAmmonia is classified as a Group 2 Refrigerant per ASHRAE Standard 34-1989.  The \ndominant characteristic of this chemical is its toxicity.  It is a self-alarming chemical by its \ndistinctive pungent odor.  Due to this odor, persons exposed to ammonia vapor will not \nvoluntarily stay in"
