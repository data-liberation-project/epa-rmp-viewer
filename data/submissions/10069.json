This Gulf Coast Fabrication LLC site is located at 13151 Road E. Bay St. Louis, with geographic coordinates of -90o 1' 28\" longitude and 30o 0' 36\" latitude.  Daily operational activities of this facility include the manufacture, fabrication, and repair of barges and marine vessels.  Fabrication processes include steel plate processing, welding, painting, blasting and pipe fitting.  The facility is regulated under the provisions of SARA Title III.  Gulf Coast Fabrications LLC is registered with a SIC code of 3731, and NAICS codes of 33661 and 336611.  Halter Maine Group, Inc. acts as the corporate parent of Gulf Coast Fabrication LLC.  Gulf Coast Fabrication LLC prides itself on being a vibrant member of the Bay St. Louis economy, providing jobs and products for economic expansion.\n\nGulf Coast Fabrications LLC incorporates a comprehensive safety program in all standard operational procedures, which emphasizes individual responsibility. Each facility maintains a full time Safety / Environmental Manager to insure successful implementation of the program.  A corporate Environmental Coordinator is responsible for directing company policy in a manner which emphasizes a firm commitment to the highest standards of safety for the regular employees, contract employees, subcontractors, visitors, and the surrounding population.  While the corporate safety program covers many of the processes involved in shipbuilding, only the propane process on-site meets the threshold quantity (310000 pounds) requiring an EPA risk management plan under the Clean Air Act, section 112(r).\n\nThe propane is filled, serviced, and maintained by Blossman Gas, Inc., located at 943 Hwy 90 Waveland MS.

A company representative is responsible for administration of all documentation regarding tank maintenance.  Maintenance is on an as needed basis, which is determined by the delivery driver's inspection.  A certified service technician provided by Blossman Gas, Inc. performs all tank maintenance.  The service technician is specially trained in propane tanks and distribution systems.  The tanks are ASME (American Society of Mechanical Engineers) certified, using brass valves that are kept in the open position; to minimize wear.  Emergency response procedures are reinforced through monthly training exercises.  The delivery truck's propane transfer process is designed with both manual emergency shutdown or through pressure feedback features, so that only the amount in the hose can be lost during a transfer mishap.\n\nThe properties of propane, which contribute to its usefulness as a fuel, also contribute to the need for safety precautions.  Propane possesses a CAS# of 74-98-6, a molecular structure of CH3CH2CH3, a NIOSH/OSHA exposure limit of 1000 ppm, a lower explosion limit (LEL) of 2100 ppm, and a boiling point of negative 44oF.  This low boiling point allows for rapid expansion from liquid to vapor thus producing extremely cold temperatures and the possibility of frostbite.  Propane is liquefied under pressure and is stored and transferred in its liquid state.  Propane is a colorless, odorless gas with a vapor density 1.5 times greater than air.  Therefore it has a tendency to settle in low areas when released to the atmosphere.  Foul smelling compounds are added to facilitate human sensory sensitivity as a safety consideration.\n\nThe explosive nature and useful fuel properties of propane are the same, ignition with an oxidizer, most commonly ambient air.  It is therefore paramount that there are no devices or equipment that, because of their modes of "

The National Fire Protection Association, in conjunction with the propane industry, has promulgated NFPA 58 as a standard for safe storage and handling of liquefied petroleum gases.\n\nWorst Case Scenario\nThe worst case release scenario for the facility would be a simultaneous failure of several tanks (considered a single process) on site, causing the release of 16960 pounds of propane, (assuming all tanks were 80% full.) Blossman Gas, Inc. policy limits the maximum filling capacity of this tank to 80% at 60oF to allow for liquid expansion.  It is assumed that the entire contents find a source of ignition, with only a portion in the resulting vapor cloud explosion.  The estimated distance to 1 psi overpressure is 0.2 miles (0.3 kilometers).   It is assumed that the atmospheric stability class is F, when solar radiation is relatively weak and air near the surface has less of a tendency to rise resulting in less turbulence. In this case, the atmosphere is considered stable or less turbulent with weak winds.  A wind speed of 3.4 miles/hour (1.5 meters/second) and a temperature of 77oC (25oC) is used with this scenerio.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario\nThe alternative release scenario would be a transfer hose release under slightly different environmental parameters.  The transfer hose is 150 feet by 1 inch in diameter, thereby releasing 25.94 pounds of propane.  The estimated distance to 1 psi overpressure is 0.01 miles (0.02 kilometers).  There is no offsite population within this area.  It is assumed that the atmospheric stability class is D, representing conditions of neutral stability or moderate turbulence.  Neutral conditions are associated with relatively strong wind speeds and moderate solar radiation.  A wind speed of 6.7 miles/hour (3 meters/second) and a temperature of 77oC (25oC) is assumed with this scenario.\n\nAccident History and Emergency Response\nDu"
