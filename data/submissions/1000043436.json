Ammonia is a hazardous substance that must be handled properly in order to prevent accidental releases and injuries.  It is the policy of the McLane Foodservice facility located in Tracy, California to conduct all operations (including the ammonia refrigeration system) in a safe manner.  This policy extends to all employees and contractors at the facility.  McLane Foodservice implements this policy towards chemical and general safety through on-going employee participation, training, written operating procedures, maintenance, inspections, safety committee meetings, and safety reviews/evaluations.  These programs are in effect at the facility to prevent the accidental release of ammonia.  In the event of an ammonia accident, the facility has an Emergency Action Plan to notify the appropriate authorities and safely evacuate the facility.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\n\nMcLane Foodservice is located at 800 East Pescadero Avenue in Tracy, California.  The facility is situated approximately ? mile south of Interstate 205.  There have been numerous owners of the facility since operations began in 1990, with McLane Foodservice assuming ownership in Fall 2006.  The area immediately surrounding the facility is commercial.\n\n\n\nThe primary business of McLane Foodservice is to provide refrigerated warehousing and storage for various food products.  In order to conduct operations, the facility maintains a refrigeration system containing approximately 18,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, a regulated substance.  The refrigeration system, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, and then back to high pressure liquid) in order provide refrigeration for dock operations, cooler/freezer storage, and glycol u"

Typical operating conditions range from 4 psig on the low pressure side of the system to 130 psig on the high side of the system.  \n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nIn order to operate the ammonia refrigeration system, the facility complies with the following risk management regulations:\n\n\n\n1) OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM);\n\n2) EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP); and\n\n3) California Accidental Release Prevention Program (CalARP).  \n\n\n\nThese regulations impose numerous requirements on the facility to ensure the safety of the public and on-site workers.  The following summarizes the key compliance programs that have been implemented by McLane Foodservice to prevent the accidental release of ammonia from the facility.  The Operating Procedures program ensures that the ammonia system is operated in a safe manner.  The Training program ensures that personnel fully understand how to perform their jobs in a safe manner.  The Mechanical Integrity program ensures that the ammonia system is in proper working condition based upon routine testing, inspections, and maintenance according to manufacturer's specifications and industry standards.  The Management of Change program ensures that process modifications are implemented in a safe manner.  The Pre-Startup Safety Review program ensures that adequate safety measures are in place before ammonia is introduced into a process.  The Hot Work Permit program ensures that McLane Foodservice's employees and contractors perform hot work (e.g. welding) in a safe manner.  The Contractor Safety program ensures that contractors understand the hazards of ammonia and must take specified precautions to safely complete job requirements.\n\n\n\nIt is important to note that the refrigeration system has been designed with several safety features to prevent the accidental release of ammonia.  For example, the compressors are equipped with safety mechanisms that will cause t"

Also, level indicators, alarms, and switches are installed in key points within the system to monitor the supply of liquid ammonia and to ensure that a vessel is not overfilled.  The facility has also installed ammonia sensors at strategic locations throughout the facility.  An off-site alarm company monitors the ammonia detection system while the facility is unmanned.  In the event of a release while the facility is unmanned, the off-site alarm company will notify the McLane Foodservice General Manager.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nEPA's RMP regulation defines \"accident\" as the following:\n\n\n\n\"The release must be from a covered process and involve a regulated substance held above its threshold quantity in the process.\n\n\n\nThe release must have caused at least one of the following:\n\n\n\n?    On-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage (?68.42(a)); or\n\n?    Known offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place (?68.42(a)).\"\n\n\n\nA review of the facility's accident history revealed that there have been no significant releases of ammonia that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 100 pounds in the last five years (June 2009 - June 2014). In addition, there have been no releases of ammonia that meet the RMP definition of \"accident\" as described above.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe facility has an Emergency Action Plan (plan) in effect at the facility.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:  \n\n\n\n-    save lives;\n\n-    minimize and avoid injuries;\n\n-    protect the environment; and\n\n-    minimize property damage.\n\n\n\nSince facility personnel will not respond to an ammonia release at the facility that poses a health or safety threat, the Plan provides the notification procedures and evacuation routes for emergencies that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year to ensure comp"

Facility personnel receive annual training regarding the emergency procedures.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nThe Process Hazard Analysis Revalidation, performed in August 2011, generated mitigation measures (recommendations) to improve safety at the McLane Foodservice facility located in Tracy, California.  The mitigation measures include additional training, key maintenance-related tests/inspection, and enhanced emergency response policies and procedures.  The McLane Foodservice safety committee is planning to complete several items, including the recommendations, over the next year, as a continual effort to provide a safe work environment for their employees.  These changes include the following items:\n\n\n\n1.Continue to train all employees in the facility Safety Plan/Programs.\n\n\n\n2.Continue to have employee involvement in Safety Plan Development.\n\n\n\n3.Continue employee involvement through safety team participation.\n\n\n\n4.Continue internal and external safety audits/inspections and implement changes as needed.\n\n"
