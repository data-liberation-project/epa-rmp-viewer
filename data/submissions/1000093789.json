This procedure states that \"safety is a primary concern and a core value\" and that \"it is the policy of the St. Gabriel Plant management that safety is a definite job requirement at every level of the organization\".\r\n   \r\nRelevant to the Risk Management Program are the following Plant Procedures:\r\n\r\n      M-1 Risk Management Program (RMP) Compliance \r\nThis procedure is to provide a USEPA Risk Management Program overview.

These analyses are conducted on unit equipment as well as processes and procedures.  In selecting a worst-case release scenario, the facility also considered (1) smaller quantities of regulated substances handled at higher process temperatures or pressure or (2) the proximity of a regulated substance in relation to the facility boundary.  Additionally, failure scenarios identified in the Process Hazard Analysis were considered for the selection and evaluation of the alternative release scenario.\r\n\r\nSyngenta also has comprehensive procedures for inspection and maintenance of equipment.  The Syngenta Maintenance Department maintains a Preventive/Predictive Maintenance (PM/PDM) Manual.  This comprehensive manual documents the system used to ensure that maintenance and inspections are conducted effectively and efficiently, and that closure is attained on recommendations resulting from these activities.  The PM/PDM incorporates inspection plans designed to \"enhance safety, environmental integrity, operational reliability, and protection for plant personnel and the surrounding community\".\r\n\r\nSyngenta also conducts extensive employee training.
