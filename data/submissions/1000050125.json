      "SummaryText": "Cathay Industries (USA) Inc. is a manufacturer of synthetic iron oxides for magnetic storage media, and food and cosmetic grade color pigments.  One of the raw materials used in this process is agricultural grade anhydrous ammonia (anhydrous means without water).  Approximately 80% of all ammonia produced is used in agriculture as a nitrogen source for corn and a protein source in livestock feeds.  Other common uses for ammonia are: metal treating, pharmaceuticals, synthetic textile fibers, plastics, water treatment, pollution control devices and commercial refrigeration systems.  Anhydrous Ammonia is classified as a non-flammable gas with a reportable spill quantity of 100 pounds.  Cathay uses detailed procedures and employee training to maintain the safe operation of this system.  Detection sensors are strategically located to alert personnel of leaks. Remotely operated shut off valves, internal tank automatic isolation valves, and a remotely operated water deluge system minimizes the effect of a failed component.  Cathay participates in the Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC), and invites the local Fire Department and Hazardous Materials Response Team to train on site annually.  Our internal emergency response plan includes coordinating with police, fire and HAZMAT personnel.  Cathay has had no reportable releases or injuries from ammonia in the last 10 years.  Cathay is committed to operating this system in a safe and responsible manor, protecting our employees and the surrounding community. \n\n\n\nIn November of 2010, 8 foot tall chain link fence topped with barbed wire was installed around the perimeter of the ammonia storage tank system as an extra measure of security.\n\n\n\nIn August of 2012 the following mechanical integrity work was completed on the ammonia system: Storage tank emptied for internal visual and magnaflux inspection of tank welds and shell thickness testing, all system manual valves were rebuilt,  all emergency shut off valves and operating "

At completion the storage tank and piping system was repainted with a two-part protective coating (white) and relabeled.\n\n\n\nIn October 2013 the facility security system was upgraded with new cameras and DVR, with one camera dedicated to constant surveillance of the ammonia storage tank.  In May 2015 this camera was upgraded to HD.  "
