Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Great Lakes Chemical, South Plant are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, our highly trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.    We are also completely coordinated with Union County Arkansas LEPC which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities encompass organic and inorganic chemical synthesis.  We have 14 regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include ammonia, bromine,  chlorine, ethylene [ethene], hydrogen fluoride/hydrofluoric acid [hydrofluoric acid], oleum (fuming sulfuric acid) [sulfuric acid, mixture with sulfur trioxide], propylene oxide [oxirane, methyl-], sulfur dioxide (anhydrous), vinylidene chloride, vinylidene fluoride and sulfur trioxide.  The regulated substances at our facility are involved in several uses.  Ammonia is used for acid adjustment and neutralization.  Bromine is used for chemical synthesis.  Chlorine is used for bromine replacement.  Ethylene  [Ethene] is used for chemical synthesis.  Hydrogen fluoride/hydrofluoric acid [hydrofluoric acid] is used for chemical synthesis. Oleum (fuming sulfuric acid) [sulfuric acid, mixture with sulfur trioxide] is used for chemical synthesis.  Propylene oxide [oxirane, methyl-] is used for chemical synthesis. Sulfur dioxide (anh"

Vinylidene fluoride [ehene, 1,1 difluoro] is used for chemcial synthesis.  Sulfur trioxide is used for chemical synthesis.  \n\nThe maximum inventory of bromine at our facility is 1,524,125 lb. while ammonia, sulfur trioxide, chlorine, hydrogen fluoride/hydrofluoric acid [hydrofluoric acid], propylene oxide [oxirane, methyl-], oleum (fuming sulfuric acid) [sulfuric acid, mixture with sulfur trioxide], sulfur dioxide (anhydrous), vinylidene chloride [ethene, 1,1 dichloro], vinylidnene fluoride ethene, 1,1 difluoro] and ethylene  [ethene] are present at our facility in quantities of 200,000 lb., 300,000 lb., 1,080,000 lb., 250,000 lb., 71,818 lb., 210,000 lb., 480,000 lb., 58,000 lb., 30,000 lb. and 40,000 lb. respectively.\n\n3.    The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\nTo evaluate the worst case scenarios, we have used the look-up tables and equations provided by the EPA in the RMP Off-site Consequence Analysis Guidance as well as Equations from Appendix D of the EPA's Off-site Consequence Analysis Guidance.  For alternative release scenario analyses, we have employed the look-up tables and equations provided by the EPA in the RMP Off-site Consequence Analysis Guidance.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from the Bromine Refining process.  The scenario involves the release of two railroad tank cars of chlorine in a gaseous form over 10 minutes.  At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s wind speed, a distance of  some miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 3 flammable substances as a c"

Under worst case weather conditions, a maximum distance of less than 1/4 mile is obtained corresponding to an endpoint of 1 psi over pressure.  \n\nOne alternative release scenario will be submitted for each toxic substance present in Program 3 processes.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for ammonia involves a release from a pipe leak at the ammonia rail car storage area in the Bromine Refining process.  The scenario involves the release of 500 lbs. of ammonia in a gaseous form over 10 minutes.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L of ammonia is 0.2 mile.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for bromine involves a release from a pipe leak on the bromine storage tanks in the Bromine Refining process.  The scenario involves the release of 750 lbs. of bromine.  Toxic liquid is assumed to be immediately released to form a pool of height 1 cm, from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated over 35.7 minutes.  Passive mitigation controls such as dikes are taken into account to calculate the scenario.
