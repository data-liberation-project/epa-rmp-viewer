The date of the most recent PHA's are 11/22/94 for No. 7 Pipestill, and 2/21/95 for SDA.  The major hazards identified in section 7.4.d were addressed during the PHA's conducted for this process.  The vents listed under Process Controls (section 7.4.e) do not apply to the SDA unit.  The deluge system listed under mitigation systems (section 7.4.f) applies only to the SDA unit.  There have been no incidents in this process within the past 5 years involving the release of a RMP regulated substance which resulted in, or could reasonably have resulted in, imminent and substantial offiste impacts.  A narrative description of the facility's prevention program elements can be found in the Executive Summary.",

      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE PLAN\n\nThe Bayway Refinery is committed to worker and public safety.  The recognition and control of risks are instrumental to the safe, efficient, and environmentally compliant operation of the refinery.  The refinery's accident prevention and risk management plan is organized to be consistent with the OSHA Process Safety Management regulation, which provides for systematic and comprehensive attention to key elements of process hazard management, addressing issues of technology, personnel, and equipment.  This structure facilitates our overall program which emphasizes accident prevention through safe design, installation, operation, inspection, and maintenance of our processes.  Even though we emphasize the prevention of accidents, we also maintain a highly trained, qualified, and well-equipped emergency response organization to quickly respond to and mitigate an incident should one occur.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Bayway Refinery, located in Linden, New Jersey, operates a wide variety of operating processes to convert raw crude oil into useable petroleum products for our customers.  The refinery produces many commonly used petroleum products, including gasoline, heating oil, diesel, jet fuel, propane, butane, and petrochemical feedstocks.  These products and their production account for numerous regulated flammable substances being present on site, including propane, butane, hydrogen, and mixtures of other regulated flammable substances.  The Bayway Refinery does not exceed the EPA threshold quantity for any RMP regulated toxic materials.\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT RESULTS\n\nA Worst Case Scenario (WCS) for flammables represents the release and subsequent ignition of the entire contents of the storage vessel having the greatest offsite impact, without allowing for existing prevention measures, detection equipment, or response measures which are in place.  Based upon the location of  storage vess"

The maximum vessel inventory was determined by the maximum operational fill height, which is monitored and protected by a high level alarm system.  The results show that each of the refinery's two WCS's for flammable materials would reach the 1-psi overpressure endpoint offsite.  The management systems and accidental release prevention program summarized later in this document will describe many of the steps we take to make an incident of this magnitude highly improbable. \n\nAn Alternative Release Scenario (ARS) represents a more likely and realistic event.  The ARS allows consideration of existing prevention, detection, minimization, and response measures which the facility has in place.  After the evaluation of numerous ARS's, and consistent with the refinery's five-year accident history, no ARS's (for flammables or toxics) were found that would have a distance to endpoint reaching past the refinery's fenceline.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe Bayway Refinery has had an excellent accident record over the history of the facility, and has had only one event in the past five years involving the release of a regulated substance which meets the RMP reporting requirement.  The incident occurred in 1996 when a hydrogen leak occurred inside one of our process furnaces, and the resulting fire required shutting down the equipment for repair.  There were no injuries or offsite impacts associated with the fire; however, the equipment damage that resulted from the fire was financially significant.  As a result of the refinery's incident investigation, a faulty instrument was determined to be the cause of the fire.  This instrument and other similar instruments throughout the refinery were evaluated and corrected as necessary to prevent the recurrence of this type of incident.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDEN"

Because processes at the refinery that are regulated by the EPA RMP regulations are also subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accidental release prevention program.  In addition to the OSHA PSM regulation, the refinery is also regulated by the New Jersey Toxic Catastrophe Prevention Act (TCPA) for processes covered by that regulation.  \n\nThe following elements represent numerous programs and practices that the Bayway Refinery has institutionalized as Management Systems.  Through the establishment, review, and continuous improvement of these Management Systems, the Bayway Refinery demonstrates its commitment to operating a safe, healthy, and environmentally sound facility.  \n\nEMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION\n\nThe Bayway Refinery encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation include safety committee involvement, developing and reviewing safe operating procedures, and participation in the process hazard analysis program.   Information on the refinery's prevention program is available to all employees, and they are encouraged to recommend improvements to any of the programs.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the prevention program are documented in the employee participation plan element of the PSM Management Systems Documentation.  Copies of this document are maintained at the refinery and address each element of the accidental release prevention program.  In addition to this program, the refinery has a strong commitment to following written policies and procedures, and encourages employee's input to identify when a policy or procedure needs to be changed or improved to cover new tasks, revised "

Through this teamwork, a determination can be made to update the policy or procedure, and then train everyone involved on the revised requirements. \n\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION\n\nThe Bayway Refinery maintains an extensive library of Process Safety Information which includes information related to chemicals in the process, technology of the process, and equipment in the process.  These documents include detailed information on chemical properties and their associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  The process safety information is available to all employees, either directly on the unit, or by contacting their supervisor. \n\nChemical specific information, including hazards, protective measures, symptoms, and first aid procedures is provided via Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS's).  For specific process areas, the refinery has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g. temperature, pressure, flow, and level).  These are documented in the Operating Conditions and Controls section of the unit Operating Manuals.  The refinery ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using computer process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g. automated shutdown systems).\n\nThe refinery also maintains technical documentation that provides information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides the basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nPROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS (PHA"

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe Bayway Refinery primarily utilizes the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted by a team representing operating experience, as well as safety and engineering expertise.  This team systematically identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as existing accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nThe PHA teams recommendations are forwarded to the management of the involved unit or area for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation measures in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All mitigation measures being implemented in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are resolved.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process operation and controls do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety parameters, the Bayway Refinery periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analyses.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years.  The results and findings of these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, any team findings are forwarded to the unit or area management for resolution, with the final resolution of the findings documented and retained.  \n\nOPERATING PROCEDURES\n\nThe Bayway Refin"
