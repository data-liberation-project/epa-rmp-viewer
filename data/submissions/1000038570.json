Titanium sponge is produced by reacting titanium tetrachloride TiCl4 with magnesium metal to produce titanium metal sponge and magnesium chloride.  \n\n\n\nTiCl4 is the only toxic chemical regulated by the Risk Management Program (RMP) that is used in the process at the Titanium Sponge Production facility.    All TiCl4 operations and equipment are closely monitored and controlled to prevent accidental releases to the environment.  It is ATIs policy to safely manage hazardous chemicals and processes for the protection of workers, customers, the community, and the environment.  ATI considers environmental compliance to be an integral part of our operations. We have a comprehensive environmental management and reporting program, and require compliance with all federal, state, regional and local environmental laws and regulations.\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\nRegulated Chemicals\n\n\n\nThe ATI Titanium Sponge Production facility uses titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4) as a raw material in the titanium metal manufacturing process.  TiCl4, a liquid at ambient temperatures, is delivered in rail cars containing approximately 16,000 gallons and unloaded into six storage tanks that are 25,000 gallons each.  The storage tanks are surrounded with concrete curbs designed to contain any accidental leaks or spills from the storage system into a large below-ground containment sump.  From the storage area, the TiCl4 is pumped to the reduction furnaces where it is reduced to titanium metal.  In the unlikely event of an accidental release, the TiCl4 would be collected in the containment system or flow onto the ground and slowly evaporate.  The TiCl4 vapors would react with the humidity in the air to form titanium dioxide, an inert nonhazardous solid, and hydrochloric acid (HCl).  The health effect of HCl vapor is primarily an irritant of mucous membranes, the eyes, and the respirator"

The HCl vapors would migrate downwind and quickly disperse to below health affect concentrations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response\n\n\n\nThe toxicity of TiCl4 at high concentrations makes it necessary for ATI to observe certain safety precautions to prevent unnecessary human exposure, and reduce the threat to the personal health of our employees as well as nearby members of the community.  It is ATIA?s policy to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle toxic chemicals including equipment design and safe handling procedures used to operate the equipment.  ATIA?s release prevention program is based on four principles; inherently safe design, effective written procedures, training, and the goal of continuous improvement.  Our chemical storage and handling equipment meets or exceeds design codes and standards as well as incorporating good engineering practices recommended by industry groups.  As a result, ATIs equipment incorporates inherently safe designs.  Written operating and maintenance procedures are prepared and reviewed annually for accuracy and safety.  Operating and maintenance personnel are thoroughly trained on proper procedures and safety hazards, and are provided with regular refresher training.  Equipment and procedures are frequently evaluated and updated with the goal of continuous improvement in both operation and safety.\n\n\n\nATIs emergency response program integrates OSHAs and EPAs preparedness planning response and training requirements.  In the event of an accidental release, the emergency response plan is put into action , and if necessary, the local county Hazmat Response team is notified.  Plant personnel will notify neighboring industries, DEQ, and OSHA, as necessary.  Plant personnel receive classroom training on implementation of the response plan in addition to participating in training exercises.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nWorst-case and Alternati"

      "SummaryText": "ve Release Scenarios\n\n\n\nThe worst-case release scenario at the ATI Rowley facility involves the catastrophic failure and release of the entire contents of a TiCl4 storage tank.  Using EPAs dispersion modeling program, RMP*Comp, the maximum distance downwind from the storage tank to an endpoint concentration of approximately 2.7 ppm TiCl4 is 5.5 miles.   This worst-case impact distance is calculated using EPA mandated assumptions that are conservative.  For example, EPA requires the assumption that all of the liquid is released within 10 minutes.  The worst-case analysis also requires the assumption that the wind blows constantly at a high speed in the same direction for several hours in order for the TiCl4 to migrate a significant distance downwind.  The alternative release scenarios are considered by EPA to be more representative of actual impacts attributable to an accidental release.\n\n\n\nOne alternative release scenario was developed,  for TiCl4.  The alternative release scenario is intended to represent the largest release that could reasonably be expected to occur.  For TiCl4, the alternative release scenario is based on the failure of a hose feeding the reduction furnace.  Failure of the hose would release of approximately 50 lb/min spilling onto the ground until the operator identifies the problem and closes the automatic valve.  The estimated time for this to occur was not more than minutes.  The total release would be about 250 pounds of TiCl4.  The maximum calculated downwind distance to the endpoint is 0.1 miles.  This alternative release scenario is more realistic than the worst-case release.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThere has been no accidental releases of TiCl4   \n\n"
