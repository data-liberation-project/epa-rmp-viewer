To ensure continuous improvement, the environment, health and safety function has increased staff resources. We have contracted with a consultant to assist us in revalidation of PHA's and to conduct compliance audits.   We are utilizing off site training that simulates a refrigeration system.  This enables operators to gain experience in ammonia system operations and theory.   We continuously review industry practices and benchmark for applicable best practices to improve our ammonia system to make it safer for our stakeholders and the communities in which we have presence."

Management recognizes that leadership in environmental protection is critical to all of our stakeholders, customers and the communities where we have a presence.  We meet or exceed all applicable federal, state and local standards in the operation of our plant.  Our stakeholders produce value added egg products utilizing liquid egg in either whole, white or yolk form.  Anhydrous Ammonia is used in our refrigeration system to maintain and control temperatures of our manufacturing processes.  This ensures that our products are processed and maintained at proper temperatures to inhibit microbiological growth.                                                                                          We comply with OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM), OSHA Emergency Action Plan, EPA Oil Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasure plan (SPCC), and applicable EPCRA regulations at state and local levels.  Preventive Maintenance is tracked on computer based maintenance management system.   This builds trend history that is allowing us to become predictive vs. preventive in our maintenance and further ensuring the safe operation of our system.  Management of Change and Pre Start Safety Review are principles from PSM that are being deployed to all of our process lines to ensure safe design.  Contractors are required to submit information on their safety performance and if SFF standard is met they are approved to work for Sunny Fresh.  Before work is started all contractors complete an orientation to ensure understanding of Sunny Fresh Safety policies, rules and permit procedures. \nSunny Fresh Foods, Mason City, IA has had no reportable quantity accidents in the last five years.
