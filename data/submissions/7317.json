A covered\nfacility is one that stores any of a long list of dangerous chemicals (e.g., chemicals that are either\ntoxic, flammable, or explosive), in quantities greater than the threshold levels listed in the Rule. \nListed toxic chemicals and their respective threshold quantities can be found in the Federal\nRegulations at 40 CFR 68.\n     The stationary (potential) source that is addressed herein is the City of Westwego's\nWastewater Treatment Plant.  The Plant's location is identified as follows:\n\n                                   1) Street Address:       8700 Lapalco Blvd.\n                         Westwego, LA 70094\n\n                                        2) Geographical Location:     29o53'47\" North Latitude\n                         90o09'14\" West Longitude\n\n     Chlorine gas and sulfur dioxide gas, both air toxic chemicals, are listed.  Chlorine is used by\nmost water treatment and wastewater treatment plants as a disinfectant.  Sulfur dioxide is used to de-\nchlorinate the treated wastewater following disinfection.  The threshold quantity listed for chlorine\nis 2,500 pounds.  The threshold quantity for sulfur dioxide is 5,000 pounds.  The City of Westwego's\nwastewater treatment plant stores chlorine gas in quan"

Accordingly, the City of Westwego has employed a consultant to\nconduct a Program 2 Hazard Review, a Compliance Audit, and to develop this RMP for the\nwastewater treatment plant.  The consultant, EPL, Inc., also is preparing written Safety, O&M, and\nEmergency Response Plans for the safe handling of both toxic gases, as required by the USEPA.  \n     It is pertinent to note, however, that the City of Westwego's wastewater treatment plant has\nbeen in continuous operation for 34 years.  During that long operational history, there has never been\na release of chlorine gas of such a magnitude so as to cause injury to people, pets or property\nsurrounding the wastewater treatment plant.  Similarly, sulfur dioxide has been used for only the last\nfew years without incident.\n     Pure chlorine gas (an air toxic), used to disinfect the City's treated wastewater supply, is\nreceived and stored at the above location in the form of a gas that is liquified under pressure.  The\nliquified chlorine gas is supplied in steel pressure cylinders that contain one ton (2000 lbs) of\nchlorine when received.  Another air toxic, sulfur dioxide, also is handled as a pressure-liquified gas\nin one-ton cylinders.  Typical inventory of chlorine at the Westwego wastewater treatment plant is\nfour ton cylinders.  Typical inventory of sulfur dioxide is two ton cylinders.\n\nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\n\"Worst-Case\" Scenario \n     The USEPA regulations require an assessment of risk and emergency response planning for\naccidental release of any of the listed air toxics under two (or more) different scenarios.  That is, the\nregulations call for analysis/planning for a \"worst-case\" scenario based on rigid scenario conditions\nfor any air toxic.  These \"worst-case\", scenario - required conditions are identified as follows:\n\n                                                       Release Duration                   10 minutes\n      "

The resulting risk area for this \"worst-case\" scenario was determined from the\nUSEPA's Risk Management Program Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants for the Westwego\nwastewater treatment plant.  For an urban setting, such as is the condition at the Westwego\nwastewater treatment plant, the distance to the endpoint (or safe exposure distance) is listed in\nExhibit 4-12 in the Guidance document as a 1.3 miles radius around the wastewater treatment plant.\n     Additionally, the USEPA regulations provide for consideration of passive mitigation in\n\"worst-case\" assessments.  Enclosure of air toxic containers/feed systems within a building is\nconsidered a valid, passive mitigation condition.  Passive mitigation presence provides for a toxic\ngas release area reduction of 45 percent (i.e., by multiplying the model \"worst-case\" radius by a\nfactor of 0."

Thus, the USEPA's model endpoint for chlorine is reduced for the Westwego\nwastewater treatment plant as follows:\n\n                                             1.3 miles x 0.55    =    0.72 miles (\"worst-case\" release area)\n\nAlternative Scenario\n     The regulations also permit planners to provide one or more realistic, alternative scenarios\ninvolving accidental release of air toxics.  The alternative scenario considered for the Westwego\nwastewater treatment plant was based on a tubing failure, a bad connection or valve failure resulting\nin the release of chlorine gas through a 5/16 inch-diameter whole or opening in a ton cylinder.  \n     This scenario was modeled by the USEPA study, (see Exhibit 4-15 in the Guidance\ndocument) and produced the following information.  The release described above would last for 60\nminutes with an average maximum gas flow rate of 15 lbs/min.  Again, for an urban setting, the\nrelease impact area, i.e., the distance from the source out to the endpoint concentration for chlorine\n(0.0087 mg/l or 3 ppm) was found to be 0.1 miles, without consideration of the passive mitigation\nfactor.  When we adapted the model's result to include the containment of the gas inside the\ntreatment plant, the endpoint distance is further reduced by 45 percent to 0.06 miles (317 feet).\n     Further, while only passive mitigation can be considered for the \"worst-case\" scenario, the\nregulations permit inclusion of active mitigation factor(s) for the alternative scenario modeling that\ncan further reduce the estimated toxic gas spread area (i.e., distance to endpoint).  The active\nmitigation system to be installed at the City of Westwego's wastewater treatment plant is an air\nscrubbing system that will remove either chlorine or sulfur dioxide gases from the air.  An alarm\nsignal from the existing chlorine leak detector (also responds to sulfur dioxide) will be used to\nautomatically trigger start-up of the air scrubbing system in the event of a leak.   It is con"

Thus, as part of this alternative\nscenario, the endpoint distance is further reduced to about 0.006 miles (or about 32 feet).  In this\ncase, there would be no release to any public receptors off-site.\n     The City has developed a toxic gas release Emergency Response Plan (ERP) that is\napplicable to both the City's Water and Wastewater Treatment Plants.  The plan has been\ncoordinated with the City's Fire and Police Departments.\n     During much more than the past 5 years there have been no toxic gas releases from either\nplant.\n     The City plans to install air scrubbers at each plant to chemically neutralize either chlorine\nor sulfur dioxide before it can leave the plant.\n\n  \n\n\n"
