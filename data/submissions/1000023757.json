ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\nClearwater Paper Corporation (Clearwater Paper) has always acknowledged its responsibility to provide its employees with a safe working environment and to be a responsible corporate citizen to the surrounding community.  Clearwater Paper strives to meet or exceed applicable EPA and OSHA rules and regulations.  As part of this commitment, Clearwater Paper periodically evaluates the quality of its environmental and safety programs.\n\nThe Clearwater Paper Thomaston, Georgia facility's accident prevention and emergency response procedures have been designed for successful risk management and is a blend of sound organizational practices that prevent or mitigate incidents including operating procedures, employee training, preventative maintenance, management of change, process hazard analysis, and other human factor components.  \n\nThe Clearwater Paper Thomaston facility has integrated its emergency response procedures with those of the Thomaston Fire Department and local Emergency Management Agency.\n \nThe facility contact for the Clearwater Paper Thomaston facility risk management program is Mr. Time Reid, Environmental/Foam Manager.  He can be contacted at 678-504-0773 (main).\n\n \n2. STATIONARY SOURCE INFORMATION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\nThe Thomaston facility, which is owned and operated by Clearwater Paper, is located at 1201 Barnesville, Thomaston, Georgia.  Employing approximately 133 staff, the Thomaston facility is a Coated and Laminated Paper Manufacturing facility. In addition, the facility operates a polystyrene extruder and thermoforming unit. \n\nClearwater Paper uses butane, a Risk Management Program regulated substance, as a blowing agent in their polystyrene extrusion process.  Butane is brought on-site by truck and unloaded into one 18,000 gallon butane tank that is located outside. No passive mitigation systems are in place to contain a release (the mitigation systems that are in place a"

The high pressure metering system is designed to meter a constant flow of butane (blowing agent) into the primary extruder.\n\nThe 18,000 gallon butane tank is administratively controlled to be filled to no more than 87% of capacity, such that the maximum quantity of butane stored is 15,660 gallons (or approximately 76,000 lbs).\n\n \n3. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\nThis plant has a comprehensive process safety management program that is in compliance with the EPA Accidental Release Prevention Rule, the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard, and all applicable state codes and regulations. A safety management system is in place to assure on-going compliance. \n\nProcess hazard analyses are conducted on an on-going basis to identify hazards and recommend safeguards that will prevent an accidental release. Recommendations resulting from the process hazard analyses are implemented or otherwise addressed to ensure safety is continually improved.  \n\nA Management of Change (MOC) system is used to assure that changes to plant equipment, procedures, or processes do not cause accidents. For equipment, procedure, and processes changes, a MOC initiates a safety review. This review may include a process hazard analysis. \n\nThe Mechanical Integrity program maintains the mechanical integrity of process equipment. Clearwater Paper uses a Maintenance Spreadsheet to manage the preventive maintenance schedule. Routine scheduled equipment inspections, tests, or servicing are performed according to published engineering standards, manufacturer recommendations and plant experience in order to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release caused by equipment failure. \n\nThe Hot Work Policy describes safety measures for welding or other hot work, which includes a permit system to reduce the risk of fire.\n\nIncidents that cause or could have caused a release are investigated and recommendations are made to prevent recurrence"

      "SummaryText": ". These recommendations may lead to improvements in equipment, procedures, operating conditions, or training.\n\n\n \n4. FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThe Clearwater Paper Thomaston facility has not had any reportable accidental releases in the last five years as defined by 40 CFR Part 68, General Guidance for Risk Management Programs. \n \n5. EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\nThe Emergency Action Plan for Release of Butane (EAP) provides specific procedures that shall be implemented when there is a butane release.  While the prevention of a site emergency is Clearwater Paper's goal, it is also recognized that employees must have adequate training to enable them to respond appropriately in the event a site emergency occurs.  \n\nPlanning for a site emergency is a continuous process, starting with prevention and including preparedness, and response.  Clearwater Paper takes seriously its civic responsibility and tries diligently to comply with all requirements.\n\nTo help maintain an effective EAP, the Clearwater Paper Thomaston Facility has established, and seeks to maintain, a productive working relationship with the local emergency responders such as the local fire department. Also, the Clearwater Paper Thomaston facility regularly trains employees and keeps several up-to-date copies of the EAP in areas accessible to all personnel involved with the butane process.\n \n6. PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nClearwater Paper is planning to install in the near future a fire suppression system near the butane tank to provide additional safety.  The system has two parts, with one part providing fire suppression around the tank and the second part to put a water curtain around the south wall of the main building.  This will protect the main building in case of a fire in the Foam Warehouse.\n\nClearwater Paper believes in emphasizing environmental and safety training. We will continue to assess the environmental impact of each of our processes and propose to design, build, operate and maintain our op"
