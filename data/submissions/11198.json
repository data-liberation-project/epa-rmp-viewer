These procedures cover all modes of operation, such as (1) unit start up, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial start up of a new or improved process. Operating procedures are used as a reference by experienced employees and provide a consistent basis for training new employees.  In addition to describing the steps for safely conducting operations, the procedures also contain valuable information about safe upper and lower limits, consequences of deviations, and applicable safety and health information.  Operating procedures are annually certified as accurate to ensure that they are updated following process changes. \n\n\nTRAINING\nThe Vulcan-Geismar plant trains workers to safely and effectively perform their tasks.  Employees who are new to a process are given basic training that includes (1) a general overview of the process, (2) the properties of the substances used in the process and their associated hazards, and (3) a detailed review of the operating procedures for that process.  Once they have demonstrated their understanding of this initial training, they are paired with an experienced operator to learn their specific job functions and tasks.  After they demonstrate their competence in performing these tasks, they are allowed to work independently.\nThrough oral reviews, written tests, and on-the-job demonstration, we ensure that our employees understand the training given to them.  The frequency of refresher training is decided, in part, by our employees but is performed at least every three years.  All training given to an employee is documented, along with the means used to verify that the training is understood.\n\n\nMECHANICAL INTEGRITY\nThe Vulcan-Geismar plant maintains the mechanical integrity of our equipment to prevent equipment fail"

The resulting overpressure travels to a distance of approximately 0.227 miles (1,196 ft) from the rail car before falling below the overpressure limit of 1 PSI.   No one lives within this distance from the rail car.  The only public or environmental receptor that are located within this distance is a public highway.\n\nThis scenario is chosen because it results in an off site end point distance , as required by EPA's risk management program rule.  However, a catastrophic failure of a rail car is an extremely unlikely event, and even if such an event did occur,only a fraction of the vinyl chloride in the rail car would actually contribute to the explosion.  A more likely, but still rare, event might be a failure of an unloading hose.  But a release due to an unloading hose failure will not lead to an explosion large enough to reach the 1-psi overpressure end point off site, even without consideration of the active mitigation components placed on all of our vinyl chloride rail cars that would limit the release in this event.\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\nWe take a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  Our management system addresses each of the key features of a successful prevention program, as described below:\n\n\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION\nThe Vulcan-Geismar plant maintains a variety of technical documents that describe the chemicals and processes at our facility.  These documents are kept up to date and are available to all employees and address important process parameters such as (1) operating limits for the equipment, (2) design basis and configuration of the equipment, and (3) physical properties and hazards of the chemicals used in our processes.\nChemical information is usually documented within material safety data sheets (MSDSs).

MSDS's are available to all employees, as well as the emergency responders in our community.\nImportant process parameters are also documented and maintained.  Engineering design documents may include (1) operating limits, (2) block flow or simplified process flow diagrams, (3) process chemistry, (4) maximum intended inventories, (5) design basis and configuration, (6) piping and instrumentation diagrams, and (7) other information that is important for understanding the design intent, operating limits, and hazards of each process.\n\n\nPROCESS HAZARDS ANALYSIS\nThe Vulcan-Geismar plant has a comprehensive program for ensuring that the hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled.  Each process is examined in detail to ensure that all hazards are identified and that appropriate controls are in place to manage those hazards.\nA hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis is typically used for our process hazard analyses.  A team comprised of personnel with engineering, operations, and maintenance experience systematically examines each hazard in each section of the process and identifies potential causes and a range of possible consequences.  The team then compares the hazard to the existing set of prevention and mitigation measures designed to contain that hazard, making further recommendations when deemed necessary.  These recommendations are resolved by management and are tracked until they are implemented.\nWe update and revalidate each process hazard analysis every five years.  The results and findings from these revalidation studies are documented and retained, and recommendations are tracked until resolved by management.\n\n\nOPERATING PROCED"

All contractors are evaluated prior to hiring to ensure that they are well trained and are able to perform their job function in a safe manner.  A contractor\u0012s safety record and performance are reviewed during the selection process.\nOnce a contractor is selected, the Vulcan-Geismar plant requires orientation, training and compliance with procedures to ensure that contractor employees (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) are aware of the hazards associated with the area in which they will be working, (3) understand the emergency response procedures, and (4) report any hazards they find during their work.  Our personnel regularly monitor contractor activities to ensure they are performing their work in a safe manner.  Infractions of safety procedures are grounds for craftsman or contractor expulsion.\n\n \nCOMPLIANCE AUDITS\nA compliance audit is performed periodically to help ensure that the prevention program activities at our facility are adequate and that safety issues are addressed effectively.  Audits are performed by a team that is knowledgeable in our processes, but often is independent of our facility, to ensure a thorough and complete evaluation.  The audit team systematically evaluates each aspect of the prevention program, ensuring both compliance with PSM, CMA Responsible CARE Codes and  the RMP rule.

Some of the public and environmental receptors that are located within this distance are as follows: schools, shopping malls, parks and recreation areas, hospitals, day care centers, wildlife management area, industrial plants, commercial and office buildings, hotels, nursing homes, airport,etc.\n\nWorst-case Flammable Release Scenario\nThe worst-case release scenario representing the flammable substances handled by Vulcan is a catastrophic rupture of a storage tank containing vinyl chloride.  The entire quantity of vinyl chloride, 685,000 lb, is released to the atmosphere, where it ignites and explodes.  Although we have several features that help to prevent this scenario, or that mitigate the consequences of such a release, no credit is taken for these measures.
