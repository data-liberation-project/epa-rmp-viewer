We are committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes in a safe and responsible manner, as demonstrated by the resources we invest to prevent accidents.  As a member of the Synthetic Organic Chemical Manufacturer?s Association, we adhere to the principles of Responsible Care.  As such, we are in the process of developing an Environmental Management System to continue improvement in Environmental, Health and Safety programs.  In addition to ensuring that our employees have the best training in the operation of our processes, we demand that safety be the first priority in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our processes.\nIt is the policy of Lynx Chemical Group to develop, manufacture, and distribute materials with minimal impact on the environment and without injury to our employees, customers, and community.  To that end, Lynx Chemical Group is committed to:\n\n?    The protection of the health, safety, and security of our employees and facilities;\n?    Complying with all applicable federal, state and local Environmental, Health, Safety, and Security regulations and our other related voluntary requirements including Responsible Care;\n?    Continual reduction of the impact of our operations on the environment through ongoing pollution prevention programs;\n?    Continual communications and openness with our stakeholders;\n?    Training all employees regarding the importance of EHS&S protection and roles they play as stewards.\n\nWe have implemented maintenance and inspection programs that help ensure site integrity.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.

Mitigation measures that have been included in our design include installation of isolation valves, fire suppression systems in areas where flammable chemicals are present and fire fighting equipment in all process areas, vapor suppression monitors to control vapors, a fully implemented emergency response plan, appropriate PPE and an alarm system for early notification of a release.  The local fire department is also familiar with our site.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n    The Lynx Chemical Group-Smyrna Plant manufactures phosphonates, polymeric dispersants and toll manufactures products for other companies.  Raw materials are received via rail cars, tank trucks and in tote bins and drums.  As a part of the manufacturing processes, we use some substances that are covered by the Risk Management Program (RMP) rule (40 CFR 68).  The plant also uses a combination of good design practices, an accidental release prevention program and an emergency response program to ensure the safety of our employees, the public and the environment.  We are committed to operating our facility in a safe and responsible manner.  Following is a brief description of the facility and the RMP regulated chemicals at the site.\n\n    The Smyrna plant is situated on 60 acres.  Covered processes are the phosphorous acid processes which uses the RMP covered chemical phosphorous trichloride.  This chemical, along with others used at the site, are also covered under OSHA?s Process Safety Management Regulations.\n\nGE"

Our management system addresses each of the key features of a successful prevention program, as described in the sections below.\n\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION\n\n    The Lynx Chemical Group-Smyrna plant maintains a variety of technical documents that describe the chemicals and processes at our facility.  These documents are kept up to date and are available to all employees and address important process parameters such as (1) operating limits for the equipment, (2) design basis and configuration of the equipment and (3) physical properties and hazards associated with each chemical.  \n    \n    Chemical information is usually documented within Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDSs).  MSDSs contain information concerning both the physical properties and the hazards associated with each chemical.  This information typically includes (1) toxicity information, (2) physical data, (3) reactivity and corrosivity  data, (4) thermal and chemical stability data and (5) hazards of mixing substances together.  MSDSs are available to all employees as well as the emergency responders in our community.  MSDSs for all Smyrna materials are maintained on site.\n\n    Important process parameters are also documented and maintained.  Engineering design documents may include (1) operating limits, (2) block flow or simplified process flow diagrams, (3) process chemistry, (4) maximum intended inventories, (5) design basis and configuration, (6) piping and instrumentation diagrams and (7) other information that is important for understanding the design intent, operating limits and hazards of each process.\n\nPROCESS HAZARD ANALYSES\n\n    The Smyrna plant has a comprehensive program for ensuring that the hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled.  Each process is examined in detail to ensure that all hazards are identi"

A team comprising personnel with engineering, operations, environmental and maintenance experience systematically examines each hazard in each section of the process and identifies potential causes and a range of possible consequences.  The team then compares the hazard to the existing set of prevention and mitigation measures designed to contain that hazard, making further recommendations when deemed necessary.  These recommendations are resolved and prioritized by management and tracked until they are implemented.  We update and revalidate each PHA every five years or whenever a significant change is made.  The results and findings from these revalidation studies are documented and retained and recommendations are tracked by management until resolved or completed.\n\nOPERATING PROCEDURES\n\n    Our engineers, operators and supervisors work together to develop and maintain operating procedures that ensure the safe operation of our facility.  These procedures cover all modes of operation, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown and (6) initial startup of a new or improved process.  Operating procedures are used as a reference by experienced employees and provide a consistent basis for training new employees.  In addition to describing the steps for safely conducting operations, the procedures also contain valuable information about the safe upper and lower limits, consequences of deviations and applicable safety and health information.  Operating procedures are annually certified as accurate to ensure that they are updated following process changes.\n\n     Smyrna also operates using the Lynx Chemical Group batchsheet system.

Employees who are new to a process are given basic training that includes (1) a general overview of the process, (2) the properties of the substances used in the process and their associated hazards and (3) a detailed review of the operating procedures for that process.  Once they have demonstrated their understanding of this initial training, they are paired with an experienced operator to learn their specific job functions and tasks.  After they demonstrate their competence in performing these tasks, they are allowed to work independently. \n\n    Through oral reviews, written tests and on-the-job demonstration, we ensure that our employees understand the training given to them.  The frequency of refresher training is decided, in part, by our employees but is performed at least every three (3) years.  All training given to an employee is documented, along with the means used to verify that the training is understood.\n\nMECHANICAL INTEGRITY\n\n    The Smyrna plant maintains the mechanical integrity of our equipment to prevent equipment failures that could endanger workers, the public or the environment.  Our inspection and testing program helps identify equipment damage or deterioration before the equipment fails.  When a deficiency is found, maintenance personnel will correct the problem and try to identify the root cause(s) of the deficiency so that future problems are avoided.  Our quality assurance system ensures that new or replacement equipment meets the strict design standard required for service in our facility.  The mechanical integrity system includes (1) inspection and testing procedures, (2) replacement equipment specifications, (3) procedures fo"

Except for replacements-in-kind (e.g., replacing a valve with an identical valve), all changes are subjected to a hazard analysis to ensure that (1) new hazards are not inadvertently introduced into the system, (2) safety consequences resulting from the change are addressed, (3) operators in the process are notified of the change and made aware of possible repercussions and (4) all training material, process safety information and operating procedures are updated.  The management of change system applies to changes in the chemicals used, process equipment, technology, procedures and other facility changes.\n\nPRE-STARTUP SAFETY REVIEW\n\n    Whenever a change occurs that requires updating the process safety information, the Smyrna plant performs a pre-startup safety review.  This review ensures that safety features, procedures, personnel and the equipment are prepared for service before the process is restarted.  A pre-startup safety review will generally include field verification of new construction and also serves a quality assurance function by verifying that accident prevention measures are implemented correctly.  Generally, a pre-startup review will ensure that (1) construction and equipment are consistent with design standards, (2) adequate operating, safety and maintenance procedures are in place, (3) training for all affected employees is complete and (4) a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) has been performed, if necessary.\n\nINCIDENT INVESTIGATION\n\n    The Smyrna plant trains its employees to promptly investigate each incident that resulted in, or could have resulted in serious injury to employees, the public or the environment.  Incident investigations are designed to determine the facts, identify the root causes and provide reco"

Incident investigations are conducted in accordance with our Safety Standard 201 and utilize Non-Conformance Notices (NCN?s) that are define through our ISO Problem Elimination Procedures (AP-010).\n\nEMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION\n\n    The Smyrna plant encourages employees to be involved in every aspect of process safety management and accident prevention.  Employees are routinely asked to participate in PHA?s, incident investigations, management of change hazard analyses and all other aspects of the prevention program.  Employees have access to all information developed as part of the prevention program and are specifically informed of any changes that occur in their process areas.  The various ways employees are involved in the prevention program are documented in a written plan.\n\nSAFE WORK PRACTICES\n\n    The Smyrna plant has established safe work practices that ensure the safety of our employees.  Examples of these procedures include (1) hot work permits designed to control spark or flame producing activities, (2) a permit and procedure to control confined space entry and (3) a lockout/tagout procedure for isolating energy sources during maintenance.  These procedures and permits ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\nCONTRACTORS\n\n    The Smyrna plant uses contractors for various activities such as maintenance and construction.  All contractors are evaluated to ensure that they are well trained and are able to perform their job function in a safe manner.  A contractor?s safety record and performance are reviewed during the selection process.  Once a contractor is selected, the plant provides training and procedures to ensure that contractor employees (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) are aware of the hazards associated with the area in which they will be working, (3) understand the"

Our personnel periodically monitor contractor activities to ensure they are performing their work in a safe manner.\n\nCOMPLIANCE AUDITS\n\n    A compliance audit is performed periodically to help ensure that the prevention program activities at our facility are adequate and that safety issues are addressed effectively.  Audits are performed by a team that is knowledgeable in our processes, but is independent of our facility to ensure a thorough and complete evaluation.  The audit team systematically evaluates each aspect of the prevention program, ensuring both compliance with the RMP rule and effective hazard prevention.  The results of audits are documented and recommendations are tracked until they are resolved.  Compliance audits are conducted at least every three years.\n\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n    The prevention program described previously ensures the safe operation of our facility by providing our employees with a system they can use to safely perform their job functions.  This management system helps prevent hazards associated with equipment failures and human error.  In addition to the prevention program, the Smyrna plant has safety features built into the design of our facility that help to ensure safe process operation for our employees, the public and the environment.  These features may contain or control a release, detect a release or reduce the consequences of a release.  They may also prevent a release by providing strict design standards for process equipment.  The following types of safety features are used in various processes in our facility:\n-    Release detection monitors\n-    Procedures require that a plan employee be present during loading and unloading operations\n-    Valves to permit isolation of the process\n-    Automated notification systems for some process parameters, (e.g., high level, high pressure)\n-    Manual shutdown systems located in the control room\n-    D"

However, only one of these has resulted in any off-site consequences that involved any injuries.  In addition, no significant property damage has occurred on or off-site.  The one incident did not result in a public evacuation.\n\n    For any incidents that occur, we conduct an incident investigation to identify and correct the root cause(s) of the event.  The following list describes some of the improvements made as a result of these investigations:\n-    Tank level alarms and gauges\n-    Implemented a Mechanical Integrity program\n-    Upgraded secondary containment\n-    Implemented a scrubber system check list\n-    Installed perimeter monitoring devices\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n    The Smyrna plant maintains a written emergency response plan that is designed to protect employees, the public and the environment.  The procedures include all aspects of emergency response, including proper first-aid and other medical procedures, the use of emergency equipment, the use of personal protective equipment, evacuation plans and community emergency response notification procedures.  Procedures for maintaining emergency response equipment are also contained in the emergency response plan.  There are procedures that address maintaining, inspecting, testing and using the critical equipment needed in an emergency.
