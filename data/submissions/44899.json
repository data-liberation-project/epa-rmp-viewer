      "SummaryText": "The goal of a risk management program is to prevent accidental releases of toxic and flammable substances that can cause serious harm to the public and environment, and to mitigate the effects of accidental releases that do occur.  Under the requirements of Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act (CAA), Indiana Rail Road Company Palestine, Illinois Yard (INRD Palestine Yard) has completed a risk management program according to Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 68 (40 CFR 68).  INRD Palestine Yard temporarily stores chlorine and butane in tank cars on site in quantities above threshold values while on route to their final destination.  INRD Palestine Yard falls into the RMP requirements because the motive power is removed from the cars during temporary storage.  Predictive filing was used because of the variable nature of storage at INRD Palestine Yard.  The quantity of each chemical was determined by evaluating the maximum quantity of each chemical expected to be in each tank car and the expected maximum number of cars on site.  \n\nINRD Palestine Yard will conduct its operations in a way as to avoid harm to its employees and all others who may be affected directly or indirectly by its activities, and to maintain the highest practically achievable standards of safety, occupational health and working environment.  All employees will take personal responsibility for their health and safety and the protection of the working environment and surrounding areas.  INRD Palestine Yard does not perform any loading or unloading of the regulated chemicals onsite and does not perform maintenance on the tanks containing regulated substances; therefore, reducing the risk of accidental releases associated with these chemicals.  Operations are regulated by the Department of Transportation and safety is maintained as a priority.  All employees are properly trained in operating procedures and safety programs.  There have been no accidental releases of the regulated substance"

      "SummaryText": "s in the last five years.\n\nShould a release or other emergency situation occur at INRD Palestine Yard, the employees will follow the company?s written Emergency Incident Procedures.  INRD Palestine Yard has a 24-hour dispatcher that acts as the first line of communication during an emergency and is able to contact the appropriate emergency agencies.  The initial contact will contact the dispatcher and relay appropriate information about the emergency.  In the event of an emergency, INRD Palestine Yard employees are not to respond to the emergency themselves but contact the appropriate emergency services (ambulance, if needed) and the dispatcher to deploy the organized Indiana Rail Road Company emergency response team and other emergency and regulatory agencies.  The emergency response team is responsible for coordinating all phases of the incident response. \n\nINRD Palestine Yard will continue to evaluate safety concerns at the facility and train employees on new concerns that may arise."
