In 1996, the EPA RMP rule established that a Program Level 3 Prevention Program would become a requirement for these processes as well. The facility's Program Level 3 Prevention Program under the RMP rule is essentially the same as the OSHA PSM Program, except that the program also focuses on protecting the public and the environment.\r\n  \r\nThe following sections briefly describe the elements of the Wauna Mill Program Level 3 Prevention Program that addresses the EPA RMP rule prevention program requirements.\r\n\r\n1.0 INTRODUCTION\r\n\t\r\nAt the Wauna Mill, the facility takes a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.

The company and employees are committed to the standard that these management systems set for the way the facility does business, and have specific accountabilities and controls to ensure that the facility is meeting their own high standards for accident prevention.\r\n\t\r\n2.0 PROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION\r\n\t\r\nIn accordance with Section 68.65 of the RMP rule, the facility systematically controls the creation, updating, and retention of written documentation associated with the process chemicals, process technology, and process equipment. This information is essential for supporting all of the other elements of the risk management program. The facility also uses this information"

As part of this commitment, the company has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the hazardous chemical processes at this facility. One component of this system is a Risk Management Program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the facility and addresses compliance with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Regulation 40 CFR 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule). One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a Risk Management Plan (RMPlan) describing the Risk Management Program at the Wauna Mill. This document is intended to satisfy the RMPlan requirements of the RMP Rule and to provide the public with a description of the Risk Management Program at the facility.\r\n\r\nThe Risk Management Program at the facility consists of three elements:\r\n\r\n1.\tA hazard assessment to help understand (a) the potential off site consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and (b) accidents that may have occurred during the last five years associated with the use of the substances regulated by the RMP rule - see topic 1.2\r\n2.\tA prevention program to help maintain and safely operate the processes containing more than the threshold quantity of the regulated substances (covered processes) -see topic 1.4\r\n3.\tAn emergency response program to help respond to accidental releases of the regulated substances from the covered processes - see topic 1.6\r\n\r\nInformation further describing these elements is provided in this RMPlan summary.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Risk Management Program at the facility helps provide assurance that the facility is maintained and operated in a safe manner, it is only one component of the safety program at The Wauna Mill.

These products include towel and tissue products for retail stores and the commercial market. The Wauna mill employs about 740 people from the local area. \r\n\r\nSawdust, wood chips, and purchased pulp are transported to the mill by barge or by truck. Sawdust and wood chips are stored in piles prior to processing.\r\n\r\nWauna uses the Kraft process to convert wood into pulp.  The Kraft process uses a sodium hydroxide and sodium sulfide solution under heat and pressure to dissolve the lignin component of wood. The dissolved lignin and spent pulping chemicals are separated from unbleached pulp by washers and sent to chemical recovery. After washing, unbleached pulp goes through a multi-stage bleach plant. The bleaching process uses sodium hydroxide, oxygen, chlorine dioxide, and hydrogen peroxide to remove residual lignin from the pulp and whiten it to commercial brightness levels. The chlorine dioxide solution is produced on-site from sodium chlorate, sulfuric acid, methanol, and water.\r\n\r\nThere are five paper machines at the Wauna mill.  They all produce towel and tissue grades. \r\n\r\nBleached pulps derived from different wood species, as well as purchased pulp and secondary fiber recycled from waste paper are blended to produce a mixture tailor-made for each paper gr"
