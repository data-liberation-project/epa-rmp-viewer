As part of this commitment, the company has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the hazardous chemical processes at this facility. One component of this system is a Risk Management Program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the facility and addresses compliance with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Regulation 40 CFR 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule). One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a Risk Management Plan (RMPlan) describing the Risk Management Program at the Wauna Mill. This document is intended to satisfy the RMPlan requirements of the RMP Rule and to provide the public with a description of the Risk Management Program at the facility.\n\n\n\nThe Risk Management Program at the facility consists of three elements:\n\n\n\n1.    A hazard assessment to help understand (a) the potential off site consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and (b) accidents that may have occurred during the last five years associated with the use of the substances regulated by the RMP rule - see topic 1.2\n\n2.    A prevention program to help maintain and safely operate the processes containing more than the threshold quantity of the regulated substances (covered processes) -see topic 1.4\n\n3.    An emergency response program to help respond to accidental releases of the regulated substances from the covered processes - see topic 1.6\n\n\n\nInformation further describing these elements is provided in this RMPlan summary.\n\n\n\nAlthough the Risk Management Program at the facility helps provide assurance that the facility is maintained and operated in a safe manner, it is only one component of the safety program at The Wauna Mill. In fact, the facility has a comprehensive safety program in place establishing many levels of safeguards that are"

When hazardous substances are used at the facility, the equipment is carefully designed, built, and operated to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release. Industry and government standards are closely adhered to in design, construction, and operation of the equipment.\n\n\n\nThe Wauna Mill takes steps to limit damage from a release, if such a release were to occur. The facility trains plant emergency operations personnel to respond to upset conditions, reducing the consequences of a release if it occurs. In addition, the facility participates with the Columbia Emergency Planning Association (CEPA) LEPC to help ensure that injuries and/or environmental damage will not occur in the event that a release does occur.\n\n\n\nThe safety program at The Wauna Mill consists of a number of elements, only some of which are required by the RMP rule. This RMPlan is primarily intended to describe those parts of the safety program at the facility that are required by the RMP rule.\n\n\n\n1.1    Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nThe Wauna Mill is committed to the safety of workers and the public, as well as the preservation of the environment through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances. The facility implements controls to prevent foreseeable releases of the hazardous substances. These controls include training programs for personnel; programs to help ensure safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the processes; and programs to evaluate the hazards at the facility.\n\n\n\nIn the event of an accidental release, the facility will control and contain the release in a manner that will be safe for workers and will help prevent injury to the public and/or the enviro"

The Wauna Mill provides response training for upset conditions to facility personnel, designates an emergency response coordinator to oversee response activities, and coordinates response efforts with the local emergency response organizations.\n\n\n\nIn order to effectively implement these policies, the facility has established a management system directed by the Vice President/Mill Manager.\n\n\n\n1.2    The Wauna Mill and Its Regulated Substances\n\n\n\n1.2.1    Mill Description\n\n\n\nThe Georgia-Pacific Consumer Products LP Wauna Mill is located on 1200 acres adjacent to the Columbia River in Clatsop County, Oregon.  \n\n\n\nThe Wauna mill is a fully integrated pulp and paper mill that produces a variety of paper products.  These products include towel and tissue products for retail stores and the commercial market. The Wauna mill employs about 740 people from the local area. \n\n\n\nSawdust, wood chips, and purchased pulp are transported to the mill by barge or by truck. Sawdust and wood chips are stored in piles prior to processing.\n\n\n\nWauna uses the Kraft process to convert wood into pulp.  The Kraft process uses a sodium hydroxide and sodium sulfide solution under heat and pressure to dissolve the lignin component of wood. The dissolved lignin and spent pulping chemicals are separated from unbleached pulp by washers and sent to chemical recovery. After washing, unbleached pulp goes through a multi-stage bleach plant. The bleaching process uses sodium hydroxide, oxygen, chlorine dioxide, and hydrogen peroxide to remove residual lignin from the pulp and whiten it to commercial brightness levels. The chlorine dioxide solution is produced on-site from sodium chlorate, sulfuric acid, methanol, and water.\n\n\n\nThere are five paper machines at the Wauna mill.  They all produce towel and tissue grades. \n\n\n\nBleached pulps derived from different wood species, as well as purchased pulp and secondary fiber recycled from waste paper are blended to produce a mixture tailor-made for each paper gr"

Portions of the production equipment are shut down periodically for maintenance or cleaning.  The entire facility is generally shut down only once per year for maintenance.\n\n\n\n1.2.2    Substances and Processes Regulated Under RMP\n\n\n\nThe Wauna mill stores two chemicals above the threshold limits of 40 CFR 68.130.  A summary of the RMP-regulated processes and substances is given below.  \n\n\n\nTable ES-1\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia (Program 3): Fluid bed boiler NOx control system, includes storage of anhydrous ammonia\n\nChlorine Dioxide (Program 3): R-8 reactor system including storage system for dilute, aqueous chlorine dioxide solution.\n\n\n\nChlorine Dioxide Generator and Associated Chlorine Dioxide Storage:  The mill produces chlorine dioxide on-site for subsequent use in the Kraft bleach plant.  In this process, methanol is added to a heated solution of sodium chlorate and sulfuric acid in a reaction vessel which is under a vacuum.  The resultant chlorine dioxide gas is absorbed in cold water and then stored as a nominal 1% solution.  \n\nFluid Bed Boiler NOx Control and Associated Ammonia Storage:  The Fluid Bed Boiler at Wauna uses ammonia injection as part of its Fluid Bed Boiler (FBB) Selective Non-Catalytic Reduction (SNCR) Nitrogen Oxides (NOx) control system which is part of the pollution control equipment package.  Liquid ammonia is purchased and stored on-site in a 12,000 gallon tank.  From the storage tank, ammonia is added to the mill's fluid bed boiler as needed to control emissions.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n \n\nWauna Mill has always used a prevention program to help prevent accidental releases of hazardous substances. Beginning in 1992, the facility formalized this prevention program for the Chlorine Dioxide Solution System to comply "
