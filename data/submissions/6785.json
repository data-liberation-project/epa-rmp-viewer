An outline of the Risk Management Program is provided in Figure ES-1. \n  The disinfection process (i.e., chlorine system) is covered under this regulation at the Sewerage\n  and Water Board of New Orleans (S&WB) Algiers Water Purification Plant (WPP). \n\n  To meet the regulation requirements, this binder contains useful information on the chlorine\n  system. The technical information herein may be used as a training reference in initial and\n  recurring operator and maintenance training. Training on process fundamentals, operations, and\n  maintenance, coupled with the recommended process modifications discussed below, will reduce the potential\n  hazards to plant personnel and the surrounding community.\n\n  An Emergency Response Program and an Incident Investigation Program are included. These two programs should be\n  an integral part of both initial and recurring training.\n\n  A Risk Management Plan (RMP), in the format required by the EPA, is included at the end of the main body of this\n  document.  It consists of a summary of data elements as required by EPA for inclusion in a public access database. \n  The RMP is intended to inform the public of Algiers WPP's\n  proactive stance toward protection of the environment and the surrounding community.\n\n  Hazard Assessment\n  The Hazard Assessment is comprised of a Worst Case and Alternative Release Scenario for the\n  chlorine system, as well as a 5-Year Accident History for the same. The Hazard Assessment was\n  conducted as an initial screening procedure as part of determining which Program Level (I, II, or\n  III) the Algiers WPP falls.  Residences lie within the EPA-defined endpoint concentrations of\n  Algiers' Worst-Case releases. Therefore, the plant is ineligible for Program I.  The Algiers Water"

      "SummaryText": "Purification Plant is operated by public personnel and therefore excluded from Program III. \n  Algiers Water Purification Plant is included in Risk Management Program II.  The Hazard\n  Assessment is provided in Chapters 1 through 3.\n\n  Worst Case Scenario\n  The Worst Case Scenario (WCS) is defined as a ton container (2,000 pounds) of chlorine being\n  released by a catastrophic event within a 10 minute duration. A mitigation factor of 0.55 is\n  allowed for this process due to the building which encloses the chlorine system. This scenario\n  was developed and modeled using the EPA approved RMP Comp model. The toxic endpoint\n  for chlorine was determined to be 0.9 miles for RMP Comp at the 3 ppm concentration specified\n  by the EPA.  It should be noted that at this concentration, a person may be exposed for up to one\n  hour without suffering permanent injuries (ERPG-2).\n\n  Alternative Release Scenario\n  The Alternative Release Scenario (ARS) of chlorine was also modeled using RMP Comp. An\n  estimation of approximately 348 pounds of chlorine gas released was derived from the scenario\n  of a flexible connection failure.  This release is contained within the chlorine storage room.  The\n  Algiers WPP has a scrubbing system as a means of chlorine release mitigation, which may be\n  considered when modeling alternative release scenarios.  The scrubber is sized to neutralize the\n  2000 pounds of chlorine (the entire contents of a 1-ton container.)  As a result, the radius of\n  impact would effectively be zero.  However, for RMP reporting purposes the minimum radius is\n  0.01 miles.\n\n  5 Year Accident History\n  One (1) qualifying chlorine accident has been documented within the past 5 years.  In 1997, a\n  minor release of chlorine occurred due to a partially open valve in a chlorine purge line.  The\n  purge line was used to evacuate the chlorine supply piping during container changes and\n  maintenance.  A valve was inadvertently left slightly open allowing a undetermined but sm"

There were no\n  known exposure related injuries from this incident to either on-site or off-site receptors,\n  although a lawsuit was subsequently filed against the Sewerage & Water Board by nearby\n  property owners alleging damages from chlorine. \n\n  Management Program\n  The Management Program consists of the Document Management System described below:\n\n  Document Management System\n  A Document Management System was established to attribute responsibility for the\n  development, implementation, and maintenance of the Risk Management Program. The\n  Program must be updated every three years, or any time a covered process undergoes a physical\n  or administrative modification.  The Document Management System is largely a function of the\n  Risk Management Program Team, described below in Table ES-1.\n\n  Risk Management Program Team\n  Tables ES-1 lists the employees responsible for the Risk Management Program development,\n  implementation, and maintenance. The Plant Superintendent has the ultimate responsibility.\n  \n  Prevention Program\n  The Prevention Program is more appropriately entitled the Accidental Release Prevention Program.  It is comprised of Safety\n  Information, Hazard Review, Operating Procedures, Training, Maintenance, Incident\n  Investigation, and Compliance Audit procedures.  Each has an entire chapter devoted to it in this RMP, and is described in\n  more detail below.\n\n  Safety Information\n  Safety Information is divided between Chemical Safety Information and Process Safety\n  Information.

The blowdown line has been removed.)\n  @/\u0004@ Install gas filters before the chlorinators.\n  @/\u0004@ Consider the installation of ceiling mounted room heaters rather than portable space heaters.\n  @/\u0004@ Locate a chlorine detector outside of the chlorine room (ex. near recycle basin).  \n  @/\u0004@ Develop an improved emergency response plan.\n\n  Operating Procedures\n  Basic chlorine system operating procedures have been developed and documented for the\n  Algiers WPP. They provide system descriptions, specifications, and operating procedures for the\n  chlorine gas system. Procedures include Start-up, Shutdown, Normal, Abnormal, and\n  Emergency Operation. Also included are Troubleshooting Procedures.\n\n  Training \n  Training is required by the EPA to be included in the Risk Management Program. A program\n  has been developed with guidelines on how to conduct regular and structured plant training.\n  Training Record Forms are included with the Program for the required documentation.\n  Additionally, a Training Record has been compiled and included for all affected personnel\n  associated with the covered processes.\n\n  Maintenance\n  Basic chlorine system maintenance procedures have been developed with associated\n  documentation forms. Sound preventive maintenance will reduce potential hazards to personnel\n  onsite, as well as to the off-site public.  In the event of an inspection or compliance review, state\n  and federal regulators will request to see documentation and record keeping"

The EPA has established strict\n  guidelines to follow in the aftermath of any release involving the chlorine system. The Incident\n  Investigation Program outlines key milestones that must be accomplished within 24 hours of\n  any covered incident, and the actions that must occur subsequently. Ultimately, it is desired that\n  the plant learns from the incident and takes action to prevent similar incidents in the future.\n  Incident Investigation Report Forms are included, and must be maintained for a minimum of\n  five years after each incident.\n\n  Compliance Audits\n  Internal Compliance Audits must be conducted every three years to verify compliance with the\n  programs and procedures contained in this document. The Plant Manager must certify that the\n  Risk Management Program team has evaluated compliance with the provisions of the Program,\n  and verify that the procedures and practices are adequate and are being followed. Audit Report\n  Forms are provided, the two most recent of which must always be maintained. This means that\n  in the year 2006, the Compliance Audit Report for the year 2000 may be discarded.\n\n  Emergency Response Program\n  The Emergency Response Program is included as part of the Risk Management Program, in case\n  a significant release ever occurs. As in all the above programs, it is important to review this\n  program regularly. The Rule, 40 CFR 68.95 requires training for all employees \"in relevant\n  procedures\" of the Emergency Response Program.\n  It is recommended that training on the specific plant safety procedures take place upon initial\n  employment and every year thereafter, as with most of the other RMP training programs.  Other\n  training recommendations, i.e., OSHA 8, 24, and 40 hour training are discussed in the\n  Emergency Response Program as appropriate to the level of response.\n\n  Risk Management Plan\n  A"

The format details are provided in Section 3.\n  The RMP Rule, 40 CFR 68.54 requires that each employee presently operating a process, and\n  each employee newly assigned to a covered process be trained or tested competent in the\n  operating procedures.  As an alternative, the S&WB may certify in writing that the employee has\n  the required knowledge, skills, and abilities to safely carry out the duties and responsibilities as\n  provided in the operating procedures.  Training documentation forms are provided in Section 7. \n  CDM facilitated the development of operating procedures for the Algiers WPP, and they are\n  provided in Section 6.  These operating procedures may be used as training guides as well. \n  The RMP Rule, 40 CFR 68.56 also requires training on the plant maintenance procedures. \n  Maintenance guidance is provided in Section 7.  The S&WB must train or cause to be trained\n  each employee involved in maintaining the on-going mechanical integrity of the process.  To\n  ensure that the employee can perform the job tasks in a safe manner, each such employee must\n  be trained in the hazards of the process, in how to avoid or correct"
