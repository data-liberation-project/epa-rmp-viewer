Typical operating conditions range from vacuum 1.6 Hg on the low pressure side of the system to 166 psig on the high side of the system.\r\n  \r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nIn order to operate the ammonia refrigeration system, the facility complies with the following risk management regulations:\r\n\r\n1) OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM);\r\n2) EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP); and\r\n3) California Accidental Release Prevention Program (CalARP).  \r\n\r\nThese regulations impose numerous requirements on the facility to ensure the safety of the public and on site workers.  The following summarizes the key compliance programs that have been implemented by Konoike E Street, Inc. to prevent the accidental release of ammonia from the facility.  The Operating Procedures program ensures that the ammonia system is operated in a safe manner.  The Training program ensures that personnel fully understand how to perform their jobs in a safe manner.  The Mechanical Integrity program ensures that the ammonia system is in proper working condition based upon routine testing, inspections, and maintenance according to manufacturer's specifications and industry standards.  The Management of Change program ensures that process modifications are implemented in a safe manner.  The Pre Startup Safety Review program ensures that adequate safety measures are in place before ammonia is introduced into a process.  The Hot Work Permit program ensures that Konoike E Street, Inc.' employees and contractors perform hot work (e.g. welding) in a safe manner.  The Contractor Safety program ensures that contractors understand the hazards of ammonia and must take specified precautions to safely complete job requirements.\r\n\r\nIt is important to note that the refrigeration system has been designed with several safety features to prevent the accidental release of ammonia.

Also, level indicators, alarms, and switches are installed in key points within the system to monitor the supply of liquid ammonia and to ensure that a vessel is not overfilled.  The facility has also installed ammonia sensors at strategic locations throughout the facility.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nBased on the investigation into the facility's accident review conducted at the time of the Hazard Review (October 27, 2016), showed that there have been no releases of anhydrous ammonia that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 100 pounds over the past five years (November 2011 - November 2016).  In addition there have been no injuries resulting from an ammonia release.\r\n\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe facility has an Emergency Action Plan (plan) in effect at the facility.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:  \r\n\r\n- save lives;\r\n- minimize and avoid injuries;\r\n- protect the environment; and\r\n- minimize property damage.\r\n\r\nSince facility personnel will not respond to an ammonia release at the facility that poses a health or safety threat, the Plan provides the notification procedures and evacuation routes for emergencies that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year to ensure compliance with the PSM, RMP, and CalARP regulations.  Facility personnel receive annual training regarding the emergency procedures.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nThe Process Hazard Analysis Revalidation was conducted on October 27, 2016 to satisfy the five year update requirements.  The team involved in the development of the HAZOP made several procedural/managerial recommendations to improve safety at the facility.  The 2016 Process Hazard Analysis consisted of the following:\r\n\r\n- A review of the Process Hazard Analysis Requirements / History (Over"

The mitigation measures include additional training, key maintenance-related tests/inspections, and enhanced emergency response policies and procedures.  The Konoike E Street, Inc. safety committee is planning to complete several items, including the recommendations, over the next year, as a continual effort to provide a safe work environment for their employees.  \r\n\r\nA Process Hazard Analysis Addendum study was conducted on March 21, 2014 to HazOP Evaporators UC-26 & UC-27.  This study generated mitigation measures (recommendations) to update the Mechanical Integrity to include the new evaporators, to ensure all new vessel and connected piping are properly labeled, to ensure all the new vales are properly tagged, lower the low level detection to 25 ppm, and to update the Emergency Action Plan.  These analyses provided the mitigation measures outlined below to improve safety at the Konoike E Street, Inc. \r\n\r\nIn addition, the facility is planning to complete several items over the next year as their continue effort to provide safe work environment for Konoike E Street, Inc. employees in Wilmington, California.
