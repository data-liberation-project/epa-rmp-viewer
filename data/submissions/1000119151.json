      "SummaryText": "Introduction\n\nWestern Zirconium, a division of Westinghouse Electric Company LLC, is an integrated manufacturing facility that extracts zirconium and produces zirconium metal and metal products. The facility, which employs about 400 people, is located in a rural area of Weber County, Utah, near the eastern shore of the Great Salt Lake. The zirconium produced by Western Zirconium is used worldwide primarily by the commercial nuclear fuel industry. The process of producing zirconium metal involves the use of several chemicals, including chlorine and ammonia. Because of the nature of the manufacturing process, the facility typically maintains a sizable inventory of these chemicals on site. We also maintain a large quantity of propane, which is used for supplemental heating and to fuel a calciner, as well as the plant boilers. The employees of Western Zirconium are proud of our 45-year history of safe handling of these chemicals. While the products we produce are used by nuclear power utilities, the products we make do not contain radioactive materials.\n\nThe following represents some additional information about Western Zirconium, its commitment to safety and protection of the environment, and how we employ this commitment to minimize risk to the community.\n\nOur Commitment to Safety and the Environment\nThe employees and management at Western Zirconium believe that nothing is more important than the health and safety of our employees, our contractors, the general public, and the protection of the environment. Western Zirconium prides itself on its commitment to meet or exceed all applicable legal and regulatory requirements.\n\nOur commitment to safety and environmental protection includes the following:\n-\tA commitment to prevent accidents and to minimize, as far as reasonably achievable, the consequences of any accident that might occur.\n-\tA commitment to meet all statutory requirements for safety and environmental protection.\n-\tA commitment to strive for continual improv"

The facility stores these chemicals in tanks and rail cars and transfers them into process equipment through pipelines. Because these chemicals are inherently toxic or flammable, the management and employees of Western Zirconium have spent a considerable amount of time and effort assessing potential dangers associated with storing and using these chemicals in our processes. In doing so, we employed EPA and OSHA recognized approaches for evaluating potential hazards. Potential dangers associated with these chemicals include potential toxic release, fire and environmental impact.\n\nThe risk associated with a chemical hazard is evaluated based on several variables, including the likelihood of a release occurring, the inherent hazards of the chemical involved, the quantity released, the potential impact of the release on the public and the environment, and mitigating influences, such as safety planning and safety systems. Pursuant to the requirements of EPA's Risk Management Program, we have analyzed worst-case scenarios using assumptions developed by EPA and site-specific alternative scenarios. For specific reasons discus"

      "SummaryText": "sed below, we believe the alternative site-specific scenarios are more representative of a realistic worst case. For all scenarios, we have followed procedures outlined in EPA's Risk Management Plan Off-site Consequence Analysis Guidance document. Data developed using EPA's guidance document is very conservative; that is, it overestimates the distance a toxic release would likely travel.\n\nLow public risk exists for the following reasons:\n\n-\tWestern Zirconium uses generally recognized best management practices and methods to prevent accidental releases of hazardous chemicals. These methods include such things as employee training, preventive and predictive maintenance procedures to prevent equipment failures, automatic shutoffs and monitoring systems. Well-established operating procedures are used to ensure process equipment is operated within safe limits.\n-\tWestern Zirconium's safety program includes an Emergency Response Plan and on-site response teams. Our ability to respond to an emergency has always been a top priority for Western Zirconium. The plant has its own well-trained and equipped Fire and Hazardous Materials Response Teams staffed by employees. These response teams receive special training comparable to local fire departments.\n\n-\tOur response teams periodically conduct training exercises with local fire departments. Western Zirconium emergency response is coordinated by the Weber County, Utah, Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). \n\n-\tIn the event a release would occur, it is generally the area closest to the site of the release - within a half mile or less - that would be most affected. The Western Zirconium facility is located in a remote, unoccupied area with no adjacent residential population. Western Zirconium owns the vacant land surrounding our facility, which reduces the risk of a chemical release leaving our site.\n\n\nFor More Information:\nIf you would like to learn more about Western Zirconium or Westinghouse Electric Company LLC, please vi"
