Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\n\n\n\nWe at HEB Kirby Distribution Center San Antonio, Texas are committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as the design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the Ammonia (anhydrous) refrigeration system at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate control measures to prevent possible releases of Ammonia (anhydrous).  In the event that an accidental release did occur, our highly trained employees are available to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  We are also completely coordinated with the San Antonio Fire Department, who provides our on-site emergency response services.\n\n\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled:\n\n\n\nWe have one substance that is regulated by the Process Safety and Risk Management regulations at our facility.  That substance is Ammonia (anhydrous).  The maximum inventory of Ammonia (anhydrous) that is expected to be present in this facility, based on process and operational requirements is 17,000 pounds.\n\n\n\n3. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical Specific Prevention Steps:\n\n\n\nHEB Kirby Distribution Center San Antonio,Texas has taken the following steps as required by 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA's Clean Air and Emergency Planning and Community Right To Know Acts.  Our Ammonia (anhydrous) refrigeration system is also subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management regulation 29 CFR 1910.119.  The following sections will briefly describe the elements of the accidental release prevention program that is in place at our facility.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information:\n\n\n\nOur facility conducts comprehensive analyses to ensure that all of the hazards associated with our Ammonia (anhydrous) refrigeration system are identified and controlled safely.

The analyses are completed by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in the engineering, maintenance, operation and safety of the system and are updated at an interval of at least every 5 years.  Any corrective actions noted in these analyses are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures:\n\n\n\nHEB Kirby Distribution Center San Antonio,Texas maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation including initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and startup after a turnaround.  The information in these procedures is reviewed at least annually by personnel who operate and/or maintain the Ammonia (anhydrous) refrigeration system.\n\n\n\nTraining:\n\n\n\nHEB Kirby Distribution Center San Antonio,Texas has a comprehensive training program to ensure that personnel who operate and/or maintain the Ammonia (anhydrous) refrigeration receive initial and refresher training and evaluations.  New personnel receive basic classroom training in the operation and maintenance of the process, followed by on-the-job training and supervision, until they are evaluated as competent to work independently.  Refresher training is provided at an interval of at least every three years.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity:\n\n\n\nHEB Kirby Distribution Center San Antonio,Texas completes preventive maintenance inspections and tests of the Ammonia (anhydrous) refrigeration system to ensure proper operation.
