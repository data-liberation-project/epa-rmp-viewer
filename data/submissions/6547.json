They have monthly mandatory safety meetings for all employees in which chemical safety and operational procedures are key issues.  Signs are posted to remind employees of the hazards associated with chlorine as well as the necessary procedures in the event of an emergency situation.\n\n\nRegulated Substances handled at the Painesville Water Treatment Plant:\n\nThe Painesville Water Treatment Plant treats 7.5 million gallons per day (MGD) for the surrounding community servicing approximately 24,000 people.  Disinfecting of the water supply is accomplished through the use of chlorine gas.  The disinfection process requires approximately 200 pounds of chlorine per day.  The Painesville plant has storage capacity for 15 one-ton chlorine cylinders and typically stores 9 full cylinders on-site. \n\n\nWorst-case release and alternative release scenario(s):\n\nThe worst case scenario is failure of a one-ton chlorine cylinder.  This scenario involves compromising a one-ton cylinder by severe impact.  This can occur while lifting the cylinder from the ground level storage area to the chlorine feed room by hoist and monorail.  The facility is located in a populated area and a chlorine plume could reach residents in the nearby area.\n\nThe alternative release scenario is a hose or valve failure during the switchover of one of the chlorine storage cylinders.  This can occur if the operator, while switching the cylinders, is not careful to properly seat the vacuum regulator on the one-ton chlorine cylinder.  The alternative release scenario would most likely remain on site within the chlorine feed room.  Both scenarios were evaluated using the modeling program RMP*COMP.\n\n \nGeneral accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\nAs part of the Painesville"

      "SummaryText": " Water Treatment Plant accidental release prevention program, the plant  requires that three men be involved in the switching or moving of a chlorine cylinder.  This dramatically decreases the possibility that a person could become overcome by chlorine gas without the awareness of others.\n\nMaintenance is performed on a regular basis on the chlorine feed system.  The vacuum regulators that are installed on the chlorine cylinders have semi-annual maintenance performed on them.  In addition to the maintenance, there are spare parts along with replacement regulators on hand at the site.\n\n\nFive-year accident history:\n\nThe Painesville plant has had two accidental releases of chlorine in the past five years. Both incidents occurred during cylinder switchover in which valves were improperly seated.  Both incidents resulted in gas releases affecting the operator only.  No offsite consequences were reported nor were there any injuries.\n\n\nEmergency response program:\n\nThe Painesville Water Treatment Plant has adopted an in-house training procedure through the experience of senior employees.  Training involves demonstrating the procedures for switching a chlorine cylinder and how to properly operate the chlorine disinfection system.  Switching a chlorine cylinder follows a step-by-step method that has been developed for the plant.\n\nThe Painesville plant has a chlorine alert system installed in the chlorine room.  The chlorine alert system consists of a chlorine level detector that will alert the plant operators when an abnormally high level of chlorine gas is present.  In addition to detection, the plant has exhaust fans in place for evacuating the air in the chlorine room in the event of a chlorine leak.  Self-contained breathing apparatus is also located near the chlorine room.\n\nIn addition to these technological safety devices, the plant has a procedural plan in the event of a chlorine leak.  The plan contains the procedures for handling the case of a leak that occurs at the "

This will involve alerting the local emergency planning commission (LEPC) along with the local fire department and performing an evacuation of the plant.\n\nSchematics of the facility including the layout of the chemical storage and feed areas are on file with the LEPC and the local fire department.  All exit signs are clearly marked for evacuation.  \n\nPublic awareness has been addressed via a Right to Know presentation hosted by the Lake County LEPC on June 12, 1999.  The goal of this meeting was to increase the public's knowledge of regulated substances in the area as well as illustrating the procedures and commitment of the LEPC to protect the wellbeing of the general public and the environment. \n\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety:\n\nThe Painesville Water Treatment Plant has recently completed a new contingency plan to provide response options under multiple event scenarios.  The chlorine facility was evaluated for compliance with current design requirements.  Plant personnel have addressed most of the recommendations contained in that evaluation."
