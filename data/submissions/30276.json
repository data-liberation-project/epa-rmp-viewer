Facility policy\n     The owners, management, and employees of Geary Grain, Inc. are committed to the prevention of any accidental release on anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility information\n    In relation to anhydrous ammonia the primary activity is the receipt, storage, and distribution of anhydrous ammonia as a crop production nutrient. Anhydrous ammonia is received by truck in approximately 42000 lb loads as a gas liquefied by pressure. It is stored in a 12000 gallon storage tank under pressure until it is transferred to 1000 gallon mobile nurse tanks. The maximum quantity stored on site would be approximately 154000 pounds if the 12000 gallon storage tank and all nurse tanks were full. The maximum quantity handled in a single evolution would be the unloading of a semi truck which would include the movement of approximately 42000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia. \n\n3. Prevention program\n    The accidental release prevention program at Geary Grain, Inc includes implementation of the provisions of A?Safety requirements for the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia, K-61.1A?, published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc. and the standards of the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111,  A?Storage and handling of anhydrous ammoniaA?.  It is also key to our prevention program that we strive to continually  review, update, and improve our maintenance  and operating procedures taking into account the latest equipment changes and safety guidelines. Our training program is an ongoing system of annual classroom training in association with A?hands onA? practical application of classroom instruction. Our training program is under continual review to achieve the most compreh"

Five year accident history\n    There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\n-    have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor\n-    to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n4. Emergency response program\n    Geary grain, Inc. has\n  A. a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR \n      1910.38;\n  B. provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-\n       Know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\n 5. Planned changes to improve safety\n     Safety improvement is an on-going process at this facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions. There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time.\n"
