The chlorine is stored in a room equipped with ventilation and chlorine alarms.  The chlorine gas is mixed with water in the chlorinators and is directly injected into the treatment locations.\r\n\r\nRelease Scenarios\r\nA worst case release scenario and three alternative release scenarios have been evaluated and documented in the facility RMP files.  The worst case and alternative release scenarios were reevaluated for the five year anniversary, updating population and receptor information.  Based on guidelines provided by EPA in the 2004 RMP Submit Instruction Manual, release scenario information is not provided in this Executive Summary.\r\n\r\nAdministrative and Engineering Controls\r\nThe North Attleborough Wastewater Treatment Facility has implemented a prevention program (RMP Program 2) to administratively limit the potential for a worst case or alternative release.  Specific measures employed in this program include safety reviews, hazard reviews, operating procedure reviews, training, maintenance and inspections.\r\n\r\nCompliance audits are conducted at least once every (3) three years based on the schedule contained in 40 CFR 68.58.  Hazard reviews are completed at least once every five (5) years, or sooner if major changes occur, based on the schedule contained in 40 CFR 68.50.  Maintenance and inspections are conducted on process equipment at specified intervals as outlined in the North Attleborough Wastewater Treatment Facility's RMP.  Documentation of the most recent reviews, audits, inspections and maintenance are maintained at the facility.\r\n\r\nMitigation Measures\r\nCertain engineering controls are used to mitigate the potential effects of the alternative release scenario and are listed in Section 8.4.d of the RMP submittal.\r\n\r\nGeneral Accide"
