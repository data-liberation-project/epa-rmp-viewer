      "SummaryText": "The City of Brunswick Risk Management Plan for safe handling of chlorine and sulfur dioxide involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices to monitor potential chlorine and sulfur dioxide hazards and minimize the risk of accidental chlorine and sulfur dioxide releases.  Procedures in the plan seek to provide employee safety, public health and response agency interactions.\n\nThe City of Brunswick owns and operates the wastewater treatment plant known as Academy Creek Water Pollution Control Plant.  This plant utilizes chlorine to disinfect treatment plant discharge and utilizes Sulfur Dioxide to neutralize residual chlorine prior to discharge.  Chlorination processes include chlorine and sulfur dioxide cylinders, chlorination equipment, an instrument room, electrical equipment, and process safety equipment.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario, as defined by EPA, states that \"the owner or operator shall assume that the maximum quantity in the largest vessel is released as a gas over 10 minutes.\"  The \"alternative scenario\" is defined as \"more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario\".  In each case, the modeling program \"RMP Comp\" was used to determine the distance traveled byt he chlorine and sulfur dioxide released before its concentration decreases to a theoretical \"toxic endpoint\".\n\nThe worst-case release scenatio for the Academy Creek wastewater treatment plant involves a failure of a one-ton cylinder yielding a cumulative release of 2,000 lbs of chlorine or sulfur dioxide.  When using the RMP Comp modeling program, the distance to toxic endpoint is .9 miles.\n\nThe alternative scenario for the Academy Creek plant involves a failure at flanges joints, welds, valves and valve seals, and drains and bleeds in the chlorine or sulfur dioxide piping system.  Using a hole diameter of 1/4 inch and release rate of 8.23 lbs/min the distance to toxic endpoint is less than .1 miles.  This is based on RMP Comp modeling.\n\nThe City"

This will be done using the 911 emergency telephone number.\n\nThe emergency response program includes notification of responsible individuals of the releases and procedures for notifying the general public within the release areas.\n\nNo accidental releases have occured from 1994 through 1988 involving death, injury, or response or restoration for an exposure of an environmental receptor."
