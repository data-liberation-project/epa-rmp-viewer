With this 2018 resubmission, the dispersion model was updated using the DEGADIS Model.\r\n\r\nThe most likely release scenarios would have no off-site impacts, but an alternative release scenario with off-site impacts was evaluated using the DEGADIS model. This scenario involves the breakage of a process pipeline between the solution storage area and one of the bleach plants. Assuming that the delivery pump could not be shut down it is expected that the discharge would last for 40 minutes before the mill's Emergency Response Team could suit up and stop the flow. Atmosheric conditions are assumed to be normal.  The potential impacted area includes receptors such as residences and other industrial sites. This scenario is very unlikely because the loss of flow would trigger alarms in the bleach plant, immediate investigation would ensue and the system would be shut down in much less than 40 minutes. Also,  the Emergency Response Team would be deluging any spill with water to lessen the impact of the release.\r\n\r\nChlorine dioxide is also covered under the mill's OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) program.  Enhanced training for both operations and maintenance personnel is in place for all of the covered processes as well as the Distributed Control System alarm systems to alert operations should the covered systems develop leaks or other major faults.\r\n\r\nTraining and preparation for a release include on-site emergency response teams for each shift, trained to the Hazardous Materials (Haz-Mat) technician level. These teams receive annual 40 hour training at an off-site fire academy and drill monthly under the direction of the in-house fire chief. There is a site emergency response plan, emergency operations center and on-site medical department.\r\n\r\nThe mill is well prepared should an emergency occur.
