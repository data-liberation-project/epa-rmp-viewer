NH3: stored in liquid state.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Policy\n\nPraxair is dedicated to being the best performing industrial gas company in all aspects of our business, including safety, health and environmental affairs.  Our safety, health and environmental policy call for a commitment to protecting the health and safety of our employees, neighbors and the surrounding environment.  This policy is the basis for engineering and construction programs that produce equipment and process systems that minimize the possibility of accidental chemical releases and operational safety programs that ensure safe operation of our facilities.  Praxair is committed to the continuous improvement of these programs.\n\nPraxair is an active member of the American Chemistry Council and subscribes to the council's program of Responsible Care&reg; Employee Health and Safety Code of Management Practices.\n\nPrevention Program\n\nIn accordance wtih OSHA's Process Safety Management standard and EPA's Risk Management Program rule, the Praxair Whiting, IN #5,6 facility has a comprehensive accident prevention program in place.  This program is built around process safety concepts such as:\n- Technical documentation of Process Safety Information, describing the physical  \n  properties of the hazardous substances, the safety systems in place to control these \n  substances, and the critical operating parameters of the associated equipment and \n  systems.\n-"
