      "SummaryText": "Facility and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe City of Katy Wastewater Treatment Plant is currently a 3.45 MGD plant. This facility is committed to accident prevention and protection of employees and the public.  \n\nThe plant utilizes chlorine gas as a disinfectant and sulfur dioxide for dechlorination.  Chlorine is maintained at the facility in one-ton cylinders.  The maximum quantity of chlorine present on-site and any one time is 4,000 pounds which is in excess of the Risk Management Planning threshold of 1,500 pounds.  Sulfur dioxide is also maintained at the facility in one-ton cylinders.  The maximum quantity of sulfur dioxide present at any one time is 4,000 pounds, which is below the Risk Management Planning threshold of 5,000 pounds.  \n\nThe City of Katy Plant was constructed in 1979, expanded in 2003, and has never had an accidental release of a toxic chemical.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at the Facility\n\nAccidental releases of chlorine are prevented through the use of standardized procedures recommended by the manufacturer.  Only the chlorine supplier will install or remove chlorine cylinders at the facility.  Plant personnel have been trained in procedures regarding the use of chlorine.  The chlorine system operates under a vacuum to minimize the potential for release.  \n\nEmergency response policies are discussed below under the section entitled Emergency Response Plan.\n\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nA Process Safety Hazard Analysis was conducted in June 2004 using the what-if and checklist methodologies.  The Plant chlorine system utilizes numerous engineering and administrative safeguards including vacuum design to minimize release potential, use of continuous gas detectors to provide early warning of a release, operating procedures for the system, preventative maintenance procedures, personnel training and use of personal protective equipment.  \n\nTo maintain com"

      "SummaryText": "pliance with the Process Safety Management Standard, the plant operator will certify that training has been provided to personnel operating the chlorine system and the sulfur dioxide system.  Also, refresher training will be conducted at a minimum of yearly.  That training will cover the areas of process safety information, operating procedures and emergency procedures.  Training records will be maintained. \n\nOutside contractors will be provided all necessary training prior to starting work.  That training will inform the contractors of the use of toxic compounds on site and the potential for hazardous release.  That training will also inform the contractors of their responsibility while on site.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nThe Plant has had no accidental releases of either chlorine of sulfur dioxide in the past five years.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe Emergency Response Plan addresses the requirements of 40 CFR 68 pertaining to notification, medical treatment, response procedures, planning, use and maintenance of emergency equipment, employee safety training and emergency response evaluation dealing with chlorine gas.   After discovery of a leak, the Operator and one other person will make an assessment of the situation.   If the assessment indicates that repair by Plant personnel is possible, the Plant personnel will perform the needed repairs.  If the assessment indicates that a major leak has occurred, the Plant's Emergency Response Plan will be implemented and the City of Katy Police Department will be notified.  All communication with other response agencies and any notification to the public will be coordinated through the City of Katy Police Department.  Plant personnel are trained in the Emergency Response Plan at least annually.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe chlorine and sulfur dioxide monitors presently in place will be connected to an autodialer to notify appropriate authorities of a release.  It is anticipated that the monitors will be in"
