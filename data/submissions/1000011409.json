A?1910.119, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Standard regulating Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals (HHCs) at four (4) City of Oklahoma City (OKC) Waste Water Treatment Plants (WWTP) that they operate, named:\nA?    Chisholm WWTP\nA?    Deer Creek WWTP\nA?    South Canadian WWTP\nA?    North Canadian WWTP\nThe PSM Plan is intended to assist those who may be affected by HHCs to be able to identify and understand the hazards posed by the processes that involve those chemicals.  The only HHCs currently present at the OKC WWTP facilities above PSM Program applicability threshold quantities are chlorine and sulfur dioxide, which is stored as a compressed gas in either 150 pound or 1 ton cylinders.  Cylinders of compressed chlorine gas and sulfur dioxide are used in the wastewater treatment process.  \n\nThis PSM Plan is intended to prevent the occurrence of, or minimize the consequences of, catastrophic releases.  It is a written program stating OKC WWTP policies and procedures for the management of chlorine and sulfur dioxide storage and use hazards in design, construction, start-up, operation, inspection, maintenance and training related to the OSHA Standard.\n\nThe PSM Plan requires employee participation.  Therefore, the OKC WWTP PSM Plan is intended to: \n\n(1) work with employees and their representatives on the development of Process Hazard Analyses (PHA), \n(2) the development of the OSHA Standard's other elements of process safety management, and \n(3) provide to employees and their representatives access to the process hazard analyses and all other information required to be developed under the Standard.\n\nThis PSM Plan will be regularly reviewed and updated whenever necessary to reflect new or modified tasks and procedures.\n\nA copy of the written elements of the PSM Plan, as well as the other documents and reports that are "
