In business at the same location since 1977, the company is a quality bulk storage/distribution facility for LPG-like chemicals.  Butadiene is shipped to companies around the United States, who in turn use the chemical to produce products such as tires, automotive parts, roofing materials, wire and cable coating, etc.  Propylene, which is shipped to companies in Texas, is a key ingredient used to produce plastic and rubber products.\n\nIntercontinental Terminals Company potentially has three chemicals in threshold quantities affected by the rule.  1,3 butadiene and propylene are stored continously on-site, and isobutylene is expected to be occasionally offloaded from ships directly into railcars.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\nThe following is a summary of the general Accident Prevention Program in place at the Anchorage Chemical Terminal.  EPA's Program 3 prevention requirements were implemented because some processes at the plant meet Program 3 criteria and are also subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.  In addition, Intercontinental Terminals Company has implemented Oper"

Further, OIMS has been attested as equivalent to ISO 14001 as a valid management system to oversee the implementation of the risk management activities.\n\nEMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION\nIntercontinental Terminals Company encourages associates to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of associate participation ranges from updating and compiling operating and maintenance procedures to participating as a member of a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) team.  Associates have access to all information generated from HAZOPs and Site Risk Assessments.  In addition, the plant has a number of initiatives underway that address process safety and associate safety issues via the ACT Safety Committee which is comprised of site personnel and selected contractors.\n\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION\nThe Anchorage Chemical Terminal keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  The ACT Terminal Manager is responsible for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.  A table summarizing the reference documents and their location is readily available as part of the OIMS documentation to help associates locate any necessary process safety information.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS).  This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For specific process areas, the plant has identified oper"

The plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using computerized process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (i.e., automated shutdown systems, alarm systems).\nThe plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as form evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nPROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS\nThe Anchorage Chemical Terminal has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe Anchorage Chemical Terminal primarily uses the Knowledge Based Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) study that is an adaptation by ExxonMobil Research and Engineering and ExxonMobil Chemical Americas of widely used industry methodologies to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating experience and engineering expertise on the process to be evaluated.  This PHA team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such m"

Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk evaluation done by the PHA team.  This evaluation helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned greater risk receive attention first.  All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are complete.  The resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the Anchorage Chemical Terminal periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years for the life of the process.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  The team findings are forwarded to management for consideration and resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\nOPERATING PROCEDURES AND SAFE WORK PRACTICES\nThe Anchorage Chemical Terminal maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) startup, (2) shutdown, (3) normal, and (4) emergency operations.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a consistent basis for training of new operators.  The procedures are maintained current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\nThe plant has identified operating envelopes, i.e., documented safety related limits for specific process parameters such as temperature, level, and compositions.

These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\nTRAINING\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Anchorage Chemical Terminal has implemented a comprehensive training program for all associates involved in operating a process.  New associates receive basic training in plant operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with an experienced operator to learn process specific duties and tasks.  After employees demonstrate (i.e., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operations personnel periodically receive refresher training to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  All of this training is documented for each operator.\n\nCONTRACTORS\nThe Anchorage Chemical Terminal uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner; (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills; (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace; (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency; (5) understand and follow site safety "
