The Plan includes an analysis of the potential offsite consequences of an accidental release, a five-year accident history, and a release prevention and emergency response program.  \n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nWilbur-Ellis has implemented release prevention and emergency response procedures to minimize the potential for accidental releases of hazardous materials.  Emergency response procedures including evacuation procedures and notification procedures have been implemented by Wilbur-Ellis.  In addition, Wilbur-Ellis has developed operating procedures and preventative maintenance activities to reduce the likelihood of accidental releases.\n\n\n\nThis Plan and the emergency response procedures document the accidental release prevention, safety, and emergency policies in place at Wilbur-Ellis.\n\n\n\nDescription of Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nWilbur-Ellis is located at 36025 Highway 12 in Dayton, Washington (the \"facility\").  Wilbur-Ellis is a retailer of fertilizer in the forms of anhydrous ammonia stored under pressure and aqueous ammonia.  There is one anhydrous ammonia storage tank located at the facility with a capacity of approximately 12,500 gallons.  The anhydrous ammonia is transferred from the storage tank into 1,000 gallon tanks on tender trucks.  There are two tender trucks with two 1,000 gallon tanks at the facility.  The contents of the tender trucks are sold and delivered to the local farming community for use as fertilizer.  \n\n\n\nThere is one aqueous ammonia storage tank located at the facility with a capacity of approximately 22,000 gallons.  The aqueous ammonia is transferred from the storage tank to tankers with capacities ranging from 750 gallons to 2,500 gallons.  There "

The Plan's purpose is to enhance the facility's existing safety programs implemented at the site to reduce the possibility of accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia that could cause harm to employees, the public and the environment.  The emergency response program, documented in the emergency response procedures, includes accidental release prevention and chemical specific prevention steps.\n\n\n\nWilbur-Ellis ensures that equipment meets the appropriate industry standards prior to use.  Wilbur-Ellis implements operating procedures and maintenance procedures in accordance with manufacturer and industry specifications to prevent accidental releases at the facility.  Chemical specific prevention steps implemented at the site include excess flow valves, pressure relief valves, emergency shut off valves with cables that run along the length of the horizontal storage tanks for quick access, and ammonia training for personnel.\n\n \n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThere have been no qualifying accidents involving ammonia in the five-year period prior to the completion of this Plan.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\n\nThe facility coordinates with the Columbia County Joint Fire District #2 (\"fire department\") regarding specific actions to be taken in response to an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  The facility has established emergency evacuation procedures to evacuate the site and notify the appropriate agencies regarding a release.  The facility's emergency response program is documented in the facility's Emergency Response Procedures.  The emergency procedures cont"

Information on emergency health care.\n\n3.    Emergency response training for employees.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nPlans to improve safety at the facility were developed based on the results of compliance audits, hazard reviews, and a Risk Management Plan (RMP) site inspection conducted by an outside contractor.  The Branch Manger is currently working on an implementation schedule for the recommended actions. The recommended action includes the following:\n\n\n\n1. Update emergency shutdown section of operating procedures to include specific references to valves and couplings. \n\n2. Order a sign that meets requirements and install on side of building or posts. \n\n3. Install flexible connectors for storage tank pump on liquid line and for storage tank to bulkhead on vapor line. \n\n4. Modify the daily in season inspection form to include end of day check to ensure valves are locked before site personnel leave for the day. \n\n5. Update written operating procedures or RMP data to reflect site specific information regarding colors. \n\n6. Evaluate the flexible lines serving the system are within manufacturer specifications for offsets and length. \n\n7. Evaluate the policy to determine if W-E staff is required to be present during tank filling and dispensing operations. \n\n\n\nTo improve the safety of ammonia and all other aspects of operations, Wilbur-Ellis has implemented a comprehensive, risk-based safety management process to help guide employees to improved safety performance. The safety management process, branded Guiding People to Safety (GPS), is designed to be implemented in four steps, step one comprising of the foundation and fundamental elements of a strong safety program and positive safety culture. The GPS process provides guidelines for each safety program that describe methods for effective implementation. The GPS program include"
