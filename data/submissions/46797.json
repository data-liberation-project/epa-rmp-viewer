      "SummaryText": "Facility and Regulated Materials\nThe National Welders Supply Company facility located in Charlotte, NC is primarily an acetylene production plant.  Acetylene gas is manufactured at the facility.  Also, various industrial gases are repackaged at the facility by the transfill of cryogenic gases from bulk tanks into compressed gas cylinders.  Some gases, including chlorine, are simply received in cylinders, stored on site, and shipped to customers.   The facility has determined that the quantities of acetylene and chlorine may reach the regulatory thresholds under RMP.  The facility also covers these materials under its Process Safety Management (PSM) program.   \n\nNational Welders conducts its operations to prevent possible releases or harm to its products, employees and to the surrounding area and residents.  National Welders implements many Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) for the acetylene process and the safe handling of compressed gas cylinders (including chlorine) to prevent any accidental release.  Along with written standard operating procedures, several administrative controls are used.  These include, operator training, emergency procedures, qualification of operators, and inventory control.  \n\nThe company uses a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) as the foundation of the chemical prevention program. The PHA systematically examines the equipment, systems and procedures for handling regulated materials in order to identify the hazards that exist and how to control them. The PHA included a team review of the process using the ?what-if/checklist? methodology to identify hazards, review of previous incidents, verification of controls and the consequences of their failure, review of issues related to sitting and human factors and a qualitative evaluation of failures of control.  \n\nChlorine\nThe quantity of chlorine stored on site is being increased to potentially be above RMP threshold quantities.  The chlorine is received, handled and shipped in 150 lb cylinders.  N"
