Broadway\n\t      St. Louis, MO. 63102\nRMP Facility ID: 100000154762\n\nGateway Cold Storage has implemented the requirements of the Risk Management Plan in order to operate this facility in accordance with regulations and support of the best industry standards. Our objective is to minimize the risk of an accidental ammonia release.  The facility management has developed an Emergency Action Plan along with regular training to ensure a quick and efficient response in the event of an accidental hazardous material release, fire or other emergency situation.\nIn order to prevent a potential accidental release of ammonia at Gateway Cold Storage our company has an ongoing review process of operating procedures. This helps to ensure that Gateway\u00bfs refrigeration systems comply with OSHA, EPA and all other local, state, and federal regulatory agency safety standards.\nThe management believes that cooperative emergency response with company employees, local emergency responders and regulatory agencies will provide a safe workplace and a safe environment.  In an emergency, all are instructed to cooperate with fellow employees and other support personnel as directed by our Emergency Response Coordinator. \nGateway Cold Storage is a public refrigerated warehousing facility. Most of the products stored at this facility are for human consumption and pose no known environmental or safety risks. Anhydrous ammonia is a regulated substance, which is a commonly used refrigerant in industrial grade refrigeration systems that maintain temperatures below zero and can be safely managed by trained operators.  The ammonia refrigeration process functions within a closed pipe system serving this facilities operation. Gateway\u00bfs refrigeration system contains approximately 12,500 pounds of ammonia for this system.\nGateway Cold Storage is committed to safe management and operation of their closed Ammonia Refrigera"

Should any accidental release occur, all maintenance employees are certified Emergency Hazardous Material Responders and are required to observe safe emergency response procedures.  They are trained to work in conjunction with the local Emergency Planning Commission to minimize the impact of any accidental release.\nAs part of Gateway Cold Storage\u00bfs safety programs, we have adopted OSHA Process Safety Management Plan as an integral part of our base safety manual.  The OSHA PSM Program has been implemented and covers the entire scope of safe operation procedures of the ammonia refrigeration system from start-up and normal operations to potential emergency response operations and subsequent clean-up and restoration of systems.\nNormal operations rely on the following:  \n*Maintenance Management Procedures are used to perform preventative maintenance and to maintain records of all maintenance work performed.  \tThis helps to ensure that the closed ammonia system continues to work safely, reliably and efficiently as originally intended.\n*Any set specifications of systems temperatures, pressure, level or power interruption that are exceeded or violated will normally trigger an alarm and safety shutdown. Maintenance Technicians are notified of a deviation from normal operation specifications through an indicator or alarm system.\n*In the event of deviations, technicians are trained to analyze the situation, follow personal safety procedures at all times, determine that everything is under control and correct the problems and/ or deviations.\n*If a problem cannot be corrected immediately, the equipment needing repair or service will be safely locked out of service until such time as repairs have been completed.\n*If a problem cannot be safely handled by Maintenance Personnel,\nGateway has procedures in place to obtain"

The EAP is intended to address all emergencies at this facility, in addition to incidents related to a release of ammonia. The EAP includes awareness and response training for employees, coordination with the local fire department, and evacuation of the facility.  The plan details what personal protective equipment and spill response equipment is available; identifies specific individuals, their 24 hour telephone numbers, and their responsibilities; identifies procedures for emergency medical care; and refersto other pertinent elements of the management sysstem(i.e., standard operating procedures)."
