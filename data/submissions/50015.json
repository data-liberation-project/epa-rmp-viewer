      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\nThe DuPont Memphis Plant is located north of Memphis in the Lucy-Woodstock area of Shelby County at the intersection of Hwy51 and Fite Road.  The DuPont Plant began operation in 1952 and has operated safely within the community for over 55 years.\n\nWe manufacture Hydrogen Cyanide, a basic building block chemical for the manufacture of acrylics products (manufactured by another company) and Solid Cyanides, also produced on our site for use in the mining and metallurgical industries.  We also produce a family of Aminonitrile intermediates used to make reaction initiators; and Oxone?, a dry non-chlorine based oxidizer used primarily in the water treatment and home products industries.\n\nThe DuPont Memphis Plant is committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes in a safe and responsible manner.  This document provides a brief overview of our comprehensive risk management activities.\n\n1. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nOur policy is that all accidental releases to the environment can be prevented.   Therefore our goal is to not have a release that negatively impacts the public, environment, or plant personnel.  We work closely with local off-site emergency responders to ensure that in the unlikely event a spill or release goes beyond our fence line, we are all prepared to respond.\n\n2. REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nOf the materials we handle, the following chemicals meet the Risk Management Plan threshold for assessment and reporting.   EPA has identified these materials as having potential to cause significant off-site consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release:\n\n     Toxics:           Ammonia (NH3)\n                          Hydrocyanic Acid (HCN)\n                          Oleum (Fuming Sulfuric Acid)\n                          Sulfur Dioxide (SO2)\n     Flammables:  Hydrogen\n\n3.

      "SummaryText": "th, and the environment very seriously.  We practice \"Defense-In-Depth\" which means several things must all fail at the same time for a release to occur.  Since each one of our layers of defense is very reliable, the probability of a release that spreads beyond our plant boundary is very small.  \n\n Listed below are some examples of the things we do to prevent releases and reduce the impact of releases that do occur: \n\n(a) Plant equipment is designed carefully, to minimize the probability of a major leak or spill.\n\n(b) All unusual operations, and small leaks or spills are investigated to prevent recurrence.\n\n(c) Safety controls such as instrumentation, warning alarms, monitoring equipment, and automatic shutdown systems are installed.\n\n(d) Thorough routine audits of the process are conducted.\n\n(e) Regular equipment inspections and maintenance insure proper operations.\n\n(f) Training and testing of operators and mechanics ensures they follow safe operating procedures.\n\n4. FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nUnder the RMP, EPA requires owners or operators to report all accidental releases that resulted in death, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, or property or environmental damage.  For the DuPont Memphis Site, there was one incident that met the accidental release reporting criteria, in which three employees were exposed to toxic vapor, felt or exibited signs of exposure, and were showered and given oxygen. The three exposures were recorded as OSHA Medical Treatment Cases. \n\n5. EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe DuPont Memphis Site has developed a comprehensive Emergency Action Plan that helps us to protect the health of the public and our employees and prevent harm to the environment.   The plan establishes the emergency response organization, the training and preparation requirements, the equipment and facilities used for response, and procedures utilized during response.\n\nThe overall site Emer"

This includes: \n\n(a) Prevent injuries and save the lives of the public and our employees\n\n(b) Minimize property damage\n\n(c) Minimize interruptions to the continuity of operations\n     \n(d) Maintain security of company property\n     \n(e) Insure that the public and we are prepared to respond to incidents with potential for off-site impact \n     \n(f) Maintain good public relations\n     \n(g) Facilitate cooperation with local authorities\n\nAn Emergency is defined as any incident occurring on or off the plant that may affect the safety of off-plant neighbors, plant personnel or operations, to the extent that coordination of plant personnel is required through channels other than those normally used.  The content of the plan applies to the following typical types of emergency conditions that might occur at this site: fuming condition and/or hazardous chemical release, fires and explosions, confined space rescues, spills beyond the control of a process area, personal medical emergencies, potential terrorist activities (post event), severe weather conditions and natural disasters.  A higher level of emergency, called a Major Emergency, is declared: whenever there is risk off site; when more than one operating area on site is affected; or when additional resources are needed to respond to the incident.\n\nEach RMP covered process, operating area and normally occupied building on the site maintains a portion of the Emergency Action Plan specific to their operations or facilities.\n\nInforming the Public and Local Emergency Response: \n\nThere are four ways the public is notified whenever an Emergency occurs that may potentially impact them.  First and foremost, our procedures require the site Emergency Response Team to notify the Memphis Shelby County Emergency Management Agency by telephone during the emergency.   Second, our site has implemented a Community Communication System w"

Third, our facility has an air-horn that supplements our alarm system that can alert the immediate community to an emergency condition occurring on site.   Fourth, we have an Off-Plant Air Team which conducts air monitoring off plant during emergencies and works with the Incident Commander to determine the community alert level.\n\nFirst Aid and Medical Treatment: \n\nPlant supervisors and selected members of the Emergency Response team are designated and trained annually to provide first aid coverage when Medical personnel are not on site.   The Emergency Response Team is also responsible to take whatever action is necessary for prompt transportation of injured or ill personnel to the appropriate health care facility.  Site Safety, Health and Environmental Standards for Off-Plant Medical Treatment and Incident Classification, Investigation and Reporting are the written documents that describe these procedures.\n\nProcedures for Handling Accidental Release of a Regulated Substance:\n\nHazardous materials emergencies may result from a spill or uncontrolled release of one or more plant materials.  Response to these incidents may require the services of the plant fire brigade or in some cases the site Regional HAZMAT Response Team.   All responses must comply with 29 CFR 1910.120 (q) - Hazardous Waste Operation and Emergency Response.\n\nThe Incident Commander will, upon completion of the initial assessment, request the assistance of either the shift fire brigade or the Regional HAZMAT Response Team. In some situations, both organizations may be required to assist in handling the hazardous materials incident.  Additional resources may be obtained by requesting assistance from the Shelby County Fire Department.\n\nThe Memphis Site Fire Brigade Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) describes the detailed response steps the site will take in the event of a hazardous material emergency.\n\nThe following equ"
