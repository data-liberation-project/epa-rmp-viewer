In addition, there have been no releases of ammonia that meet the RMP definition of accident as described above.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe Dreyer's Ice Cream facility has an emergency action plan in effect.  The Emergency Action Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the PSM/RMP document. This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\r\n\r\n  1.)

In 2013 a large project was completed to upgrade and replace aging system components.\r\n\r\nThe ammonia refrigeration system at Dreyer's Ice Cream facility is a closed-loop system that cycles the refrigerant, ammonia, from liquid to gas and back again.  The systems, consisting of vessels, piping, valves, and process equipment, cycle ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration to accommodate the storage and production of ice cream.\r\n\r\nDreyer's Ice Cream conducted an ammonia inventory study of the main refrigeration system to determine the ammonia charge in the system after the completion of the 2005 expansion project.  The results of the ammonia inventory study indicated that the total ammonia charge of the ammonia system was then approximately 51,405 pounds.  The ammonia system charge has been calculated periodically since 2005.  The last calculation was in 2021 using the IRC Model and showed that the charge of the main system was approximately 51,639.4 pounds.  High Pressure Receiver #2 (HPR 02) is the largest vessel in the main refrigeration system and can store the entire charge of ammonia for that system.\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nA prevention program is in place to minimize the risk of hazardous chemical releases in accordance with the California Occupational Safety and Health Administration (CalOSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (Section 5189 of Title 8, CCR) and the EPA Risk Management Program.

Since the main refrigeration system handles more than 10,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, Dreyer's Ice Cream Company has developed and implemented a Process Safety Management (PSM) / Risk Management Program (RMP) for the ammonia refrigeration process.  \r\n\r\nAs part of the PSM / RMP program, Dreyer's Ice Cream has completed process hazard analyses, developed written operating procedures, trained employees on the refrigeration system, conducted a pre-startup safety review, and developed a mechanical integrity program for the ammonia equipment.  In addition to plant personnel monitoring the operation of the refrigeration systems on a daily basis, Dreyer's Ice Cream has implemented a preventative maintenance program to ensure that the refrigeration system is maintained in good operating condition.  Properly maintained equipment reduces the risk of an accidental release.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, Dreyer's Ice Cream promotes safe and environmentally sound operating practices and procedures through their employee training programs.  In addition to job specific and process specific training, operators and maintenance personnel receive training in fire prevention, fire control, accident prevention, safety, and first aid.  \r\n\r\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\r\n\r\nThe Dreyer's Ice Cream facility is located at 970 East Continental Avenue in Tulare, California.
