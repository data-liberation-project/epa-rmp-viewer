In addition, the BP Amoco Chemical Whiting Polybutene plant has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties.  The emergency response program is reviewed annually with all plant personnel and at one evacuation drill is performed annually.  The program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to plant processes or other plant facilities.  The emergency response program changes are administered through the MOC process, which includes informing and/or training affected personnel in the changes.\n\nThe overall emergency response program for the BP Amoco Chemical Whiting Polybutene plant is coordinated with the Lake County  Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).   This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives.  The BP Amoco Chemical Whiting Polybutene plant has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department).  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.

These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years as long as the process exists.  The recommendations from these updates are also forwarded to management.  Final resolution of the recommendations is tracked, documented, and retained.  \n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe BP Amoco Chemical Whiting Polybutene plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process.  These procedures are developed/revised by experienced operators as needed and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  The procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate. Procedures are also spot audited on a semi-annual basis for compliance with our ISO 9000 Quality Program.   The procedures are revised as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\n\nAlso safe operating limits are maintained to provide guidance on how to respond to upper or lower exceedences for specific process or equipment parameters.

This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.  The system ensures that all documentation is updated and training completed prior to the commissioning of the change.\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nThe BP Amoco Chemical Whiting Polybutene plant promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.   Our incident investigation system is based on total employee involvement.  More than 75% of the plant populous have completed incident investigation training so that the facility can use everyone\u0012s experience and input.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.

Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years, so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidation\u0012s. \n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the BP Amoco Chemical Whiting Polybutene plant periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.  Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years.  Both hourly and management personnel participate as audit team members.  The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to plant management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports along with the resolution of findings are retained.  In December 1997, a Corporate Compliance Audit was conducted at our plant.  The Compliance Team stated in the final report that the incident investigation procedure at our plant should be a model for other facilities.\n\n\nCHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe processes at the BP Amoco Chemical Whiting Polybutene plant have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.  The accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all Program 3 EPA RMP covered processes at the BP Amoco Chemical Whiting Polybutene plant.

Written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training.  Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended, and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (i.e. adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels).  If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or an MOC team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance.  The BP Amoco Chemical Whiting Polybutene refinery incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs.  This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made. \n\n\nHot Work Permit\n\nThe BP Amoco Chemical Whiting Polybutene plant has a hot work permit program which details those areas which require a permit and those areas for which a permit is not required.

The WCS endpoint is based on the instantaneous release of the contents of the Butane-Butylene (BB) Storage Sphere,  resulting in a VCE.  The effects of administrative controls, mitigation systems, and safety systems are not included in determining the effects of a VCE.  Distances to the endpoint were calculated using the methodology outlined in EPA\u0012s RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.  Nearby public receptors could be affected by this type of release.  Specific information on this release is presented in more detail in the plan.  The toxic WCS is not applicable to this plant.\n\nAlternative Release Scenarios \n\nThe alternative release scenario for flammable substances at the plant is a VCE resulting from the release of a BB mixture from a flange leak.  The release is expected to be isolated by operators within 10-15 minutes. Specific information on this release is presented in more detail in the plan.  An alternative release scenario for toxic substances is not pertinent to this plant.\n\nPREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the BP Amoco Chemical Whiting Polybutene plant.  Because processes at the plant that are regulated by the  EPA RMP regulation are also subject to the OSHA PSM standard, this summary also addresses the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the prevention program.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nThe BP Amoco Chemical Whiting Polybutene plant encourages employees to participate in all facets"

Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous materials before process piping or equipment is opened, and (4) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.  These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the BP Amoco Chemical Whiting Polybutene plant has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in chemical plant operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After the new operator demonstrates (i.e. through tests, skills demonstration, etc.) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every three years.  All of this training is documented, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nContractors\n\nThe BP Amoco Chemical Whiting Polybutene plant uses contractors to supplement its work force during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.
