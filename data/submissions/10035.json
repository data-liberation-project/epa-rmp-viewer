      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary for Project 7 Water Authority\nMay 6, 1999\n\nAfter much review and by working through this risk management process, Project 7 has identified one major risk and one minor risk to manage at our facility.  The major process is the one ton cylinders of liquid chlorine used to disinfect our water.  We have identified all foreseeable  risks associated with delivery, storage, and feeding of  liquid chlorine.  For delivery, we rely on the expertise and procedures of our supplier, Thatcher Chemical Company of Salt Lake City, UT.  Storage has been dealt with by minimizing the number of ton containers kept on site at any one time.  This has also been accomplished by coordination of deliveries/pickups by Thatcher.   Feeding hazards have been scrutinized and made safer by changing from a positively pressurized manifold to cylinder mounted feed equipment, and construction modifications to our storage and feed areas, ie... personnel are not required to enter into the room housing the chlorine cylinder to make feed adjustment. All feed rate adjustments are made from a separate room housing the control equipment. \n\nThe secondary issue or minor risk for our consideration is the Liquid Propane Gas stored on site for use as a heating fuel for portions of  this facility. As stated above the same concerns apply to the Propane. Again we rely on the expertise and procedures of our supplier , Ferrell Gas Company from Delta, Colorado. All propane is stored above ground in two one thousand gallon tanks, and propane use is limited to the two buildings nearest the tanks. We have identified Propane as a secondary or minor risk due to the release scenarios we developed. \n\nThe Project 7 Water Authority has devoted numerous man hours in researching the various risks involved with both Chlorine and Propane. Additionally we have worked closely with our local Fire District and local law enforcement agencies in refining our  Risk Management Plan\n\nThe Project 7 Water Authority is a regio"

      "SummaryText": "nal domestic (potable) water treatment facility serving the majority of the inhabitants of the Uncompahgre Valley. The facility is staffed twenty four hours per day by Class A Water Works Operators, certified by exams administered by the Colorado Department of  Health and Environment.\n\nProject 7 is committed not only to the safety of our employees, but to that of our community. This commitment is demonstrated by the ongoing training our employees are provided, as well as an identifiable safety program, including the training we have provided our local Fire District.\n\nAs previously mentioned the major area of concern is that of an instantaneous release of chlorine gas as a result of a cylinder rupture. Our procedure is to immediately notify both the Fire Dist. and Sheriffs Office. Project 7 personnel are to assist in the repair, notification , traffic control etc. Project 7 has on site the necessary emergency equipment, such as approved breathing apparatus, and Haz Mat suits. This scenario is highly unlikely because of our twenty four hour staffing,  alarming equipment, and the fact that the chlorine cylinders are stored inside a separate building that would act as a containing device allowing for a slower release to atmosphere of the chlorine gas.\n\nThe propane cylinders are stored outside, but due to the chemical nature of propane the zone of influence is reduced considerably from that of chlorine\n\nProject 7 has had no accidental release of gaseous chlorine or propane in the last five years, nor has it experienced any accidental release of chlorine or propane since it began operation in 1980.\n\nThe Water Authority will continue to work with and through the local emergency responders, as well as continue its training of current and future staff."
