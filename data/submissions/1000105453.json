(WSU) has highly hazardous chemicals on-site that require the protection of our employees and environment.  The major objective of our Risk Management Program is to prevent unwanted releases of hazardous chemicals especially into locations that could expose employees and others to serious hazards.  By targeting highly hazardous chemicals, applicable standards can aid management in their efforts to prevent or mitigate episodic chemical releases that could lead to a catastrophe in the workplace and possibly in the surrounding community.\n\nSafe work practices and procedures, along with safety rules, have been established in order to create the safest workplace possible.  The practices, procedures, and rules are reviewed on an annual and as needed basis and improved as necessary.  The practices, procedures, and rules are also communicated to workers and expected to be followed at all times.\n\nSenior management demonstrates their commitment to continuous improvement in environmental, health, safety & security through annual review of policies, procedures, communication, and resources.\n\nFacility and regulated substances handled\n\nOur facility is approximately 7000 sq. ft. warehouse space.  The warehouse is engaged in chemical distribution activities including:  storage, handling, packaging, mixing/blending, shipping, and receiving.  These activities include several hazardous chemicals (sodium hypochlorite, hydrochloric acid), non-hazardous materials (phosphate salts, ammonium sulfate), and some EHS (chlorine).  While most chemical products do involve mixing and/or repackaging, no EHS are ever mixed or repackaged at our facility.  EHS quantities can vary from day-to-day, however, the average daily quantity is above the threshold quantity established by EPA.  For example, typical daily quantities of chlorine ex"
