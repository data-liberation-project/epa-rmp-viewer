For a more detailed description the anhydrous ammonia system see the anhydrous ammonia system equipment list and drawings. \r\n\r\nAmmonia and Its Properties (Appendix A - Ammonia MSDS)\r\n\r\nAmmonia is a colorless liquid with a strong, intense, suffocating odor.  It is a common molecule, given off by living organisms.  It is used to make fertilizers, animal food, synthetic fibers, glues and explosives.  It is also used in the treatment and refining of metal, and the manufacture of nitric acid, hydrazine hydrate and acrylonitrile.  It is often used in refrigeration. \r\n\r\n?Total ammonia? refers to the sum of ammonia (NH3) plus the ionized form (NH4+).  The toxicity of liquid ammonia solutions is primarily due to the presence of NH3, the percentage of which increases with pH and temperature.  Therefore, the toxicity of ?total ammonia? is greater in more alkaline water at higher temperatures.  It is also more toxic under conditions of decreased oxygen concentrations.  \r\n\r\nAmmonia is a severe irritant of the eyes, respiratory tract and skin.  Exposures to and inhalation of large concentrations of aqueous ammonia can cause severe corneal irritation, dypsnea, bronchiospasm, chest pain and pulmonary edema, which may be fatal.  Exposure of the eyes to liquid ammonia may cause serious injury to the cornea and deeper structures and sometimes loss of sight.  Skin contact can cause extreme first- and second-degree burns and, if extensive, may be fatal. Extremely high concentrations of vapor can also result in skin burns.  With skin and mucous membrane contact, burns are of three types:  cryogenic (from liquid), thermal (from exothermic dissociation of ammonium hydroxide) and chemical (alkaline).\r\n\r\nPersonnel should avoid direct contact with ammonia.

The best protection is to enclose the operation and/or provide local exhaust ventilation at the site of the chemical release.  Using respiratory protection is less effective than engineering controls, but is still advisable whenever working with or around ammonia.  A NIOSH-approved, full-face piece respirator with ammonia vapor cartridge or canister is sufficient at low exposures.  A self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) with full-face piece and pressure demand is the recommended respiratory protection.\r\n\r\nAdministrative controls should also be in place to minimize the potential for human exposures.  These may include written procedures or policies, which specify the methods and techniques that will be practiced whenever personnel work with ammonia.\r\n\r\nAcute ecological effects may include the death of animals, birds, or fish and death or low growth rate in plants.  Acute effects are seen two to four days after animals or plants are exposed.  Under natural conditions of pH and temperature, ammonia has a moderate acute toxicity to aquatic life.  No data is available on the short-term effects of ammonia on plants, birds or land animals. Chronic (long-term) toxic effects may include shortened life span, reproductive problems, lower fertility and changes in appearance or behavior in exposed animals.  These effects can be seen long after the first exposure. Ammonia is not expected to accumulate in the tissues of fish.\r\n\r\nAmmonia is highly soluble in water.  Concentrations of 1,000 milligrams and more will mix with a liter of water.  Total ammonia is non-persistent in water, with a half-life of less than two days.

The quantity of anyhdrous ammonia used at the Facility is greater than the threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds, which is EPA?s criteria for requiring the development and submittal of information found in this RMP.\r\n\r\nAnhydrous ammonia is considered hazardous by EPA standards.  The same properties that make this chemical valuable for ethanol production also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling of this chemical to prevent unnecessary human exposure and to reduce the impact or threat to nearby members of the community.  Safety depends upon the manner in which the Facility handles the chemical, combined with safety devices inherent in the design of this Facility, and the training of our personnel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRisk Management Program Overview \t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies"

The Facility has been designed and constructed to be a state-of-the-art facility employing numerous release identification and prevention measures.  If a minor incident were to occur, in-house staff are trained and equipped to perform isolation measures and secure leaking systems.  If the incident escalates, Calgren Renewable Fuels would immediately initiate the 911 system and the Tulare County Fire Department would respond to the emergency at the Facility. The Tulare County Fire Department also has mutual aid agreements with other fire departments and local HAZMAT Teams for additional emergency support should the need arise.\r\n\r\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nThe primary purpose of the toxics (ammonia) at this Facility is the production of ethanol. Physical access by non-employees to the toxics (ammonia) is somewhat restricted by the general site fencing, security cameras, and chemical contractor protocols/procedures and by the employees being on-site 24 hours, 7 days a week and 365 days per year.  Within the Facility, the bulk anhydrous ammonia is near the south west corner of the facility.\r\n\r\nAnhydrous ammonia is a regulated toxic substance in accordance with the RMP regulation.  The total  average daily use of aqueous ammonia at the Facility is approximately 2880 pounds/day with a storage capacity of 79,000 pounds in one tank. Anhydrous ammonia is received by truck and delivered into the 18,000 gallon tank. The aqueous ammonia stored/used at the Facility is near the south west corner of the facility (see figure 2). \r\n\r\nWorst-Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenarios\r\n\r\nIn accordance with 40 CFR Part 60 Section 112r (the RMP regulations), an off-site consequence analysis must be conducted and evaluated for each chemical (toxic and/or flammable) ab"
