Many of the employees on the emergency response team are also highly involved with the community volunteer fire and HazMat teams. Several emergency response drills are held each year. In addition, the Rentech Energy Midwest Corporation emergency response team has responded to nearby incidents at the request of the community.\n\n4. Strong community relations are an important part of the facility's safety program. The facility has taken the lead in forming a community Advisory Panel that assists in communications and awareness of the community on the safety and environmental safeguards of the facility.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS:\n1. The Rentech Energy Midwest Corporation encourages all employees to participate in all facets of process safety and accident prevention. Examples of employee participation include updating and compiling technical documents, networked computers that provide all employees instant access to up to date safety information, participation in Process Hazard Analyses, and continual employee training.\n\n2. The Rentech Energy Midwest Corporation has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled. Within this system, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\n3. Rentech Energy Midwest Corporation has well established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems.\n\n4. Training of plant personnel includes: (a) an overview of the process, (b) safety and health hazards, (c) emergency response plans, and (d) applicable safe work practices.\n\n5.
