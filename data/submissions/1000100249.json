All recommendations from Process Hazard Analyses and compliance audits were designed to improve the safety performance of the ammonia refrigeration process.

The emergency action plan includes pre-emergency planning and coordinating with outside parties. This enables those who deal with emergencies to have a course of action to effectively deal with unplanned events. This plan has been provided to and reviewed with the Toluca Fire Protection District. The approach in the development of this plan has been to identify the ammonia emergencies most likely to occur at Ajinomoto Foods and to establish precautions and procedures to protect life, safety, and health during an emergency. The refrigeration process has backup prevention systems to keep processing malfunctions from becoming ammonia release emergencies. If an emergency does occur, Ajinomoto Foods has trained personnel to immediately notify Toluca Fire Protection District and take defensive actions to mitigate the release. Automatic alarms, shutdown systems, and controls have been designed to minimize the potential for an uncontrolled release.  All Ajinomoto Foods personnel are trained to fulfill their designated responsibilities in an emergency. Mock emergency drills are held periodically to maintain familiarity with"

While the design of the facility incorporates multiple safety devices, safe handling procedures, maintaining mechanical integrity, and appropriate training of our personnel are key aspects to safety at our facility. Ajinomoto Foods has implemented a process safety management and risk management (PSM/RMP) program that complies with the OSHA regulations covered in 29 CFR 1910.119 and EPA Rule 40 CFR Part 68.  A crucial component of this program is the emergency action plan, developed in compliance with the emergency action plan provisions of OSHA regulations covered in 29 CFR 1910.38.  The emergency action plan includes pre-emergency planning and coordination with outside parties to enable coordinated action to effectively deal with unplanned events.\r\n\r\n2.\tFacility Description and Substances Handled\r\n\r\nAjinomoto Foods is a frozen food manufacturing facility that processes, stores, and distributes frozen ready-to-eat foods. Production requires the use of a refrigeration system to preserve the integrity of processed foods, and Ajinomoto Foods uses ammonia as the refrigerant. Access to the facility is limited to authorized employees, management personnel, and contractors.\r\n\r\n3.\tWorst Case and Alternative Case Release Scenarios\r\n\r\nHazard Assessment/Off Site Consequence (OCA) data is available for review onsite at the Ajinomoto Foods facility.\r\n\r\n4.\tGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Ammonia Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nAjinomoto Foods' written PSM/RMP plan incorporates many policies and procedures to ensure safe operation and maintenance of the refrigeration equipment. Plan elements essential to safe operation of the refrigeration system include employee participation, process safety information, process hazard analysis (PHA), operating procedures, training, contractor safety, pre-startup safety revie"
