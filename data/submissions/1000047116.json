Release scenarios were performed using guidance and modeling contained in Risk Management Program Guidance for Offsite Consequence Analysis, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Solid Waste and Emergency Response, EPA 550-B-99-2009, March 2009 and U.S. EPA's Risk Management Program Guidance for Propane Storage Facilities\r\n\r\nWorst - Case Release Offsite Consequence Analysis \r\n\r\nIn developing the worst - case release scenario, Stellar Blending and Packaging Solutions in accordance with RMP requirements, assumed the entire contents of the largest and only containment vessel (44,000 pounds) is released with the consequent formation of a vapor cloud and subsequent detonation (explosion).

The final and more probable alternative release scenario involves the dispensing (charging) of small aerosol containers with flammable gases which is performed in a specially-designed gas house equipped with multiple interconnected analyzers to detect the presence of flammable hydrocarbons.  If flammable gases are detected (below LFL) gas flow is automatically stopped and the room air exchange is increased.  The gas house is outfitted with a fire suppression system and deflagration panel that would vent the deflagration away from employees, the plant and storage tank in the event of an explosion. \r\n\r\nThe outlined list of alternative scenarios is not likely to occur as the facility has a robust preventive maintenance program to ensure system integrity and provides routine training to employees.  Additionally, there are currently no public or environmental receptors within the alternative release scenario endpoints.  \r\n\r\nAccident Prevention Program\r\n\r\nStellar Blending and Packaging Solutions, LLC is committed to employee and environmental safety through a host of written operational and training measures.
