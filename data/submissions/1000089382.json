The Facility is an onshore, light products, bulk petroleum storage terminal used in the storage and distribution of petroleum products to retail and commercial end-users in the vicinity of Newark, NJ.  The Facility handles and stores various grades of unleaded gasoline, low-sulfur diesel, No. 2 fuel oil, pentane, ethanol, and various other petroleum based additives. \r\n\r\nThe Facility has a fixed inventory of pentane. Pentane is received by truck and stored in one 60,000-gallon pressurized storage vessel.  Specifically, pentane is off-loaded by truck for storage under pressure.  The pentane is pumped to a blending skid for direct injection into regular and premium unloaded gasoline lines feeding the site gasoline truck-loading rack.  Process safety controls include excess flow valves, low-melting point (<250\u00b0F) feeds to pneumatic valves (fail safe), emergency shutoff devices on the system and video display terminal, line thermal (pressure) reliefs, and grounding/interlock devices.  Access to the Newark Terminal is restricted to authorized employees, management personnel, authorized contractors/visitors and tenants. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe Newark Terminal is designed, operated and maintained in a manner that protects the health and safety of our employees, contractors, and the community in which we operate.  We promote health, safety, and the environment through programs of awareness, compliance, prevention, and protection.  These programs include a combination of accidental release prevention and emergency response planning.\r\n\r\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention programs in place at Newark Terminal.

These programs constitute the framework by which process safety and accident prevention are managed in the facility.  The Newark Terminal complies with the National Fire Protection Association's (NFPA's) Flammable and Combustible Liquids Code (NFPA 30 [2012]) requirements for flammable liquid storage.   In addition to the presence of appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of pentane, if a release does occur, a Facility Response Plan (FRP) is in place for the Facility and response activities are coordinated with the Newark City Fire Department and Newark Office of Emergency Management\r\n\r\nNo accidents/incidents have occurred on the covered process in the last five-years. \r\n\r\nThe goal of the Newark terminal is to demonstrate continuous improvement in our health, environmental and safety performance.  In addition, we will work cooperatively with our neighbors to ensure the health, environment, safety, and security of Newark Terminal and surrounding community. \r\n\r\nTwo requirements of this section specifically apply to operations at the Facility:\r\n\r\n1. Purpose and General Duty Clause - The essence of the general duty clause is that an owner/operator that stores and uses hazardous chemicals in any quantity has a fundamental obligation to ensure a safe operation and to have plans in place in the event of an accident to appropriately manage the situation.\r\n\r\nSPM&T is committed to ensuring the safe operation of the Facility, as well as all of its other operations, to ensure a safe workplace for employees and a safe location for neighbors in the community. SPM&T has procedures in place to prevent accidents and is committed to emergency preparedness both for the Facility and community-wide and coordinates with the Newark Office of Emergency Management and Newark Fire"

      "SummaryText": "Department.\r\n\r\n2. Risk Management Plan - The primary function of the Facility is to act as a flammable liquid storage and distribution facility. Due to\r\nthe flammable effects associated with pentane, it is necessary to observe certain safety precautions to prevent unnecessary human\r\nexposure, to reduce the threat to employee health, and to minimize the threat and impact to nearby members of the community.\r\n\r\nThe Facility is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety and health. Safety at the Facility depends on the\r\nmanner in which flammable substances are handled as well as the various safety devices incorporated into the design of the\r\nprocesses. Furthermore, comprehensive training is provided to employees and contractors which reinforces the safety policies and\r\nprocedures of the Facility. Programs have been established to help prevent any accidental releases and to train personnel for\r\nemergency response in the event of a release.\r\n\r\nFor planning purposes, SPM&T has considered the impact of worst case and alternative release scenarios. The probability of the\r\nworst case catastrophic event evaluated in this report is extremely remote. The worst-case scenario is far less probable than natural\r\ncatastrophes such as tornadoes and floods that could produce much more severe and extensive damage and injury. SPM&T also\r\nconsidered the impact of a more likely loss of containment event. \r\n\r\nSPM&T has implemented safety precautions and procedures designed to prevent and mitigate catastrophic releases. SPM&T has active operating, maintenance, training and inspection procedures. SPM&T provides annual emergency response training to its employees.  \r\n\r\nSPM&T's management is committed to the following:\r\n- Preventing accidents;\r\n- Training our employees in correct response procedures in the event of an accident;\r\n- Participating in community emergency preparedness;\r\n- Addressing any citizen concerns by fully explaining potential hazards associated with Suno"
