A relative risk ranking based on the probability and severity of the hazards was used to assign a hazard category to each identified deviation.  A What If? Analysis, human factors evaluation and facility siting evaluation were also performed as part of the PHA to evaluate other circumstances or outside influences beyond the control of the system operators and maintenance personnel.  The PHA/HAZOP study team evaluated these influences and their possible consequences were discussed.  For each consequence, a mitigating action was presented and/or developed to address such occurrences.\n\nAll of the improvements and mitigation measures identified in the PHA that Blundell committed to accomplish have been completed or are in progress.  Any other measures identified by employees during workplace hazard surveys, or because of audit activities, will be thoroughly reviewed and considered for implementation.\n\nAt the time of this report, Blundell has complied with the RMP requirements and is committed to reviewing and updating the program periodically, as appropriate, and maintaining compliance with regulatory requirements.  The RMP program has been developed to comply with all applicable regulations and is accessible to all interested employees/contractors at all times.  PacifiCorp Energy has been proactive in developing and implementing the RMP program for Blundell, not only to comply with state and federal requirements, but also as a commitment to workplace safety as a top priority."

      "SummaryText": "The Blundell Geothermal Power Plant (hereafter referred to as Blundell) is owned and operated by PacifiCorp Energy, a PacifiCorp company.  Blundell is located near the city of Milford, Utah within the Roosevelt Hot Springs Geothermal Area and generates electricity in an environmentally friendly manner.  The North American Industrial Classification System code for the facility is 221119, Other Electrical Power Generation.  PacifiCorp Energy operates Blundell in accordance with all applicable federal, state and local environmental and health and safety regulations and is committed to maintaining compliance with these regulations.  Blundell has implemented emergency response procedures at the facility in coordination with local emergency response agencies.\n\nBlundell consists of two independent geothermal power plants and associated geothermal wells.  The existing power plant referred to as Unit 1 is a single-flash steam generated power plant.  As a single-flash power plant, Unit 1 uses steam as the motive fluid for power generation and therefore, is not subject to the U.S. Environmental Protections Agency\u00bfs Risk Management Programs (RMP) for Chemical Accident Prevention.  The recently constructed Integrated Two Level Unit Ormat Energy Converter (ITLU OEC) referred to as Unit 2 is a binary process that utilizes isopentane as the motive fluid for power generation.\n\nThe RMP regulations require proactive identification, evaluation and mitigation or prevention of chemical releases that could occur as a result of failures in processes, procedures, or equipment.  The RMP regulations define the responsibilities of employers and contractors involved in work that affects or takes place near processes covered by the regulations to ensure the safety of both plant and contractor employees and the potential effects on public and environmental receptors.  The RMP program describes the procedures, training, engineering controls and emergency response programs implemented by Blundell t"

      "SummaryText": "o prevent or minimize the release of hazardous chemicals from its covered process. \n\nThe primary chemical used at Blundell Unit 2 is isopentane.  In the binary process of electrical generation, isopentane is used as the motive fluid in the generation of electricity from natural geothermal fluid.  Geothermal fluid is used to heat isopentane liquid to vapor in the ITLU OEC, which in turn is used as the motive fluid to spin a turbine connected to a generator to produce electricity.  The isopentane vapor is then condensed and reused in a continuous, closed-loop process within each ITLU OEC.  This process does not involve any chemical reactions or changes to the isopentane. \n\nIt is the policy of Blundell that the receipt, storage and handling of isopentane at its facility be done in a manner that meets regulatory requirements and minimizes the probability and severity of accidental releases of isopentane into the atmosphere, in order to protect the health and safety of its workers, the public and the environment.  In order to accomplish this goal, Blundell has performed the following tasks:\n\n\u00bf\tGathered safety information on the process, equipment and procedures involving isopentane; \n\u00bf\tPerformed a structured process hazard analysis (PHA) and evaluated external events that might affect the process; \n\u00bf\tPerformed an off-site consequences analysis of defined release scenarios; \n\u00bf\tEstablished a written program for prevention and mitigation of accidental releases; and \n\u00bf\tEstablished a written emergency response program coordinated with emergency response agencies.\n\nAn integral part of the RMP/PSM program is the completion of a PHA of the facility\u00bfs storage and use of isopentane in the ITLU OEC.  The PHA was conducted using a hazards and operability (HAZOP) study.  A team composed of Blundell personnel with detailed knowledge of the process were directed through the HAZOP study by consulting members.
