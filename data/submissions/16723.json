This successful operating record is due to the City's commitment to ongoing training programs, operating procedures, and computer-generated maintenance activities.\n\nStationary Source and the Substance Handled\n\nThe City of Lincoln operates an 8-MGD (by design) municipal wastewater treatment facility at 7000 North 70th Street.  Discharge from the treatment facility enters Salt Creek.  The facility uses chlorine to reduce the pathogenic (disease causing) bacteria and viruses in the wastewater discharge to levels below those which can be achieved through ordinary secondary treatment.  The use of chlorine reduces the threat to the quality of recreational waters. \n\nThe facility uses sulfur dioxide to remove residual chlorine remaining after the disinfection process and prior to  discharging to the receiving waters.  This is done because it has been shown that residual chlorine is harmful to some species of fish and carcinogenic to other wildlife.\n\nChlorine and sulfur dioxide utilized in the disinfection and dechlorination processes arrive at the facility in one ton containers that are stored inside a ventilated building equipped with leak detection devices.  The maximum quantities of chorine and sulfur dioxide stored at the facility are 16,000 pounds and 8,000 pounds, respectively.  \n\nThe facility uses propane for building heat and as a supplemental source of digester heat.  Propane is stored in one 18,000-gallon tank.  The maximum quantity of propane stored at the facility is 67,000 pounds. \n\nOff-Site Consequence Analysis\n\nOne worst-case release scenario and one alternative release scenario was assessed for the chlorine, sulfur dioxide, and propane processes.  To ensure a common basis for comparisons, EPA defined the worst-case scenario as the release o"

The worst-case scenario allows consideration of passive mitigation measures.  The worst-case release scenarios for the chlorine, sulfur dioxide, and propane processes were determined in accordance with the requirements provided in 40 CFR 68.22 and 40 CFR 68.25(b,c).\n\nThe alternative release rate is a release that is considered more reasonable or \"more likely.\"  The alternative release scenarios for the chlorine, sulfur dioxide, and propane processes were determined in accordance with the guidelines in 40 CFR 68.22 and 68.28.  Active mitigation measures, as well as passive mitigation measures, can be used in determining the alternative release scenario.\n\nAccording to EPA, the toxic endpoint for chlorine and sulfur dioxide have been defined to be 0.0087 mg/L (3 ppm) and 0.0078 mg/L (3 ppm), respectively.  An airborne concentration that is used as the toxic endpoint is the maximum airborne concentrations below which it is believed that nearly all individuals can be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects.\n\nAccording to EPA, the explosion endpoint for propane has been defined as the distance at which there is an overpressure of 1 psi.  This explosion endpoint is the farthest distance of release at which the explosion causes the pressure on a person or building to exceed atmospheric pressure by 1 psi.\n\nThe distance to the toxic or explosion endpoint becomes a radius for a circle around the covered process.  Residential population within the circle is required to be determined based on available census information.  The population number is reported as part of the EPA submittal.  This method greatly overestimates the population potentially exposed to a chlorine or sulfur dioxide release, because the chlorine or sulfur dioxide plume would seek lowest elevations in the d"

In the event the cylinder would release its entire contents to the atmosphere in 10 minutes, the release rate would be 200 pounds per minute.
