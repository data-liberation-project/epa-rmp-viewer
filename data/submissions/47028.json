      "SummaryText": "The Motiva Enterprises, LLC - Bainbridge Terminal complies with the National Fire Protection Association #58 (2004 Edition) for Liquified Petroleum Gas Storage, and it is this Facility's policy to notify the Bainbridge Fire Department (Stations 1 & 2) and Decatur County LEPC via the \"911\" service in the event of an emergency and follow all additional response procedures set forth in the Facilities's Integrated Contingency Plan, as appropriate.  Medical emergencies will require notification of the Bainbridge Memorial Hospital and asociated ambulance service via 911.  The Facility currently maintains a trained incipient stage fire and hazardous material emergency response team (first responder - operations) to respond to small or initial stages of an emergency.      The Motiva Enterprises, LLC - Bainbridge Terminal transfers/stores refined product (regular/premium gasoline and diesel fuel) and handles product additives, including the liquified butane blending system (direct injection into refined product pipelines).  The Risk Management Program covers the butane blending system including the associated piping, 2 x 84,000 gallon vessels, the blending skid, sampling unit (Grabner), and the truck offloading station product connection points.    The Facility's worst case scenario is the failure of the blending system's manifolded 84,000 gallon liquified (pressure) butane vessels when filled to the greatest amount allowed (fill shutoff device at 85% with an alarm at 90%) resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  The resulting distance to the end point (1 PSI overpressure) extends off-site 0.5 miles and includes both public/recreational and environmental receptors including residential properties, the Jones-Wheat School, Bainbridge Memorial Hospital, Route 84, The CSX Mainline, various adjoining commercial and industrial structures and Twin Lakes.  The Facility's alternate scenario (most likely) is a truck \"pull-away\" resulting in a one-minute pipe/hose release and explosion."

      "SummaryText": "The resulting distance to endpoint (1 PSI overpressure) extends off-site including a portion of the contiguous property (Colonial Pipeline) to the east and CSX Mainline to the north.    The Motiva Enterprises LLC - Bainbridge Terminal complies with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Accident Prevention Rules (40 CFR Part 68 Part 1910.119).  The butane blending system is designed, constructed, and maintained to meet or exceed the NFPA #58 requirements for Liquified Petroleum Gas Storage.  To this date, this Facility has never had an accident involving the butane blending system (new process) resulting in dealths, injuries, property/environmental damage, evacuations or sheltering in-place.  In the event of an emergency involving the Bainbridge Terminal butane blending system, it is the policy of the Facility to initially contact the Bainbridge Fire Department and request their assistance.  The Facility maintains a trained (annually) incipient fire and hazardous substance emergency response team, as referenced above.  The Facility's emergency response plans are coordinated with the Bainbridge Fire Department and the Decatur County LEPC.  The Bainbridge Fire Department, which maintains a full hazardous material response team, is aware of the Facility's butane blending system, access via East Shotwell Street or Pipeline Road, and available fire suppression equipment including approximately eighteen 20lb. ABC fire extinguishers, and water sources (three hydrants available adjacent to the Terminal with a total flow of approximately 2,300 gpm).  Motiva Enterprises, LLC Bainbridge Terminal maintains a vegetation control program to minimize plant growth within 10 feet of the system."
