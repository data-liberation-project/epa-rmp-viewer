This facility's function is to purify surface water for the purpose of providing drinking water to the surrounding area. The East Water Purification Plant's function is to purify surface water for the purpose of providing drinking water to the surrounding area. There are two regulated substances present at the facility, chlorine and ammonia. The regulated substances are both used in the disinfection process.   However, a Risk Management Plan for ammonia is no longer required due to the decrease in the percent concentration being below 20%.  The maximum inventory of chlorine at the facility is 568,000 pounds.\n\n\n\nThe East Water Purification Plant is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the facility's comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at the facility. New equipment, processes and equipment are evaluated in our quest to improve safety and reduce or eliminate the use of chlorine at the plant.  No changes in process management are currently anticipated.\n\n\n\nIt is the East Water Purification Plant's policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. This facility has a chlorine scrubber system for the storage building, along with chlorine leak detectors in the storage, feed and at all points of chemical application. The leak detectors activate a visual and audible alarm that alerts the facility staff to any release. If such a release does occur unforeseeably, the East Water Purification Plant's emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  \n\n\n\nDrinking Water Operations has an"

Additionally, the facility is also coordinated with the City of Houston's Hazardous Materials Response Unit and the City of Pasadena Park Fire Department, which provide additional emergency response expertise. \n\n\n\nDuring the last five years, there have been no accidental releases involving chlorine that resulted in any offsite impacts.  There have been no deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations or sheltering in place.  \n\n\n\nEmployees, supervisors and managers are responsible for complying with the RMP regulations. It is policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. In the event of a release, Drinking Water Operations has an assigned Chemical Spill Response Coordinator in addition to the City of Houston's Safety Department. East Water Purification Plant has taken steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA.   The following sections briefly described the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at the facility.\n\n\n\nComprehensive chemical data has been assembled.  Operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes along with Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) are onsite.  Health hazards, chemical exposure limitations and physical properties of chlorine are included in the complied data.  This information is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\n\n\nComprehensive process hazard analysis reviews are conducted to ensure the hazards associated with the facility's processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these reviews is inspection of the plant to identify deficiencies throughout the system.  The reviews are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering, process operations and safety.  Hazard analysis reviews "

These procedures address various modes of operation such as container connection and change-outs, startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, and normal shutdown.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\n\n\nA comprehensive training program is in place to ensure that employees operating or maintaining the chlorination process are trained.  Training ensures employees have the required knowledge, skills, and abilities to safely carry out the duties and responsibilities, including emergency response, as provided in the written operating procedures.  Refresher training is provided at least every three years to employees working with or operating the chlorination system and equipment.  This helps to ensure that the employees understand and adhere to the current operating procedures.\n\n\n\nWritten maintenance procedures have been assembled.  Maintenance checks on process equipment are conducted and documented to ensure proper operations of the chlorination system.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes: pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls, pumps, overhead cranes  and other chlorination related equipment.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Personnel are offered specialized training as needed.

These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment operating, and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operations.\n\n\n\nCompliance audits are conducted on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rules and regulations are being implemented.  These audits are carried out at least every three years and any corrective actions required as a result are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\n\n\nIncident investigations are conducted for any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a release of the regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident (root case analysis) as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  Incident investigations start promptly and no later than 48 hours after the event.
