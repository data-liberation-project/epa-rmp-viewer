      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY REPSONSE POLICIES\n\nHarcros Chemicals Inc. and former owners of this facility have a long standing commitment to worker and public safety and to the protection of the environment.  We are committed to operating and maintaining our processes in a safe and responsible manner, as demonstrated by the resources we invest to prevent accidents.  As members of the National Association of Chemical Distributors we adhere to the principals of Responsible Distribution.  In addition, to ensure our employees have the best training in the operation of our processes, we demand that safety be the first priority in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Harcros Chemicals Dalton plant is primarily involved in manufacturing sodium glucoheptonate and blending chemical formulations used by the carpet industry.  As part of the manufacturing process, we use two substances that are covered by the Risk Management Program (RMP) rule (40 CFR 68).  However, we also use a combination of good design practices, an accidental release prevention program, and an emergency response program to ensure the safety of our employees, the public, and the environment.  We are committed to operating our facility in a safe and responsible manner.  \nThe Harcros Chemicals \u00c2\u00bf Dalton plant is located on a 27 acre site.  The covered chemicals in use are anhydrous ammonia and aqueous ammonia.  Both processes are subject to Program Level 3.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nWe take a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  Our management system addresses each of the key features of a successful prevention program, as described below.\n\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION\n\nThe Harcros Chemicals Dalton plant maintains a variety of technical documents that describe the chemicals and processes at our facility"

      "SummaryText": ".  The documents are kept up to date and are available to all employees.  They address important process parameters such as operating limits for equipment, design basis and configuration of equipment, and physical properties and hazards of the chemicals used.\n\nChemical information is contained in Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS\u00c2\u00bfs).  Important process parameters are also documented and maintained.  Engineering design documents may include (1) operating limits, (2) block flow or simplified process flow diagrams, (3) process chemistry, (4) maximum intended inventories, (5) design basis and configuration, (6) piping and instrumentation diagrams, and (7) other information that is important for understanding the design intent, operating limits, and hazards of each process.\n\nPROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS\n\nThe Harcros Chemicals Dalton plant has a program for ensuring hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled.  A hazard and operability study (HAZOP) analysis is typically used for our process hazard analyses.  We update and revalidate each hazard analysis every five years or whenever a significant change is made.  The results and findings from these revalidation studies are documented, and recommendations are tracked until resolved.\n\nOPERATING PROCEDURES\n\nOur employees develop and maintain operating procedures that ensure the safe operation of the facility.  These procedures cover (1) startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) startup of a new or improved process.  Operating procedures are annually certified as accurate to ensure they are updated following process changes.\n\nThis plant uses a batchsheet system.  Batchsheets are the detailed operating instructions for making a batch of product.  They include process deviation codes describing the actions to take under various conditions (e.g. high temperature or pressure, loss of cooling).\n\nTRAINING\n\nThe Harcros Chemicals Dalton plant tra"

Employees new to a process are provided basic training including (1) overview of process, (2) properties of substances used and their associated hazards, and (3) a detailed review of the operating procedures.  Once they have demonstrated their understanding of the process, they are paired with an experienced operator to learn specific job functions and tasks.  After they demonstrate their competence in performing these tasks, they are allowed to work independently.\n\nRefresher training intervals are decided, in part, by our employees but is performed at least every three years.  All training is documented.\n\nMECHANICAL INTEGRITY\n\nThe Harcros Chemicals Dalton plant maintains the mechanical integrity of our equipment to prevent equipment failures that could endanger employees, the public, or the environment.  Our inspection and testing program helps identify damage or deterioration before equipment fails.  When a problem is found, maintenance personnel correct the problem and try to identify the root causes to help prevent future problems.  Our quality assurance system ensures that new or replacement equipment meets the strict design standards for our facility.  The mechanical integrity system includes (1) inspection and testing procedures, (2) replacement equipment specifications, (3) procedures for safe work practices, (4) maintenance personnel training, and (5) required documentation.\n\nMANAGEMENT OF CHANGE\n\nWe review all changes to our processes to determine if new hazards are introduced or existing prevention measured are threatened.  Except for replacements-in-kind, all changes are subject to a hazard analysis to ensure that (1) new hazards are not inadvertently introduced, (2) safety consequences resulting from the change are addressed, (3) operators are notified of the change, and (4) training material, process safety information, and operating procedures are updated.\n\nPRE-STARTUP SAFETY REVIEW\n\nIf a"

This review ensures that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are prepared for service before startup.  This review will generally include field verification of new construction and also serves as a quality assurance function by verifying that accident prevention measures are implemented correctly.\n\nINCIDENT INVESTIGATION\n\nEmployees at the Harcros Chemicals Dalton plant promptly investigate each incident that resulted in, or could have resulted in, serious injuries to employees, the public, or the environment.  These investigations identify the facts and root causes of the incident, and provide recommendations to help prevent a reoccurrence.  Recommended corrective actions are tracked until they are resolved.\n\nEMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION\n\nHarcros Chemicals encourages employees to be involved in all aspects of process safety management and accident prevention.  Employees participate in process hazard analyses, incident investigations, and management of change hazard analyses.  Employees have access to all information developed as part of this prevention program and are informed of any changes in process areas.\n\nSAFE WORK PRACTICES\n\nThe Harcros Chemicals Dalton plant has safe work practices that ensure the safety or our employees.  These include (1) hot work permit procedures designed to control spark of flame producing activities, (2) confined space entry permits and procedures, and (3) lockout/tagout procedures for isolating energy sources during maintenance.\n\nCONTRACTORS\n\nThe Harcros Chemicals Dalton plant occasionally uses contractors for maintenance and construction.

This includes periodic meetings with community responders so they are aware of the hazards of our processes.  Coordination and communication channels ensure the public is quickly notified, if necessary, and actions are promptly taken to minimize the consequences of a release.  We periodically conduct emergency drills so all participants are familiar with their duties during an emergency.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe Harcros Chemicals Dalton plant continuously strives to improve the safety of our processes.  Suggestions for improving safety are regularly addressed through process hazard analyses, management of change procedures, incident investigations, and employees suggestions.\nHarcros Chemicals Inc. acquired this facility and its employees from Lynx Chemical Group in July, 2007.  Improvements made since the acquisition include upgrading the toxic gas alarm warning system, installation of a new process control system, and installation of new anhydrous ammonia storage tank.  The only specific additional safety feature planned at this time is to continue with the changeover to a more sophisticated control system to further improve the safety and efficiency of the process.  Also, we anticipate making additional security improvements as we develop our Security Plan in accordance with Department of Homeland Security requirements."
