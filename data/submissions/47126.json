      "SummaryText": "BACKGROUND\nSUEZ Energy Marketing NA, Inc. (SUEZ) owns and Choctaw Gas Generation LLC operates a gas-fired power plant, a 780 megawatt (MW) combined cycle facility, near Ackerman, Mississippi, to supply electricity to the power grid.  The facility is referred to as the Choctaw Gas Generation Facility (CGGF).  Construction commenced on the CGGF facility on August 15, 2002.   Commencement of operation is considered to be March 26, 2004 with Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality\u00bfs (MDEQ\u00bfs) receipt of the certification of construction for the diesel fire pump.  A Title V permit application was submitted to the MDEQ in March 2005.\n\nPROGRAM APPLICABILITY\nThe EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) is part of the Clean Air Act and applies to processes storing a specified chemical above a threshold quantity.  The chemicals and threshold quantities are specified in Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 68.  One such chemical and threshold is ammonia (stored in a 20 weight percent or stronger concentration) in excess of 20,000 pounds.  To minimize the formation of oxides of nitrogen (Nox), Choctaw Gas includes a Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) pollution control system.  The SCR system uses 29.4 weight percent aqueous ammonia, stored in two 25,829 gallon tanks, which equates to approximately 56,880 lbs of ammonia per tank.  \n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT\nThe RMP requires the facility to evaluate the potential impact zone for accidents involving the aqueous ammonia for a worst-case release.  This worst-case release is highly improbable since it involves the combination of a certain set of weather conditions (dawn after a clear, still night) for a large release of the chemical without any employee intervention.  The weather conditions result in the vapor plume from the release staying highly concentrated and narrow.  \n\nThe result of the Hazard Assessment is a \u00bfzone of influence\u00bf which, for toxics, is a distance at which the air concentration of the chemical is at t"

Both of these results are greater than the 0.13 mile distance to the nearest public receptor (the nearest environmental receptor is greater than 0.4 miles from the facility).  The impact distance also extends beyond the facility property. \n\nACCIDENT HISTORY AND RESPONSE COORDINATION\nSince the ammonia storage is a new process, there is no accident history for the site; however, the site has coordinated its emergency response procedures with local responders.\n \nPROGRAM CLASSIFICATION\nCurrently, Choctaw Gas does not meet one of  the three criteria for a Program 1 process as the worst-case scenario impacts a public receptor.  \n1.  The potential worst-case scenario endpoint does not impact offsite receptors;\n2.  There have been no ammonia accidents with offsite impact; and\n3.  Emergency response has been coordinated with local providers.\n\nThe facillity does not meet either Program 3 requirements.  \n1.  The process is in NAICS code 32211, 32411, 32511, 325181, 325188, 325192, 325199, 325211, 325311, or 32532.\n2.  The process is subject to the OSHA process safety management standard, 29 CFR 1910.119        \n                                                                                                                                                                            Therefore, the Choctaw Gas operation is classified as a Program 2 facility.\n\nACCIDENT PREVENTION ACTIVITIES\nTo prevent future potential ammonia accidents with offsite impacts, Choctaw Gas has undertaken prevention activities.  \n1.  The facility utilizes an extensive, interconnected alarm system to monitor the tanks;\n2.  Access to the site is restricted via guard gates to authorized personnel;  \n3.  All facility personnel are trained on safe work practices and the proper procedures to be followed should a leak or spill occur;\n4.  Spills are contained in the dike, minimizing the impact distance;\n5.  The tanks and"

This information is required to be reported in the RMP; however, the facility makes every attempt to prevent, rather than react to situations which may possibly occur."

Nearly all individuals (including sensitive persons such as people with asthma) could be exposed to the EPA limit for up to one hour without irreversible or other serious health effects.  EPA states the following about the EPA toxics limit (endpoint) and the worst-case analysis:\n \n\u00bfBecause the assumptions required for the worst-case analysis are very conservative, the results likely will be very conservative.  The endpoints specified for the regulated toxic substances are intended to be protective of the general public.  These [toxic] endpoints are concentrations below which it is believed nearly all individuals could be exposed for one-half to one hour without any serious health effects.  In addition, the worst-case analysis is carried out using very conservative assumptions about weather and release conditions.  The distance to the endpoint estimated under worst-case conditions should not be considered a zone in which the public would likely be in danger; instead, it is intended to provide an estimate of the maximum possible area that might be affected in the unlikely event of catastrophic conditions.  \u00bfEPA intends the estimated distances to provide a basis for a discussion among the regulated community, emergency responders, and the public, rather than a basis for any specific actions.\u00bf  \n\nA release from one of the full, independent, identical storage tanks has been identified as the worst-case release and was considered in the Hazard Assessment.  Each storage tank is surrounded by a partitioned dike, which would fully contain a spill from a single tank, thereby reducing the evaporation rate (and thus, the impact area) of the spill.\n \nThe impact distance from the worst-case scenario has been estimated using the equations and tables in EPA\u00bfs Risk Management Program Guidance for Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA Guidance), and with EPA\u00bfs SCREEN3 model.
