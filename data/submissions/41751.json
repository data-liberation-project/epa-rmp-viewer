This commitment is strongly supported by senior management of Prism Gas and is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as employee training and in considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our facility.  This plant implements both administrative and engineering controls to reasonably minimize the risk of an uncontrolled release of a hazardous substance.  The facility does not anticipate having any type of uncontrolled release.  However,  if an uncontrolled release does occur, the personnel at the facility, in cooperation with local emergency response agencies,  are trained to respond, minimize and/or eliminate any exposure that could occur to protect employees and the surrounding area.  \n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\nThe Waskom Plant is a facility which receives raw natural gas from well production.  The raw gas is dehydrated and contaminants removed.  Marketable natural gas is delivered via pipelines.  Natural gas liquids are extracted and stored on site.  The extracted natural gas liquids include ethane, propane, butane, and a pentane-natural gasoline mixture that are delivered to market via transport vehicles.  There are no listed toxic substances which exceed their respective threshold quantities stored at this facility.\n\nHazard Assessment - Worst Case Scenario\nThe Worst Case Scenario for this facility is for flammables and would be a failure of a natural gasoline storage tank releasing the entire contents instantaneously to the atmosphere; having an offsite impact.  EPA's RMP Comp  Ver. 1.07 was used to calculate this release scenario.  This type of scenario is very unlikely to occur.  In addition, qualified individual"

EPA's RMP Comp Ver. 1.07 was used to calculate this release scenario.  Qualified individuals operate this facility daily and  the equipemnt is inspected and maintained according to a preventive maintenance schedule,  further reducing the likelihood of this release occurring.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\nThis facility is regulated by 29CFR 1910.119 (Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals), 1910 .38 ( Employee Emergency Plans), 1910.120 ( Hazardous Waste and Emergency Response), 40 CFR 112 (Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasure), RCRA and State and Federal EPCRA rules/laws, as well as other federal, state, and local regulations, which are all developed to reduce the potential for the release of Highly Hazardous Chemicals.\n\nThis facility has implemented the Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals along with additional requirements of the Risk Management Program as the Accident release Prevention Program.  There are other practices and measures, which are contained in numerous plans and procedures that all assist to prevent the release of Highly Hazardous Chemicals.
