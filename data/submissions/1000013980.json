The service area is located at an elevation of approximately 8,000 feet on the eastern sides of the Sierra Nevada mountain range.  The town is surrounded by the United States Forest Service lands and is heavily utilized as a recreational area.\n\n The District has instituted a Risk Management Program to ensure that its facilities utilizing regulated hazardous chemical substances are operated according to the rules established by the United States Environmental Protection Agency.  \n\nThrough its risk management program, the District has performed a hazard assessment to assess the potential effects of an accidental release of a hazardous substance.

This includes procedures for notifying public and local agencies responsible for responding to accidental releases, information on emergency health care, and employee response training measures.\n\nDescription of Facilities and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe Districts\u00c2\u00bf wastewater treatment facility utilizes chlorine for disinfection purposes.  This facility is located at the eastern edge of the town and treats all wastewater generated by the community.  The facility is considered a secondary treatment facility and includes processes of primary clarification, biological treatment, secondary clarification, filtration and disinfection.  Chlorine gas in injected into the treated wastewater to kill any potential disease causing organisms.  Up to eight cylinders containing 2,000 pounds of chlorine gas each are stored at this facility.  \n]\n\n\n Worst Case Scenario\nA worst-case release scenario at the wastewater treatment facility would involve major damage to a valve incurred while loading or offloading chlorine gas cylinders.  This could result in release of chlorine gas from the container at a rate of 200 lbs. per minute with the release lasting ten minutes.  At this release rate, toxic gas could extend over a distance of 1.3 miles.  The affected area would involve a maximum of 14,387 people and would include residential areas, industrial areas, commercial areas, hospital and elementary, middle, high school and college facilities. \n\n\nAlternative Release Scenario\n\nThe alternative released scenario a wastewater treatment facility is similar to that considered for the water treatment facility.  A leak would occur at the valve while the cylinder was being connected into the system.  At a release rate of one pound per minute, toxic gas would extend over a distance of 0.1 miles."

      "SummaryText": "A toxic atmosphere could impact the District operations and administrative offices and could involve 39 people.  Again, it is unlikely that the entire content of a cylinder would be released because personnel would be on hand to immediately respond and stop any leakage.\n\nAdditional Scenario concerns to the Community\n\nIn addressing the earthquake disaster potential, the one-ton containers are cradled on engineered blocks attached to the floor and strapped in place, which prevents movement.  The connecting lines from the cylinders to the system are made of flexible material.  This has proved a very effective method during high earthquake activity.  The most recent series included an earthquake with a magnitude of 5.6 on the Richter scale with no incident at the plant.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe District is currently in compliance with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration rule for Process Safety Management and with the Risk Management Plant Rule.\n\nSpecific prevention steps that the District has taken include a computerized alarm system that immediately notifies emergency personnel of potential chemical release situations.  Minimal amounts of chlorine gas in the atmosphere will trigger on-site alarms and provide notification.  District personnel also receive specific training in the use of chlorine cylinders and apparatus.  Only the necessary amount of chlorine required for use in the treatment processes is stored at the wastewater facilities to minimize the potential hazards.\n\nFive \u00c2\u00bfYear  Accident  History\nThe wastewater treatment plant has experienced no accidental release of chlorine gas during the last five years and in fact has not experienced any accidental releases since it began using chlorine in 1972.\n\n\nEmergency Response Program"
