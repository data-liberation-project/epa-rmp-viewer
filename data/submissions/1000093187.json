The warehouse is a Refrigerated warehouse for storage of food product prior to distribution.  We have a strong commitment to operate our facility in a safe and responsible manner. \n\n\n\nThe ammonia is contained in a closed loop system; it is designed to remain inside the piping and vessels in our facility. Ammonia as contained in equipment in the facility is compressed, condensed and evaporated to remove heat from within the facility to maintain safe storage areas and remove heat from the products being handled.  We believe that ammonia provides the safest and most efficient cooling choice for our operation. \n\n\n\nAmmonia is classified by EPA as a toxic chemical and it is necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling it to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the health threat to our own workers, and reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is our policy to adhere to all Federal and State rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle ammonia, safety devices inherent in the design of this facility, safe handling procedures that we use and the training of our personnel.\n\n\n\n                  A. Accident Release Prevention and Emergency Policies \n\n\n\nAn accidental release prevention program has been in place since 2001 when the warehouse was constructed and placed in service. The facility was designed and constructed in accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines, and is in compliance with State codes.  This food processing facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable State codes and regulations.\n\n\n\nWe take many precautions to prevent or minimize accidental releases of ammonia from the refrigeration system. These precautions include safety controls (alar"

Description of the Accidental Release Prevention Program \n\n\n\nThe facility has an accident release prevention program that complies with Occupational Safety and Health Act's Process Safety Management Standard and EPA's Risk Management Program Rule. The prevention program consists of the following elements: \n\n\n\n- Employee Participation Program: \n\n  The Plant has an overall safety program that includes employee awareness and training to minimize the potential for an accident or incident involving the ammonia refrigeration\n\n  equipment.   \n\n- Process Safety Information: \n\n  Ammonia refrigeration equipment manuals and plant design technical specifications including piping diagrams are on file.  \n\n- Process Hazard Analysis: \n\n  A process hazard analysis (PHA) re-validation was conducted in March 2021 and another PHA re-validation is schedule for March 2026.   A team with expertise in engineering, operations, maintenance, and safety evaluated the existing refrigeration system in depth and developed recommendations to improve the safety and operability of the system.

The SOPs include procedures for normal operations, startup, shutdown, emergency operations, and emergency shutdown.  \n\n- Training Program: \n\n  An operator training program is designed to ensure that the systems are operated by qualified personnel.  \n\n- Contractor Safety Program: \n\n  Contractors that are used to work on or adjacent to the refrigeration system are \"pre-qualified\" based upon their knowledge of ammonia refrigeration, understanding of applicable codes and standards, and their demonstrated ability to work safely.  Each of these contractors is evaluated from a safety perspective.  \n\n- Pre-Startup Safety Review Procedures: \n\n  See comments under Management of Change  \n\n- Mechanical Integrity Program: \n\n  The Plant has a program for replacement of all Safety Relief Valves on a 5 year interval as recommended by IIAR.
