Per the LEPC, one Risk Management Plan was prepared for the facilities.  In 2006, Apio Cooling developed their own independent refrigeration system.  This submittal represents Apio Cooling as an independent, stand-alone ammonia refrigeration process.\n\n\n\nA. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n\n\nApio Cooling located in Guadalupe, California, utilizes refrigeration for ice making and cold storage. Senior management at the facility is not only committed to offering superior service, but also to maintaining a safety and environmental program to promote a safe environment for all employees and the surrounding communities.  Senior management administers the safety and environmental policies and programs.  These programs include but are not limited to forklift safety, hazard communications, lockout/tagout, Hazardous Materials Emergency Business Plan, employee safety manuals, manufacturers documentation, Emergency Response, as well as the Risk Management Plan. A majority of the ammonia equipment is located inside the engine room.  The system is a closed loop refrigeration system similar to a residential refrigerator.  There are no emissions or planned releases of ammonia.\n\n\n\nApio Cooling has independently coordinated emergency response efforts with the Santa Barbara County Fire Department.  In the case of an ammonia-related emergency, it is the policy of Apio Cooling to evacuate the employees and to allow the fire department/HazMat team to respond to the emergency.\n\n\n\nB. STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\n\nThe Apio Cooling facility is located at 4595 W. Main Street in Guadalupe, California, which is approximately 0.2 miles east of Highway 1 and 0.1 miles north of Highway 166.  The area immediately surrounding the facility is rural with a mixture of agricultural and sparse residential areas.\n\n\n\nThe primary business of Apio Co"

In order to conduct operations, the facility maintains a refrigeration system containing approximately 24,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, a regulated substance.  The refrigeration system, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, and then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for cooling and storage of vegetables.  Typical operating conditions range from approximately 15 psig on the low pressure side of the system to 150 psig on the high side.\n\n\n\nC.  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nIn order to operate the ammonia refrigeration system, the facility complies with the following risk management regulations:\n\n\n\n?    EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP);\n\n?    OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM); and\n\n?    California Accidental Release Prevention Program (CalARP).  \n\n\n\nAdministrative Measures:\n\n\n\nThe facility operates in accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines and standards including the following:\n\n\n\n?    IIAR Bulletin 107, \"Suggested Safety and Operating Procedures When Making Ammonia  Refrigeration Tie ins\"\n\n?    IIAR Bulletin 109, \"Minimum Safety Criteria for a Safe Ammonia Refrigeration System\"\n\n?    IIAR Bulletin 110, \"Startup, Inspection, and Maintenance of Ammonia Refrigeration Systems\"\n\n?    IIAR, \"A Guide to Good Practices for the Operation of an Ammonia Refrigeration System\"\n\n\n\nThe Apio Cooling ammonia refrigeration system has many safety features.  Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system.  For example, the Apio Cooling facility operates in accordance with the Process Safety Management (PSM), Risk Management Program (RMP), and California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program.

      "SummaryText": "important to note that the refrigeration system has been designed with several safety features to prevent the accidental release of ammonia.  For example, the compressors are equipped with safety mechanisms that will cause the units to shut down if operating conditions exceed designated safety limits.  Also, level indicators, alarms, and switches are installed in key points within the system to monitor the supply of liquid ammonia and to ensure that a vessel is not overfilled.\n\n\n\nOther safety features of the ammonia refrigeration system include: two emergency shutdown switches (located outside the engine room exit door and in the office) that stop electrical power to all engine room equipment with the exception of the exhaust fans, relief valves on all pressure vessels, and ventilation fans in the engine room which start automatically when the ammonia level or temperature in the engine room exceed designated setpoints.\n\n\n\nD.  FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThere have been no significant releases of ammonia at the facility in the last five years (January 2007 - January 2012) that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 100 pounds or the state requirement mandating immediate reporting of any release or threatened release of a hazardous material.  In addition, there have been no injuries resulting from an ammonia release, nor any releases or \"near misses\" that warranted an internal incident investigation. \n\n\n\nE.  EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe facility has an Emergency Action Plan (plan) in effect at the facility.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:  \n\n\n\n?    save lives;\n\n?    minimize and avoid injuries;\n\n?    protect the environment; and\n\n?    minimize property damage.\n\n\n\nApio Cooling maintains a safety committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented"

This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM/RMP/CalARP regulations.  \n\n\n\nApio Cooling personnel circulate throughout the plant, taking note of unusual conditions in any portion of the systems.  In the event that an ammonia leak is discovered, the person nearest to the leak will alert any personnel in the immediate area who are unaware of the danger, and the Operations Manager. The Operations Manager will determine what procedures and personnel are necessary to remedy the problem. Action is promptly taken to mitigate the leak so normal operations can resume.\n\n\n\nF.  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nA Process Hazard Analysis Revalidation (PHA) was performed on December 8, 2011, at the Apio Cooling facility. This study generated mitigation measures (recommendations) to improve safety at the Apio Cooling facility located in Guadalupe, California.  The mitigation measures include additional training, key maintenance-related tests/inspection, and enhanced emergency response policies and procedures.  The Apio Cooling safety committee is planning to complete several items, including the recommendations, over the next year, as a continual effort to provide a safe work environment for their employees.  These changes include the following items:\n\n\n\n1.     Continue to train all employees in the facility Safety Plan/Programs.\n\n\n\n2.     Continue to have employee involvement in Safety Plan Development.\n\n\n\n3.     Continue employee involvement through safety team participation.\n\n\n\n4.     Continue internal and external safety audits/inspections and implement changes as needed."
