The faciity is located at 300 Market Street in Rochester, NY.  The RMP has been prepared in accordance with the Federal Clean Air Act (CAA) Section 112r and associated regulations and ammendments CFR Part 68.  The facility supplies refrigerated fresh foods to all of Wegmans food stores.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system has been upgraded to refregirate the newly constructed MDC located immediately adjacent to to the FFDF. Note that this RMP has been submitted just prior to the increase of anhydrous ammonia above the regulated threshold of 10,000 pounds and the new system going on-line.  The refrigeration system now contains a total of 10,200 pounds of ammonia.\n\nThe following are the required seven (7) elements of the Executive Summary:\n\nAccidental release prevention and emergency response policies-\n     The Fresh Foods Distribution Center complies with all Federal, state, and local requirements for ammonia refrigeration facilities. The facility was designed and constructed in accordance with applicable industry standards and codes. The facility is monitored by ammonia sensors which are wired directly to Wegmans Corporate Security Control Station and the Gates, NY Fire Department.  In the event of an ammonia release, Gates Fire Dpt. will respond and contact the Monroe County Hazmat team if necessary. The facility has a written set of emergency procedures.\n\nStationary source and regulated substances handled-\n    The facility is a fresh foods refrigerated warehouse and attached partially refrifgerated meat product distribution center and central shipping point for all refrigerated foods to the Wegmans food stores. The FFDF and adjacent MDC uses 10,200 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.\n\nWorst Case Release Scenario and Alternate Release Scenario, including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distance "

      "SummaryText": "of each reported scenario-\n     For purposes of this RMP,  the worst case release scenario has been determined to be a failure of the high pressure receiver which is the largest vessel containing ammonia in the system. A release from this receiver and attached piping would include 5,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia. The release would be a liquid spilled onto the floor in the equipment room. the equipment room doors and windows are kept closed which would help mitigate the release. The liquid will vaporize and form a cloud.  The cloud would be exhausted from the building, over a period of time, by the ventilation system in the equipment room.  The alternate release scenario would consist of a release from the high pressure release valve which would last for 60 minutes at 57.7 pounds per minute (total of 3,462 pounds). the release would be to a common relief header that is located on the roof.  For both the worst case and alternate release scenarios, ammonia detectors are in place that will detect the release and notify Wegmans security personnel at the security office which is staffed 24 hours per day, seven days per week. Wegmans security will in turn follow written procedures for notification of emergency response personnel.\n\nGeneral accidental release prevention program and chemical specific prevention steps-\n     The facility complies with EPA's Risk Management program requirements and all applicable codes and standards in effect at the time the facility was constructed and upgraded.\n\nFive year accident history-\n     There have not been any releases from the facility in the last five years (or ever).\n\nEmergency Response Program-\n     In the event of an ammonia release emergency, the facility will contact the Gates Fire Department and request that they respond to the facility. The facily's alarm system is directly linked to the Gates Fire Dpt. Several members of the Wegman's team have appropriate training on the use of personal protective equipment and may assist t"

The Gates Fire Dpt. has trained at the facility and will in the future attend annual drills at the facility.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety-\n     Several recommedations were made during the recent process hazard analysis.  These recommendations were implemented as of June 2000."
