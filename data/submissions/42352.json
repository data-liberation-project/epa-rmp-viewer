As such, all Union Carbide facilities now operate under and adhere to policies and standards of The Dow Chemical Company.  The Union Carbide facilities at South Charleston, Institute, Technology Park, North Charleston Distribution Terminal, Massey Yard, and New Yard share leveraged support and management and are collectively called West Virginia Operations.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nWest Virginia Operations is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. If such a release should occur, our highly trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  We are also completely coordinated with the Kanawha/Putnam Emergency Planning Committee which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe North Charleston Distribution Terminal is a storage and redistribution facility for chemicals manufactured at other locations.  The North Charleston Distribution Terminal is managed by the Union Carbide South Charleston Plant, but is treated as a separate stationary source because the Kanawha River separates it from the South Charleston Plant, therefore, it is considered non-contiguous with the South Charleston Plant.  The North Charleston Distribution Terminal  stores and distributes vinyl acetate monomer to the South Charleston"

In December 2004, the gum base business climate changed and the demand for poly vinyl acetate increased.  A business decision was made to restart the South Charleston Gum Base Plant.  Plans call for re-starting the gum Base Plant in late March or April 2005.  The quantities of vinyl acetate monmer stored and distributed at the North Charleston Distribution Terminal will not increase from those reported in the 1999 RMP Plan.\n\nUnion Carbide handles and stores threshold quantities of the following RMP-regulated toxic substances at the North Charleston Distribution Terminal:\n\nVinyl Acetate Monomer\n\nThere are no Union Carbide owned EPA RMP regulated flammable chemicals stored at the site in threshold quantities.\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe North Charleston Distribution Terminal has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies, there have been no accidental releases as defined by the RMP rule of regulated substances, during this period.\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nUnion Carbide\u00bfs general accident prevention program consists of compliance with the EPA RMP rule, OSHA\u00bfs PSM standard, and implementation of Dow's Operating Discipline Management System.  Key elements include:\n\nProcess Safety Information\nWe maintain a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes. Examples include Material Safety Data Sheets for all the hazardous chemicals, Equipment Design Specification sheets, Reactive Chemicals Test results, and many others. This information is maintained up-to-date and is available to operating personnel.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis"

Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and are trained to deal with the modification.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at Union Carbide. These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nSelf assessments and audits are conducted on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  Audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\nUnion Carbide promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a significant release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation\nUnion Carbide Corporation believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility\u00bfs implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazar"

Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is performed.  West Virginia Operations has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related the contractor\u00bfs work and the processes.  Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe emergency response program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  Detailed emergency response plans are developed and coordinated with the Kanawha/Putnam Emergency Planning Committee and the community.\n\nThe North Charleston Distribution Terminal carries a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.  The plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, quarterly emergency drills are conducted to enhance skills and tactics for responding to an accidental chemical release.  Critiques are held on drills and actual events.  Emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced. In addition to the on-site emergency squad, Union Carbide staffs a Distribution Emergency Response Team (DERT) in the Kanawha Valley that responds to accidental releases from transportation equipment throughout the continental United States\n\nKanawha/Putnam EPC is the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) with which our em"
