      "SummaryText": "West Central Cooperative - Dawson, IA.\n\nRisk Management Plan - Executive Summary\n\nThe accidental release prevention policy at West Central Cooperative involves, but is not limited to technologies, procedures, and management practices.  All applicable procedures of the ANSI K-61.1 - 1989 revision of the Safe Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, as adopted by the Iowa Department of Agriculture & Land Stewardship are adhered to.  Our emergency response policy involves the preparation of response plans that are tailored to our facility and to the emergency response services available in our community, and is in compliance with the EPA Emergency Response Program requirements.\n\nWest Central Cooperative purchased this facility from Cargil on July 1, 2000.  This Risk Management Plan, is for a new installation of an Anhydrous Ammonia storage facility at this location.  \n\nThis facility is in the business of selling anhydrous ammonia to farm customers as a form of nitrogen fertilizer.  The facility has one anhydrous ammonia storage tank with 30,000 gallons water capacity.  The storage tank, several anhydrous ammonia nurse tanks, risers for filling nurse tanks, electrical panels, lighting, and safety equipment are all parts of this facility's anhydrous ammonia operation.  The facility is manned during the season and is operational through normal business hours.\n\nThe off-site consequences analysis includes two anhydrous ammonia release scenarios, identified as worst-case release and alternative release scenario.  The first scenario is defined by EPA and shall assume the maximum quantity of the largest storage vessel is released as a gas in 10 minutes due to a catastrophic break.  The alternative release scenario is defined as a more likely accidental release of anhydrous ammonia caused by a transfer hose failure.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario involves a catastrophic failure of the largest tank, releasing the entire 135,150 pounds of anhydrou"

The worst case scenario used EPA's recommended wind speed of 1.5 meters per second with a F atmospheric stability class.  A rural topography was selected as typical.  The distance to the endpoint was 2.60 miles. It is estimated that 434 people would be affected by this release.\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario assumed a hose breaks and leaks 7,127 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  The EPA recommended wind speed of 3.0 meters per second with a D atmospheric stability class was used in this scenario.  Using urban topography and Degadis the toxic endpoint is 0.46 mile.  The population with in that area is estimated to be 69 people.  The assumption is that the duration of the release is 2 minutes because equipment, excess flow valves, and human intervention will stop the leak.  \n\nWest Central Cooperative has several key elements in its accident prevention plan:\n1. The anhydrous ammonia system adheres to the laws and regulations of the State of Iowa.\n2. Annual training is required of all personnel on handling, transferring, or transporting anhydrous ammonia.  The training includes properties of ammonia, safe handling practices, first aid, and emergency response.\n3. Use of good management practices as specified by industry standards and training aids.\n4. Frequent site inspections by management and risk management consultants.\n5. Annual inspections by the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship include safety equipment, tanks, and handling equipment.\n6. Use of proper anhydrous ammonia personal protective equipment and safety equipment.\n\nChanges are made in the system when necessary or when required by regulation change.  Periodic evaluations of the procedures help to determine whether or not a change in operations should be made to provide increased safety to the operators and to the community."
