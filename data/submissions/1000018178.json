Risk prevention and emergency response procedures are in place at this facility, as documented here. GreenGate Fresh LLLP hires outside contractors to maintain the ammonia refrigeration equipment in order to prevent accidents. The Emergency Response Plan lists the responsible personnel and the policies for responding to an accident involving the regulated substance.\n\nThere are both portable and fixed refrigeration systems onsite and all have safeties to detect unsafe operating conditions. Fixed and portable equipment support the cold storage rooms, processing facility, and vacuum pre-cooling equipment. The portable equipment is located outdoors, and has no detection system. Fixed equipment is located within the facility and includes the fan coil units and piping. Operators monitor the system when it is operational. \n\nGreen Gate Fresh LLLP utilizes inspection procedures to review refrigeration equipment prior to startup and during operations.  These procedures identify potential sources of release and equipment corrections required to prevent these releases.  Onsite personnel and certified refrigeration contractors review the equipment as required.\n\nOnsite personnel provide initial emergency response.  Onsite personnel will make a preliminary assessment in the event of a release and will provide first response.  First response may include emergency equipment shutdown, system isolation, or controlled operation such as pump down to prevent or reduce an offsite release.  No emergency operations will be performed that are beyond the capabilities of the operators or other onsite personnel.  Local fire and police departments with mutual aide response will provide emergency response for a major release event.  The refrigeration contractors would also be on-call to provide emergency response.\n\nEmergency response training will be conducte"

Records will be kept of all training performed at the site for a minimum of five (5) years.\n\nDescription of Stationary Source and Substance Handled\nGreenGate Fresh LLLP, located at 3255 South Avenue 3 1/2 E, Yuma, Arizona, utilizes anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant in their operations.  The ammonia refrigeration systems are used for vacuum cooling, produce cooling, and cold storage prior to shipment.  There are two interconnected systems at the facility.  The system as a whole has both portable and fixed equipment. The new facility was constructed as per applicable codes and industry standards.  \n\nThe total charge for all the refrigeration systems is approximately 14,000 lb. \nThe refrigeration systems at this facility are single-stage vapor compression cycles. The refrigeration systems consist of the following equipment:\nA?    Compressors,\nA?    Low pressure receivers,\nA?    A high pressure receiver,\nA?    Evaporative cooling condensers,\nA?    Air cooling evaporators,\nA?    An ammonia diffuser tank,\nA?    Ammonia pumps,\nA?    Water pumps,\nA?    Water chillers,\nA?    Shell and tube heat exchangers,\nA?    A low pressure recirculator,\nA?    Oil separators,\nA?    Oil coolers,\nA?    An electric control box,\nA?    A refrigeration control panel, and\nA?    An emergency electric shut-off switch.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration equipment inspection checklists describe equipment details. \n \nThe substance handled at GreenGate Fresh LLLP, anhydrous ammonia (NH3), is a gas in its natural state and is extremely irritating to mucous membranes and lung tissue.  The gas is pungent and may cause suffocation, as shortness of breath and labored breathing can develop if inhaled.  Prolonged inhalation of high concentrations may cause bronchitis and/or pneumonia, with some residual reduction in pulmonary functions.  Repeated or prolonged contact of high concentrations of ammonia to the skin can cause frostbite, redness, pain, and serious skin burn.  A Material Safety Data sh"

Written in both Spanish and English, the MSDS details the chemical properties and health hazards of anhydrous ammonia.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\nGreenGate Fresh LLLP maintains an accidental release prevention program designed to eliminate or minimize ammonia releases.  The program includes equipment monitoring, regular inspections and maintenance, and log keeping of operating conditions, scheduled maintenance, emergency response, and operator training.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system has specific safety measures in place to prevent accidental release.  Operators and mechanics are trained for safe operation and maintenance of the refrigeration system.  They are also trained in emergency response procedures in the event of an ammonia release.  An alarm and detection system monitors the facility for unsafe ammonia concentration levels and for operating conditions outside of safety set points.  Monitoring is done 24 hours per day.  Relief valves are installed to protect both the high and low sides from an overpressure situation.  Relief valves are piped to a diffusion tank, which provides a system-wide mitigation measure.  Compressors have control panels, which will automatically shut down the compressors if pressure and temperature set points are exceeded.  An emergency control box allows system pressures to be relieved without releasing to the ambient.  Additional information about the ammonia detection system and the sensor locations can be obtained from the drawings in the RMP binder. \n\nA thorough review of the system including a \"What If\" Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) was performed for this facility.  Equipment corrections and updates were made for those items determined to have the highest potential for offsite releases.\n\nSafety and equipment operational training will be conducted, at a minimum, at least once per year.
