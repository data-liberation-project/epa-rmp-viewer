General accidental release and prevention policy of Gorton's.\n\nGorton' is a frozen seafood processing facility that utilizes anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant. \nAnhydrous ammonia is considered hazardous by the Environmental Protection Agency. The same\nproperties that make ammonia a valuable refrigerant also makes it necessary to observe certain\nsafety precautions during it's use to prevent exposure to our workers, the surrounding community\nand the environment.  \nIt is our policy at Gorton's to implement the requirements of the Risk Management Program by\nmanaging and operating this facility in full compliance with all applicable federal and state\nregulations that we are governed by. The objective is to minimize the risk of an accidental release\nof hazardous materials. Safety depends directly on our proper handling of ammonia. Our plant\npersonnel have been trained on the equipment operating procedures and the various safety devices\nthat are incorporated in our facility to prevent the possibility of accidental releases.\n\n2.  Stationary source and regulated substance handled.\n\nGorton's, 127 Rogers Street, Gloucester, Massachusetts operates a refrigeration system utilizing\nanhydrous ammonia as the primary refrigerant. Mechanical refrigeration is a thermodynamic\nprocess where the refrigerant, ammonia, is used as a heat exchanging fluid to maintain a desired\ntemperature in an enclosed environment. The refrigeration cycle consists of evaporation,\ncompression, condensation and expansion. Evaporation and condensation are designed to alter the\nquantity of energy associated with the refrigerant. Compression and expansion are designed to\nchange the availability of the associated energy. The refrigeration cycle is a closed loop process.\nThe ammonia cycle utilizes fluid temperature, pressure and latent heat of vap"

The refrigeration system is actually a spilt system that is operated by Americold.\nAmericold operates the machine room (compressors, condenser, receivers) while Gorton's\noperates and maintains the low side of the system, (pump receivers, coil evaporators, water\nchillers and coolers) to maintain processing, freezer and holding room temperatures required for\nthe processing and storage of our product. There are approximately 400 employees at this facility,\nincluding hourly and salary personnel, that manufacture and prepare shipment of frozen seafood\nproducts via truck approximately 24 hours a day, five days a week.\n  \nThe refrigeration system contains 40,000 pounds of aggregate ammonia. The potential hazards\nthat could lead to an accidental release of the ammonia include, but are not limited to, equipment\nfailure, damage to piping, damage to equipment, human error, etc.\n \n\n\n\nAlthough ammonia is a colorless, tasteless liquid, it's dominant characteristic is it's pungent,\ndistinct odor.  Persons exposed to ammonia will not voluntarily stay in areas of even small\nconcentrations, although these levels would not normally result in any health risks. Risks from\naccidental exposure to ammonia in a vapor state are irritations to the eyes, nose and throat. The\nextent of irritation depends on the exposure amount and length of time exposed.  \nAmmonia is classified non-flammable by the Department of Transportation.  Ammonia will burn,\nbut only in a very narrow concentration level when accompanied with a constant ignition source.\n\n3.
