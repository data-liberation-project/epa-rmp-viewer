In addition, a contractor periodically uses anhydrous ammonia as raw material to produce Ammonium Polyphosphate fertilizer at the facility.  The properties that make anhydrous ammonia a valuable fertilizer source also makes it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling it.  It is the policy of the Cooperative and its employees to adhere to all of the Federal and state rules and regulations, so as to prevent unnecessary human exposure and to reduce the threat to the community.  Safety depends upon the competent training of our personnel, the manner in which we handle anhydrous ammonia and the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility.\n\n\n\nThe stationary source and regulated substance handled:\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is to repackage and distribute anhydrous ammonia to our customers as a nitrogen source, with its primary use as a crop land fertilizer. Anhydrous ammonia is received by truck (transports) and is stored in three (3) storage tanks.  Anhydrous ammonia is distributed from this facility by nurse tanks.  The facility has the necessary equipment to safely load and unload transports, railcars and nurse tanks.  Access to the tank controls and hoses are restricted to authorized employees and management personnel, along with authorized contractors that may work on the facility.  \n\n\n\nThe only regulated substance handled at this facility is anhydrous ammonia.  The maximum amount stored at the site is 201,875 gallons or 1,080,031 pounds which includes a maximum of three (3) railcars.  Predictive filing was used to account for the railcars intermittently located at the facility. \n\n\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program:\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevent"

The facility design and construction is in accordance with the ANSI K 61.1 and the OSHA 1910.111 standards.  It is formally inspected a minimum of once a year for compliance to all applicable standards by a third-party.  The facility is also inspected on a quarterly basis by trained employees and prior to each use.  Corrective and routine maintenance is performed at the facility to maintain compliance with the appropriate standards.  Employees of the crop production department at the cooperative receive training to meet Federal and state requirements to handle hazardous materials along with additional training using industry training programs and schools.  The contractor is responsible for maintenance of equipment related to the production of Ammonium Polyphosphate and their RMP and Process Safety Management Plan for this process is available when on-site.\n\n\n\nFive-year accident history:\n\nThis site has not experienced a reportable accidental release of anhydrous ammonia in the five years prior to the date of submitting this report.\n\n\n\nThe emergency response program:\n\nThis facility relies on the local emergency response unit and does not have its own emergency response program.  However, employees are familiar with the North American Emergency Response Guidebook, and the local fire department is familiar with the plant.\n\n\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety:\n\nThis facility utilizes the ANSI and OSHA standards as guidelines for the safe storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.  At this time there are no further plans to modify or change the facility.\n\n"
