The Smith Dairy, Wayne Division\u00bfs senior management is not only committed to offer superior service, but also maintain a safety and environmental program to promote a safe environment for all its employees and the surrounding communities.  The Smith Dairy, Wayne Division administers safety and environmental policies at the facility to ensure compliance with OSHA\u00bfs Process Safety Management (PSM) and EPA\u00bfs Risk Management Program (RMP).  These programs include forklift safety, hazard communications, lockout/tagout, employee safety manuals, manufacturers documentation, and the Emergency Response Plan.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe Smith Dairy, Wayne Division is located at 1590 N.W. 11th Street in Richmond, Indiana.  The facility\u00bfs ammonia refrigeration system was designed and constructed in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations.\n\nThe system uses 19,600 pounds of ammonia to provide refrigeration for frozen desserts and diary products.  The majority of the system including vessels and compressors is located inside and outside of the facility building.  The condensers are mounted on the roof and all of the evaporators are located in their respective freezer/cold storage areas.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe Smith Dairy, Wayne Division ammonia refrigeration system has many safety features.  Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system.    For example, the Smith Dairy, Wayne Division operates in accordance with OSHA\u00bfs Process Safety Management regulation.\n\nOther safety features of the ammonia refrigeration system include: ammonia sensors that sound a facility-wide alarm, an emergency shut down button that kills power"
