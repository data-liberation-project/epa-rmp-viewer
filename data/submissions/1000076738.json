Inc.(C&D) is engaged in the manufacture and sale of a diversified line of consumer and health care products.  The Fostoria DC location consist of warehouse storage and shipping areas for the full line of C&D consumer products.  There are no other manufacturing operations at this location.  \r\n\r\nFacility Description\r\n\r\nThe Fostoria DC operation is affected by the Risk Management Plan (RMP) involve the receipt and storage of aerosol product in consumer size containers.  Product is received in palletized cases via trailer truck at site loading docks.  The product is moved within the warehouse to a designated aerosol storage room location via forklift trucks.  Aerosol product is removed from the warehouse via forklift truck and loaded onto trailers for shipment to customers.  Pallets may be broken down by hand and cases re-palletized to accommodate less than full pallet orders.\r\n\r\nVarious hydrocarbons are used as propellants in the finished good aerosol products stored in the warehouse.  Hydrocarbon propellants are defined by the US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) as hazardous materials.  USEPA enforces regulations designed to minimize the potential for accidental release associated with the handling of hazardous materials.  Additionally, US Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA) enforces accident prevention regulations to protect employees.  The aerosol product propellants are listed as hazardous due to flammability.  The aggregate volume of flammable mixture in the Level II and Level III aerosol can inventory will exceed the RMP threshold.\r\n\r\nAccident History\r\n\r\nThe Fostoria DC has no history of accidental releases associated with the regulated hazardous materials.\r\n\r\nPrevention Programs"

C&D takes a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals through process management systems and programs which include:\r\n\tEmployee Participation\r\n\tProcess Safety Information\r\n\tProcess Hazard Assessment\r\n\tOperating Procedures\r\n\tOperator Training\r\n\tMechanical Integrity\r\n\tManagement of Change\r\n\tPre-Start up Review\r\n\tContractor Safety\r\n\tHot Work Permits\r\n\tAccident Investigation\r\n\tCompliance Audits\r\n\r\nIn addition to C&D's management programs, specially designed systems to control, prevent, detect, and mitigate potential accidental releases are also in place.  These include an aerosol storage room designed to NFPA requirements with a high capacity sprinkler system and a fire pump. No storage racks are used to store aerosol products and product is floor stacked to further mitigate aerosol flammability accidents.  All C&D forklift operators are trained and certified.  The firewater and sprinkler systems are inspected and tested quarterly by an outside independent company. Safety and emergency training of employees is conducted regularly\r\n\r\nEmergency Preparedness and Response\r\n\r\nC&D has an emergency plan detailing procedures to respond to accidental releases and other emergencies.  The plan is tested on a regular basis through exercises and drills.  The plan is shared with the local Fire Department and county Emergency Services, as appropriate for the warehouse location.  In the event of an emergency affecting the local community, C&D will work closely with the local, county, and state agencies to ensure public safety.

For the specific case of a warehouse, the largest vessels are 350 gallon totes, 55-gallon drums, 10-gallon pails, 150-lb cylinders, and other containers that are small relative to typical vessels in a chemical plant. Therefore, the spillage of the contents of one of these containers constitutes the worst-case scenario, although you may well be able to think of scenarios in which a quantity greater than Q as defined above can be released. Other credible scenarios could involve simultaneous damage to more than one vessel. EPA recommends that you consider multiple-vessel release scenarios, if credible and appropriate, as alternative release scenarios.\"\r\nBased on this guidance, the WCS can be defined as the loss of containment on a single aerosol can.  This scenario, however, may not be considered credible, since if a single can were to catastrophically fail, other cans in the case are also likely to fail.  Therefore two scenarios are assessed 1) failure of a single can and 2) a WCS assumption of the loss of an entire case of cans (i.e. twelve (12) x 7 oz cans or six (6) x 200 ml cans).\r\nThe WCS scenarios for the Distribution Center are calculated on the basis of a vapor cloud explosion resulting from the release of flammable propellant.  Scenario 1a and 2a are for Aerosol antiperspirant/deodorant.  Scenario 1b and 2b are for Aerosol dry shampoo.  The following equation used to calculate the distance to endpoint of impact is"
