The maximum quanity stored would be 79,000 pounds in a 18,000 gallon storage tank *Note maximum quanity allowed to be stored is 85% of storage tank size.\n\nIII.  The worst case release scenario and the alternativerelease scenario.\n     A.  The worst case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of the sorage tank over a ten minute time span.  The maximum quanity release would be 79,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the tank at 85% capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the toxic endpoints is 1.06 miles.\n\n     B.  The alternitive release scenario is based on release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the toxic endpoint is 0.59 miles.  To keep mitigation to a minimum we would shut off all emergency valves possible, call fire department, and keep area evacuated.\n\nIV.
