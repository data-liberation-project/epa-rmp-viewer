              "Description": "Process safety information including  the MSDS for anhydrous ammonia, PID of the refrigeration system, materials of construction and operation procedures are kept in the maintenance and operations office.\n\nAn initial PHA was conducted on October 5, 2000.  The following operational and procedural changes were recommended by the PHA team and have been responded to by management:\n\nHazard:                 There is a potential for a release of anhydrous ammonia to occur while the contractor is filling the ammonia, system. \n\nRecommendation:       The plant operations be shut down during the fill process. An operational procedure for filling the ammonia receiver must be developed. This procedure should be developed by RECCO and reviewed with the contractor providing the anhydrous ammonia. \n\nResponse:    We will post MSDS notices in the plant and will notify all personnel located in the area where the delivery will take place. All delivery fittings are exterior to the building and are double valved for safety.\n    \nHazard:                If there is an ammonia leak response will be conducted by the Taunton fire department and RECCO. Most often the Taunton Fire Department will be first to respond. The fire department at this time is unfamiliar with the facility. \n\nRecommendation:       RECCO and the Taunton Fire Department tour the building to become familiar with the layout and ammonia system. There will be four tours conducted in order to train all current members.  A similar training tour will be conducted with all new members of the fire department. \n\nResponse:    A familiarization tour of the facility will be conducted between November 27th and December 1st. We will have a videotape of the facility prepared for them as part of the tour and will review that at the time. \n\nHazard:                Leak in flange, valve, gasket, site glass and/or corrosion and ice build up which may result in a leak. The team raised a concern regarding the personal available to keep up on required maintenance of the system. Systems of similar capacity have a full time maintenance engineer specifically for the refrigeration system.\n \nRecommendation:       Preventative maintenance schedule is to be developed, and \nprovided by RECCO. This should include documented daily logs. The maintenance department will provide maintenance assistance for the next six months. If at anytime during this period they feel that there is a need for additional personal, management Will address the issue. At the end of six months management and maintenance manager will review maintenance requirements and other assigned duties to determine if additional personal /outside maintenance contracts are required.\n\nResponse:    Agar plant personnel are to meet with RECCO to finalize the preventive maintenance schedule no later than December 15, 2000. There is a computerized control system that is reviewed daily to monitor the performance of the system. There is an experienced and qualified full time maintenance person on staff and an assistant who is being trained in all facets of the operation. The company has for 20 years used the services of RECCO, the premier ammonia refrigeration company in the area, and will continue to do so on a regular and as needed basis.\n\nHazard:                The PHA team members did not know if the system was tied into a back up generator which would supply power incase of an outage. \n\nRecommendation:        Stahlman Engineering will confirm that the system is tied into a back up generator If it is found that the system does not have back up generator power, Stahlman Engineering win work with the contractor responsible for the power system to provide emergency generator power to the system.\n\nResponse    A backup generator exists that powers all emergency systems in case of a power outage, including the engine room exhaust system. \n\nHazard:                There is the potential for powered industrial trucks to impact the forced air evaporators and associated piping located at the end of the rack system. \n\nRecommendation:        Provide awareness training for all operators, post warning signs \nand hold operators accountable for all incidents. Management to develop a policy which restricts drivers with prior incidents from conducting work in the area until management feels that the operator is conducting the job in a safe manner.\n\nResponse:        The following written notice is posted in all such areas:\n                        DANGER!!\nOPERATION OF FORKLIFTS IN AN ELEVATED POSITION IS NOT ALLOWED BEYOND THIS POINT!\nAgar trains all forklift operators in accordance with OSHA requirements. All drivers have been educated about safety issues relating to the ammonia system.\n\n\nDocumented training has been conducted for maintenance employees regarding operating and emergency shut down procedures.  The following elements have been included in and implemented as part of the RMP/PHA Program : pre-startup review, mechanical integrity, preventative maintenance, management of change, incident investigation, compliance audits, employee training and participation, hot work permits and contractor safety. \n\nThe refrigeration system is equipped with the following safe guards: ammonia detectors in 26 zones which fail safe open, manual and automatic operation of exhaust fan system , dampers fail safe open, alarm system (including vent lines) connected to the Taunton fire Department which indicates the nature and location of the emergency, security access into the operations room , two king valves for system shut down, water treatment in place for condensers, entire system on a 24-hour remote monitor, spar pumps in line in case of pump failure, automatic shut down in case of pressure/temperature out of normal range, relief valves and rupture discs.",

Every AGAR employee is trained in safe work practices and dedicated to maintaining a safe work environment.\n\nIn the event of an ammonia leak the maintenance engineers, operations manager and supervisors have been trained to shut down the system and ensure exhaust fans are operable to minimize the impact of the incident.  Employees have been trained to follow the emergency evacuation plan.  \n\nThe company has contracted with Refrigeration Engineering & Contracting (RECCO) Company, Inc. of Medford, Massachusetts to provide preventative maintenance and \n24-hour on-call emergency response.  RECCO employees are licensed refrigeration technicians trained under the OSHA standard 1910.120 Hazardous waste operations and emergency response.\n\nThe refrigeration system has been designed by  Stalhman Engineers a Registered Engineer in the State of Massachusetts in compliance with all applicable standards and codes.  The refrigeration system is a two stage liquid recirculation feed system.  The system uses anhydrous ammonia  as the refrigerant. The original charge to the system was 15,000 lbs of anhydrous ammonia.  An additional 10,000 lbs will be added to the system.  \n\nThe liquid recirculation system is designed to operate at an overfeed ratio of approximately 4:1 through the evaporators.

All ammonia detectors are tied into the local emergency response agency (Taunton Fire Department) and indicate the location and type of emergency.  The Taunton Fire Department has toured the facility with RECCO to ensure that all members  are familiar with the system and know how to respond in case of an emergency. \n\nThe ammonia compressor room has been designed with a ventilation system to accomplish two major criteria:\n\n?    Remove space heat given off by the refrigeration system equipment \n?    In case of an ammonia leak within the space remove the ammonia gas from the space at a rate to help reduce levels.\n\nAmmonia detection in the space will initiate emergency ventilation at 35 ppm.

Rupture discs are installed ahead of relief valves.  Rupture members have a nominal rated rupture pressure not to exceed the design pressure of the parts of the system being protected.\n\nThe worst case release scenario analysis was calculated using the EPA RMP COMP software.  The greatest potential for the site of a worst case release is the ammonia receiver.  Due to the potential for release during fill of the system and quantity of ammonia in a liquid form under pressure at this location.  The 25,000 pound quantity in the system  is to be completely release over a ten minute time period.  Section 2.1 of the EPA Model Risk Management Program for Ammonia Refrigeration was used as a basis for this worst-case scenario.  The estimated distance to the toxic endpoint was calculated to be 1.5 miles.  Based on Land View III software , Block Group Proration method the population within this radius is 5,632 persons.\n\nTo reduce the potential for such a release an operational procedure for filling the ammonia receiver has been developed by RECCO.  Training has been provided for the contractor filling the tank.  The warehouse an facility operations will be shut down during the process. RECCO will be on-site to supervise the process. There is a low potential that the tank will ever have to be refilled due to the closed loop system.\n\nThe most realistic alternate release scenario is likely to be caused by a leak in a gasket or flange.
