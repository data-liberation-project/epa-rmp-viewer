We utilize a 6,000 gallon bulk storage\ntank to store this material. Due to the nature of operations, we have designed the storage\ntank and the delivery systems with the utmost care, taking into account the safety, health,\nand environmental impacts this material possess.\nThe storage tank is located within a diked area inside of our building. The diked area has\nthe capacity to contain the entire volume of the tank. The tank weight is monitored\nclosely. We have also installed a redundant safety system, which includes a high levels\nalarm, high, high level alarm, automatic pump shut off device, overflow system and a\nrupture disk and PLC monitoring of tank weights and direct reading indicating scales\nnear the tank itself.\nThorough operating procedures have been developed and followed for the TDI unloading\nprocedure and for processes. Only trained operators are allowed to unload TDI into the\nstorage tank.\nThe processes which require the TDI are enclosed and monitored via a PLC system. We\ndo not handle this material outside of the system. Procedures have been established for\nworking on all of our processes in which hazards exist. In the event that an incident\nwould occur with this material, we have developed a detailed response plan which\ninvolves members of our response team. This program follows the ILS for emergency\nresponse. Team members have been trained per the OSHA HazWoper requirements.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\nChemRex, Inc.\n333 W. 86th Street\nBloomington, MN 55420\n\nSUBSTANCE: Toluene Diisocyanate (mixed isomers)\nPRIMARY ACTIVITIES: Manufacturing of Polyurethane sealants, floor coatings,\nmastics, and adhesives.\nQUANTITY STORED: 6,000 gallons\nWORST CASE SCENARIO\n\nThe worst case scenario would be complete tank failure. Tank failure would result in the release of 61,08"

      "SummaryText": "0 lbs. or 6,000 gallons into the diked area. The duration of the release is 60 minutes based on the low evaporation rate of TDI, building volume, and ventilation rates. However, the diked area will contain entire contents of the tank within the building. Based on EPA provided formulas, dike size, physical characteristics, and building design there will be minimal impact to the environment and community. Our radius is 316 feet. In addition, the material will react with moisture lessening this radius.\n\nRELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAMS\n\nComplaint with OSHA's PSM standard\nComplaint with OSHA's HazWoper standard\nRedundant Controls\nOperating procedures in place and followed\nTrained operators and response teamDiked area inside of building\n\nACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe facility has not experienced a release outside the facility which impacts the\n\nenvironment, community, or required Minnesota Duty Officer in the past 5 years.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe state has a detailed response program in place which includes notification procedures. The plan has been viewed by the city safety, health, and environmental officer.\n\nFUTURE CHANGES\n\nWe have started discussions with the city and supplier about conducting a mock disaster outside using a tanker truck. We anticipate that the local police and fire departments will want to participate."
