      "SummaryText": "The Accidental release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at the Soda Lake 2 (SL2) Geothermal Power Facility\r\nThe SL2 Geothermal Power Facility is located at 5500 Soda Lake Way, Fallon, Nevada in the county of Churchill. The facility is committed to be a responsible member of the nearby communities. Site policy dictates that the SL2 Facility continuously identify methods to identify and reduce the risk to the community and environment through implementation of inherently safe technologies and procedures. This commitment to safe and environmentally sound operations is documented in policy and safety procedures at the facility which are available to all employees who are trained to these policies and safety procedures. In the event of a fire the Fallon Fire Department will immediately be notified of the fire and for response.\r\n\r\nDescription of the Soda Lake 2 Unit Geothermal Facility and the Regulated Substance Used.\r\n\r\nThe facility uses heat from geothermal brine at approximately 327 degrees Fahrenheit to heat, through a non-contact heat exchange process, up to three pentane processes that convert the geothermal heat to electric power for sale to the local utility (NV Energy). The pentane used in the closed loop (recirculated/recycled) power generation process is the only regulated substance at the site. The facility can have on site up to 31,000 gallons of pentane being used in the processes or being stored at any given time. No more than one truck of approximately 4,200 gallons of makeup pentane is required per year. When pentane is delivered to the site it is off loaded at a designated pentane storage area and under qualified and approved safe operating procedures.\r\n\r\nThe three identical power generation processes, Organic Energy Convertors (OEC), each consists of two levels of power extraction, Level 1 (L1) and Level 2 (L2). The Pentane in each of these levels are completely isolated from one another and each circulate in a closed loop. The turbine in eac"

      "SummaryText": "h of these loops is directly coupled to a common generator. Each level has similar components with the exception that that OEC-4 has a recuperator. For each cycle, the power extraction starts in heat exchangers (preheaters and vaporizers) which absorb heat from the geothermal brine in order to boil and convert the pentane into its vapor phase. The vaporized pentane is then directed to turbines specially designed to convert thermal energy in the pentane to rotational mechanical energy. The turbines which are directly coupled to the same generator, in turn, rotate the generator leading to the generation of electrical power.  Pentane from the turbine is directed to air-cooled condensers with exception of OEC-4 which has the pentane go to the recuperator prior to the air-cooled condenser. The condensers then complete the condensing of pentane back to its liquid phase. From the condensers pentane falls to the suction of the feed pumps which pressurize the pentane and directs the pentane to the preheaters on all units and levels except OEC-4 which goes to the recuperator prior to the preheaters. This recuperator is to absorb heat from the pentane moving from the turbine outlet to the condensers and to the preheater in the cycle. \r\n\r\nThe Worst-Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario.\r\n\r\nThe Worst-Case Release Scenario evaluated was that of a ruptured pentane tank leading to a BLEVE condition using 46,000 pounds of pentane. The maximum distance to an over pressure of 1 psi is 0.3 miles (0.6 kilometers). The EPA's RMP Off site Consequence Analysis Guidelines for Worst-Case Scenario were calculated using RMP*Comp. Although there are numerous installed control measures that, in an actual event, would mitigate the release, no credit for mitigation measures was considered for this scenario.\r\n The Alternate Case Release Scenario evaluated based on a feed pump seal failure.
