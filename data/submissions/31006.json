In order to prevent accidental release of the chemical from various sources, numerous safety procedures have been enacted to ensure the maximum safety of the employees working with TDI and the population surrounding the plant.  Employees of the plant have been trained in the proper handling of TDI and in the actions to be taken in case of an accidental release.\n\nThe JCI-Pulaski facility has a maximum intended on-site inventory of 399,789 lbs of TDI.  The largest spill would be a release from one of the 12,000 gallon storage tanks.  The storage tanks are located in a diked area designed to contain the entire contents of the tank.  In addition, the tank farm is located in a completely enclosed building.  Due to the mitigation measures in place and the low volatization of TDI, the toxic endpoint concentration of 7.0 mg/m3 does not reach outside the building.  In addition, safety measures that have been taken include informing the plant population of the hazards of the chemical, and making sure that proper procedures in the maintenance of the TDI equipment, such as pumps, filters, and valves, have been followed and adhered to.\n\nJCI-Pulaski's emergency response policies have been designed to comply with all applicable state and federal regulations.  These policies also summarize the actions that need to be taken in response to a chemical release.\n\n1.2 Description of JCI-Pulaski and the Regulated Substance Handled\nJCI-Pulaski, a ISO/TS 16949 and ISO 14000 certified facility, produces molded polyurethane foam for automotive seating applications.  Foam production is a result of a specific blend of chemicals, including TDI, which are poured into specially designed molds.  Once the foam is inspected for imperfections, it is moved to the cloth covering area by a conveyor system, where it is covered by cloth and attached to the metal frame of the seat and then packed and shipped to JCI custo"

      "SummaryText": "JOHNSON CONTROLS INC. PULASKI, TENNESSEE\n\n1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nJohnson Controls, Inc. (JCI) owns and operates a foam seat manufacturing facility located in Pulaski, Tennessee (JCI-Pulaski).  On site, JCI-Pulaski has two 12,000 gallon storage tanks, one 6,000 gallon and 60 gallon day tanks which store Toluene Diisocyanate (TDI), a regulated hazardous substance, for the manufacturing of polyurethane foam car seats.  In addition, Johnson Controls-Pulaski may have a 20,000 gallon rail car on-site storing TDI.  The maximum intended inventory of TDI on site is above the threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds listed in 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 68.130.\n\nSince the quantity of TDI exceeds the threshold quantity, JCI-Pulaski is required to implement a Risk Management Program (RMP).  JCI-Pulaski is subject to Program Level 1 requirements.  This submission of RMPSubmit presents the details of the RMP compliance measures conducted by JCI-Pulaski.\n\nRMP Submit defines minimum and maximum values that can be entered.  Specifically, limitations exist for the release rate (Section 2.6), release duration (Section 2.7), toxic endpoint distance (Section 2.11).  Due to these limitations, JCI-Pulaski was forced to use the default (inaccurate) values for the release rate, release duration, and toxic endpoint distance for this submittal rather than the more accurate values utilized by the ISCST3 model.  \n\nTable 1.  Difference Between RMP Submit Values and Actual Modeled Parameters\n\n\n  RMP Submit Default Value Actual (Correct) Modeled Value\n\nRelease Rate        0.2 lb/min                2.8x10-2 lb/min\n\nRelease Duration  9999.9 minutes         6.79x10+6 minutes\n\nToxic Endpoint\nDistance              0.01 miles                0.049 miles\n\n\n1.1 Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nAt JCI-Pulaski, certain precautions, such as implementing engineering controls, and wearing appropriate personal protective equipment, including respiratory protection if exposure limits may be exceeded, are t"

The maximum amount of TDI that can be stored in the plant (i.e., not including the rail car) is 209,789 pounds.\n\n1.3 The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\nJCI-Pulaski has specific process controls in place to minimize the risks of spills.  All chemical storage tanks are located indoors, above ground with secondary containment.  Tanks critical to the process have level sensors to prevent any tank from being overfilled.  Fill duration is also monitored during the transfer of TDI to the process lines and if not satisfied within a set time period, auto filling ceases and an alarm is activated.  Chemical wet systems are equipped with high and low-pressure switches to shut down in the event of a line rupture.  Critical valves are monitored electronically as to open/closed positioning.\n\nJCI-Pulaski has a preventative maintenance software program in place to address maintenance of all vital parts of the plant's day-to-day operations.  Specific environmental issues are also addressed with this computer driven program.\n\nJCI-Pulaski has established an Air Monitoring Program that monitors the airborne concentration of  TDI within the production facility.\n\nProperty Conservation and Risk Management audits are conducted annually by Factory Mutual Risk Appraisers as well as Environmental audits by the JCI corporate environmental department located  in Plymouth, Michigan.\n\n1.4 Five-Year Accident History\nIn the past five years, there have been no accidental releases of TDI at JCI-Pulaski.\n\n1.5 The Emergency Response Program\nJCI-Pulaski's emergency response policies have been designed to comply with all applicable state and federal regulations.  These policies summarize the actions to be taken in response to a chemical release.  In the event of a release, the HazMat Team will respond using appropria"

If necessary, the appropriate outside facilities, such as the hospital or nearby residences and businesses, will be notified.  Employees are and will be trained in the safe handling and management of hazardous materials, respiratory protection, confined space entry, transportation of dangerous goods, and in the emergency response procedures to be taken in the event of an accidental release.\n\nAll spills that take place at the Pulaski facility must be documented and reported to the appropriate personnel.  The reporting allows the number and type of spills that occur to be tracked.  This in turn allows measures to be implemented to prevent similar spills from occurring in the future.  Spills exceeding the reportable quantity must be reported to certain regulatory agencies.\n\nIf a release of 10 gallons or more of TDI has occurred, JCI informs Bayer Corporation, the supplier of TDI, of the accidental release and inquires about assistance and advice.\n\n1.6 Planned Changes to Improve Safety\nJCI-Pulaski is committed to continuous improvement in all aspects of its operation, including safety.  As such, JCI-Pulaski strives to take a proactive approach to ensure employee safety, health and wellness and to protect the environment.\n\nJCI-Pulaski conducts routine inspections and audits to ensure safe work conditions and compliance to applicable regulations.  These inspections and audits may be conducted by internal personnel from various levels of the organization (line employee to plant manager), by JCI personnel from other locations, or by outside consultants.  Results of the inspections and audits are documented"
