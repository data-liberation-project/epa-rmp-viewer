Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at the Stationary Source\n\nPregis, LLC (Pregis) is committed to protecting facility personnel, the public, and the environment from any workplace and accidental release hazards. An appropriate response to releases of Isobutane is in the written Risk Management Program. Safety, environmental, and risk management programs are fully implemented and coordinated with community emergency responders for emergency planning and response. \n\n\n\nB. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nPregis is a specialty foam manufacturing facility, which produces polyethylene (PE) foam and is located at 1867 South Veterans Blvd. in Tupelo, Mississippi. \n\n\n\nThe EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) is part of the Clean Air Act and applies to processes storing a specified chemical above a threshold quantity. The chemicals and threshold quantities are specified in Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 68. One such chemical is Isobutane, which is used as a blowing agent in the manufacturing process and is stored in excess of the threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds.\n\n\n\nPolyethylene foam or \"PE\" foam is a plastic product made of polyethylene resin that is mixed with reclaimed product and additives.  Processes include the extrusion of the mixed resin through a highly specialized extruder; adding a liquid blowing agent (Isobutane), then cooling the material and forcing it through a die. The finished product is produced in variety of colors, thicknesses, and densities. The Isobutane is stored in three (3) storage tanks located in the tank farm.  The Isobutane Storage Tanks include one (1) 7,000) gallon and two (2) 6,000-gallon storage tanks with a combined maximum storage capacity of 19,000 gallons. The facility maintains administrative controls that allow the tanks to be filled to 80% of capacity which equates to 15,200 gallons or 71,288 pounds of Isobutane.\n\n\n\nThe entire facility is con"

General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nProcess Safety Information: Pregis will complete a compilation of written safety information to be used in conducting the process hazard analysis (PHA). The PHA will be conducted using the process safety information gathered in order to identify and understand the hazards posed by the Isobutane System. The PHA will be conducted using the process safety information in order to identify and understand the hazards posed by the Isobutane system.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis: Pregis will update and revalidate the PHA as necessary and at least every five (5) years. The PHA was conducted using the \"What If\" methodology, which is one of the methodologies specified in 40 CFR 68.67, and was performed by a team with expertise in engineering and process operations, including one member who has expertise in the Isobutane system and a member knowledgeable in the specified PHA methodology. A system was established to promptly address the team's findings and recommendations; assure that the recommendations are resolved in a timely manner and that the resolution is documented; develop a written schedule of when these actions are to be completed; and communicate the actions to operation, maintenance and other employees who may be affected by the recommendations or actions. The PHA was updated and revalidated on April 27 and 28, 2021.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures: Pregis has developed written operating procedures to provide clear instructions for safely conducting activities at each operation where Isobutane is utilized. These written operating procedures will be consistent with the process safety information for each operating phase, operating limitations, safety and health considerations, safety systems and their functions. The operating procedures will be rea"

Pregis will certify annually that these operating procedures are current and accurate. Pregis will develop and implement safe work practices to provide for the control of hazards during operations such as lockout/tagout; opening process equipment or piping; and control entrance into the Pregis facility.\n\n\n\nTraining: Pregis will provide training for each employee associated with the Isobutane system. This training will include an overview of the process and operating procedures as outlined in 40 CFR 68.67. Refresher training is provided every three (3) years or more often as necessary. Pregis documents and maintains records of employee training, and the means used to verify that the employee understood the training.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity: Pregis will develop a written preventive maintenance program to maintain the on-going integrity of the equipment used in the Isobutane system (i.e., storage tanks, pumps, piping systems, etc); additionally, inspections, testing, equipment deficiencies, and quality assurance are addressed.\n\nEach person who has responsibilities to perform maintenance on the Isobutane system components receives training at least every three (3) years or more often if necessary.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change: Pregis will establish and implement written procedures to manage changes to process chemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures; and, changes to Pregis that effect the Isobutane system. These procedures assure that appropriate considerations are addressed prior to any change. Employees involved in operating a process and maintenance and contract employees whose job tasks will be affected by a change in the process are informed of, and trained in, the change prior to startup of the system.

The compliance audit will be conducted by at least knowledgeable in the Isobutane system. A report of the findings of the audit will be developed. Pregis will promptly determine and document an appropriate response to each of the findings of the compliance audit, and document that deficiencies have been corrected. Records of the two (2) most recent compliance audit reports will be maintained. A compliance audit was last conducted on July 21, 2019.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation: Pregis will investigate each incident, which results in or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of Isobutane. Incident investigations will be initiated as promptly as possible, as but no later than 48 hours following the incident. The incident investigation team will consist of at least one person knowledgeable in the process involved, including contract employee if the incident involved work of the contractor.
