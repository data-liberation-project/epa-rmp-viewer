The facility is staffed year-round and also employees a large seasonal work force during the spring and summer months.  The plant produces fresh, fresh frozen and thermally processed seafood products.  The facility uses Anhydrous Ammonia in a closed system as a refrigerant in freezers and cold storage.  Ammonia is the safest refrigerant available.  It has excellent  warning properties: it is extremely pungent at levels far below dangerous concentrations.  The maximum inventory of ammonia in the plant is 20,918 pounds.  In calculating worst case and alternate scenarios, efforts were made in all cases to over estimate rather than under estimate the effects of a release.  The plant has been operating safely since 1962.\n\nWorst Case Scenario:\nA worst case scenario is required to be documented in the RMP.  Failure of the largest vessel in the systme, the high pressure receiver (HPR),  when filled to capacity would release 11,781 pounds of ammonia.  The HPR is located in the machinery room.  Based on the requirements of the RMP rule, it is assumed that the HPR fails catastrophically, releasing it's entire contents in 10 minutes.  To obtain the most conservative assumption, it is assumed that the building does not mitigate the release, but that the ammonia exits to the outdoors via doors and ventallation shafts in the machiner room roof.  The release is modeled using RMP Comp Tm software.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario:\nThe alternative release scenario for the ammonia refrigeration process is based on a potential hazard identified during the Process Hazard Analysis conducted during documentation of the fac"

The release occurs indoors.  The release is evaluated according to the procedures documented in Chapter 4 of the EPA\u00bfs \u00bfRisk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration\u00bf (EPA GAR) and calculated by RMP CompTm software.\n\nRelease Prevention Program:\nAPS has a prevention program in place to comply with the requirements of the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, which is designed to prevent accidental release of ammonia.  The PSM program addresses all required elements including employee participation, process safety information and system drawings, operating procedures, hot work permits, management of change, mechanical integrity, training, pre-startup review, compliance and its, process hazard analysis, contractor safety, incident investigation and emergency response.  The system itself has many safety features built in including high and low level controls and alarms, pressure relief valves, automatic and manually controlled valves and shutoffs, and check valves.  Plant personnel responsible for the system have had extensive training in ammonia systems and hazardous material handling and response.\n\nFive Year Accident History:\nPer the requirements of 40 CRF 68.42, facilities must include a five year accident history for all accidental releases from covered processes that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.  There have been no such accidents at this facility in the past five years.\n\nEmergency Response Program:\nAPS maintains a written emergency action plan as part of the PSM plan to facilitate response to accidental ammonia releases.  The plan identifies personnel designated and trained to conduct the necessary duties during a response.  Responsibilities"
