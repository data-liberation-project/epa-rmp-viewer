      "SummaryText": "Gordon Food Service operates a food distribution facility in Houston TX.  Like many food facilities, we use anhydrous ammonia in our refrigeration system. Ammonia is the best refrigerant available for our use. Because of its moderate toxicity and slight flammability, ammonia is considered a hazardous material.  Gordon Food Service is committed to maintaining a safe manufacturing operation for our employees and the surrounding community. Our refrigeration system obeys our local building and fire codes, as well as industry consensus, codes and standards where appropriate. Finally, to comply with requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the United States Environmental Protection Agency, we have a Process Safety Management program to help us operate and maintain the system safely.  Our priority is to prevent accidental releases of hazardous materials instead of merely responding to problems. Our Process Safety Management program includes elements addressing:\r\n- Employee Participation: We involve our employees at all appropriate points in our program.\r\n- Process Safety Information: We maintain information relating to the safety of ammonia and the design limits of the refrigeration system so that our employees are fully informed.\r\n- Process Hazards Analysis: We conduct detailed studies of our refrigeration system to identify the important hazards and safeguards and to identify appropriate changes to improve safety.\r\n- Operating Procedures: We provide written operating procedures to help our staff stay within the safe operating limits of the refrigeration equipment.\r\n- Mechanical Integrity (Maintenance and Quality Control): We have established a comprehensive program of inspections and preventive maintenance to keep mechanical failures from occurring.\r\n- Training: We train our mechanics in safe operation and maintenance of the refrigeration system.\r\n- Management of Change: Alterations to the refrigeration system are screened to verify that they"

As required by the EPA, we have analyzed worst-case and alternative hypothetical ammonia release scenarios and their consequences, details of which appear in other portions of this Risk Management Plan.  The methodology used to evaluate these accidents is prescribed by regulation, and makes no effort to estimate the likelihood or risk of these incidents.  The worst-case release scenario involves loss of the contents of a High pressure receiver vessel over ten minutes.  As required, this scenario has offsite impact, meaning that a level of 200 ppm ammonia is reached beyond the property line.\r\nThe alternative scenario involves the rupture of a pipe. This scenario also has (much lower) offsite impact. \r\nWe routinely make system changes to improve system safety, but as our system is quite safe now, we do not plan major overhauls soon. \r\nOur s"
