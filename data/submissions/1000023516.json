      "SummaryText": "The City of Shawnee, Oklahoma operates a water treatment plant located within the city limits in the southern portion of the city.  The plant uses chlorine to treat the city's drinking water for the city.  The water treatment plant holds safety as its first priority, especially when it comes to chlorine.  The maximum inventory is five tons  and the treatment plant limits the maximum number of cylinders in use at any one time to two.\nThe worst case scenario for the City of Shawnee water plant is a release from a 1-ton Chlorine cylinder at a rate of 110 lbs/min. Estimated distance to toxic end point using EPA's RMP COMP software  is 0.9 miles.  The alternate scenario represents a release from a pipe at 800 lbs/min for 2.5 mins until the connected tank is empty. Estimated distance to toxic end point using EPA's RMP COMP software  is 0.4 miles.\n\nThe City of Shawnee water plant follows a strict operation, safety and maintenance program to minimize the likelihood of an accident occurring at the facility.  Because of the strict implementation of the above-mentioned programs, this facility has not had a release within the last five years.\nThe City of Shawnee water plant holds training and refresher courses for the personnel at the facility regarding the chlorine system and its concerns and Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA).  However, if an accident occurred. The City of Shawnee Fire Department and the Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC) would be notified and would respond immediately.\nThe City of Shawnee water plant has no current plans to change the chlorine process in the foreseeable future."
