      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nThis stationary source's accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates procedures and management practices. Applicable procedures of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Prevention Program are followed . The stationary source's emergency policy involves the preparation of plans tailored to the stationary source and to the emergency response services available in the community.\n\nThe facility spill prevention policy seeks to implement appropriate controls to prevent accidental releases of regulated flammable substances. In the event such a release occurs  personnel are prepared to work with the local fire department, Local Emergency Planning Commission, and other authorities to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nBuzzard Creek, a remote unattended stationary source located in rural Mesa County, Colorado, recovers petroleum products      (e.g. natural gas and natural gas liquids (NGL) from field gas. The NGL separated from the field gas is stored on site and is sold to others for further processing. NGL is a mixture of aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons including regulated flammables ethane, propane, butane, isobutane, isopentane and pentane. There are no threshold quantities of toxic substances present.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe necessary steps have been taken to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements of 40 CFR part 68. This stationary source was designed and constructed in accord with applicable state and federal regulations and applicable good engineering practices. The following briefly describes the release prevention program that is in place.\n \nSafety Information \n\nA variety of documents are available and used to help maintain safe operation of the process. These documents cover chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters, and specific chemica"

This information is updated when a change occurs that makes the information inaccurate. \n\nChemical specific information describing the chemical hazards associated with regulated substances is maintained e.g. material safety data sheets. For specific process areas, safety related limits for specific process parameters (e.g. temperature, pressure, level) are documented. Process controls and monitoring instruments, protective instrument systems and trained personnel are used to maintain the process within these limits.\n\nInformation about the design and construction of the process equipment is maintained and readily available. This information provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities as well as evaluating proposed changes to make sure that process safety features are not compromised.\n\nHazard Review\n\nA hazard review and safety inspections are conducted to identify and control hazards associated with the process and regulated substances including the potential equipment malfunction or human error and the safeguards needed to detect, control or prevent hazards, equipment malfunction and human error. The hazard review  will be updated on at least 5 year intervals and whenever a major process change occurs.  Additional reviews/ inspections include pre startup for new/ modified process or equipment and periodic equipment inspections. Hazard review findings are addressed in a timely manner. The findings and final resolutions are documented and retained.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nWritten operating procedures for safely conducting activities associated with the process and regulated substances have been prepared and are maintained at the facility. These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown, startup after an emergency shutdown and temporary operations.

New employees receive basic training in process operations followed by on-the-job supervision until they are determined to be competent to work independently. Training in updated or new procedures is provided before process startup after a major change.  Refresher training is provided at least ever 3 years or more frequently if needed or requested.  In addition, employees not operating the process receive safety training on the hazards associated with the process and regulated substances at the facility.\n\nMaintenance Procedures\n\nMaintenance checks are performed on the equipment to ensure proper function.  Maintenance, tests and inspections are consistent with manufacturers recommendations, good practices and prior operating experience. Trained and qualified personnel perform the maintenance tasks. Equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner. \n\nWhen contractors are required for construction and maintenance activities, procedures are in place to ensure they perform their work in a safe manner, are aware of hazards in their work place, understand what they are to do in an emergency, understand and follow facility safety rules, and inform the facility representative of any hazards that they find during their work. \n\nCompliance Audits\n\nCompliance audits will be conducted on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions of the RMP rule are being implemented.

The goal of the investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence, or a similar incident. A summary report will be prepared at the conclusion of the investigation. The resolutions and action taken will be documented. The findings will be reviewed with the affected personnel. Summaries will be maintained for 5 years.\n\nEmergency Plan\n\nEmployees receive training as necessary to perform their specific emergency actions.  Such actions include, but not limited to, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public and initiate post accident cleanup.The plan is updated when necessary and those affected are informed and or trained in the change. There are no 112(r) threshold toxic substances on site."
