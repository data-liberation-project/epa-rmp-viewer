As a residual effect, our neighbors in the community and the surrounding area benefit. Less likelihood of problems within the mill means less likelihood of problems for our neighbors. We will continue to find ways to actively engage our work force in the safety process and continue our Behavior-Based safety observation program. We have created a new observation form to assist all employees in documenting their safety observations.  It's a pocket sized card that walks the employee through the Take Two steps to review jobs prior to commencement.  Our mill remains one of the best in our Division for safety related metrics."
