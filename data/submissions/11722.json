      "SummaryText": "This Risk Management Plan (RMP) has been developed by Earth Sciences Consultants, Inc. (Earth Sciences) for Allegheny Ludlum Corporation's Brackenridge facility located at 100 River Road, Leechburg, Pennsylvania, and is pursuant to the requirements of 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68.\n\nProcess Description and Regulated Substances.\nThe Brackenridge facility has designed and operates a process for the storage and transfer of 70 percent hydrofluoric acid (HF) into process tubs.  The process includes a 12,000-gallon storage tank located in a designated acid storage area and piping used to supply 70 percent HF to the process tubs.  The storage, handling, and use of 70 percent HF at the plant is hereafter referred to as \"Process No. 1\" in the remainder of this document.  The North American Industrial Classification System code for the facility is 331111.  The Brackenridge facility process is classified as a Tier II program since the facility is not subject to Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) requirements under 29 CFR 1910.119.  \n\nAccident Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nThe Brackenridge facility has an excellent record in preventing and minimizing releases of hydrofluoric acid.  The Brackenridge facility remains committed to the prevention of releases of hydrofluoric acid.  In the event of a release, the Brackenridge facility is committed to a timely response in accordance with their Preparedness, Prevention, and Contingency (PPC) Plan and the applicable components of this RMP.  Accident prevention and emergency response programs are described in this RMP.  \n\nWorst-Case Scenario and Alternative Release Scenario\nThe worst-case scenario  is a failure of the 70 percent HF storage tank and piping system when filled to capacity.  An administrative control (i.e., visual inspection to maintain less than or equal to 90 percent fill volume in the tank) is in place at the facility.  A release from th"

RMP Comp was used to determine the distance to the toxic end point associated with a worst-case scenario release.  According to the modeling results, the distance to the specified end point for a worst-case accidental release scenario associated with this process is 0.8 mile, which is greater than the distance to the nearest public receptor.\n\nThe most likely alternative release scenario for is a leak from the piping connected to the HF storage tank.  Due to a series of shut-off valves, including one near the storage tank, any leak from the piping would not likely exceed the amount contained in approximately 200 linear feet of 2-inch-diameter piping which is approximately 33 gallons or 327 pounds.  RMP Comp was used to determine the distance to the toxic end point associated with this alternative release scenario.  According to the modeling results, the distance to the specified end point for the alternative release scenario associated with this process is 0.2 mile, which is greater than the distance to the nearest public receptor.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nThe Brackenridge facility has safe job procedures (SJP) in place:\n\n7 to evaluate the HF tank capacity and volume already in place before unloading begins;\n7 to describe the use of HF in the facility's manufacturing operations; and\n7 for the inspection of process equipment including the HF tank, piping, and isolation valves.\n\nIn addition, the Brackenridge facility trains employees regarding safe job procedures, safe work practices, emergency evacuation and response, and routine and nonroutine work authorization.

The  Brackenridge facility has trained employees for an initial response team.  This team will don personal protective equipment (PPE) and be dispatched to control or stop a minor emergency or an accidental release or help move any employee(s) that has been affected by a 70 percent HF release.  If necessary, employees will be evacuated to a safe zone.\n\nIn the event of an emergency where off-site response is appropriate, it will be the policy of the Brackenridge facility to notify the Brackenridge Fire Department and/or the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and request that they respond to the emergency.  A fire, explosion, or other occurrence with the potential to create a release of the regulated substance (HF) from the process may pose a danger to public emergency responders.   Public emergency responders will not be permitted to enter this area except as previously arranged with the Primary Emergency Coordinator (PEC) or other designated personnel, as identified within this RMP.\n\nFinally, the  Brackenridge facility has an equipped emergency control center.  The emergency control center is sited in a safe zone and serves as the major communication link between the PEC and plant or corporate management as well as with local community officials.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nNo additional measures to prevent off-site impacts from accidental releases have been identified or are required at this time.  If reasonable measures are subsequently identified that would lower the risk of an off-site release, such measures will be implemented.\n\nResponsible Person\nI, Deborah L.
