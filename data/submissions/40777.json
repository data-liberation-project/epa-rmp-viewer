Regulated chemicals are stored in original shipping containers. Containers are changed only during daylight hours with a two-man team of trained operators.\n    PVIA treats an average of 4.5 million gallons of raw water per day pumped from Lake Wister. The primary disinfectant is chlorine. We store a maximum of 10-12 thousand pounds of chlorine on site in 2000 lb. Shipping containers. The chlorine is fed into the finished water under vacuum at a rate of 150-200 lbs. Per day depending on the disinfectant demand.    \n    The worst case release scenario for this facility would be a ruptured shipping container, containing the full 2000 lbs. This unlikely event would have off site impacts.       \n    PVIA and the locale Rural Fire Dept. has worked out an evacuation plan for off site receptors. This facility is in a rural area and any off site receptors will be few. We have passive mitigation and have installed dikes and water spray piping to cover the stored shipping containers. Alternative scenarios are a leaking gasket at the connection between the shipping container and our vacuum feed equipment or a leaking pressure plug on the shipping container. These events will not have off site impacts. Passive mitigation will keep these events to very small releases.   \n    Our suppliers tests shipping containers before they are filled and shipped to us. Trained operators connect containers to our feed system. Passive mitigation is being installed. We conduct training with locale Fire Department.    \n    PVIA has a written emergency response plan that"
