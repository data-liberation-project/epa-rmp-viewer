In addition to the ongoing inspection and maintenance of the refrigeration system, wherever possible refrigeration system components are located in areas that are not as likely to become damaged (i.e., tanks and pipe runs are placed away and protected from forklift and truck traffic). RPC's objective is to prevent unwanted releases of ammonia into locations that could potentially expose Associates and others to serious hazards. An effective program requires a systematic approach to evaluating the entire system. Workplace and process safety are major concerns to management and Associates alike. The prevention and mitigation of unwanted releases of ammonia into locations that could expose Associates and the community to serious hazards is of primary concern.\n\n\n\nThe Site has incorporated many safety features in the design of the ammonia refrigeration system to prevent system failures and to mitigate potential releases. The predominant safety concern with closed-loop ammonia systems is an inadvertent buildup of pressure exceeding pressure ratings or capacities of equipment due to ammonia expansion. The Site's ammonia system is continuously monitored by automated control systems that shutdown pump and the components if deviations from normal operating conditions occur. Further, the system is equipped with pressure relief valves on all pressure vessels and most, if not all, additional locations within the ammonia system where ammonia could become trapped.\n\n\n\nRPC considers the health and safety of each Associate as its most important responsibility. It is our policy to provide a healthy and safe work environment.

RPC has developed a comprehensive safety program in compliance with OSHA and EPA requirements to ensure the responsible management of the ammonia onsite (the Process Safety Management and Risk Management Program, respectively). All refrigeration Associates receive operator training, safe work practices training and training on the standard operating procedures (SOPs). Safety meetings are conducted to further protect Associates and the community as a whole.\n\n\n\nThe Site's prevention program is designed to inform all Associates of the hazards of ammonia, procedures for the safe use of ammonia, and the steps taken for the safety of Associates and the community in the event of a release or spill.\n\n\n\nThe Site endeavors to eliminate accidents and health hazards to Associates, customers, and the community by having procedures in place to provide Associates educational training, safe working conditions, and the means to increase awareness of potential dangers both on and off the job. RPC's objective is to prevent unwanted releases of ammonia into locations that could potentially expose Associates and others to serious hazards. An effective program requires a systematic approach to evaluating the entire system. Workplace and process safety are major concerns to management and Associates alike. The prevention and mitigation of unwanted releases of ammonia into locations that could expose Associates and the community to serious hazards is of primary concern.\n\n\n\nThe Site has incorporated many safety features in the design of the ammonia refrigeration system to prevent system failures and to mitigate potential releases. The predominant safety concern with closed-loop ammonia systems is an inadvertent buildup of pressure exceeding pressure ratin"

Alarms are placed throughout the Site to alarm personnel of an emergency relating to the accidental release of ammonia or other emergencies that may be encountered. RPC has developed specific procedures to be followed in the event of release. These procedures include evacuation of personnel, notification of authorities and actions to be taken to stop or mitigate the emergency if it is safe to do so.\n\n\n\nRPC-FNO has developed an emergency action plan (EAP) in compliance with 29 CFR 1910.38. RPC-FNO has coordinated its emergency response activities with the Fresno Fire Department, who will perform all emergency response activities at the facility. The EAP establishes the procedures to be followed in the event of a release of anhydrous ammonia as well as the order of notification for off-Site responders.\n\n\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nThe Site recognizes that the implementation of this program is a continuous process for evaluating, monitoring and improving anhydrous ammonia handling operation at the Site. As such, the prevention program will evolve as RPC continues their ongoing focus and dedication of risk minimization and safety improvement for the employees and the surrounding community.\n\n"

The Site's ammonia system is continuously monitored by automated control systems that shutdown pump and the components if deviations from normal operating conditions occur. Further, the system is equipped with pressure relief valves on all pressure vessels and most, if not all, additional locations within the ammonia system where ammonia could become trapped.\n\n\n\nRPC considers the health and safety of each Associate as its most important responsibility. It is our policy to provide a healthy and safe work environment. This facility follows operating practices that safeguard all associates and result in safe working conditions while maintaining efficient operations.\n\n\n\nSafety is the responsibility of all Associates. Each associate is expected to comply with the requirements of RPC's Standards for Safety Performance. Management is responsible for the implementation, communication, documentation, and necessary training. The Associate is responsible for implementation, communication, and practices of the program. Management is committed to maintain a high level of interest in health and safety throughout this facility. This commitment extends to the associates and their involvement in preventing accidents.\n\n\n\nRPC has established its Health and Safety Program to insure that:\n\n\n\n--  Associates work in a healthy and safe environment.\n\n--  Associates are trained on safe work practices.\n\n--  Associates practice safe work habits.\n\n--  Management and associates are both involved in the program.\n\n--  There is constant communication between all Associates on safety issues.\n\n--  Compliance with all regulatory agencies is maintained.\n\n\n\nMajor safety features at the Site include:\n\n\n\n--  Installation of Ammonia leak detectors in processing areas and the engine room\n\n--  Remote emergency shutdown switches for the refrigeration system\n\n--  Fire sprinklers throughout the Site\n\n--  Component specific safety shutdowns of the refrigera"
