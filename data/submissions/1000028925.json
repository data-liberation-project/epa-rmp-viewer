      "SummaryText": "Facility Description:\r\n\r\nThe Black Run Natural Gas Processing and Propane Distribution facility is located near the intersection of SR-16 and Black Run Road in western Muskingum County.  The facility is comprised of two separate operations:\r\n\r\n1.\tNatural gas processing to recover Butane and Natural Gasolines (BG).\r\n2.\tBulk Propane storage and distribution to residential and commercial customers.\r\n\r\nNatural Gas Processing\r\n\r\nNatural gas is brought to the site via an underground natural gas pipeline where it is pumped through processing equipment that removes water and strips butane and natural gas liquids (BG) and propane from the natural gas.  The BG is comprised of approximately 30% Butane, 10% Propane and 60% Pentane.  The remaining natural gas is then sent back into the natural gas pipeline distribution system.  \r\n\r\nThe processing equipment is comprised of the following:\r\n\r\n\u00bf\tNatural gas fired engine to run the compressors;\r\n\u00bf\tCompressors push both natural gas and propane refrigerant through the process equipment;\r\n\u00bf\tGlycol dehydration process removes water vapor from the natural gas;\r\n\u00bf\tChilling equipment liquefies the BG and propane;\r\n\u00bf\tStabilizer Tower boils off the ethane;\r\n\u00bf\tDepropanizer equipment boils off propane and BG and then cools them and sends them to the bulk BG tank and bulk propane tank.  \r\n\r\nThe BG is stored in an onsite 25,000 gallon aboveground storage tank and sold to commercial reprocessing operations.  The propane is first stored in an onsite 18,000 gallon aboveground storage tank.  The propane can either be transferred to the other propane bulk tanks on site or can be loaded directly onto bobtail trucks for delivery to residential or commercial propane customers.\r\n\r\nPropane Storage and Distribution\r\n\r\nThis portion of the facility is comprised of three 30,000 gallon aboveground storage tanks.  The propane is delivered to the facility using bulk propane trucks.  Propane can also be transferred from the natural gas processing storage tanks to"

Both these processes are considered covered processes for purposes of this Process Safety Risk Management Plan (PSRMP).  The propane distribution operation is considered part of the covered process due to its location (co-location) adjacent to the processing plant storage tanks.  The co-location determination is based on the definition of process and the interpretations of what constitutes co-location as described in the Ohio EPA Risk Management Plan Co-Location Guidance of Non-Interconnected Regulated Substance Vessels, January 2002, and as described in Appendix A of the USEPA guidance document Risk Management Program Guidance for Propane Storage Facilities, March 2009.  Based on the close separation distances between all the storage tanks at the facility it was determined that the tanks are close enough together for a vapor cloud explosion resulting from the release of the total contents of one tank to cause the catastrophic failure of an adjacent tank.  \r\n\r\n\r\nOff-Site Consequence Analysis:\r\n\r\nThe USEPA and Ohio EPA regulations require that TEC submit one \"worst-case scenario,\" and one \"alternate case scenario\" for the listed flammable substances at their facility.  The listed flammable substances are as follows:\r\n\r\n1.\tButane and Natural Gasolines (BG) - a mixture of natural gas liquids comprised of approximately:\r\n\r\n\u00bf\t30% Butane\r\n\u00bf\t10% Propane\r\n\u00bf\t60% Pentane\r\n\r\n2.\tPropane  \r\n\r\nUS EPA defines the \"worst-case scenario\" as a release of the largest vessel containing the regulated substance.  For Butane, Propane and other flammable materials the released substance is assumed to explode and generate a pressure wave that can damage people and structures.  \r\n\r\nAn \"alternate"

The nominal water storage capacity of Tank 1 is 25,000 gallons or approximately 126,155 pounds of BG.  \r\n\r\nTank No.3 is the largest d vessel or system containing Propane and the worst-case scenario was determined to be the release of the entire contents of the tank into the air surrounding the tank.  The nominal water storage capacity of Tank 3 is 30,000 gallons or approximately 127,200 pounds of Propane.  \r\n\r\nTEC follows the recommendations of the Certified Employee Training Program, National Propane Gas Association and only fills the BG and Propane tanks to 85% of their nominal capacity.  This is considered an Administrative Control under 40 CFR 68.25(b) Determining the Worst-Case Release Quantity.  The maximum pounds of BG and Propane that can be released were adjusted to 85% of the nominal capacity as follows:\r\n\r\n\u00bf\tTank No.1 BG - 107,232 pounds\r\n\u00bf\tTank No.3 Propane - 108,120 pounds.\r\n\r\nBoth the BG and Propane are liquefied under pressure and stored at ambient temperature.  \r\n\r\nEstimated Release Rate and Distance to Toxic Endpoint\r\n\r\nThe US EPA program RMP*Comp Version 1.07 was used to calculate the estimated distance to endpoint and results in a conservative estimate of the potentially impacted area.  Assumptions used were selected in accordance with 40 CFR 68.25 where the estimated quantity released is the entire contents of the tank, considering administrative controls.

ArcView 9.3 provides databases from the Environmental Protection Agency, the Bureau of Census (2010 Tiger/Line Shapefiles), and other federal agencies.  These databases are presented in a geographic context on maps that contain jurisdictional entities (states, counties, cities and towns, zip codes, congressional districts and others), detailed network of roads, rivers, and railroads, schools, hospitals, churches, cemeteries, airports, and other landmark features.  The demographic information in ArcView 9.3 is based on the 2010 Census and the Environmental Systems Research Institute, Inc. (ESRI) Community Data.\r\n\r\nCensus block group data are usually calculated in ArcView 9.3 using the proportional split method.  This method was utilized where there was a census block group located partially within the radius of the distance to endpoint and partially outside of the radius.  However, during the analysis population data were not available in the census block groups for the impacted area.  The rural nature of the surrounding area allowed a hand count of household units (houses) to be done using a Google Earth aerial photo.  The residential population within the impacted area was estimated by multiplying the total household units seen on the aerial photo by average household  for Muskingum County (2.58 persons per household).  All houses seen on the aerial were assumed to be occupied and field verification was not performed.  \r\n\r\nThe analyses indicate that the area within the impact radius is 0.5024 square miles.

The alternate scenario is defined to be a more likely scenario than the \"worst case\" that still produces an offsite impact.  The Pull-Away scenario was selected as the more likely scenario to occur.  In this scenario a bulk tanker truck pulls away from the loading rack with the hose still attached to the truck.  The hose ruptures and releases the contents of the hose and additional gas from the truck or tank systems until the mitigating measures take affect.  \r\n\r\nPassive mitigation was included in the analysis and includes the following components:\r\n\r\n1.\tSmart Hose - The Smart Hose has a cable inside so that if the hose breaks the flapper valves at either end of the hose clo"

The valve closes and prevents gas from escaping from the bulk storage tank piping.  \r\n\r\nThe US EPA program RMP*Comp Version 1.07 was used to calculate the estimated distance to endpoint and results in a conservative estimate of the potentially impacted area.  The release occurs over a time period of less than one minute due to the passive mitigation measures.

According to the USEPA Risk Management Guidance for Offsite Consequence Analysis the analysis of flammable mixtures can be done using the major component of the mixture with the highest heat of combustion.

Of the three major components, propane has the highest heat of combustion as listed in Exhibit C-1 of the guidance.  Propane and butane together comprise 40% of the mixture and have similar values for heat of combustion.  Propane was selected as the chemical to be modeled using RMP*Comp.  \r\n\r\nThe distance to endpoint estimated for propane using the RMP*Comp model is 0.02 miles.
