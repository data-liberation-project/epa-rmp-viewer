      "SummaryText": "Mariah Foods, Inc. is a meat processing plant.  The facility uses an anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system to cool production, storage, and freezer areas of the plant.  The system consists of two main circuits with one high pressure compressor on each circuit plus one standby compressor which may be used on either refrigeration circuit.  Low pressure compressors are used for the freezer portions of the refrigerant loop.  All ammonia is taken from a main storage receiver located on the South side of the facility.  In the event of a release, various refrigeration circuits may be valved off to minimize the leak.  In the event of a major leak or accident, the compressors and main receiver will be isolated and shut down.\n\nMariah Foods is dedicated to making the ammonia refrigeration systems safe and efficient.  Equipment is replaced in a pro-active manner, and operating personnel are trained to be able to handle most expected emergencies.  The Hazardous Materials Response team of the Columbus Fire Department supports trained operating personnel in responding to any situation involving the ammonia system."
