              "Description": "Pawtucket Power Associates (PPA) uses anhydrous ammonia for the Inlet Cooling System that is regulated by OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations.  In 1994, PPA compiled a PSM Plan to address OSHA requirements and a majority of the RMP Prevention Program Elements.  The major elements of the prevention program for anhydrous ammonia are summarized below:  PPA maintains documentation on the anhydrous ammonia system that provides information on the equipment's design, configuration, and safe operating parameters.  The system is equipped with monitoring equipment that provides operators with indications of potential problems.  Pressure relief valves mounted on the process vessels discharge into the header system that vents through a water deluge system and provides mitigation in the event of a release.  PPA conducts a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) consistent with PSM requirements.  Using the \"What If\" technique, PPA identified potential malfunctions that could occur, along with the associated hazards, consequences, and controls.  There were no corrective actions that were identified or required as a result of the PHA.  PPA maintains operating procedures that describe proper start-up, shutdown, normal operating, and emergency actions.  All system operators receive training in these procedures at the start of their employment at the facility.  Continuing on-the-job training is provided to all operators by PPA.  The competency of operators is evaluated by the obsevations of supervisors and communicated to employees as issues arise and during normal preformance reviews.  PPA has certified that all employees currently working at the facility have the required skills, knowledge, and abilities to safely operate the system.  Operators routinely inspect process equipment and monitor system operating parameters throughout their shifts.  Preventative maintenance is conducted on an as-needed basis and each year during the facility's annual outage period.  PPA utilizes skilled outside contractors with extensive knowledge and experience with anhydrous ammonia systems to conduct inspections and maintenance whenever such activities may result in potential exposure to ammonia and prior to each system re-start.  PPA has established Management of Change, Hot Work Permits, Employee Participation, and Contractor Safety programs as required by both the PSM and RMP regulations.",

      "SummaryText": "The accidental release prevention and emergency response policy at Pawtucket Power is to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations.  It is our goal to achieve and sustain \" Zero Accident Tolerance\" through communication, information, and training.  If an emergency were to occur, it is our procedure to notify the Pawtucket FIre Department and request that they respond to the emergency.\n\nPawtucket Power is a combined cycle cogeneration power plant.  The regulated substances handled here are Anhydrous Ammonia used as a refrigerant to enhance gas turbine performance and efficiency and Aqueous Ammonia used as a catalyst to control nitrogen oxides (NOx).  Approximately 13,000 pounds of Anhydrous Ammonia is used in the \"Chiller System\" and 12,000 gallons of Aqueous Ammonia is stored in an above ground storage tank.\n\nThe worst-case scenario is a catastrophic failure of the Cooler System.  This facility is located in an urban area and there will be off-site consequences in the unlikely event of an emergency.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps at Pawtucket Power are to comply with EPA's accidental prevention rule, OSHA's process safety management rule, and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.  Each system and equipment at Pawtucket Power is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with the afformentioned codes, laws, and regulations.\n\nPawtucket Power has had no accidents associated with ammonia use during the life of the facility, through June 18, 1999.\n\nThe emergency response program at Pawtucket Power is to contact the Pawtucket Fire Department.  It is our policy to request the fire department's response to an emergency and to inspect our facility yearly to ensure they are familar with our systems and materials.\n\nThere are currently no planned changes to improve safety at Pawtucket Power."
