The Facility Policy\n\n    West Central AGRIServices,LLC., and the employees of the West Central AGRIServices, LLC., south of Adrian are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Adrian Fire Department, and other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information\n\n    The primary activity is an agricultural supply center with sales of feed, seed, grain, agricultural chemicals and fertilizers. This RMP is for the storage and distribution to our farmer customers of anhydrous ammonia.\n\n    The maximum quantity stored would be 140,000 pounds in our 30,000 gallon storage tank. The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a transport delivery truck holding approximately 50,000 pounds.\n\n3. The worst-case and alternative release scenario.\n\n    a. The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of the storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes. The maximum quantity released would be 140,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 PPM) is 2.5 miles.\n\n    b. The alternative release scenario based on the most likely potential incident is a release from a break in a 3? transfer hose during receiving operations. This release is assumed to last approximately 2 minutes before automatic or manual shut-off stops the flow. The maximum quantity release would be 26,640 pounds. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 PPM) is 1.2 miles.\n4. The Accidental Release Prevention Program.\n\n    The facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the "

The Five-year Accident History\n\n    There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that: have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6. The Emergency Response Program.\n\n    The facility has;\n\n    a. a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA\n       Standard, 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\n    b. provided State and Local authorities with the emergency\n       planning and community right-to-know information as\n       required under SARA Title III (EPCRA);\n\n    c. a written emergency response program, in accordance with\n       OSHA Standard, 29 CFR 1910.120, including pre-emergency\n       planning and employee training.\n\n7. Planned changes to improve safety.\n\n    Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions. There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
