The address on record for the Northeast Station is 10200 McCombs Street in El Paso, Texas.  The physical location of the Northeast Station is at the intersection of McCombs Street and Sean Haggerty Drive (5804 Sean Haggerty Drive).  The location is depicted on the Site Location Map in Appendix C.  This booster station is surrounded by commercial, residential and vacant land.\r\n\r\n1.2 ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\r\nEPWU-PSB has prepared this Risk Management Plan (RMP) for the chlorination process at Northeast Station, in compliance with 40CFR68, found in the EPA's General Risk Management Program Guidance (GRM\u00ad PG), the registration for this process is presented in Appendix A.\r\n\r\nThe RMP objectives are:\r\n\u00bf\tHazard Assessment-communicate the extent of a possible chlorine release and identify potential receptors\r\n\u00bf\tPrevention Program-develop strategies to prevent an accidental release\r\n\u00bf\tEmergency Response Program-formulate contingency planning in the case of an accidental release\r\n\r\nHazard Assessment\r\nThe worst case scenario modeled by the Areal Locations of Hazardous Atmospheres (ALOHA&reg;) software indicates a vulnerable zone radius of 2.5 miles.  The alternative release analysis indicates a vulnerable zone radius of 13 yards. The Hazard Assessment shows an estimated population within the worst case scenario at 57,300 people.  The alternative \"more likely\" release estimated population is approximately 0 people.\r\n\r\nThe RMP rule requires the identification of environmental receptors within the toxic endpoint zone for both worst case and alternative scenarios. No environmental receptors were identified.\r\n\r\nPrevention Program\r\nThe goal of the Prevention Program is to integrate technologies, procedures, and management practices t"

The Prevention Program incorporates safety information, hazard review, operating procedures, training, maintenance, compliance audits and incident investigations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\nThe Emergency Response Program is modeled after the EPWU-PSB's \"Emergency Response Action Plan\" and the Chlorine Institute Pamphlet 1 Chlorine Basics.  The Emergency Response Program incorporates an emergency response plan, equipment procedures and training in relevant procedures for employees involved in the chlorination process.  \r\n\r\nMexico and The United States created the Jointed Contingency Plan (JCP), designed for rapid international response to contingencies associated with chemical hazardous substances on the inland border. The JCP provides a mechanism for cooperation between the El Paso, Texas, United States of America and Ciudad Juarez, Chihuahua, Mexico. The JCP is designed to protect the health, human safety and the environment by providing international guidance and coordinated responses between the two countries (Mexico-US).\r\n\r\n1.3 PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\nEPWU-PSB plans to review and revise, as necessary, the chlorination process operating procedures in order to make certain that the operators understand the human factors that may lead to accidental releases.  The emergency response plan is also reviewed and updated to reflect changes and ensure that employees are informed of changes.  \r\n\r\n2 HAZARD ASSESSMENT (40CFR68 SUBPART B)\r\n\r\n2.1 APPLICIBILITY (\u00a7 68.20)\r\nSection 112(r) of the Clean Air Act requires covered facilities to develop Risk Management Programs in an effort to \"prevent accidental releases and minimize the consequences of releases.\" Chlorine (CAS 7782-50-5), a regulated substance under section 112(r)(7) of the Clean Air Act, has a threshold quantity of 2,500 pounds as listed in Table 1 of \u00a768.130. The Northeast Station is subject to the RMP regulation because the chlorinati"

      "SummaryText": "on process at the facility utilizes and/or stores a greater quantity of chlorine than the threshold quantity. Currently, the Northeast Station has the potential to store up to two (2) one-ton chlorine containers in the chlorination storage area, a potential of 4,000 pounds of chlorine.\r\n\r\nUnder the RMP guidelines, the chlorination process at the Northeast Station qualifies as a Program 2 process. The process is not listed as Program 3 because the facility is not covered under the OSHA Process Safety Management requirements and the process is not part of the SIC codes listed in \u00a768.10(d)(1).  The chlorination process does not qualify for Program 1 status because a worst case release would reach a public receptor, therefore not satisfying \u00a768.10(b)(2).\r\n\r\n2.2 OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS PARAMETERS (\u00a7 68.22)\r\n\r\n2.1.1 ENDPOINT\r\nAs specified in Appendix A for \u00a768.22(a)(1), the toxic endpoint for chlorine is 0.0087 mg/L. The toxic endpoint corresponds to a concentration of 3.0 parts per million (ppm).\r\n\r\n2.1.2 WIND SPEED AND ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY CLASS\r\nPer the RMP rule, a wind speed of 1.5 m/s and an F stability class, utilized in the worst case release analysis. Weak winds, nighttime cooling and little turbulent mixing characterize the F atmospheric stability class.  The atmosphere is considered stable under the F stability classification.  These wind and atmospheric conditions allow for maximum plume transport and are therefore appropriate for a worst case release analysis.\r\n\r\nThe atmospheric data used for the RMP's update was obtained from the National Weather Service (NWS) Office for the El Paso, Texas region. The NWS station is located at the Dona Ana County Airport at Santa Teresa, New Mexico, approximately 16 miles northwest of downtown El Paso.\r\n\r\nFor the alternative release scenario, the regulations allow the use of typical meteorological conditions for the geographic area. According to the NWS Office, the average wind speed for El Paso is 8.5 miles per hour (3"

      "SummaryText": ".8 m/s). The atmospheric conditions would be best described by the C stability classification.  The C classification is representative of a neutral atmosphere with moderate turbulence. These wind and atmospheric conditions are more probable to occur and are therefore used in the alternative \"more likely\" release scenario.\r\n\r\n2.2.3 AMBIENT TEMPERATURE AND HUMIDITY\r\nFor the worst case analysis, the RMP rule requires the use of the highest daily maximum temperature in the previous three years and the average humidity. The three-year (January 2016 through January 2019) maximum temperature for El Paso is 111\u00b0F and the daily average relative humidity is 37%.\r\n\r\nFor the alternative release scenario, the regulations indicate the use of average temperature and humidity data. The average temperature for El Paso is 69.1\u00b0F and the daily average relative humidity is 37%.\r\n2.2.4 HEIGHT RELEASE\r\nAs indicated in the RMP rule, the worst case scenario analysis assumes a ground level release (0 feet). For the alternative release analysis, the regulation indicates that the release height be determined by the release scenario.  Since the process area is near ground level, the release was assumed to occur at ground level.\r\n2.2.5 SURFACE ROUGHNESS\r\nThe software model used in the offsite consequence analysis considers the roughness length (Zo) of the terrain as a parameter in the transport analysis.  For example, Grass (artificial, 7.5 cm high), Grass (thin to 50 cm), Vegetation (1 m to 2 m high) and a Large City (Tokyo) have a roughness length of 1 cm, 5 cm, 20 cm and 165 cm, respectively.  Since the modeling software utilizes a heavy gas model, the software considers a roughness length of up to 10 cm.\r\n\r\nThe topography of the area near the chlorine process is urban with obstacles in the immediate area such as trees or small buildings. The topography of the area near the chlorine process is desert rangeland with residential housing developments and several industrial areas. A roughness le"

Since chlorine gas is 2.4 times heavier than air, the heavy gas model in Areal Locations of Hazardous Atmospheres (ALOHA&reg;) Version 5.4.7 was utilized for the dispersion analyses, instead of a buoyant gas model.\r\n2.2.7 TEMPERATURE OF RELEASEED SUBSTANCE\r\nFor the worst case analysis the RMP rule requires the use of the maximum of either the highest daily maximum temperature in the previous three years or the typical process temperature.  For dispersion modeling purposes, this temperature was 111\u00b0F, the highest daily temperature in El Paso, Texas for the previous three years (January 2016 through January 2019).\r\n\r\nFor the alternative release scenario, the regulations indicate that the substances may be released at process or ambient temperature. For modeling purposes, the chlorine was released at the average ambient temperature of 69.1\u00b0F.\r\n2.3 WORST CASE ANALYSIS (\u00a768.25)\r\nThe worst case release scenario selected was the release of the entire contents of a one-ton chlorine container.  According to the EPA's Risk Management Program Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants, the worst case scenario \"need only consider the largest vessel, regardless of interconnections with pipes and other vessels.\"  The worst case analysis performed on the chlorine process indicates a vulnerable zone radius of 2.5 miles (Appendix B) as determined by the ALOHA&reg; modeling software.  The worst case analysis was conducted in compliance with the RMP rule, as presented below.\r\n2.3.1 NUMBER OF RELEASE SCENARIO\r\nFor the Program 2 process, the EPWU-PSB analyzed and reported \"one worst case release scenario that is estimated to create the greatest distance in any direction to [a toxic endpoint] resulting from an accidental release of regulated toxic s"

The one-ton (2,000-lb) worst case release quantity selected represents the greatest amount held by a single vessel.\r\n2.3.3 WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO FOR TOXIC GASES\r\nAccording to the RMP rule, \"for regulated toxic substances that are normally gases at ambient temperature and handled as a gas or as a liquid under pressure, the owner or operator shall assume that the quantity present  in a vessel ... [will be] released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The release rate shall be assumed to be the total quantity divided by 10, unless passive mitigation systems are in place, then the mitigation factor (i.e. 55 percent) assumes the release occurs in a fully enclosed space\" (\u00a768.25(c)(1)) and EPA's Release Rates for Toxic Substances:\r\n\r\nCalculations:\r\n\t2.3.3.1\tQR= QS/10 *0.55\r\n\t2.3.3.2\tQR= 2000/10 * 0.55 = 110\r\n\t\t\tQR = Release rate (pounds per minute)\r\n\t\t\tQS = Quantity released (pounds)\r\n\t\t\t0.55 = Mitigation factor\r\n\r\nThe chlorine building at the Northeast Station is considered a passive-mitigation system since largest the vessels are stored indoors.  The mitigated release rate considered was 110 lb/min (Formula 1).\r\n2.3.4 PARAMETERS TO BE APPLIED\r\nThe parameters used to determine the distance to the toxic endpoints is discussed in Section 2.2.

The alternative release analysis performed on the chlorine process indicates a vulnerable zone radius of 13 yards (39 feet) (Appendix B). The ALOHA&reg; modeling software determined this radius after the appropriate parameter values were applied.  The alternative release analysis was conducted in compliance with the RMP rules, as presented below.\r\n2.4.1 NUMBERS OF SCENARIOS\r\nThe RMP rule requires at least one alternative release scenario be identified and analyzed for each regulated toxic substance held in a covered process (\u00a768.28(a)).

The contents of this section are summarized in the Safety Information Summary Sheet located in Appendix F.\r\n\r\n4.2.1 GENERAL SAFETY INFORMATION\r\nChlorine is a toxic gas stored as a liquid under pressure.  Chlorine is irritating and corrosive to the eyes, skin, and respiratory tract and reacts violently with easily oxidized materials. Considering that the boiling point for chlorine is -29.4\u00b0 F, contact with evaporating chlorine or equipment releasing flashing chlorine can cause frostbite burns.  Chlorine gas is heavier than air and will tend to travel along the ground and fill low spaces and pits displacing air.\r\n4.2.1.1 SAFETY DATA SHEETS\r\nA Safety Data Sheet (SDS) for the chlorine process at the facility is included in Appendix G.  Per the RMP rule, the SDS meets the requirements of the OSHA Hazard Communication Standard (HCS) 29 CFR 1910.1200(9).\r\n4.2.1.2 MAXIMUM INTENDED INVENTORY\r\nThe maximum intended inventory of chlorine at this facility is 4,000 pounds stored in two (2) one-ton chlorine containers. \r\n\r\nTable 4-1: Maximum Intended Inventory\r\nChemical Name\tMaximum Intended Inventory (pounds)\r\nChlorine\t4,000\r\n4.2.1.3 SAFE OPERATING LEVELS\r\nStorage containers are designed for storage at the upper and lower extremes of ambient temperature in normal use and for the pressures that can develop at those temperatures (with additional safety factors).  One-ton containers of chlorine are designed to withstand pressures of at least 330 psig that can develop at a temperature of 165\u00b0 F, the point at which the fusible plugs melt to relieve pressure in the event of a fire.  Temperatures may drop if chlorine gas is withdrawn to approaching the boiling point of-29.4\u00b0 F, but are usually higher due to heat transfer from the surrounding air.\r\n\r\nDesign maximum flows are generally defined by the capacity of the chlorine flow regulating devices.
