FACILITY POLICY\n\nThe management and employees of Farmer's Cooperative Association are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepareto work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. FACILITY INFORMATION\n       \nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage of fertilizers for sale to farmers.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application for crop production nutrients.\n\nThe maximum quantity stored or handled in available storage would be 513,698 pounds in permanent storage tanks and rolling stock.\n\n3. THE WORST-CASE and ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\n   a. The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released  would be the volume of the largest storagtank at 85% capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) and possible public anenvironmental receptors within the area are available to our LEPC (Local \nEmergency Planning Committee) to assist in their planning.\n\n    b. The alternative release scenario based on the most likely potential incident is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The \ndistance to end point and possible receptors are are also available  LEPC.\n\n4. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM.\n\n   The faciity has implemented key provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and  Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR \n1910.111, \"Storage and handling of anydrous ammonia\".

FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n   There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the \npast five years that:\n\n   a.  have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor\n\n   b.  to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, \nevacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6. EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n    The facility has:\n\n     a. a written Emergency Action Plan, in accordance with OSHA Standard, 29 CFR 1910.38.\n\n     b. provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\n7. PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n   Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendationfor implementation at this time."
