SPS takes an active role in preventing accidental releases at all of its facilities by ensuring that its employees are properly trained in the safe operation of covered processes and the safe handling of treatment chemicals.  As for emergency response, SPS has established and maintained procedures for emergency notification and response.  These are reviewed with employees on a periodic basis and revised to accommodate changes in staffing when they occur.\n\nSPS management understands its duty to provide a safe working environment and to take measures to prevent accidents that may have an effect on the surrounding community.  This understanding is reflected in procedures described and referenced in the RMP manual.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\nMaddox Station is a natural gas-burning electric generating station.  The regulated substance handled at this facility is chlorine.  The chlorine is used for cooling water biocidal control and is stored in one-ton containers with a maximum intended inventory of 2 containers on site.\n\nPrevention Steps for Chlorine System\nThe prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps are described in detail in the Maddox Station Chlorine System PSM/RMP manual.  The prevention programs include the following elements:\n? Employee participation, which includes provisions for active participation by plant employees in the development and implementation of the plant PSM/RMP programs, as well as ready access to program information\n? Process safety information, which has been collated into the PSM/RMP manuals located in the Maddox Station Facility"

Trade secrets provisions allowing contractors and employees or their representatives access to system information\n\nAccident History\nWithin the five-year period prior to the submittal of this RMP, there were no accidental releases of chlorine meeting the requirements of 40 CFR 68.42.\n\nEmergency Response Program\nThis facility has established and maintains an emergency response program that is coordinated with local response agencies and includes emergency response by an on-site response team backed up by the Hobbs Fire Department.  The program is described in detail in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the PSM/RMP compliance manual and meets the requirement of 40 CFR 68.95.  The goals of the program are to protect onsite employees from the hazardous effects of chemical releases and to minimize the effects of releases on the general public.  The program is routinely reviewed and updated to reflect personnel and regulatory changes.\n\nPlanned Changes for Improved Safety\nIdeas for changes to improve safety are actively sought from employees.  Employee safety meetings that focus on chemical safety issues are held regularly at this facility.  Employees are encouraged and trained to recognize hazards and present ideas to eliminate them or to minimize the potential consequences of those hazards.\n\nDuring the development of the Maddox Station PSM/RMP program, process hazard analyses were conducted with key employees to meet the prevention program requirements.  During these sessions, recommendations were made for the purpose of improving safety and preventing accidental chemical releases.  Each recommendation has been or will be considered for implementation.  Though not all recommendations may be implemented, all will be considered.  The exercise has provided all affected employees with a heigh"
