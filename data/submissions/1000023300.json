      "SummaryText": "Kings River Conservation District (KRCD) has a nominal 97 megawatt, natural gas-fired, simple cycle peaking power plant in Fresno County, California. The Facility is located on approximately 9.5 acres south of the City of Fresno near the community of Malaga. The site address is 2611 E. North Avenue, Fresno, California, 93725. The Facility used aqueous ammonia (29.4 percent concentration), a regulated substance subject to the RMP and CalARP regulations.  The quantity of the regulated substance stored on site (12,000 gallons ammonia, or approximately 22,000 pounds as ammonia) exceeds the CalARP threshold quantity (TQ) of 500 pounds and the RMP TQ of 10,000 pounds.\nThe facility was previously subject to Program Level 1.  However, due to encroachment of commercial buildings within previous open spaces adjacent the KRCD facility, the facility is now subject to Program Level 2 for RMP and CalARP. The Level 1 RMP was previously submitted to the Fresno County Environmental Health Department (the Administering Agency). This submittal constitutes a 5-year update to the RMP.  The updated RMP plan meets the requirements for a Level 2 RMP and CalARP plan, including coordination of the emergency response procedures with the Administering Agency.  There has not been a release of ammonia from the facility that impacted an off-site receptor within the previous five years.\nThe following activities were conducted in support of the RMP Update, in accordance with Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) RMP guidance for updates:\n\u00c2\u00bf\tThe facility maintains up-to-date safety information related to its ammonia process equipment.\n\u00c2\u00bf\tA hazard review for the facility was conducted on May 5, 2011.  The What-If/HazOp approach was used to conduct the hazard review by a qualified team knowledgeable of the ammonia process at the facility.\n\u00c2\u00bf\tThe OCA was conducted using guidance contained in the EPA OCA Program Guidance document.

Residential and commercial receptors are within the impact radius of the worst-case release but no other public receptors would be affected by the worst-case release.  \n\u00c2\u00bf\tAs the facility is located in California, a seismic review of the ammonia system was conducted as part of the hazards review.  The evaluation found that the structural integrity of these systems met design standards in place at the time of construction and meet current CalARP seismic review criteria.\n\u00c2\u00bf\tKRCD has prepared comprehensive operating and maintenance procedures for the ammonia system that provide clear instructions for the safe performance of operations and maintenance involving its ammonia system.\n\u00c2\u00bf\tKRCD has prepared an incident investigation procedure to investigate each serious incident that may occur involving its ammonia system within 48 hours of occurrence of the incident.  The goals of the procedure are to identify the root causes of any incident and to implement modifications to its ammonia system to prevent future and similar incidents from occurring in the future.\n\u00c2\u00bf\tA compliance audit was conducted satisfying the requirement for a compliance audit every three years."
