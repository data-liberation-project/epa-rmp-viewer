INDIAN ORCHARD PLANT\n\n\n\n2015 RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN RESUBMITTAL\n\n\n\nThis resubmittal has been prepared to renew the Risk Management Plan (RMP) for the Solutia Inc. Indian Orchard Plant. This renewal updates the RMP to reflect the following changes:\n\n- Removal of the Adhesives process unit.  This process unit was physically shut down as of October 1, 2014 and no longer presents a worst-case toxics (vinyl acetate monomer [VAM]) release scenario nor will it be included in a Level 3 Prevention Program.\n\n- As a result of removal of the Adhesives unit, the Building 89 Warehouse no longer handles VAM-containing materials and as a result, is no longer covered under our RMP.\n\n- Update of the worst-case and alternative toxics release scenario to reflect operations in South Butvar.  The bulk VAM tank is now considered part of South Butvar for this analysis.\n\n- As corrected in June, within 30 days of his departure, John Weiss is no longer the Person Responsible for RMP implementation or the Emergency Contact.\n\n- Updates to all relevant process-related dates for safety inspections, Process Hazard Analyses (PHAs), etc.\n\n\n\nSolutia Inc. (Solutia) is a wholly owned subsidiary of Eastman Chemical Company (based in Kingsport, TN), but still maintains a corporate structure in St. Louis, MO.\n\n\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n\n\nAt Solutia's Indian Orchard Plant, we are committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes, especially those using federally-regulated hazardous substances, in a safe and responsible manner. We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs, process safety management systems, and emergency response planning to help ensure the safety and health of our employees, the public, and the environment. This Executive Summary provides an overview of the comprehensive risk management and process safety procedures and practices that we have designed and implemented at the Indian Orchard Pl"

In 1963, Monsanto acquired the Shawinigan Resins facility on the opposite side of Grochmal Avenue, creating the current site. The plant took the Indian Orchard name in 1982 and following a spin-off from Monsanto in 1997, Solutia Inc. was formed. The site includes manufacturing units producing high-value specialty products that include Saflex interlayer, and Butvar resin. The site also includes a Technology Center, complete with research laboratories and pilot plant facilities, finished product warehouse buildings, wastewater collection and neutralization facilities, a powerhouse, analytical laboratories, and office buildings. In addition, Ineos Melamines, and MassPower each own and operate facilities within the borders of the Indian Orchard site. Soca USA, leases a former warehouse building from Solutia to house a small recycling process they own and operate at the site as well. The Adhesives Department that was owned by Cytec Industries, Inc. (but operated and maintained by Solutia employees), was permanently shut down by October 1, 2014.  As a result, the processes related to the Adhesives department have been removed from this RMP.  The entire plant occupies approximately 250 acres and Solutia currently empl"

Additional employees for Ineos Melamines, MassPower, Cytec Industries, and Soca USA also work at the site. \n\n\n\n\n\nREGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nIn our current production processes, we use only one chemical that the EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release; vinyl acetate monomer.\n\n\n\nVinyl acetate monomer is shipped by our suppliers as a liquid in approved railcars. Three(3) railcars, on average, are typically present at the site at any given time; however, a maximum of 5 railcars may be stored at the site to support plant operations. These railcars are unloaded into an aboveground storage tank that has a capacity of approximately 200,000 gallons and is filled to 80% capacity or 160,000 gallons. This tank is located inside a concrete containment structure designed to hold the entire contents of the tank in the event of an accidental release. The plant's South Butvar Department utilizes vinyl acetate as a key raw material in the production of polyvinyl butyral (PVB) resin. This resin is the primary ingredient in the manufacture of a plastic sheet (interlayer) that is \"sandwiched\" in laminated safety glass for automotive and architectural applications. A significantly smaller \"Day Tank\" of approximately 5,000 gallons capacity, is utilized to support daily production needs.\n\n\n\nOur accidental release prevention programs, process safety management systems, and contingency planning efforts help us effectively manage the potential hazards that are posed to our employees, the public, and the environment by our use of vinyl acetate and all other chemicals at the site.\n\n\n\n\n\nWORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\n\n\n- Worst-Case:  South Butvar - Release of full contents of a rail car of Vinyl acetate (195,000 pounds), which had been in the sun, heating the VAM to 80F.  Released at rate of 4,510"

Released at rate of ~1,600 pounds per minute for a duration of ~45 minutes.  Distance to endpoint is 0.7 miles.\n\n\n\nMore information on these releases is available in the submitted RMP scenarios.\n\n\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nSolutia employs a systematic and proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals at the Indian Orchard Plant. Our process safety management and risk management systems include each of the key components of a successful prevention program including:\n\n- Development and maintenance of process safety information.\n\n- Completion and revalidation of process hazards analysis (PHA) studies.\n\n- Development, review, and use of written operating procedures.\n\n- Development and administration of employee training programs.\n\n- Mechanical integrity programs for the inspection, testing, preventive maintenance, and repair of plant equipment.\n\n- Management of change procedures to evaluate, approve, and communicate new or modified equipment, process conditions, raw materials, etc.\n\n- Execution of pre-startup safety reviews.\n\n- Completion of program compliance audits evaluating all elements of our programs.\n\n- Incident investigations for injuries, spills, fires, and near miss events.\n\n- Employee participation in all elements of our process safety and risk management prevention programs.\n\n- Implementation of hot work permitting requirements.\n\n- Evaluation, qualification, and management of contractors utilized at the site.\n\n- Additional identification of potential environmental and safety risks, reviewed annually, via the American Chemistry Council's Responsible Care&reg; 14001 (RC 14001) program.\n\n\n\nAs part of "
