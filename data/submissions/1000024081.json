LLC - Arapaho Gas Plant\r\n\r\nThis summary provides a brief description of the MarkWest Western Oklahoma Gas Co. L.L.C. (MarkWest) Risk Management Plan (RMP) for the Arapaho Gas Plant in Custer County, Oklahoma.\r\n\r\n1.\tAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nMarkWest is committed to the safety of its employees and the public.  MarkWest utilized generally accepted and recognized engineering practices, codes and standards in the design and construction of the Arapaho Plant. Safe work practices have been established and written in a formal Safety & Environmental Policy Manual.  A site specific Emergency Plan has been prepared which is tailored to the facility and the resources available in the community.  Operating manuals and drawings are current for the plant.\r\nMarkWest has a training program in place for employees assigned to the facility to ensure they can operate the plant safely during normal operations as well as during an emergency situation.\r\n\r\n2.\tDescription of Arapaho Plant and the Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nThe Arapaho Plant is located 9 miles North of Butler, Oklahoma in Custer County.  Its primary activity is the extraction of natural gas liquids (NGL) from a natural gas stream through the operation of a cryogenic expander unit.  Other processes at the site include compression, dehydration, and product CO2 removal to meet specifications for sales.  Regulated substances at the facility are a flammable mixture of NGL which is separated from the natural gas stream, and propane used in the refrigeration process. All NGL product is transported from the plant by truck.\r\n\r\n3.\tThe Worst Case and Alternative Case Release Scenario \r\n\r\nThe Arapaho Plant is a Program 1 facility.  The largest tank that holds a regulated substance is a 14,500 gallon product surge tank storing mixed natural gas liquids, also known as Y-Grade.  A release from this tank is consid"

      "SummaryText": "ered to be the worst-case release scenario. Modeling a release from this vessel in RMP*Comp model provides a worst-case endpoint of 0.3 miles. The nearest endpoint receptor is approximately 1 mile away from the plant.  Using this analysis and the attached calculation sheet with the RMP*Comp model it is shown that worst-case endpoint is 0.3 miles; therefore, there is no scenario that could reach an offsite endpoint.  With this information and according to 40 CFR 68.28(b)(ii) there was no alternative scenario considered.  \r\n\r\n4.\tFive Year Accident History\r\n\r\nThere have been no accidental releases in the last 5 years.\r\n\r\n5.\tEmergency Response Program\r\n\r\nMarkWest has an Emergency Response Plan that is site specific to the Arapaho Plant.  The plan describes response procedures to minimize hazards to the public and environment in the event of a regulated substance release.  Also included in the Plan is a facility plot plan, chemical inventory, procedures for first aid and medical treatment, evacuation, control and containment of a release, and notification to local emergency response agencies.\r\n\r\nEmergency drills are conducted periodically within MarkWest's Western Oklahoma System to provide personnel with experience in responding to simulated emergencies.  Drill scenarios vary so that personnel obtain training on a broad range of possible emergency situations.  These drills are conducted periodically, but at least annually.\r\n\r\n6.\tPlanned Changes to Improve Safety  \r\nMarkWest has an ongoing program to monitor the safety of the Arapaho Plant.  A safety hazard reporting program is in place that provides all employees with a mechanism to submit hazards identified.  Reports are reviewed to determine an effective method of resolution and a formal tracking system is in place to follow up to ensure the hazard is resolved in a timely manner.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the safety hazard reporting system, a formal facility inspection program is in place that requires scheduled inspections b"

Deficiencies and recommendations resulting from these inspections are documented and tracked to ensure they are addressed in a timely manner.\r\nImprovements are also made as a result from programs mentioned above such as incident investigations, and mechanical integrity maintenance checks.\r\n\r\n7.      Conclusion\r\nMarkWest Western Oklahoma, L.L.C. has taken all necessary measures required by EPA and OSHA regulations to ensure the continued safe operations of the MarkWest Arapaho Gas Plant.  This risk management program illustrates MarkWest's commitment to employee, public, and environmental safety.  In the unforeseeable event that a release does occur, MarkWest's emergency action plan combined with the assistance of the Custer LEPC provide assurance that such an event will be successfully and safely mitigated.\r\n\r\n8. Determination of Quantities\r\n\r\nDocumentation of calculations to determine quantity of regulated substance is available upon request."
