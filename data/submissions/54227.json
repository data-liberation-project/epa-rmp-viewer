No other accident history information had appeared in the previous version of the RMP as no other accidents had occurred in the past five years. The INDSPEC Chemical Plant is a facility reporting under Program 3 and the RMP has also been revised to include the incident investigation information in section 7. Specifically, the date of investigation and the expected date of completion of changes to reflect actions taken as a result of the accident have been revised.\n\nThe information which is included regarding the release which occurred on October 11, 2008 is based upon INDSPEC?s investigation to date and includes information on claims which have been submitted to INDSPEC.  In regard to such claims, INDSPEC has not currently undergone a complete investigation to determine the claims? validity.\n\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nThe INDSPEC Chemical Corporation facility at Petrolia, PA is a producer of industrial chemicals.  INDSPEC Chemical Corporation is a wholly owned subsidiary of Occidental Petroleum Corporation.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at the Stationary Source (? 68.155(a))\n\nINDSPEC Chemical Corporation has established a system for the safe operation of the processes at this facility that includes the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  One component of this system is a program to manage the risks of accidental releases at the Petrolia, PA facility.
