(Sierrita) is provided with a General Safety and Environmental Handbook which includes the corporate and site-specific safety and health policies. \n\nSierrita has an excellent record of safety and lost-time accidents. In 1993, 1997, 1999, and 2001, Sierrita received the most prestigious award in the mining industry, the Sentinels of Safety Award. The Sentinels of Safety Award is cosponsored by the American Mining congress and the U.S. Department of Labor's Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) for recognition of achieving one of the best records for number of employee work-hours without a lost-time injury or fatality. \n\n\n\nYOUR FACILITY AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nSierrita operates a copper and molybdenum mining and concentrating facility located approximately seven miles west of Green Valley, Arizona. Ore containing low-grade porphyry copper and molybdenum deposits is excavated, crushed, conveyed, milled and concentrated to produce copper and molybdenum concentrates. Copper concentrates are shipped to a smelter for further processing. The molybdenum sulfide concentrate contains a small percentage of copper, which cannot be effectively removed in the flotation process. The copper content in the molybdenum concentrates is lowered using a ferric chloride leach process. A hot ferric chloride solution is agitated in a series of mixing tanks with the molybdenum concentrate. The slurry exiting the tank is a high-grade molybdenum sulfide concentrate. The molybdenum sulfide concentrate is then roasted to yield molybdenum trioxide which is packaged for distribution. The copper leached from the process is recovered as cement copper and sent to a smelter for further processing with the copper concentrates. \n\nThe ferric chloride leach liquor is recycled and regenerated using chlorine and iron scrap.

One 90-ton railroad tank car of chlorine is connected to a manifold that distributes chlorine to the two 7,000 gallon chlorination tanks while the other is on standby. Typically, three additional back-up chlorine railcars are stored near the chlorinator area. The maximum number of railcars anticipated on-site at any one time would be seven. Each chlorine railcar provides approximately a seven-day supply of chlorine for the chlorination process. \n\n\n\nTHE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nSierrita is regulated by the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA). MSHA performs comprehensive inspections of the facility for compliance with the Federal Metal and Nonmetallic Mine Safety and Health Standards (30 CFR Parts 1-199). The role of MSHA is to enforce compliance as a means to eliminate fatal accidents, to reduce the frequency and severity of nonfatal accidents, to minimize health hazards, and to promote improved safety and health conditions in the Nation's mines. All Sierrita employees and contractors are required to receive MSHA new miner and annual refresher training including site-specific emergency evacuation procedures.\n\nSeveral mitigation devices are located in the chlorination area to prevent a chlorine release from occurring. Six chlorine sensors are located around the perimeter of the chlorinator area for identifying the presence of chlorine. The sensors are capable of detecting chlorine in concentrations equal to or greater than 1 ppm. If a release is sensed, the latching relays are de-energized and the two valves from the railcar and the automatic addition valve close. The valves are set up to fail in a closed position in the event of a power or air supply loss. In addition, all chlorine railcars are equipped with check valves, which cut off the chlorine supply if the flow rate were to increase rapidly. Sierrita maintains a chlorine rem"

If an incident involving chlorine were to occur during the unloading process, the control room operator could quickly cease the chlorine supply from the control room.  \n\nThe chlorination system is also equipped with an absorption system to prevent over-chlorination of the process, which may result in a chlorine release. The absorption system consists of a 265-gallon tank containing 25% caustic soda solution. Chlorine in excess of the process required amount is vented to the chlorination tank, where it is neutralized. The tank is emptied and recharged daily and a detailed inspection is conducted every 7 days by trained Molybdenum Operations personnel. \n\nSierrita has prepared written operating procedures, also known as \"Tasks\", in accordance with the Molybdenum Processing certified International Standards Organization (ISO) 9000 system. The procedures are written to provide clear instruction or steps for safely conducting activities associated with each covered process\n\nMonthly inspections are performed for each of the storage tanks in the chlorination area and an annual pressure test is conducted with water on each chlorination tank. The inspections are used to monitor any signs of tank deterioration, leaking and corrosion of tanks, valves and all associated piping. In addition, an annual hydrostatic leak test is performed on all chlorine lines and unloading hoses are replaced annually. \n\nSierrita conducts a hazard review at least once every five years in order to identify hazards associated with: the process and chlorine; opportunities for equipment malfunctions or human errors that could cause an accidental release; the safeguards used or needed to control the hazards or prevent equipment malfunction or human error; and any steps used or needed to detect or monitor releases.

The most recent Site Assessment was conducted in February, 2011. Every three years, Sierrita performs a compliance audit to assess compliance with the Risk Management Program. The compliance audit team consists of personnel knowledgeable in the chlorinator process and Program requirements. The most recent compliance audit was completed in December, 2011. Only minor recommendations resulted from the most recent reviews and audit and all recommended actions have been completed. \n\n\n\nTHE FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nSierrita has had no chlorine releases in the past five years requiring medical treatment other than minor first aid. As a safety precaution, Sierrita requires first aid for any and all types of chlorine releases, regardless of the extent of the release. There have been no reportable releases and no environmental impacts from chlorine releases. \n\n\n\nTHE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nSierrita developed a detailed Chlorine Emergency Response (ER) Plan which addresses general and chemical specific emergency response procedures. Sierrita offers the ER Plan to the Pima County Sherriff's Department, Pima county Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), Green Valley Fire Department, Arizona Emergency Response Commission (AZERC), and St. Mary's Hospital for local emergency response coordination. \n\nIn the event of a chlorine release, an audible alarm will sound in various facilities at the site. Evacuation routes have been developed and are posted throughout the entire Sierrita Plant site. Sierrita has several trained first responders and a Hazmat team to respond to incidents. \n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nSierrita conducted a Hazard Review in August 2011 and invited its chlorine supplier Olin Chlor Alkali Products to conduct a Site Assessment in February, 2011.
