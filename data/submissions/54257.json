      "SummaryText": "Chattem Chemicals, Inc. stores and uses ammonia on site at the Chattanooga, Tennessee facility as a chemical feedstock in quantities that exceed the threshold quantity for ammonia as defined by the Risk Management Program regulations.  Chattem Chemicals, Inc. has dilligiently developed and implemented a comprehensive Risk Management Program, assessing the hazards associated with the process, as well as implementing procedures which minimize the probability and severity of an ammonia release.\n\nWe have not had an incident in the past thirteen years involving ammonia that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place.  An OSHA Process Safety Management Program is currently implemented for the ammonia process.  Furthermore, the facility complies with the EPA's accident regulations.\n\nOur worst-case scenario is the unlikely failure of the ammonia storage tank during a time in which the maximum amount of ammonia is stored in it.  The resulting distance to the endpoint extends offsite, and public receptors are within distance of the endpoint.  Our alternative release scenario is a pipe leak.  The resulting distance to the endpoint extends offsite, and public receptors are within the distance to the endpoint.\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving the ammonia process, it is our policy to notify the Chattanooga Fire Department and the Hamilton County LEPC."
