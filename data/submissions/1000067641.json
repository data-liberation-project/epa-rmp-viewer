The facility accomplishes this by separating constituent gasses of the atmosphere, Nitrogen, Oxygen and Argon by process of distillation. The facility manufactures Hydrogen by process of catalytic reformation.  During the process of manufacturing Hydrogen, Propane is combined with steam at high temperatures, which causes a reaction releasing Hydrogen. The Propane is chemically changed, not burned.\n\nThe stationary source located at 13140 TI Blvd, Dallas, TX, includes an 18,000 gallon (single wall, vertical) propane tank.  Additional flammable gases are also found within the process.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-specific Prevention Policies and Steps\n\n\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's RMP Prevention Program 3, the OSHA PSM standard, and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.  In addition, the propane tank was designed / installed and maintained in accordance with NFPA-58 and state law.\n\n\n\nAir Liquide's TI Boulevard location utilizes the following accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the stationary source:\n\na)  Management of change to ensure the covered process is not altered without a safety review;\n\nb)  Gauges and internal piping to ensure the bulk tank contains a maximum of 85% capacity;\n\nc)    Overpressure relief valve on the top of the tank;\n\nd)    Backflow prevention on the fill line;\n\ne)  Fail-closed emergency shut-off valves (Valves are held open by propane back pressure delivered through a consumable tubing system. The tubing will burn in case of fire, isolating the tank.);\n\nf)     Liquid level rate-of-change alarm on bulk t"

Evidence of this can be seen by the various safety improvements implemented since the last RMP submission including:\n\n\n\n1.  Replacing the deaerator;  \n\n2.   Installing Carbon Monoxide (CO) analyzers and LEL monit"
