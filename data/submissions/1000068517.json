The Risk Management Program includes an Accident Prevention Program that includes Safety Information, Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Maintenance, Compliance Audits, and Incident Investigation. Equipment included under this covered process includes (1) 18,000-gallon stationary pressure vessel and ancillary pump, piping, and valves; (16) 1,450-gallon nurse tanks and (10) 1,000-gallon nurse tanks. Helena personnel perform the transfer of anhydrous ammonia from the pressure vessel to the nurse tanks in accordance with the Operating Procedures provided in the RMPr.\n\n\n\nHelena receives anhydrous ammonia by a Contractor that transports the anhydrous ammonia with a commercial tanker truck. The commercial tanker truck is temporarily parked on the Facility property while the anhydrous ammonia is transferred to the stationary pressure vessel. The transfer process from the commercial truck is performed by the commercial tanker truck operator (Contractor). Helena does not own or operate the commercial tanker truck. The Contractor is responsible to Helena for complying with relevant operation and training procedures and documentation.  At a minimum, the Contractor must (1) have in place and certify compliance with applicable and relevant DOT and OSHA regulations, (2) make available to Helena and EPA upon request any contractor-related documentation necessary to demonstrate compliance, and (3) certify that it has in place emergency shut-down procedures for ammonia unloading operations and that its OSHA and DOT programs comply with federal, state, and local regulatory requirements. Further, Helena will provide a copy of its Contingency Plan and RMPr for review upon request by the Contractor.\n\n",

Standards codified by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration at 29 CFR 1910.119 are not applicable to the operations at this facility because the facility is operated as a retail operation and is exempt from the OSHA standards.  However, the OSHA standards at 29 CFR 1910.111, Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, are applicable and are included in the Risk Management Program (RMPr) document that is implemented by this Facility.\n\n\n\nThis electronic submittal provides conservative estimates of the offsite consequences of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia from the Seymour Facility located approximately one (1) mile south of Seymour and approximately 0.1 mile east of intersection County Road S60 and East Garden Road (3310 East Garden Road).  This Facility is at a location that is remote to the Seymour Office which is located at 120 South Fourth Street, Seymour, IA 52590.  The electronic RMP summarizes the policies and procedures implemented by the Seymour Facility to minimize the likelihood of an accident.  The electronic RMP also summarizes the actions that the Seymour Facility has taken to ensure that a response to a release will be implemented in a proper and timely manner.\n\n\n\nPURPOSE FOR UPDATING RMP\n\n\n\nThis is a 5-year update.  Also, adjustments were made to the anhydrous ammonia inventory regarding nurse tanks.  These updates are reflected in both the EPA RMP Submit report and the Facility Risk Management Plan Program Document (RMPr).\n\n\n\nFACILITY\n\n\n\nThe Seymour Facility is a retail agricultural chemical facility and operates one (1) covered process that includes Storage and Handling of anhydrous ammonia.  Anhydrous ammonia is transported to the Facility via a commercial tanker truck (9,600 gallon) and then transferr"

The commercial tanker truck operator (Contractor) performs these transfer operations.  \n\n\n\nHelena stores the anhydrous ammonia in the on-site stationary storage tanks and then transfers the anhydrous ammonia from the storage tank to nurse tanks at point of retail sale to the end user (e.g. the farmer).  This Facility owns and operates (16) 1,450-gallon nurse tanks and (10) 1,000-gallon nurse tanks.  Helena performs this operation in accordance with its RMPr accident prevention program.  \n\n\n\nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\n\n\n\nWorst case and alternative case consequence analyses were completed for the one covered process that is conducted at this Facility.  The covered process includes anhydrous ammonia Storage and Handling.  \n\n\n\nThe worst case scenario release for the Retail Facility assumed that all the contents in the largest single pressure vessel were released.  For this Facility, the largest vessel is an 18,000-gallon stationary pressure vessel.  The release was modeled as if the ammonia pressure vessel was punctured on the side at the ground level. The resulting release of ammonia was modeled as a ground level horizontal jet.\n\n\n\nThe alternative (or more likely to occur) scenario was completed for the storage and handling covered process as well.  The alternative release for the Storage and Handling assumes a 0.5-minute release from a ruptured 3-inch transfer line caused by an impact from a vehicle or some other source on the liquid ammonia transfer line during a major loading or unloading operation.  Mitigation systems included in this alternative scenario included the internal valve on the commercial tanker truck; excess flow valves (liquid and vapor ports) and emergency shutoff valve (liquid) at the pressure vessel; backflow check valve on the liquid piping and emergency shutoff valve on the vapor piping at the bulkhead; and operating procedures that Helena uses to safeguard ammonia transfer operations.\n\n"

Helena has coordinated emergency response activities with its local emergency response agency and local fire department.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThere have been no on-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage; or off-site deaths, injuries, property damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place, in the past five (5) years because of the ammonia operations at the Seymour Facility.\n\n\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n\n\nThe Risk Management Plan implemented by Helena Chemical Company at the Seymour\n\nFacility complies with the requirements of the Clean Air Act, Section 112(r). The RMP will be updated as the Seymour Facility adds, deletes, or changes processes.
