It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nOur facility's primary activities encompass a Bulk terminal for rail and truck transportation and storage of LPG (Flammable Gas - UN1075).  We have 2 regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include Butane and Propane.  Butane is delivered to customers (refiners) for Gasoline Blend Stock.  Propane is delivered to customers (wholesalers) for heating fuel..\n\nThe maximum inventory of Butane that is expected to be present in this facility based on customers' process/operational  requirements is 246967672.00 lb. while Propane is expected to be present at our facility in a maximum quantity of 23488374.00 lb..\n\n3.\tThe Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), are evaluated including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario.\n\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equations.

The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nBath Petroleum Storage Inc. maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is What If/Check List.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of two years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  The most recent PHA/update was performed on 06/11/1999.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Bath Petroleum Storage Inc. maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\n\nBath Petroleum Storage Inc. has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.

Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\n\nWritten procedures are in place at Bath Petroleum Storage Inc. to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  The most recent review/revision of maintenance procedures was performed on 06/11/1999.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\n\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at Bath Petroleum Storage Inc..  The most recent review was performed on March 9, 1999.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nBath Petroleum Storage Inc. conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.

Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses in particular.\n\nContractors\n\nOn occasion, our company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out.  Bath Petroleum Storage Inc. has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related the contractor's work and the processes.  Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\n\n5.\tFive-year Accident History\n\nBath Petroleum Storage Inc. has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases from covered processes over the last 5 years.
