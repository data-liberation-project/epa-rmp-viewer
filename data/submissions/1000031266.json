However, the facility is not used for treatment, storage, or disposal of hazardous waste.  Therefore, the Miami Plant is presently covered under OSHAA?s Emergency Action Plan 29 CFR 1910.38(a), OSHAA?s HAZWOPER regulation 29 CFR 1910.120(q), and EPAA?s  RMP Emergency Response rule 40 CFR 68.95.  Flexible Foam has developed and implemented a written emergency response plan that complies with these regulatory requirements.\n\n\n\n    The Miami Plant Emergency Response Program (ERP) has the following features:\n\n\n\n    *    Development of the Emergency Action Plan (EAP).  Miami Plant and Corporate personnel developed and maintain a plan that defines Flexible Foam employee actions during various types of emergencies.  The plan is reviewed periodically and amended to keep it current.\n\n\n\n    *    EAP content - The EAP and associated procedures are directed at handling: \n\n\n\n        (1)    small chemical releases, \n\n        (2)    small incipient fires that can be easily extinguished, \n\n        (3)    personnel injuries and illnesses requiring first aid or emergency medical treatment, \n\n        (4)    weather-related emergencies\n\n\n\n        For major fires, large hazardous chemical releases, and/or explosions, the EAP addresses: \n\n\n\n        (1)    rapid assessment of the emergency,\n\n        (2)    notification of the public and appropriate offsite emergency response agencies, \n\n        (3)    containment of a fire or release from a safe distance, \n\n        (4)    employee and/or public evacuation, and \n\n        (5)    site security and control\n\n\n\n \n\n        The EAP also addresses the use of emergency response equipment as well as the inspection, testing, and maintenance of such equipment.

Employees, the local emergency planning committee, and emergency responders are informed of any changes in the EAP resulting from the review\n\n\n\n    *    Emergency Response Training - The Miami Plant ensures that all employees are trained in HAZWOPER and applicable EAP procedures.  Selected operations and maintenance employees receive first responder operations level training and Miami Plant management receives on-scene incident commander training that meets the regulatory training requirements of HAZWOPER 29 CFR 1910.120(q), and EAP 29 CFR 1910.38(a).  Both groups receive annual refresher training that is coordinated using a site-specific Incident Command System (ICS).

Employees and contract employees are retrained when the EAP changes, prior to implementation of the changes\n\n\n\n    *    Emergency drills - The Miami Plant has offered to conduct emergency drills in conjunction with offsite emergency response agencies to help ensure that employees, contractors, and the public will react appropriately to true emergency situations.

The RMP Coordinator updates and distributes this program description and coordinates the activities involved in this program with those of other RMP programs at the Miami Plant.\n\n\n\n    The following sections of this chapter describe the EAP Program in detail.  For each activity, the roles of key organizations and/or staff members are described.  These responsibilities are summarized in Appendix 8A.
