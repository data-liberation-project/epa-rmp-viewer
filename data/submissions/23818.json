      "SummaryText": "The Burris Refrigerated Logistics facility in New Castle, Delaware provides logistics services, including storage and distribution of packaged perishable goods, for customers throughout the East Coast of the USA.  We are proud of our safety record and take stringent precautions to ensure that our operations are designed and activities are performed so that we can minimize hazards and control risks in our workplace.\n\nTo prevent damage to materials being stored, we need to maintain appropriate temperatures in parts of our facility.  To accomplish this, we operate a refrigeration system, using anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant.  The system we operate is a commonly used, standard refrigeration system.  Anhydrous ammonia, the refrigerant in this system, is regulated under 40CFR part 68 and we recognize that a release of this substance could present a hazard to the public and environment near our facility.  Therefore, we follow special practices for controlling hazards and managing risks within this process to ensure such a release does not occur.  As a testimony to the effectiveness of these practices, there has not been a reportable release of any hazardous substance from our facility since we began operation in 1999.\n\nOur approach for controlling potential risks from a release of ammonia includes:\n- Continually assessing hazards so we can minimize risks inherent in our operation.\n- Following recognized good engineering practices and codes for designing, installing and operating our refrigeration system.\n- Using release prevention practices that have been recognized as effective by federal and sate experts\n- Maintaining contingency plans for responding to any emergency that may occur and coordinating these plans with local response agencies.\n\nIn assessing the hazards of our refrigeration process, we use EPA-approved methods to determine that the worst-case release would be represented by a release of approximately 9,000 lbs. of anhydrous ammonia from the Receiver locat"

      "SummaryText": "ed inside our buildings.  Although very unlikely to occur, we have determined, using EPA-approved techniques, that such a release could affect a portion of a circular area of 1.2 miles surrounding our site.  Portions of this circle include residences, schools, and neighboring commercial and industrial sites and a total population of 7,900 people (1990 US Census).  There would be no environmental impacts from such a release.  This distance is reduced to about ? mile, and no population would be affected, for an alternative release under normal operating conditions.\n\nOur release prevention program focuses on preventing hazardous releases of anhydrous ammonia.  We use equipment and follow management practices that are consistent with recognized good engineering practices and meet OSHA regulations, ASME and ASTM specifications and other national standards.  The Refrigeration Process we used is a completely closed system so an escape of ammonia is very unlikely.  If such a release were to occur, however, monitoring devices would immediately alert us so that quick action can be taken to minimize the impact.  These and other activities are part of our Emergency Contingency Plan that is coordinated with the Goodwill Fire Company and New Castle County LEPC.\n\nIt is our policy to continually seek new and better ways to operate and continually improve the safety of our operations.  To do this management frequently reviews our practices to ensure we have effective safety and release prevention equipment and procedures in place.  As part of our continual improvement effort, we intend to update our release prevention procedures and our Emergency Response Plan and upgrade our mechanical integrity program over the next few months, so that we can ensure continuing leadership in our environmental, health and safety practices"
