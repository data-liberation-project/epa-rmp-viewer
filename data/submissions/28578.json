Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nWe at Thrifty Ice Cream, Division of Rite Aid Corporation are committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by Thrifty Ice Cream comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is Thrifty Ice Cream policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if a release should occur, Thrifty Ice Cream trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of a release.  We are also coordinated with the County of Los Angeles Fire Department, Health Hazardous Materials Division serving the City of El Monte Area, which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nThrift Ice Cream's primary activities encompass production of ice cream and frozen desert products.  We have one regulated substance present at Thrifty Ice Cream's facility; ammonia (anhydrous) used as a refrigerant.  The maximum inventory ammonia (anhydrous) is 25,000 pounds and is contained within a single refrigeration system serving the various production and process areas within the Thrifty Ice Cream, El Monte Ice Cream Plant.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.    The Worst-Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario, including administrative controls and mitigating measures.\n\n\n\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for Thrifty Ice Cream's facility, we have used the EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equations.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\n\n\nThe worst-case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 tox"

In this scenario 18,500 pounds of ammonia are released from the liquid ammonia receiver at the Ice Cream Plant, within a secure area of the facility.  The liquid ammonia released inside an enclosed building is assumed to have formed a pool.  The pool is estimated to have evaporated over a 10-minute period (1,850 pounds/minute) and passive mitigating measures as prescribed and recommended by the EPA have been assumed.  \n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario for ammonia involves a hypothetical release from ammonia piping at a raw materials storage silo.  The scenario involves the release of 100 pounds of ammonia from a failed pipe fitting at one of the storage silos, which is located outdoors within a secure area.  The release is assumed to be controlled by emergency shutdown systems, monitoring and manual shutdown.  System operational and emergency response personnel estimate the release to occur over a 10-minute period (10 pounds per minute) prior to the implementation of control measures.\n\n\n\n4.    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical - Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nThe Thrifty Ice Cream facility has taken the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release and prevention requirement set out under 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA. This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with Uniform Building Code.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at the Thrift Ice Cream stationary source.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThrifty Ice Cream maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nThrifty Ice Cream conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with Thrifty Ice Cream processes are identified and controlled "

      "SummaryText": "efficiently.  The methodology known as a Hazards and Operability Study (HAZOP) is used to carry out the process hazard analysis.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval or with major system component changes or additions.  Findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  The most recent PHA/update was performed on December 1, 2001.  No significant changes or additions to the Ammonia Refrigeration System have taken place since the above referenced analyses.  \n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within Thrifty Ice Cream covered processes, Thrifty Ice Cream maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\nThrifty Ice Cream has a training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every three years and more frequently as required or needed.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThrifty Ice Cream performs and documents maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\n\n"

The most recent review/revision of maintenance procedures was performed on 2003, January - February.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\n\n\nPre-startup Reviews\n\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at Thrifty Ice Cream and are coordinated with the management of change element of the safety program.  The most recent review was performed in 2003, March.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nThrifty Ice Cream conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  The most recent compliance audit was conducted in 2003, March.  These audits are carried out at least every three years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and timely manner.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nThrifty Ice Cream investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of five years.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nThrifty Ice Cream believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In add"

Five-year Accident History\n\n\n\nThrifty Ice Cream has an improving record of preventing accidental releases over the last five years.  During that period, accidental release of ammonia has occurred: subsequent to the referenced release, corrective measures were implemented and changes in staffing that adopted a 24-hour-seven day operating personnel policy have resulted in no succeeding release of ammonia.\n\n\n\n6.    Emergency Response Plan\n\n\n\nThrifty Ice Cream maintains a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes emergency response procedures including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.\n\n\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, Thrifty Ice Cream emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect changes taking place within Thrifty Ice Cream processes that would require a modified emergency response.\n\n\n\n7.
