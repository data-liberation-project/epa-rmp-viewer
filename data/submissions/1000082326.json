LCLA has identified potential release scenarios and taken care to develop operating procedures to monitor and address potential releases as well as defined emergency response plans in the event that an incident occurs.\r\n\r\nLCLA manufactures MEG using ethylene as a feedstock.  The process generates ethylene oxide and a methane ballast gas as intermediates in the process.  The regulated substances handled above the reporting threshold include ethylene oxide, ethylene, and methane.\r\n\r\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps are addressed in LCLA's programs and procedures.  The LCLA prevention program includes site procedures related to mechanical integrity, employee participation, hot-work permitting, and contractor management.  Operating procedures have been developed and management of change procedures track changes that may affect any process safety information, process hazard analysis, and / or operating procedures.  A pre-startup safety review is also conducted per the site procedure to ensure the site processes are adhered to and employees and / or contractors are trained on the process they will come in contact with.  LCLA has site procedures to address routine compliance audits and evaluations against site procedures and will conduct third-party audits every three years, as required.   In the event an incident does occur, a site incident investigation procedure is utilized to look at the root cause of the incident and develop corrective actions to be implemented to prevent the reoccurrence of a related incident.\r\n\r\nAs the facility is a newly constructed unit, LCL"

LCLA has also participated in mock training drills utilizing National Incident Management System (NIMS) training to ensure that site personnel are trained on the activation of site incident command structure and function.\r\n\r\nLCLA has planned changes to improve safety which include the implementation and use of an Electronic Training System.  Also, LCLA is in the process of developing and implementing a state of the art computerized system to track pre-startup safety reviews, management of change, process safety information, and mechanical integrity."
