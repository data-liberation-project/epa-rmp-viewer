Facility Policy\nThe owners, management and employees of U.S.Ag services are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, Jackson County LEPC,and/or other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Infomation\nThe primary activity at the facility is the distribution of products to farmers.The fertilizer product, anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application as a nutrient for crop production. Anhydrous ammonia is stored in tanks designed for this purpose.\n\n3. Worst-case Scenario and the Alternate Release Scenario\nAn analysis of the potential off-site consequences of hypothetical worst-case and alternative-case accidental releases have been addressed in our Hazard Assessment and information is in our Risk Management Program.\n\n\n4.  Accidental Release Prevention Program\nThe facility is in compliance with the provisions of  the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia\" and our state regulations covering anhydrous ammonia.  The OSHA standard is referenced in this RMP Registration Form, see Section 8.3 (b).\n\n5. Five Year Accident History.\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia  in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries or significant property damage at the facility, nor to our knowledge, has THERE BEEN ANY ACCIDENTAL RELEASES  resulting in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6.  Emergency Action Plan\nThe facility has:\na.  A written action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38;  \nb.
