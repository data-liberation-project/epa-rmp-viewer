ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES:\n\nThe Cryovac Food Packaging Plant at Indianapolis has implemented an accidental release prevention policy, which integrates containment technologies, redundant safety systems, operational procedures, and management practices.  All Applicable procedures of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) are adhered to.  The Cryovac Emergency Response Policy involves side specific plans, which are detailed in the Emergency Operations Manual (EOM).  This includes a trained on site, around the clock Emergency Response Team, and procedures to notify the local fire authority.\n\n2.  THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE HANDLED:\n\nCryovac Food Packaging manufactures plastic foam packaging used in the food industry.  The plant uses pentane as a blowing agent to make plastic foam.  This is the only regulated substance in threshold quantities at this location.  Pentane (CAS 109-66-0) is a flammable aliphatic hydrocarbon similar to gasoline.  Pentane is used and stored as a liquid, but is released (slowly out gassed) from the product during the manufacturing process.\n\n3.  THE WORST AND ALTERNATIVE CASE SCENARIOS:\n    \nThe \"worst-case release\" scenario as defined by EPA assumes a rail car delivery    container completely fails, all safety systems fail, worst-case weather conditionsexist, the vapors find an ignition source and 10% of release explodes.  The endpoint is at 1 psi overpressure is .37 miles.  The \"alternative release\" scenario or more credible scenario is based on an analysis of potential hazards at our facility.  Maximum release is 2000 gallons form a breach of a railcar or catastrophic failure of the delivery piping.  The impact distance is based on maximum distance at which the radiant heat effects of a vapor cloud fire might have serious consequences, .06 miles or in most cases, within our property lines.  The impact distance in both cases has been derived using the EPA \"RMP Off"

Training of operators\n* PSM process- completed HAZOP review of all stages of process\n* Spill containment and 30,000 gallons capture vault for unloading areas\n* Monitored double wall tanks and piping\n* Hydrocarbon sensor safety interlock system\n* Redundant alarms for potential upset conditions\n* Preventative maintenance program\n* Check-off sheet procedures for non-routine activities such as unloading or draining of     piping.\n* Use NFPA guidelines as a minimum standard for all fire protection systems.\n\nChemical - specific prevention steps include having detection meter calibrated to pentane and plant wide training on the properties, risks, and safe use of pentane.\n\n\n5. FIVE -YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORIES:\n \nThere has been one accidental release over the past five years, and the total release was estimated at 10 pounds.  There were no injuries, property damage or offsite consequences as a result of this incident.  In place systems resulted in early detection and mitigation.\n\n\n6.  EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\n\nThe Emergency Response program incorporates an on-site Emergency Response Team fully trained and equipped for incipient fire fighting, awareness level hazmat response, confined space rescue, and first responder first aid.  Pre-plans, joint training and drills are coordinated with Pike Township Fire Department who is responsible to Marion County Hazardous Materials Planning Committee (LEPC) on a county wide mutual response. Emergency operation and response procedures are reviewed on an annual basis.\n\n      \n7.  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\n\nNumerous changes to improve safety and reduce risks have been implemented that were identified in the HAZOP review of PSM in 2000 and 2006.  Safety is an ongoing process and the highest priority at Cryovac facilities.  The monthly Management Safety Committee meeting provi"
