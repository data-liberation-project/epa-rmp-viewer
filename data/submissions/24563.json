The alternative release scenario is evaluated using the same techniques as the worst-case scenario to define the distance to the specified endpoint.\r\nUnder 40 CFR 68 Subpart B \u00a768.22(e), the RMP rule identifies surface roughness as a parameter to be used in the hazard assessment to determine the physical setting of the site, urban or rural.  Urban means there are many obstacles in the immediate area; obstacles include buildings or trees.  Rural means there are no buildings in the immediate area and the terrain is generally flat and unobstructed.\r\nDue to the presence of trees, hills, and other structures in the immediate vicinity of the Cherokee, Iowa, facility, an urban dispersion environment was assumed.\r\nAmmonia\r\nThe data provided in the document Model Risk Management Program and Plan for Ammonia Refrigeration (May 1996) was used to estimate the toxic endpoint distance for the worst-case and alternative ammonia release scenarios. The EPA's RMP Off-site Consequence Analysis Guidance (May 1996) was not used to determine the toxic endpoint since it classifies ammonia as a neutrally buoyant gas. The worst-case ammonia release would involve liquid and would come from a pressurized liquid system; the released gas should be classified as a dense gas (a result of evaporative cooling). The ammonia refrigeration document provides calculated endpoint distances for typical meteorological conditions.\r\nThe worst-case release scenario for an anhydrous ammonia release included a release of all the contents of the low-pressure accumulator in a 10-minute period (per EPA guidelines).

The results of the worst-case assessment for ammonia show that the plume must travel 0.98 miles (1.58 kilometers) before dispersing to the endpoint concentration of 200 ppm.

The results of the alternative-release scenario for an ammonia release indicates that the endpoint concentration of 200 ppm is reached at 0.3 miles (0.48 kilometers) from the release point.

The objective is to minimize the risk of a release of a hazardous material and if a release occurs, to minimize the potential impact to Continental Deli employees, the public and the environment. This objective will be accomplished by utilizing general good operating procedures, providing appropriate training to all employees, and coordinating response activities, as necessary, with the local emergency response providers.\r\nContinental Deli's management is committed to providing the resources necessary to implement this policy.\r\nFacility Description\r\nContinental Deli operates a meat processing operation at this facility. Continental Deli produces wholesale deli products including hams, canadian bacon, a variety of sausages and roast beef. Operations at the facility include smokehouses, ovens and a number of coolers and chillers. Figure 1-1 shows the facility location and Figure 1-2 shows the facility layout.\r\nOne chemical, ammonia, is utilized at the facility in sufficient quantities to be subject to the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68, RMP. Ammonia is used as a refrigerant throughout the facility.\r\nWorst-Case and Alternative-Case Release Scenarios\r\nRMP regulations require that each facility complete worst-case and alternative-case release scenarios. USEPA has defined a worst-case release as the release of the entire contents of the largest vessel that contains a regulated substance in a 10-minute period. This release rate is then evaluated using modeling techniques and/or reference tables to define the distance to a specified endpoint (concentration or overpressure). The dista"
