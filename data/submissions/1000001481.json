The primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and transferred for use as a crop production nutrient.\n\nThe maximum quantity that would be handled would be the 145,000# in our storage tanks.  \n\nThe worst-case release scenario and alternate release scenario have been removed at the request of the EPA.  First Responders will be given all important information.\n\nThis facility has implemented the provisions of Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1 and the standards of OSHA, 29 CFR 1910.111.  In addition, the Department of Agriculture inspects our plants on an annual basis.  We also meet all insurance underwriting guidelines and have annual loss control surveys, which focus on storage and operating/safety processes.  NOTE:  The Kansas Department of Ag has not yet adopted the most recent ANSI standards.  Our company recognizes the importance of staying as current as possible and we will do our best to budget the necessary time and funds to bring our facilities up to current codes.  \n\nOur firm has an excellent safety record at this location.  In the past five years we have had no reportable accidents.\n\nWe consider training to be our greatest administrative control.  We rotate our employees on a three year basis and send them to NH3 schools that we feel provide excellent training.  Employees are trained on the hazards of the chemical they are using and the possible consequences of a release.  We have implemented Standard Operating Procedures that are written down for the"
