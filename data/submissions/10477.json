No additional measures are necessary to prevent offsite impacts from accidental releases.  In the event of fire, explosion, or a release of a regulated substance from the process, entry within the distance to the specified endpoint may pose a danger to public emergency responders.  Therefore, public emergency responders should not enter this area except as arranged with the emergency contact indicated in the RMP.  The undersigned certifies that, to the best of my knowledge, information, and belief, formed after reasonable inquiry, the information submitted is true, accurate, and complete.\n\n\n_______________________________________                  _Paul Matalon__________________________\nSignature                                                                                  Print Name\n\n\n_President______________________________                   _6/2/99_______________________________ \nTitle                                                                                           Date\n\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nThis facility complies with NFPA-58 requirement for LP-Gas storage, and it is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the Miami-Dade County Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.\n\nThis facility is a plant nursery.  We use propane on the farm for winter heating of our Mist House.  This heating system consists of twelve 1,000 gallon propane tanks and the associated piping, valves, burners, and other miscellaneous equipment.\n\n"

      "SummaryText": "Our worst-case scenario is failure of one 1,000 gallon storage tank when filled to the greatest amount allowed (88% at 60F), resulting in a vapor cloud explision.  Since this facility is located in a relatively remote, unoccupied area, the worst-case scenario would not affect anyone beyond our property.\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.  The propane system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with NFPA-58 and state law.\n\nWe have never had an accident involving propane that caused deaths, injuries, property or enviromental damage, evacuations, or shelterings in place.\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving our propane system, it is our policy to notify the Miami-Dade County Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency. \n\nThere are no planned changes to improve safety."
