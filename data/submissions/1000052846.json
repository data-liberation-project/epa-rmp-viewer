      "SummaryText": "1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nGreenGate Fresh conducts inspection procedures to review refrigeration equipment prior to startup and during operations. These procedures identify potential sources of release and equipment corrections required to prevent these releases. On-site personnel and certified refrigeration contractors review the equipment as required.\n\nOn-site personnel provide initial emergency response. On-site personnel will make a preliminary assessment in the event of a release and will provide first response. First response may include emergency equipment shutdown, system isolation, or controlled operation such as pump down to prevent or reduce an off-site release. No emergency operations will be performed that are beyond the capabilities of the operators or other on-site personnel. Local fire and police departments with mutual aid response will provide emergency response for a major release event. Refrigeration contractors would also be on-call to provide emergency response.\n\nEmergency response training will be conducted yearly for current employees and as required to for new employees. Records will be kept of all training performed at the site for a minimum of five (5) years.\n\n\n\n2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nGreenGate Fresh uses anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant in their operations. \n\nThe ammonia system is used for cold storage and produce pre-cooling and water chilling. The refrigeration system at the facility is composed of both fixed and portable equipment. Fixed system includes, pressure vessels, ammonia pumps, cold room evaporative cooling coils, ammonia detection, control systems and diffusion tank. Portable systems are reciprocating and screw compressor skids, half car vacuum tubes, three high side trailers, condenser skid, and water chiller skids. High side trailers contains screw compressors, evaporative condensers and high pressure receiver. Half car vacuum tubes contain cooling co"

Main System is composed of cold rooms and fixed and portable refrigeration systems located in equipment yard. Main system is used for cold storage water chilling operations. Vacuum Tube system is composed of one high side trailer, two half car vacuum tubes and vacuum pump skids. Vacuum tube system is located at product staging and precooling yard. All of the portable systems except reciprocating compressor skid, condenser skid and water chiller skids are removed from the facility at the end of each season.\n\nThe facility operates seasonally from approximately November 15 through March 30. The facility pumps down all the ammonia in the system to the controlled high pressure receiver during the off season. All of the refrigeration system equipment except the cold room evaporators are located outdoors. The facility has no mechanical room housing the refrigeration equipment. \n\nAll compressors have safety switches that would shut down the compressors upon detection of unsafe operating conditions. All pressure vessels and compressors are protected against high-pressure situations by safety relief valves. There are ammonia detectors in the cold rooms for alarming. Facility mechanics are experienced with ammonia refrigeration and conduct daily walks and monitor the refrigeration system.\n\nThe refrigeration systems at the facility were constructed as per applicable codes and industry standards at the time of construction. The total ammonia charge of the refrigeration systems at the facility is approximately 18,000 lb. \n\n\n\nThe refrigeration systems at this facility are single-stage vapor compression cycles.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia (NH3) is a gas in its natural state and is extremely irritating to mucous membranes and lung tissue. The gas is pungent and may be suffocating as shortness of breath and labored breathing can develop if inhaled. Prolonged inha"

Repeated or prolonged contact of high concentrations of ammonia to the skin can cause frostbite, redness, pain and serious skin burn. \n\n\n\n3. General Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nGreenGate Fresh maintains a release prevention program to eliminate or minimize releases. The program includes regular inspections, monitoring equipment and logging conditions, scheduled maintenance, and operator training. Incident Investigation program is in place to analyze releases for ways to prevent a similar future release. The ammonia refrigeration system has specific safety procedures to prevent a release. Operators and mechanics are trained for safe operation and maintenance of the refrigeration system. They are also trained in emergency response procedures in the event of an ammonia release. Ammonia detectors are installed in all refrigerated rooms. Personnel will automatically be notified if any detector exceeds its set point. Monitoring is done 24 hours per day. All of the relief valves at the facility and the vacuum cooling systems are tied into an ammonia diffusion tank to prevent high-pressure releases to ambient.\n\n\n\n4. Five-Year Accident History\n\nAccording to GreenGate Fresh personnel, there has been no releases of anhydrous ammonia in the last 5 years. \n\n\n\n5. Emergency Response Program\n\nIn event of a release, the Safety Coordinator is responsible in contacting emergency responders and will be contacting emergency response agencies, schools, daycare centers, and acute care facilities that may be affected by the release. The Safety Coordinator will also be responsible for evacuation of employees if necessary and for coordination with community emergency responders if off-site evacuations are required. \n\n\n\n6. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nRecommended corrective actions to mitigate the potential for an accidental ammonia release are proposed o"

The table items are a result from recommendations made during the Process Hazard Analysis, a Code Compliance Review, and a Safety Inspection performed by a qualified person. Some corrective items in the recommendation table originate from multiple codes but are listed only once. Specific facility areas and systems categorize recommendations resulting from the Safety Inspection; some of which may repeat general Process Hazard Analysis and Code Compliance Review items. Based on the severity of the hazards identified, implementation deadlines are also recommended.\n\nAll refrigeration equipment is well maintained and operated in a safe manner by trained personnel. Operating, maintenance, training, and safety procedures will be formalized with improved written documentation.\n\n"
