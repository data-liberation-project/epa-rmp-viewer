              "Description": "Ammonia Storage and Loading (6000)\nThe Prevention Program ensures that toxic and flammable substances are safely handled and that releases are detected and mitigated.  DGC applied the concepts of a successful on-site health and safety program to potential off-site consequences and protection of the public and environment.  The Prevention Program includes the procedures and programs in place to address the twelve elements of the Risk Management Regulation.  This program integrates safety elements including design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at the Synfuels Plant.  The Synfuels Plant has complied with the chemical accidental release prevention provisions set out under Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 68 (40 CFR 68).\n\nThe main focus of the Prevention Program is reducing the likelihood of an accidental or catastrophic release.  Procedures are in place to provide well-maintained equipment and well-trained staff and contractors along with design and process control systems to reduce the likelihood of a release.\n\nOne of the most important Prevention Program elements for ammonia handling areas is mechanical integrity.  The following elements are accomplished to prevent releases:\n\n- Periodic walk-throughs in process areas to find leaks and potential failure points\n- Inspection, testing, and maintenance of piping, pressure vessels, and miscellaneous equipment on a routine schedule\n- Periodic replacement or preventive inspection and maintenance of pressure relief valves\n- Periodic inspection of process control instruments that have safety implications\n- Periodic inspection of major powered and rotating equipment for mechanical failure\n- Review of needed spare parts\n- Identification of critical process valves\n\nThe Synfuels Plant uses applicable codes, standards, recognized and generally accepted good engineering practices (RAGAGEP), and equipment history to establish an effective testing and inspection frequency.\n\nThe Synfuels Plant has a Quality Assurance Program to ensure the proper material of construction, fabrication, and inspection procedures are followed for new construction or management of changes implementation.  The Synfuels Plant has established a mechanical integrity list for equipment, piping systems, electrical/instrumentation components, relief and vent systems, and fire protection systems.\n\nThe process hazards, process controls in use, mitigation systems in use, and monitoring/detection systems in use have been reviewed for each process area handling ammonia and are documented in the PHA and summarized in the RMP.\n\nA management system with overall responsibility for developing, implementing, and integrating the Risk Management Regulation requirements including the Prevention Program has been developed.\n\nThe program has an Emergency Response Program that meets the requirements of Subpart E of the RMP requirements.\n\nDGC is committed to continually reduce risk, and programs are in place to manage the risks and provide continuous improvement.",

The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including response to and mitigation for fires, explosion, hazardous and gas releases; adequate first aid and medical treatment; evacuations; notification of local emergency response agencies and the public; as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.\n\n\n\nPotential off-site impacts are addressed through an in-place Emergency Response Plan to deal with the DGC health, safety, and environmental policies. In case of an off-site release impact, DGC is responsible for notifying residents and businesses downwind out to 4 1/2 miles from the plant. The notification will be done by using the computerized 911 out-calling system. Mercer County Emergency Services will notify residents beyond 4 1/2 miles. Notification will be made to the Mercer County Sheriff's Office, North Dakota State Emergency Commission, National Response Center, and the on-call DGC Environmental Department representatives. In case of an accidental release with a potential off-site release impact, the public will be instructed to either shelter-in-place or evacuate.\n\n\n\nDGC has a long-standing commitment to protect the safety of our employees and the p"

Employees are highly skilled and trained to safely design, construct, operate, and maintain the plant and perform their jobs. Fully trained response teams are thoroughly prepared to respond to facility accidents and other incidents. DGC employees work hard to follow all applicable safety regulations and have established strict safety programs and procedures to make the plant as safe as possible. Coordinated emergency response drills are conducted to test response equipment, procedures, and capabilities.\n\n\n\nDGC plays an active role in its Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). A primary goal of the LEPC is to protect local citizens by developing and maintaining a coordinated Emergency Response Plan and working with industry to minimize the impact of chemical hazards. Through the LEPC, citizens can obtain information about hazardous substances handled at local facilities and about emergency planning efforts designed to successfully cope with accidents if they occur. The LEPC maintains a coordinated Emergency Response Plan for the community, detailing operational procedures to be followed in the event of an accident involving hazardous materials. The plan is available for public inspection. DGC must file detailed information with local, state, and federal agencies concerning hazardous materials located on-site and emissions of hazardous materials.\n\n\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, our on-site emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced. In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response. DGC health and safety procedures ensure that emergency response facility personnel are well trained through the use of an extensive in-house and off-site training program.\n\n\n\n6.

The valves were identified using the following criteria: any valve, which if operated incorrectly alone or in conjunction with others could cause personal injury, equipment loss, a release of ammonia, or any valve that is not routinely used, and there must be refresher training before use. Critical valve labeling was completed by September 2004.\n\n\n\nBefore EPA adopted the new RMP regulation, DGC took proactive steps upon initial ownership to ensure worker safety and protection of the public and environment by implementing policies concerning health, safety, and environment. The existing DGC Emergency Response Plan was modified to conform with the requirements of Section 112(r) of the CAAA. Changes to the existing Emergency Response Plan primarily involved performing a new Hazard Assessment and putting the existing Emergency Response Program and OSHA Process Safety Management Program into Section 112(r) format. Continuous efforts are ongoing for improvements in the Chemical Release Prevention Program as illustrated by the example of the installation of new computer control systems in operating areas and the efforts in the preventive maintenance program of equipment.\n\n\n\nResponsible Care is a voluntary initiative brought forth by the United States chemical industry through the American Chemistry Council. DGC achieved its goal of becoming a certified Responsible Care Company by passing a certification audit in December 2008 and verification again in July 2009.\n\n\n\nAchieving this goal demonstrates that DGC's effective management system works to continually improve in the areas of health, safety, security, environmental performance and product stewardship as stated in the policy. The third party Responsible Care Management System recertification process was performed in 2013 with DGC being an approved Responsible Care site based on this audit.\n\n\n\nThe elements o"

      "SummaryText": "f the Process Safety Management Systems within the RMP are detailed in Section 3. As a follow-up to our Responsible Care certification, there has been a refocus and effort to upgrade and support the initiatives for process safety. For example, a contractor was hired to provide the expertise to conduct vapor cloud emission impact analysis on various processes. Current MOC training has been completed for an expanded audience of personnel in respective departments and areas. Also, the importance of PHAs is being stressed with an eye to track the follow-up to corrective actions proposed in the PHA. Another area of focus is to provide timely incident investigations with timely completion and documentation of all corrective actions associated with incident investigations. Finally, a senior PSM engineer has been hired with the sole purpose of oversight of the PSM program at DGC.\n\n\n\nDGC is committed to chemical risk management which includes eliminating or reducing hazards, preventing incidents, minimizing or containing incidents, preparing the public for possible incidents, and responding promptly to emergencies.\n\n\n\nAs part of the Risk Management Program, DGC meets with area residents every three years to discuss programs in place to protect the public. These meetings present an oportunity to share information about new activities taking place at the Synfuels Plant. DGC also views this as an opportunity to answer questions the public may have about the plant and its operations.\n\n\n\nIn addition to public meetings, DGC offers tours to local residents to help learn more about the plant. Another convenient way for the public to obtain information regarding issues of concern is through an email address posted on the www.dakotagas.com website. The email address is DGCCares@bepc.com.\n\n\n\nDGC accomplishes off-site safety by safely designing/building/modifying operating units, training workers, safely starting up and restarting operating units, safely operating the plant, inspecting/"
