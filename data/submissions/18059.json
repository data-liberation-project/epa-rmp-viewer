      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary:\n\nColorMarks, Inc. operates continuous dyeing processes of nylon carpet yarn used in the manufacturer of commercial carpet by others.  The plant has a total of 111 permanent employees.  \nThe plant has a 30,000 gallon propane storage tank, transport unloading station, single propane liquid pumping system which feeds a  direct fired propane vaporizer / Venturi type propane air-mixing standby system and a lift truck bottle fueling station.  ColorMarks, Inc. purchases natural gas on an interruptible rate basis and uses the propane-air as the alternate fuel on the process equipment which can operate only on gas.  The propane tank is located over 75 from the plant building and over 50 from the closest property line.  The vaporizer/mixer is located 75 from the tank and 75 from the plant building.  The transport unloading station is located over 15 from the tank and 75 from the vaporizer and the plant building.  The spacing of the propane system equipment meets or exceeds the requirements of NFPA 58. requirements.  The system was inspected by a professional engineer on 3/12/99.  Some minor NFPA 58 deficiences were identified and company will correct these deficiencies by 6/20/99.  The City of Williston Fire Department is prepared to be the first responder in case of an emergency.\n\nKey Elements of the Executive Summary:\n\n1.  Accidental release prevention and emergency responses at ColorMarks, Inc.;\nColorMarks, Inc.s overall approach to the prevention of accidental release is to maintain the propane system in excellent condition, inspect and operate the system regularly and to comply with all applicable NFPA 58 regulatory codes.\n\n2.  A description of ColorMarks, Inc.s operations and the regulated substance handled is presented above in the first paragraph of the Executive Summary.\n\n3.    The worst-case release and alternate release scenarios are as follows:\na.  Worse-case:  The propane tank is at the maximum fill capacity (85% of 30,000 gal. = 107,86"

RMP*Comp program predicts that the boundary of 1 PSIG pressure will reach 0.4 miles (2,110 ft.) from tank.  If this occurred, damage to public receptors could occur.  However; due to the protected location of the tank and the high level of maintenance the propane tank and system receives, the probability of this occurring is EXTREMELY LOW.  There has not been a propane explosion like this in SC.\nb.  Alternate scenario:  A propane liquid carrying pipe breaks due to physical damage and releases 100 GPM for 10 MIN., which equates to 4,230 lb. of propane.  The propane vapor cloud explodes.  RMP*Comp predicts the a 1 PSIG pressure boundary will reach 0.09 mile (475 ft.) from release.  There could be damage experienced by adjacent manufacturing plants.  The pipe system has been protected from physical damage by fencing or guards.  The probability of occurrence of the alternate scenario is very low.  This plant has not had an propane system incident since the propane system was installed in 1989.\n \n4.  The general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:  \nOn or before June 20, 1999 all NFPA 58 code deficiencies identified during hazard review conducted March 12, 1999 will be corrected.  The maintenance personnel have received training on the safe and proper operation of the propane standby system.  All lift truck drivers have received field training on the safe and proper methods of filling the propane fuel tanks for the lift trucks.  Bottles are removed from lift trucks and filled at the bottle fill station.  In the event a  minor problem arises, experienced maintenance personnel are called to correct the problem or malfunction.  In case of an emergency, the City of Williston Fire Department is called as the first responder.\n\n5.  The five-year history:\nThere has not been a hazardous release or i"
