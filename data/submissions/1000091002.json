The previous owner and operator of this RMP facility was Wilbur-Ellis Company Inc.  All previous records and facility documentation was not provided to Heinen Brothers.  Any records and documentation for Heinen Brothers began on 11/5/2020.\r\n\r\nHeinen Brothers Agra Service is a supplier of fertilizer and other inputs to farmers. Bulk anhydrous ammonia is received via transport trucks and stored for the eventual sale to farmers. This facility is subject to the Risk Management Program rule as a Program Level 2 facility.  This executive summary is our first means of communicating the risk to the public but also outlining our prevention program to further demonstrate we are a safe operator.\r\n\r\nA.\t Accidental Release Prevention & Emergency Response Policy\r\n\r\nWe are a non-responding facility.  However, we coordinate with the LEPC on an annual basis our internal Emergency Action Plan and ensure we are still currently included in the community emergency response program.  Our Emergency Action Plan provides procedures for our employees to conduct in the event of an uncontrolled release or any other RMP reportable incident.  We do our best to prevent accidental releases.  We have well trained staff, established SOP's, and active and passive mitigation measures that act as additional fail-safe design.\r\n\r\nB.\tStationary Source & Regulated Substance Handled\r\n\r\nThis stationary source consists of bulk tanks and mobile nurse tanks of anhydrous ammonia.  Exact quantities are withheld from this executive summary as a means of protection from potential malicious acts.  The facility does hold in excess of the threshold planning quantity which subjects us to the RMP rule.  The process is very simple.  We receive anhydrous ammonia by transport truck.  Store it in a bulk tank.  And then transfer it to smaller, portable nurse tanks for farm use and application into the soil for crop nutrients."

Overall implementation is the responsibility of the CEO.  This facility has developed a worse-case and an alternative-release scenario as part of our Hazard Assessment; however, it has been withheld from this Executive Summary as security-sensitive information as requested by EPA & DHS.\r\n\r\nOur Prevention program consists of 7 major parts. \r\n \r\n     1.\tSafety Information - This information outlines the overall hazards of our regulated substance, anhydrous ammonia, includes our maximum intended inventory, \r\n        safe upper & lower operating limits, provides equipment specifications, and lists any RAGAGEP we have deemed appropriate for our facility.\r\n     2.\tHazard Review - This is a systematic approach used to identify hazards associated with our process that include human error and equipment malfunction as \r\n        well as safeguards needed to prevent that from occurring.  It also includes steps needed to detect and monitor releases.\r\n     3.\tOperating Procedures - We have developed specific operating procedures for our facility.  Our employees have been trained in the appropriate procedures for \r\n        their respective duties.  These procedures include, initial startup, normal and temporary operations, normal and emergency shutdown, startup after a normal \r\n        or emergency shutdown, equipment inspections, and consequences of deviations and how to correct or avoid those deviations.\r\n     4.\tTraining - Our employees are trained at least every 3 years on the respective procedures and hazards associated with the process.  \r\n     5.\tMaintenance - We have an established maintenance schedule that is based on RAGAGEP including manufacturer's recommendations when available.  In the \r\n        instances that those are unavailable, we use prior operating experience.  We understand that inspection and"

When we do utilize contractors at our anhydrous ammonia facility, we ensure that the \r\n        contractors are trained and experienced to perform the task at hand.\r\n     6.\tCompliance Audits - At least once every 3 years, a person knowledgeable in the process conducts a compliance audit.  This is to determine if we have met our \r\n        obligations under applicable parts of 40CFR Part 68.  Any deficiencies are outlined in our compliance audits with a timeline of expected completion.  \r\n        Ideally we approach these as safety deficiencies take a higher precedence than compliance or paperwork deficiencies.\r\n     7.\tIncident Investigations - If we have any incidents, we investigate them thoroughly to determine the cause and means to prevent it from occurring again.  \r\n        This facility has had no incidents to investigate in the previous 5 years.\r\n\r\nD.\tFive Year Accident History\r\n\r\nThis facility has an excellent safety record with no deaths or serious injuries to any of its employees as a result of the RMP covered process. In addition, there have been no accidents resulting in releases of anhydrous ammonia with off-site consequences in the previous 5 years. Extensive programs and procedures are in place to maintain this record.\r\n\r\nE.\tEmergency Response Program\r\n\r\nAs mentioned above, we are a non-responding facility and have met the requirements of an Emergency Action Plan as well as coordinated efforts with our LEPC.
