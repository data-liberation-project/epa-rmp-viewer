We use a combination of accidental release prevention \nprograms and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of \nour employees and the public as well as protection of the environment.  This \ndocument provides an overview of the comprehensive risk management \nactivities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n     \n *  A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP\nregulation\n *  A summary of results from our assessment of the potential offsite\nconsequences from accidental chemical releases\n *  An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\n *  A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated\nby EPA's RMP rule\n *  An overview of our emergency response program\n *  An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent\naccidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our \nemployees, the public, and the environment\n\n     \nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\nThe Indian Orchard Plant was established by the Fiberloid Corporation in 1904 and purchased by Monsanto Company in 1938.  The company acquired an adjoining facility, the Shawinigan Resins facility, in 1963 - creating the current site.  The plant took the Indian Orchard name in 1982.  Solutia Inc. was formed in 1997 following a spin-off from Monsanto.  Today the site includes manufacturing units producing high value specialty products which include Saflex interlayer, Gelva adhesives, Butvar resin, Resimene coatings, as well as a Technical Center complete with research laboratories and pilot plant facilities.  The plant occupies 250 acres and has about 750 employees (including contractors).  In our processes, we use the following chemica"

      "SummaryText": "ls that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release:\n\nVinyl Acetate\n\nVinyl acetate is shipped in rail cars as a liquid to the Indian Orchard plant by suppliers.  An average of 4 rail cars of vinyl acetate are stored at the plant.  Solutia has strict unloading and handling procedures for the material.  The largest above ground storage tank holds 1,200,000 pounds.  Solutia\u0012s Indian Orchard Plant uses vinyl acetate to make adhesives and in the manufacturing of polyvinyl butyral, a plastic interlayer used in laminated safety glass for automotive and architectural applications.\n     \nFormaldehyde\n\nFormaldehyde in a water solution (formalin) is shipped in tank trucks to the Indian Orchard Plant. Solutia has strict unloading and handling procedures for the material.  The largest above-ground storage tank of this material holds 700,000 pounds.  Solutia\u0012s Indian Orchard Plant uses formaldehyde to make Resimene metal coatings used in automotive paints and other industrial applications. \n\nOur accidental release prevention programs and our contingency planning efforts \nhelp us effectively manage the hazards that are posed to our employees, the \npublic, and the environment by our use of these chemicals.\n\n     \nKEY OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS SCENARIOS\n     \nEPA's RMP rule requires that we provide information about the worst-case release\nscenario and alternative release scenarios for our facility.  The following\nare brief summaries of these scenarios, including information about the key \nadministrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the exposure distances \nfor each scenario:\n     \nWorst-case Release Scenario - Regulated Toxic Chemicals\n \nThe scenario selected at the Indian Orchard Plant involves vinyl acetate.  A stationary rail car storage tank of vinyl acetate holds a maximum of 210,000 pounds and would assume the entire contents of the tank is released to a flat, non-absorbing"

      "SummaryText": "surface.  No administrative controls or mitigation controls are assumed for this worst-case scenario.  The resultant plume would have offsite consequences into the greater Springfield area.\n    \nAlternative Release Scenarios - Regulated Toxic Chemicals\n\nVinyl Acetate: The alternative release scenarios developed for vinyl acetate involve a two inch hole in the bottom of a  rail car.  The leak from the rail car two inch hole would yield an off-site consequence and would be mitigated by the site\u0012s Emergency Response Team.  Another alternative release scenario considered was a leak from a pump on the large above ground storage tank.  Emergency  Response Team would be required to stop the pump and close the pump upstream valve stopping the leak.  The pump leak would yield a slight off-site consequence.\n\nFormaldehyde:  The alternative release scenario developed for the formaldehyde in water solution involves a leak from the pump on the 700,000 pounds above-ground storage tank.  Response would  require that the manufacturing department operator stops the pump and the site\u0012s emergency Response Team close off the pump upstream valve stopping the leak.  The leak would yield a slight off-site consequence. \n\n\nWe are using this information to help us ensure that our emergency response plan\nand the community emergency response plan address all reasonable contingency \ncases.\n\n     \nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n     \nWe take a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of \nhazardous chemicals.
