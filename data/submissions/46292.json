If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, County LEPC, and/or other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impact of the release to the public and the  envireonment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 2.  Facillity Information.  The primary activiity at the facility is the distribution of products to farmers.  The fertilizer product anhydrous ammonia is recived, stored and distributed for direct application as a nutrient for crop production.  Anhydrous ammonia  is stored in tanks designed for that purpose.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         3.  Accident Release Prevention Program.  The facility follows the provisions of the U. S. Occupatioanl Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) , 29 CFR 111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\" and our State Regulations covering anhydrous ammonia                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               "

There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia during the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries or significant property dmage at the facility; nor to our knowledge has there been any accidental releases resulting in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, property dmage, or environmental damage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         5.  Emergency Response Program.  The facility has an Emergency Action Plan.  We do not plan to have our employees respond to a major release.  If a large release of anhydrous ammonia takes place at our facility, the response action is to vacate the area of the release and call 911 and all applicable emergency response numbers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        6.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety.  Safety improvement is an ongoing process at this facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the the conditions of the facility.  At this time we are reviewing and updating our written prevention program."
