The Risk Management Program is to be described in an RMP that is registered with the USEPA, submitted to state and local agencies, and made available to the public.  At the Harwood's Mill facility, chlorine, which is a listed substance, is stored in a quantity greater than its threshold quantity of 2,500 pounds (lbs).\n\n\n\nThis RMP was prepared in accordance with 40 CFR Part 68, Subpart G, 68.150 - 68.190.  In accordance with 40 CFR Part 68.10(d)(2), since accidental releases of chlorine have the potential to result in an offsite impact and chlorine storage operations are subject to the Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, Program 3 requirements apply to this facility.\n\n\n\nThe Harwood's Mill facility uses chlorine in its water treatment process for disinfection and destruction of disease-producing organisms that may be present in the water.  Chlorine is stored at the Harwood's Mill facility as a liquid under pressure in one ton steel cylinders.  These cylinders are stored inside of a building.  The liquid chlorine is transferred from the cylinders to a chlorine evaporator.  Upon vaporization, the chlorine is then sent to the chlorinators which control the chlorine dosage to the specific applications.  The Harwood's Mill maximum intended inventory of chlorine is 33 cylinders. \n\n\n\nThe Harwood'"

It is the facility's policy to adhere to applicable state and federal regulations. Moreover, the facility has installed an emergency chlorine scrubber to control chlorine emissions should a leak occur.\n\n\n\nThe Harwood's Mill facility, as part of its accidental release prevention program, requires both current and newly hired operators and maintenance personnel to complete and pass the facility's Personnel Qualification Standards (PQS).  The PQS consists of training in the following subjects: operating phase, operating limits, safety and health considerations, and safety systems and their functions.  The Harwood's Mill facility also conducts equipment inspection and maintenance activities as part of the accidental release prevention program.\n\n\n\nThe Harwood's Mill facility has an existing emergency response plan that incorporates emergency response and coordination procedures for chlorine releases.  The local fire department and local emergency planning committee are included in this plan."
