Facility Accidental Release Policy\n\nThe owners, management, and employees of John Taylor Fertilizers Company, Dixon facility (herein referred to as the Facility) at 1850 North First Street, Dixon, California, 95620 are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia, and aqua ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.  A detailed emergency response plan has been developed and will be implemented in the event of an accidental release.\n\n2.  Facility Information\n\nThe primary activity at the Facility is the storage, and sale of fertilizers, in addition to, the sale of pre-packaged agricultural chemicals to farmers.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.  \n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received by truck and stored in one 21,400-gallon storage tank (bullet) at the site.  The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia handled in this process is 92,140 pounds.\n\nAqua ammonia (25% of ammonia by weight) is stored in one 25,000-gallon above ground tank at the site. The maximum quantity of aqua ammonia handled is 187,500 pounds.  The total quantity of ammonia present in the aqua ammonia, based on 25% active ingredient by weight, is  46,875 pounds.  \n\n3.  The Worst-Case Release Scenario and Alternative Release Scenario\n\nIn compliance with the 40 CFR 68 revised 2004 regulations to the Clean Air Act, the description covering the worst-case release scenario has been eliminated from the executive summary.\n\n4.  Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia and Aqua Ammonia:  The Facility has implemented the provisions of the \"Safety Requirements for Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc.; Ca"
