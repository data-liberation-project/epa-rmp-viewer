Facility Policy.\n\nThe owners, management and employees of Treynor Ag Supply are committed to the prevention of  any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If any accidental releases should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, Pottawattamie County LEPC, and/or other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information.\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage of fertilizers for the sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application as a nutrient for crop production.  The maximum quantity stored would be 340,000 pounds in storage tank and nurse tanks.\n\n3. Worst-case Scenario and Alternative Release Scenario.\n\na. The worst case scenario would be the lease of the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas over a period of 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 130,000, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 per cent capacity as limited by design standards and adminastrative controls.  The distance to the end point (point of dispersion to 200 parts per millions, or PPM) is 1.10 miles.\n\nb. The alternative release scenario, a 3-inch transfer hose is used as an alternate release scenario followed by the release of ammonia for 2 minutes before an automatic excess flow shut-down valve/valves intervenes or a remote manual shut-off is closed and stops the flow of ammonia.  The maximum quantity released would be 27,000 pounds.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200ppm) is 0.60 miles.  (The most likely potential incident, would be a release from a break in a 1-inch transfer hose release scenario followed by the release of ammonia doe 2 minutes before an automatic excess flow shut-down valve/valves intervenes or remote manual shutoff"

The distance to the endpoint (the point of dispersion to 200ppm) is .22 miles.)\n\n4. Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe facility is in compliance with the provisions of Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1, published by the AmericanNational Standards Institute, Inc. (ANSI), and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.  The ASNI standard has been adopted by reference by Iowa Administrative Code Part 21-Chapter 43-Rule 43.6(200), Standard for the storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.  The OSHA standard is referenced in this RMP Registration form, see Section 8.3(b).\n\n5. Five Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at this facility; nor to our knowledge, has there  been any accidental releases resulting in off-site deaths, injuries, property damage, or environmental damage.  \n\n6. Emergency Action Plan\n\nThe facility has:\n\na. A written action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\nb. Provided state and local authorities with the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at Treynor Ag Supply, Inc.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the conditions of the facility.  There are no additional specific safety recommendations regarding storage or use of anhydrous ammonia for implementation at this time."
