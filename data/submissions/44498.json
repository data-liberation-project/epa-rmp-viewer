Calculations by RMP Comp with Mitigation considered is that containers are in enclosed space in direct contact w/ outside air - shed w/1 side open.  \n\nThe alternative release scenario considered, is a full 2,000 pound container released through a broken 5/16 inch container valve in 133 minutes.  The distance to alternative toxic endpoint is 0.20 miles.  Calculations by RMP Comp with Mitigation considered is that containers are in enclosed space in direct contatct w/ outside air - shed w/1 side open.  \n\nThere are public receptors:  Residencies, Schools, Hospitals, Prison/ Correctional Facilities, Recreation Areas and Major commercial, office, or industial areas within the worst case toxic end point.  Therfore SS - Daniels Water Treatment Plant Program Level is Program 2. \n\nThe Program 2 Accidental Release Prevention Program is directed toward reduction of the probability of accidental releases of chlorine at this location.  The program addresses management, the adequacy of chlorination equipment and operator proficiency to eliminate or reduce such accidental chlorine releases.\n\nThe City of Siloam Spring"
