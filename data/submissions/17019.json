Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n    We at Townsends, Inc., Pittsboro facility are strongly committed to employee, public and\nenvironmental safety. This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention\nprogram in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance,\nand employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement\nappropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a\nrelease does occur, our highly trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and\nmitigate the effects of the release.\n\n2.  The Stationary Source and Regulated Substance Handled\n\n    Our facility's primary activities encompass Poultry Processing.  We have one (1) regulated\nsubstance present at our facility.  This substance is anhydrous ammonia.  The regulated substance at\nthis facility has a singular use: refrigeration.  \n\n3.  The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), \n    including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the     \n    distances for each reported scenario\n\n    To perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used RMP\nCOMP.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios:\n\n                                 Worst Case Scenario:     A failure or puncture of the high pressure receiver would release the\n                             greatest quantity of ammonia in this system.  About 9,519 pounds of\n                             ammonia would be released as a liquid which would then volatize into\n                             a vapor.   Company policy and the system layout limits the amount of\n                             ammonia in this receiver to 50% of the vessel capacity. It is assumed\n                  "
