The facility has one administration building, two main process buildings (Fab 1 and Fab 2) and several auxiliary support buildings, including water and waste water treatment facilities.  WSC operates 24 hours per day, 7 days per week, except for occasional shutdowns for preventative maintenance activities, equipment installations, etc.\n\nThe manufacture of silicon wafers entails the use of chemicals and the generation of waste, some of which may be listed as toxic or hazardous under U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations.  Currently, WSC has two above ground tanks capable of storing more than a threshold quantiy (1,000 lbs.) of Hydrofluoric Acid and a two tank liquid hydrogen system, with one tank capable of storing more than a threshold quantity (10,000 lbs.) of liquid Hydrogen.\n\nThe worst case release scenario is based on the release of the entire contents of the largest tank in the system whithin a ten minute interval.  \n\nThe HF solution would be relased into a diked area and form an evaporating pool.  The distance to the toxic end point is approximately 1500 feet.  The area impacted reaches offsite industrial receptors, a portion of US Highway 30 and a small portion of the Willamette River.  There are no residences within the impact area.  The alternative release scenario is from a leak in a transfer hose during off-loading.  The alternate release toxic end point is 40 feet and includes no off-site impacts.\n\nThe Hydrogen liquid would be released to a gravel pad and evaporate to form a flammable cloud.  The distance to the lower flash point is approximately 1300 feet. The area impacted reaches offsite industrial receptors and a portion of US Highway 30. There are no residences within the impact area.  No secondary containment is provided for a liquid release"

The alternative release scenario is a leak from a one inch liquid line flowing at a continuous 65 lbs. per minute.  The alternate release end point is 210 feet to the lower flash point and includes no off-site impacts.\n\nWSC has extensive equipment inspection, preventative maintenance, on-site emergency response teams, on-site waste treatment facilities, and training programs, spill response and contingency plans.  There have been no accidental releases or accidents in the past five years related to HF or hydrogen."
