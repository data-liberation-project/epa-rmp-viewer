      "SummaryText": "Mobile Refrigerated Services is a public cold storage facility organization located at 1000 Alabama State Docks Blvd., Mobile, Alabama 36602. The facilities primary business is the short and long term storage of food products prior to distribution. The Facility loads and unloads the food product from containers and railcars. Mobile Refrigerated only loads vessels. The refrigeration process used to maintain dock, freezer, and blast temperatures utilizes anhydrous ammonia (R717) as the refrigerant. Anhydrous ammonia is widely used as refrigerant in many industrial facilities, including meat, poultry and fish processing facilities; dairy and ice cream plants; fruit juice, vegetable juice, and soft drink processing facilities; and cold storage warehouses. The refrigerant serving as the heat transfer fluid is circulated thru a closed loop system. Mobile Refrigerated Services is committed to operating a cold storage facility under conditions that are safe to employees, contractors, tenants, and the surrounding community. The senior magagement is committed to this cause. As a result, the Safety Policy will be considered on an equal basis with productivity, efficiency, quality improvement, environmental issues and other policies developed by the Management. To satisfy this core objective, the senior management team includes a member trained to manage facility Safety and Risk Management Programs. The core of the facilities overall approach to safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system focuses on a hazard assessment program, employee and contractor training, an ongoing preventative maintenance program, and an emergency response program. We use a variety of safety equipment and strict procedures to prevent releases and to reduce the impact of releases should they ever occur. Some examples include: Hazard analysis on a timely basis; Regular checklist audits of safety programs and records; Emergency release training with employee trained first responders and the fire dep"

The EPA requires all companies to report the release of hazardous materials. Mobile Refrigerated Services has had no releases of ammonia in the last five years. While some incidents may occur, we take great pride in our safety record and make every effort to ensure that they will be small and as infrequent as possible. Employees of Mobile Refirgerated Services have been trained specific to emergency response and emergency evacuation. Emergency Response Training has been intiiated and is an on-going program. Level 1 response equipment such as leak detection, SCBA and personal protective equipment are in place and response employees have been trained and tested in the use of this equipment. The 24/7 Alabama Fire and Hazmat department is located within three miles of the facility. The Fire Chief and the local fire respnse team have inspected the facility conducting a walk thru and are prepared to properly respond to an emergency situation should one occur. Future plans for the on-going Risk Management program include routine preventative maintenance of mechanical refrigeration systems. Mobile Refirgerated also intends to continuously focus on employee development and training specific to safe operation of plant eqipment, emergency response and employee evacuation."
