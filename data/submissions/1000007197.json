The Facility Policy\n\nMFA Incorporated and the employees of the MFA Agri Service in St. Joseph are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the St. Joseph Fire Department, and other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the receiving, storage and distribution of dry, liquid fertilizers, and anhydrous ammonia for direct application as a crop nutrient.  The facility also handles liquid and dry pesticides, seed and feed.\n\nThe facility has one, 30,000-gallon storage tank and one, 18,000 gallon storage tank. The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a transport delivery rail car holding approximately 160,000 pounds. The facility has forty-four 1,000-gallon nurse tanks, and seven tank applicators for product distribution.\n\n3. The Accidental Release Prevention Program.\n\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1, 1981\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., the Missouri Anhydrous Ammonia Law, and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\". The facility will adopt changes required to meet the 1999 ANSI Code as budgets and time will allow.\n\n4. The Five-year Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that: have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, pro"
