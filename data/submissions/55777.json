Arboleda Road, Merced, California are committed to the prevention of an accidental release of Anhydrous Ammonia, Aqua Ammonia and pesticides.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility will work with the local fire department, and other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.  An emergency response plan has been developed and would be implemented in the event of a release.\n\n2. The Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe primary business at the facility is to sell fertilizers, agricultural pesticides and agronomic services to growers and ranchers.  To conduct this business, the following activities occur at the facility:\n\nA. Storage and delivery of bulk and packaged containers of fertilizers, bulk and packaged containers of agricultural chemicals and packaged seed.  All fertilizer, agricultural chemicals and seed are distributed to growers.  No mixing or formulating of agricultural chemicals occurs at the facility.\n\nB. Four agricultural pesticides stored in the Chemical Warehouse are California regulated substances.  The maximum process quantities (in pounds of active ingredient) of the regulated substances stored in the Chemical Warehouse are:  Carbofuran (1426 pounds); Dimethoate (713 pounds); Methamidophos (480 pounds) and Paraquat (634 pounds).\n\nC. Anhydrous Ammonia is received and stored at the facility.  It is distributed to growers for use as a plant nutrient.  Anhydrous Ammonia is also used, at the facility, in the manufacturing of Aqua Ammonia.  Anhydrous Ammonia is received by truck and stored in a 12,100-gallon capacity aboveground storage tank (AST).  The maximum quantity of Anhydrous Ammonia handled at the facility is 52,968 pounds.\n\nD. Aqua Ammonia (24.4% of ammonia by weight) is manufactured and s"

Aqua Ammonia is stored in two ASTs \u00bf one tank is 30,780-gallon capacity and the other is 25,380-gallon capacity.  The maximum quantity of Aqua Ammonia handled at the facility is 426,816 pounds of solution containing 104,143 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.\n\n3. Offsite Consequences Analysis\nCPS Merced has prepared a Worst-Cans and Alternative Release Scenario for the site.  Per EPA direction, they are not included in the Executive Summary, but are included in the main document.\n\n4. Accidental Release Prevention Program \n\nCPS Merced has comprehensive written programs and procedures to comply with the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program \u00bf Risk Management Plan (RMP) program regulations.  Key to getting all programs and procedures in place was (1) having the facility management understand what the CalARP RMP regulations required and (2) developing and implementing specific written programs, written procedures, and practices to meet those regulations.\n\nFacility management and employees involved in any of the covered processes have been trained and made aware of the provisions and requirements in the programs and practices.\n\nCompliance audits and general inspections by Crop Production Service corporate staff is the next key for ensuring the facility remains in compliance.\n\n5.  Five-Year Accident History \n\nIn the past five years, there have been no releases of Anhydrous Ammonia, Aqua Ammonia, or any of the four regulated substances stored in the Chemical Warehouse that have caused any deaths, injuries, or property damage at the facility nor resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6. The Emergency Response Program\n\nThe facility has an emergency response plan.  The local fire department has conducted a facility visit specifically addressing the response to releases of Anhydrous Ammonia, Aqua Ammonia, and products stored in"
