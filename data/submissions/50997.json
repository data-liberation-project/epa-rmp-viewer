The management and employees of the Clear Lake facility are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of Propylene.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to the community and the environment.\n\nThe facilities primary operation is the manufatureing, purification, and distribution of Carbon Monoxide. A support process to this operation involves the use of propylene.  Propylene is use in a refrigeration system which cools part of the carbon monoxide production process.  Propylene is received from a Propylene pipeline supply  and stored in three liquid vessels, a 1265 gallon Accumulator, a 1077 gal. Economizer vessel and a 888 gal. Heat exchanger. The system contains a maximum of 17,700 pounds of  propylene if liquid full.  The propylene is then used in a closed refrigeration system.\n\nThe worst-case scenario, based on the EPA's definition for a flammable gas release, and alternative release, or more probable, scenarios were conducted using the EPA?s RMP*Comp. (ver. 1.07) and can be reviewed by contacting the facility. The population effected was calculated using ?Landview V? which is based on the 2000 US Census.\n\nPassive and Active Mitigation systems in place that would reduce the likelihood of a release or the release itself. These include a fire deluge system, check valves, a preventive maintenance schedule, and safeties.\n\nThe facility has developed a comprehensive prevention program designed to prevent accidental releases of propylene.  The program utilizes state-of-the-art technology, sound engineering practices, administrative controls and active employee participation.

They are frequently consulted concerning the various aspects of the program and ways to continually improve the safety of the process.  \nWritten process safety information was developed for the propylene system to enable managers, supervisors, and employees to identify and understand the process hazards.  This information was utilized to develop a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) which assists management and employees in making decisions for improving safety and reducing the consequences of releases of propylene. The PHA focuses attention on equipment, instrumentation, utilities, human actions, (routine and nonroutine), and external factors that might impact the process by identifying potential failure points or failure modes in the process. The new PHA was completed in April 2006 and will be updated at least every 5 years. \n\nDetailed 0perating procedures exist which describe tasks to be performed, dates to be recorded, operating conditions to be maintained, samples to be collected, and safety and health precautions to be taken.  The procedures were reviewed/approved to ensure they are technically accurate by employees, managers and personnel with the technical expertise/knowledge of the process.  The operating procedures were review in March 2006 and are annually reviewed/revised as necessary to reflect current operations.\n\nEmployees are thoroughly trained, including maintenance and contractor employees.  The training meets and exceeds the requirements as outlined in OSHA?s hazard communication standard 29 CFR 1910.1200.  Training includes operating procedures, safe work practices, emergency procedures (including alarms), special assignments, evacuation and emergency response; safety rules and procedures; routine and nonroutine work authorization; and other pertinent process safety information.

In addition, employees receive traditional classroom instruction including lectures, videos, programmed and on-the-job instruction.  Employees are encouraged to actively participate.  The employees  are periodically evaluated to ensure they posses the necessary skills and knowledge via written tests, observation and/or oral interviews. The training program was last reviewed on March 2006.\n\nA contractor screening process has been established and is designed to ensure that contractors hired or used can accomplish their assigned tasks without compromising the safety and health of employees and the public.   The screening program involves obtaining information on the contractor's safety performance, including injury and illness rates, and experience.  In addition, the contractor's safety performance, job skills, knowledge, and certifications (such as pressure vessel welders) are also verified. The contractors safety procedures were last review in March 2006.  \n\nPreStart-up Safety Reviews (PSSR) are used for new or modified processes to improve the design and construction of the process from a reliability and quality stand point.  The PSSR recommendations are resolved before final installations are complete. Other items completed prior to initial process startup include piping and instrument diagrams, operating procedures, and ensuring operating personnel are fully trained.  The initial startup and normal operating procedures are fully evaluated as part of the PSSR to assure a safe transfer into the normal operating mode for meeting the process parameters. The last PreStart-up Safety Review was conducted in 1995.\n\nAn on-going mechanical integrity program (maintenance) is used to ensure safe process operations.

The Celenase/LInde Hazardous Work Program describes the steps that a supervisor, contractor representative or other authorized issuer needs to follow to manage hazardous work.
