The Facility Policy For Propane Storage\n\nThe owners, management, and employees of Jackson-Jennings Co-op are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of LP Gas .  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the various fire departments, or other authorities. To mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information.\n\na The primary activity at the facility is the storage  OF LP Gas for sale to farmers.\n\n\nb LP  Gas is received, stored, and distributed for both consumer and farmer use.\n\n\nc The maximum quantity stored would be 115,260 pounds in our largest  storage tanks. The largest of which is 30,000 gallons. The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a tank truck holding 9000 gallons  pounds.\n\n3. The Worst-Case Release Scenario And The Alternative Release Scenario. \n\na. The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total                contents of a storage tank  released as a gas over 10 minutes represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 80 percent capacity as limited by design standards. The distance to the endpoint  point of detontation  is .40 miles. \n\nb The alternative release scenario based on the five-year accident history is a release from a break in a transfer hose. The distance to the endpoint (point of detontation ) is .10 miles.\n\n4. The Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of NFPA 58 for Liquified Petroleum Gas Storage .and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.for general safety.\n\n\n\n \n5. The five-year Accident History \n\nOur Facility has not had any accidents that would have caused deaths, injuries, or significant properly damage at the facility; nor To our knowledge, have resulted in offside deaths, injuries"

A written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910 38;\n\nb. Provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title 111 (EPCRA).\n\nc. A written emergency response program. In accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910120, including pre-emergency planning and employee training.\n\n7. Planned Changes To Improve Safety.\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions. There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
