Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nMontana Refining Company recognizes that, because of the complexity of our operation and the hazardous substances we handle, there are potential hazards to the public and our employees.  It is for this reason we are committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent releases of hazardous substances so that the health and safety of the surrounding community and our employees is maintained.\n\nMontana Refining has employees at the refinery that are trained in emergency response to effectively respond to incidents involving hazardous substances.  Montana Refining invites local health care providers, including hospitals and ambulance services, to attend awareness seminars on some of the hazardous chemicals present at the facility, and has provided the local hospital with information on hazardous chemicals to aid in the treatment of exposures to these chemicals.  \n\nTwo company employees are members of the Cascade County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), which was provided periodic updates on the Montana Refining Company Risk Management Program development.  Montana Refining is supporting the LEPC in upgrading the current community emergency alerting system so that the public can be notified of an emergency situation, including an accidental release, in a more timely and effective manner.\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nMontana Refining Company operates a 7,000-barrel per day refinery in Great Falls, Montana that contains various processes used to refine crude oil into various grades of motor gasoline"

We have 12 substances regulated under the Risk Management Program rule present in covered processes at the facility, as follows: isobutane, butane, propane, hydrofluoric acid, isopentane, propylene, pentane, 2-Butene-trans, 1-Butene, 2-Butene-cis, 2,2-Dimethylpropane and ethane.  These substances may occur in the pure form as well as in mixtures.\n\n3.    The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\nMontana Refining Company is required to determine a worst case release scenario for both regulated toxic substances as a class and regulated flammable substances as a class that results in the greatest distance to a specified endpoint.  The worst-case release scenarios and respective release quantities are specified by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in the Risk Management Program rule, and represent incidents that are considered unlikely.\nMontana Refining must also determine an alternative release scenario for both classes of substances mentioned above.  The alternative scenarios and respective release quantities were chosen by Montana Refining to reflect more likely release scenarios for use in community emergency planning.\n\nIn all scenarios, the endpoints represent the distance from a release that the public or environment could be subject to serious impacts.  EPA Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance Reference Tables or Equations were used to perform the required offsite consequence analyses for both types of scenarios.  \n\nThe worst case scenario for toxic substances involves the release of the entire contents of a hydrofluoric acid storage vessel as a vapor cloud over a ten-minute period, with subsequent dispersal offsite.  Although systems are in place to prevent, mitigate, and control such a release, no mitigation is assumed in this scenario.  Under very stable (Class F) at"

The release is assumed to occur over a 10-minute period, as this is the estimated time it would take operators to shut down the release.  No additional mitigation is assumed.  Under neutral (Class D) atmospheric conditions and a 6.7 miles per hour (3.0 meters per second) wind speed, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint for hydrofluoric acid of 0.016 mg/L is 0.19 mile.\n\nThe worst case release scenario for flammable substances involves an instantaneous release of the entire contents of a full isobutane storage vessel as a vapor cloud, which finds an ignition source and detonates in a vapor cloud explosion.  Although systems are in place to prevent, mitigate, and control such a release, no mitigation is assumed in this scenario.  The calculated distance to the specified endpoint of one pound per square inch (1 psi) overpressure is 0.57 mile.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for flammable substances involves a release of isobutane from a storage vessel due to overfilling.  The isobutane is assumed to be released as a vapor cloud, which finds an ignition source and detonates in a vapor cloud explosion.
