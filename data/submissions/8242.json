If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, the local emergency management center, and other local authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of a release to people and the environment.\n\nFacility Information.\n\n     The primary activities at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers, storage of pesticides, and custom application, all for sale to farmer customers.\n     Anhydrous ammonia is received by tanker truck, stored and distributed to the farmer in 1000 gallon nurse tanks.\n     The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia stored would be 114,000 pounds in storage and nurse tanks.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario and the alternate release scenario.\n\n     The worst case scenario would be the release of the total contents of a 12,000 gallon storage tank of anhydrous ammonia in 10 minutes time with maximum quantity released would be 53,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the storage tank at 85% capacity as limited by design standards. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 PPM) is .84 miles.\n     The alternate release scenario is based on a most likely potential incident, which could be a release from a break in a 3 inch pipe lasting 2 minutes. the distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 PPM) is .78 miles.\n\nThe accidental release prevention program.\n\n     This facility has implemented the rules and provisions of Minnesota Code of Agency Rules. \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\", 1513.0010-1513.1100.\n\nThe five year accident history.\n\n     There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous"
