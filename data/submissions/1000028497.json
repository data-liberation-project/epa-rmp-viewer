As explained in the Executive Summary, WVC purchased this facility from Borden Chemicals and Plastics in December 2002.  The plant was idle at that time and has remained idle until November 2003.  The other process (the PVC plant) was not operational at that time, but was brought online in December 2004.\n\n\n\n-Item 7.10.a   The most recent compliance audit was conducted by OSHA beginning in March 2012.  WVC has had the following corporate audits:  three Environmental Multimedia audits (2006, 2009, and 2012) with the next scheduled for February, 2015; three PSM/RMP audits (2005, 2008 and 2011) and two Safety, Security and DOT audits (2006, 2010).  EPA conducted a multimedia audit in June 2007. LDEQ conducted a comprehensive audit in February 2011. ",

The site is approximately 22 miles southeast of Baton Rouge, Louisiana at the intersection of Louisiana Highways 73 and 30 near the rural town of Geismar, LA.  The facility began operation in 1961 under the direction of Borden Chemical, Inc. and was operated continuously until the entire plant was shut down in April 2002.  In December 2002, WVC acquired certain assets of the complex.  The plants now operated by WVC include vinyl chloride (including ethylene dichloride) and  polyvinyl chloride.  The remaining plants which included urea, urea-formaldehyde concentrate, acetylene, anhydrous ammonia, formaldehyde,  industrial gases (carbon monoxide and hydrogen), methanol, and air separation products (oxygen, nitrogen, and argon) are not owned by WVC and are not operated by WVC.\n\n\n\nThe plant uses or produces the following RMP regulated substances in quantities above the threshold quantities listed in 40 CFR 68.130:\n\n\n\nToxics:  chlorine and hydrogen chloride\n\nFlammables:  propylene and vinyl chloride\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention programs in place at WVC's Geismar facility.   Because the processes at the plant regulated by the EPA RMP regulation are also subject to the OSHA PSM standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.   \n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\n\n\nWVC employees participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.

Employees have access to all information created as part of the plant accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees are involved in the process safety management program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the plant and addresses each process safety program element. \n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\nWVC has a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Specific departments within the plant are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.  Employees have been advised of the location of the process safety information and trained in how to use the information.\n\n\n\nChemical-specific information, including information on exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\n\n\nWVC has a comprehensive program to ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled. Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify potential process safety hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.  The facility primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evalua"

This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures.  Suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures are made when the team finds such measures are necessary.\n\n\n\nTo ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, WVC will update and revalidate the hazard analysis results at least once every five years for the life of the process. The results and findings from these updates will be documented and forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution documented and retained.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nWVC maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) shutdown, and (4) initial startup of a new process.  Temporary and emergency operating procedures are developed for each case prior to commencement of the operation.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  Procedures are maintained current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.  Procedures are reviewed annually.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\n\n\nWVC has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process. New employees receive basic training in both safety issues and plant operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.

Additional contractor work force is present during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Contractors are provided both plant-wide and unit-specific training.   In addition, craftsmen must complete the eight-hour safety-training program for industrial workers provided by industry through the local safety council.  The training is maintained through annual refresher training.  \n\n\n\nIn addition to the safety training, procedures are in place to ensure that contractors perform their work in a safe manner; have the appropriate knowledge and skills; are aware of the hazards in their workplace; understand what they should do in the event of an emergency; understand and follow site safety rules; and inform plant personnel of any hazards that they find.  Each contractor employee is provided with a process overview and information about safety and health hazards, emergency response plan requirements, and safe work practices prior to beginning work. WVC evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the contractor selection process. Plant personnel monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\n\n\n\n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\n\n\nWVC conducts a Pre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR) for any new facility or major facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.

These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change\n\n\n\nWVC has a comprehensive system to manage changes to processes.  This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard information, and equipment information, as well as procedures and drawings are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.\n\n\n\nThe management of change program is designed to allow anyone at the facility the ability to initiate a MOC.  Employees have been trained concerning the various elements that would constitute a change such as parts, procedures, operating conditio"

Management of the documents and approval to proceed are controlled at the department level.\n\n\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\n\n\nWVC promptly investigates all process safety related incidents.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to plant management.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete. When necessary, short-term interim measures are taken until the permanent fix is implemented.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings. Incident investigation reports are retained on file for at least five years to supplement the hazard analysis records for the affected areas, and are reviewed during PHAs and PHA revalidations.  WVC implemented a non-conformance report database and an employee improvement program in November 2003.  \n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\n\n\nTo help ensure that the process safety program is functioning properly, WVC periodically undergoes an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required are being implemented.  Compliance audits are conducted at least every three years.  The WVC Corporate HSE office conducted a PSM compliance audit in February 2011.  Both hourly and management personnel participate in the audits.  The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to the plant management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are resolved. The final resolution of each finding is documented. Additionally, OSHA is in the pro"

The accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all EPA RMP-covered processes at the facility.  Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and/or human errors.  In addition to the accident prevention program activities, WVC has safety features to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release. The following types of safety features are used where appropriate:\n\n\n\nRelease Detection\n\n\n\n--Hydrocarbon detectors with alarms\n\n\n\nRelease Containment/Control\n\n\n\n--Process relief valves that discharge to a flare to capture and incinerate episodic releases\n\n--Scrubber to neutralize chemical releases\n\n--Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated)\n\n--Automated shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high level, high temperature)\n\n--Vessel to permit partial removal of the process inventory in the event of a release (e.g., dump tank)\n\n--Curbing or diking to contain liquid releases\n\n--Redundant equipment and instrumentation (e.g., uninterruptible power supply for process control system, backup firewater pump)\n\n--Atmospheric relief devices\n\n\n\nRelease Mitigation\n\n\n\n--Fire suppression and extinguishing systems\n\n--Deluge systems for specific equipment\n\n--Trained emergency response personnel\n\n--Personal protective equipment (e.g., protective clothing, self-contained breathing apparatus)\n\n\n\nFive-year Accident History\n\n\n\nThere have been two accidents which meet the criteria established under RMP that have occurred at WVC's Geismar facility during the past five years.  WVC investigates every incident that meets RMP criteria very carefully to "

While our goal is to eliminate the occurrence of such events, WVC recognizes that they may occur and therefore we also work to ensure proper response to minimize and mitigate any potential impact on our employees and the neighboring community.  \n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\n\nWVC's Geismar facility maintains a written emergency response program to protect workers and public safety as well as the environment.  The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first-aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  In addition, the plant has procedures that address maintenance, inspection and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties.  The emergency response program is reviewed annually and updated when necessary based on modifications made to plant processes or other plant facilities.  Emergency response program changes are administered such that informing and/or training affected personnel is accomplished prior to implementation of the change.\n\n\n\nThe overall emergency response program for the Geismar facility is coordinated with the Geismar Area Mutual Aid (GAMA) network which is comprised of local industries and the Ascension Parish Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency respo"
