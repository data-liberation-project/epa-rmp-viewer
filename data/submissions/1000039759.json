This commitment is demonstrated in the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training for the proper operation and maintenance of plant equipment and preventative maintenance programs. \n\n\n\nBRRWB has emergency response policies in place that are addressed in the facility's Health and Safety Plan; Industrial Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan; Spill Prevention, Controls, and Countermeasures Plan; Facility Response Plan; and Emergency Action Plan. Most of the listed Plans require a minimum of annual training in order to keep employees educated on emergency response procedures in place at the facility. All new employees are required to undergo training on emergency response procedures prior to initiating responsibilities onsite.\n\n\n\nBRRWB's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, plant personnel will respond to contain the release as necessary.\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES:\n\nBRRWB ethanol plant is located in West Burlington, Des Moines County, Iowa.  The facility operates 24 hours per day, 7 days per week for the purpose of manufacturing fuel grade ethanol from corn.  The regulated substances stored at the facility are anhydrous ammonia and a flammable mixture - natural gasoline (denaturant). \n\n\n\nWORST CASE AND ALTERNATIVE CASE SCENARIOS:\n\nWorst Case Scenarios:\n\n1.  Anhydrous Ammonia:  Anhydrous ammonia is stored as a gas liquefied by pressure in an aboveground steel tank. The worst case scenario used is a release of the e"

The ammonia tank sits on a concrete pad, passive mitigation was not included as part of this scenario.  Population data was obtained using Circular Area Profiles (CAPS)which incorporates 2010 U.S. Census Data. Public receptor information (i.e. hospitals, schools, etc) was obtained using Google Earth. No Brush Creek, Spring Creek, Long Creek, Little Flint Creek, Flint Creek and Knotty Creek are located within the worst case distance to endpoint for ammonia.  \n\n\n\n2. Flammable Mixture (Denaturant): The flammable mixture stored onsite is natural gasoline, typically referred to as denaturant. Natural gasoline is used onsite to denature ethanol prior to shipment offsite. Denaturant is stored in a steel tank in the facility tank farm. The tank is located in a diked containment structure that contains an impermeable liner with gravel overlay. A worst case MSDS was used to determine RMP applicability. The worst case scenario used is the release of the entire contents of the denaturant tank, causing a vapor cloud explosion. RMP Comp was used to determine the worst case distance to endpoint; the model results were 0.5 mile radius. Of the entire tank contents, only a portion was used in the RMP Comp model due to the breakdown of regulated constituents under CAA Section 112(r). Population data was obtained using Circular Area Profiles (CAPS)which incorporates 2010 U.S. Census Data. Public receptor information (i.e. hospitals, schools, etc) was obtained using Google Earth. Spring Creek is located within the worst case distance to endpoint for denaturant.  \n\n\n\nAlternative Scenario:\n\n1.  Anhydrous Ammonia: The alternative scenario used for anhydrous ammonia is a release due to a rupture disk/relief valve failure from the ammonia piping system. This scenario is considered the most likely cause of an ammonia release"

The facility control room is manned 24 hours/day and would be alerted of the relief valve failure at the ammonia tank within minutes. The emergency shutdown system installed at the facility has been considered in this scenario as active mitigation. RMP Comp was used to determine the alternative distance to endpoint; the model results were 0.3 miles. Population data was obtained using Circular Area Profiling System (CAPS) which incorporates 2010 U.S. Census Data. Public receptor information (i.e. schools, hospitals) was obtained using Google Earth.  Spring Creek is located within the alternative case distance to endpoint for ammonia.  \n\n\n\n2.  Flammable Mixture (Denaturant): The alternative scenario used for the flammable mixture is the release of natural gasoline due to a tanker truck loadout spill, causing a vapor cloud fire. The endpoint used was an over pressurization of 1 PSI, a worst case option. Denaturant deliveries at the facility typically occur during normal business hours with a facility staff member overseeing loadout operations - therefore a release at the loadout area could be ceased within minutes by manual overrides. The loadout area also has a catchment basin with underground piping to secondary containment of the tank farm. For this scenario, passive and active mitigation was not considered, as the mitigation strategies currently in place would not contain a vapor cloud fire. RMP Comp was used to determine the alternative distance to end point; the model results were 0.2 miles. Of the entire tanker contents only a portion was used in the RMP Comp model due to the breakdown of regulated constituents under CAA Section 112(r).
