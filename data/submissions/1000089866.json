The manufacture of these products requires the use of hazardous materials.  As a chemical manufacturer, SantoLubes Manufacturing takes it's responsibility to our employees and our community seriously.  We accept the responsibility for identifying and managing the risks associated with hazardous chemicals by adhering to company safety, health and environmental policies that require us to make safety, health and environmental considerations a priority in our current operations and our planning and development of new products.  It is also our policy to adhere to all federal, state and local rules and regulations governing the protection of our employees, the community and the environment.\n\n\n\n     Should an emergency involving hazardous materials occur, our emergency response plan is designed to warn and protect both our employees and the community.  This plan has been reviewed with both the local fire department and emergency response personnel.\n\n\n\n     SantoLubes Manufacturing is a batch processor of organic specialty chemicals.  Our products are used in petroleum, photographic, pharmaceutical, agricultural and fiber products.  In our specialty chemical production we use Methyl Chloride which is considered hazardous by the EPA and requires additional considerations.  Methyl Chloride is a gas. It is received by tank truck and stored in a specially designed storage tank.  The maximum amount of methyl chloride on site is approximately 53,000 pounds.\n\n\n\n     To reduce the potential for releases of hazardous materials, SantoLubes Manufacturing has developed a risk management system covering all aspects of our facility, from design and construction, through start-up and operation, to maintenance and training.  SantoLubes Manufacturing complies with the rules and regulations contained in OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard.  Our facility empl"

      "SummaryText": "oys a team of specifically trained employees including Environmental and Safety staff, Engineers, Chemists, Production Supervisors and Production Employees that use industry accepted methods for analyzing, reviewing and minimizing risks involved with our processes.  From this analysis, specific detailed operating procedures are developed and training on these procedures conducted for all production employees.\n\n\n\n     SantoLubes Manufacturing has never had an accidental release of methyl chloride resulting in any injuries, damage or evacuation on-site or off-site.\n\n\n\n     SantoLubes Manufacturing has developed an emergency response plan designed to warn and protect both our employees and the surrounding community.  In the event of an emergency involving methyl chloride, SantoLubes Manufacturing has conducted computer modeling to predict any potential on-site or off-site inpacts.  The plan contains detailed notification procedures for on-site personnel as well as off-site emergency response personnel and emergency planning agencies.  Procedures for the notification and evacuation, if necessary, of the surrounding community have also been reviewed.  All employees receive training in the facility emergency response and evacuation plan.\n\n\n\n     SantoLubes Manufacturing feels that the risk management system and emergency response program have proven to be effective thus far in our production history.  However, we are continuously analyzing, reviewing, modifing and inproving these systems and programs.  It is our policy to strive for continuous improvement in every thing that we do in order to provide quality products to our customers, a safe and healthy workplace for our employees and a clean environment for our community.\n\n"
