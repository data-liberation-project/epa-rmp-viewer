      "SummaryText": "Kinder Morgan Santa Fe Pacific Pipeline, LLC - Eugene Terminal is a bulk petroleum storage and distribution facility that includes butane blending operations. This Risk Management Plan (RMP) covers the Butane Blending process including the associated piping and one 70,000 gallon butane storage vessel.  Kinder Morgan owns the real property associated with the Butane Blending process. Energy Transfer owns all the equipment associated with the Butane Blending process.  Energy Transfer and Kinder Morgan each have operational responsibilities for the Butane Blending process.   Energy Transfer controls and monitors all butane blending operations remotely from its control center located near Houston, Texas, conducts all maintenance activities, and schedules the delivery of butane trucks.  Kinder Morgan oversees the unloading of butane trucks into the storage vessel and conducts routine visual inspections.\n\nEnergy Transfer constructed the Butane Blending process in accordance with the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA Code) No. 58 (2020 Edition) for Liquefied Petroleum Gas Storage. Energy Transfer designed, constructed, and maintains the Butane Blending process, in accordance with NFPA No. 58 and the manufacturer's instructions and recommendations.\n\nIt is the Parties' policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws/codes. If an emergency were to occur, it is the Parties' policy to notify the local fire department or the State Fire Marshal as well as Lane County Emergency Management. Medical emergencies will require notification of the local Emergency Management Services and the appropriate medical establishments.\n\nThe Parties comply with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Accident Prevention Rules (40 CFR Part 68 Subpart D), the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard and associated 14 elements (29 CFR Part 1910.119), and all applicable state and local laws and regulations.

The facility emergency response plans are coordinated with the local fire department and the State Fire Marshall and local emergency responders were invited to attend an initial training session for this system.\n\nProcess safety controls include excess flow valves, low-melting point pneumatic valve feeds to pneumatic valves (fail closed), 85% fill shut-off (approximately 73% alarm and 90% ESD actuation) on the vessel, emergency shut-off devices on the system and video display terminal, line thermal/hydrostatic reliefs, and grounding interlock devices. Note: In contrast to the PSM requirements, this \"stationary source\" as defined under 40 CFR Part 68 is bounded by the off-load station and the points of injection.\n\nThe Parties actively seek employee input on process safety improvements. Additionally, local emergency responders are contacted periodically regarding participation in site emergency response drills. Additional actions include consolidating separate system inspection checklists for ease of completion."
