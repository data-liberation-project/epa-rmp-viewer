The properties of this material make it necessary to observe safety precautions in handling to prevent human exposure and to reduce the threat to the facility?s workers and nearby members of the community.  It is the facility?s policy to adhere to all applicable Federal State of California rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the safe procedures used to handle the ammonia; the safety devices and systems designed and constructed into the facility; and the training of the pertinent personnel.\n\n2.0 Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nCalifornia Cold Logistics is a wholesale food distribution warehouse.  It stores bare root trees, and plants, froozen food products for fast food chains and microwave meals and other products in over 3 million cubic feet of  current storage space with the capacity of storing in excess of 30 million pounds of products in spaces from -20 degrees to 45 degrees Fahrenheit.  Anhydrous ammonia is used in the three (3) refrigeration systems at the warehouse.\n\nThe anhydrous ammonia at the site is completed contained within the three (3) closed loop systems at all times and should never need to be refilled with replacement ammonia at any time under normal operating conditions.  An estimated 18,889 pounds of anhydrous ammonia is utilized within the three (3) refrigeration systems at the site.  The receipt, storage, and handling of the subject substance is considered a part of one complete process.\n\n3a. Worst Case Release Scenario\n\nThe Worst Case release scenario to be modeled assumes that the full 9,872 pounds of anhydrous ammonia in the High Pressure Receiver (HPR) is released over a ten minute period resulting in a release rate of 987 pounds per minute.  The HPR is the largest vessel with anhydrous ammonia in the refrigeration sy"

Alternative Release Scenario\n\nThe Alternative Release scenario for the ammonia system assumes a release from a valve packing resulting in a release of 120 pounds of ammonia in 60 minutes.  The distance to the endpoint of 0.14 mg/l for the Alternative Release scenario extends beyond the boundaries of the stationary source.\n\n3c.  Administrative Controls\n\nAdministrative controls to limit the distances for each reported scenario exists to restrict to a minimum the amount of ammonia release, if a release were to occur, and preferably to not have a release occur.  This administrative control is inherent in the operational procedures for the ammonia system and the training provided to the ammonia operators.\n\n3d.  Mitigation Measures\n\nMitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario exists to restrict to a minimum the amount of ammonia released, if a release were to occur, and preferable to not have a release occur.  The mitigation measures are based upon the design, inspection, testing, and maintenance of the refrigeration system and its related equipment and components with the anhydrous ammonia.\n\n4.0 General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe facility complies with all applicable federal and state codes and regulations.  There are safety meetings and safety training.  The hazardous materials management and safety programs implemented at the facility for the ammonia related activities and equipment represents one of the facility?s main active commitments to an accidental release prevention program.\n\n5.0 Five Year Accident History\n\nThere have been two (2) incidents involving the release of ammonia within the past five years at the facility.  One incident was a release of 1,853 lb of gaseous ammonia over one (1) hour on September 3, 2008.  The other incident was a releas"

The distance to the endpoint of 0.14 mg/l for each of these releases extends beyond the boundaries of the stationary source. \n\n6.0 Emergency Response Program\n\nThe Emergency Response Program is based on alerting personnel at the facility of the need to evacuate the facility and await the arrival of responders from the Yuba City Fire Department at the evacuation assembly location if a release occurs that causes the evacuation to be initiated.  The Sutter County - Environmental Health can incorporate this response into the County Area Plan.\n\n7.0 Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThere are commitments to be made from the Process Hazard Analysis element of the RMP that will be implemented at this facility for the next year and one-half.  Current applicable codes and regulations are reviewed as part of the RMP to determine if other commitments need to be made to achieve increased operational safety for the regulated substance in the regulated process of the refrigeration system.  These commitments will be prevention and mitigation measures for accidental releases of the regulated substance."
