This system uses existing proven policies and procedures that are a part of LCRA\u0092s successful environmental, health and safety record.  These policies and procedures are enhanced as necessary to document compliance with USEPA\u0092s Risk Management Plan regulations.  The Risk Management Plan Manual is designed as a tool to guide the user through the methods, procedures, and documentation required comprising LP1\u0092s RMP compliance.  The Lost Pines Power Park Director is responsible for the integration and implementation of this program.\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and regulated substance:\n\nLP1, located in Bastrop County, Texas, is a gas-fired combined cycle power plant that produces electricity. As a means of reducing nitrogen oxide emissions from the two gas-fired combustion turbines, anhydrous ammonia is injected into the turbine exhaust streams acting as a reductant for the Selective Catalytic Reduction system.  The anhydrous ammonia is stored on-site in two storage tanks located on opposite sides of the units.  The storage limit of each tank at 12,800 gallons or approximately 64,000 pounds exceeds the threshold quantity for RMP applicability.\n\n Accidental Release Prevention Program-\n\nThe Lower Colorado River Authority (LCRA) has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as mandatory technical and safety training for all facility personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. It is the policy of LCRA to implement reasonable controls to prevent releases of regulated substances.  LP1 is subject to Program Level 2 of USEPA\u0092s RMP rule.
