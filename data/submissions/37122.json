This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of facility?s processes.  Crosstex Energy Services, L.P. policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to, control and contain the release.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nCrosstex Energy Services, L.P. owns and operates the Gregory Gas Plant located in San Patricio County, Texas.  The Gregory Gas Plant receives produced natural gas via pipeline.  Residue gas is removed from the plant by pipeline.  The plant has been designed to recover as much as possible of the ethane component in the natural gas stream.  Ethane is removed from the plant by pipeline.  The hydrocarbon liquids are fractionated at the Gregory Gas Plant and the fractionated products are shipped out via pipeline and tank trucks.\n\nThe Gregory Gas Plant was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances exceeded the threshold quantity.  Based on process knowledge, Crosstex Energy Services, L.P. identified the regulated substances and quantities kept on site.\n\nListed flammable substances which are stored above threshold quantities at the Gregory Gas Plant are natural gasoline, propane, butanes, NGL mix, heating oil, and natural gas.  However, Crosstex has determined that heating oil has an NFPA flammability hazard rating of one, which exempts this mixture from threshold determination.  Based on worst-case analysis, the distance to the endpoint exceeds the distance to public receptors.  In addition, the Gregory Gas Plant is subject to OSHA PSM.  The"

      "SummaryText": "refore, the Gregory Gas Plant is classified as a Program 3 process under the ARP program.\n\nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n\nFlammable Substances ? Worst-Case Scenario\n\nThe endpoint for worst-case release of flammable substances is 1-psi overpressure (i.e., 15.7 psia), resulting from a vapor cloud explosion.  The ARP Program requirement for flammables assumes an instantaneous release and vapor cloud explosion.  A yield factor of 10 percent of the available energy released in the explosion shall be used to determine the distance to the explosion endpoint.  Since the worst-case release scenario for a flammable substance is based on the assumption that the entire quantity of the substance forms a vapor cloud, passive mitigation systems are not applicable.  Natural gasoline is the worst-case flammable release with 0.55-mile distance to the endpoint.\n\nFlammable Substances ? Alternative-Case Scenario\n\nA single alternative release scenario for all flammable substances is required under the ARP program.  A hypothetical, but likely to occur, release scenario has been identified for butanes as follows:  A 3-inch pipe on the truck rack is sheared off during loading, causing the entire contents to empty from the truck tank.  The butane will vaporize and may ignite in a vapor cloud explosion with an endpoint of 1-psi overpressure or a vapor cloud fire with an endpoint of the lower flammability limit (LFL) for n-butane.  The alternative-case release of butanes resulted in a 0.30-mile distance to the 1-psi overpressure endpoint and less than 0.06 mile distance to the LFL endpoint.  \n\nToxic Substances\n\nThe Gregory Gas Plant does not have any toxic substances held above the threshold quantity.  Therefore, analysis of worst-case or alternative-case release scenarios for toxic substances is not required.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PROGRAM\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Gregory Gas Plant.

Employee involvement will help to ensure that all perspectives regarding PSM are considered, and that the best ideas are implemented.  Open communications are encouraged between supervisors and employees regarding all safety and health issues.\n\nThe Gregory Gas Plant strongly promotes employee involvement in safety issues through existing programs.  These programs include Unit Safety Teams (which are made up of a cross section of employees and supervision), regularly scheduled safety meetings, tail-gate safety meetings, Hazard Communication, Safety Suggestion Forms, ?near-miss? reporting, and special training programs (emergency response training, first aid, etc.).\n\nThe Gregory Gas Plant actively seeks employee involvement in the development and conduct of all accident prevention activities through the approximate existing safety programs.  Accident prevention is discussed at the regularly scheduled safety meetings and/or during special training sessions if necessary.  Employees are encouraged to discuss accident prevention with their supervisors if they have questions, comments, or suggestions.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nComplete and accurate written process safety information (PSI) concerning process chemicals, process technology, and process equipment is essential to an effective PSM and "
