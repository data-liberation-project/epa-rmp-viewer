The City has demonstrated its commitment to safety by upgrading the chemical feed process at the Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) in early 1999 from a gas pressure system to a vacuum system mounted directly on a chlorine cylinder, which decreases system maintenance dramatically and therefore reduces the potential for chlorine leaks. In addition, additional chlorine leak detectors were added as a result of the orginal Hazard Review conducted. \n\nFacility and Regulated Substance\nThe City's WWTP is located in the southeastern portion of the City at 920 South Boise Avenue. Chlorine is used at the facility to provide disinfection of treated wastewater effluent prior to discharge into the Big Thompson River.  Chlorine is stored in one-ton cylinders, and no more than two cylinders of chlorine (4,000 pounds) are stored at the WWTP.\n\nWorst Case and Alternative Case Release Scenarios\nPer Chapter 2, page 26 of the RMP Submit 2004 User's Manual \"A summary of the off-site consequence analysis (OCA) for the worse-case and alternative case release scenarios(s) is no longer required to be included in the executive summary\" and therefore are not included.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\nThe accidental release prevention program complies with the requirements for Program Level 2 processes.  The prevention program includes an employee training program based on the written operating procedures for the WWTP, as well as an aggressive maintenance, inspection, and testing program for equipment utilized within the covered process.  These programs all serve to prevent or minimize unintended releases of chlorine.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\nThe WWTP has NOT had an accidental release of chlorine within the last five years.  \n\nEmergency Response Program\nThe WWTP is included within a written community emerge"

WWTP employees handle incidental releases of chlorine and are trained and equipped to do so. \n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nBy the end of year 2004, the WWTP is expected to convert from using chlorine as a disinfectant to an Ultra Violet disinfection system resulting in a significant reduction and possibly the elimination of the use and storage of chlorine."
