Membership is made up of the City of Petersburg, the City or Colonial Heights, Chesterfield County, Dinwiddie County and Prince George County.  \n \n$8.5 million of revenue bonds were sold in October, 1964 to build a Treatment Plant, water lines, dam and reservoir.  Construction started in 1966 and was completed in 1968 for the 22 MGD facilities.  In October 1983 the Authority issued $12.5 million of Revenue Bonds to expand the Plant to 46 MGD and the work was completed in late 1985. $2.2 million of Revenue Bonds were issued in 1991 to fund two sludge lagoons.  In 1997 the Authority built a $2.5 million chloramine addition to the plant with its own funds.  Only a portion of the 1983 Bonds remain outstanding.  In 2003 the Authority issued $9.11 million of Revenue Bonds and Chesterfield County contributed $31.2 million of cash to expand the facilities from 46 mgd to 96 mgd. The work will be completed in 2006. \n\nFacilities\n1.  Land  Approximately 6,000 acres were purchased.  3,100 acres was flooded for Lake\nChesdin, 2,700 acres is a flooding area surrounding the lake and approximately 200 acres makes up the treatment plant complex and immediate area.\n\n2.  Dam & Reservoir  The Brasfield Dam impounds the Appomattox River to form Lake\nChesdin.  The lake stores approximately 12 billion gallons of water.  The dam is 55 feet at the highest point, 1250 feet long and has an 800 foot long spillway.\n\n3.  Filter plant  The filter plant complex houses the Authority's Administrative, Laboratory,\nOperational and Maint"
