      "SummaryText": "INTRODUCTION\nBoasso Newark Terminal LLC (Boasso Global) operates a transportation terminal located at 80 Doremus Ave in Newark, NJ which currently consists of Intermodal Tank Containers (ISOs) transportation operations. The transportation terminal provides temporary transportation storage and maintenance for ISO containers incidental to transportation to the final destination selected by the shipper.  ISOs are manufactured according to specifications from the International Organization of Standardization (ISO) and are suitable for multiple transport methods such as truck, rail, or ship.  In-transit storage services are provided to a wide variety of clients and industries and the specific chemicals and inventory quantities onsite can vary. Temporary storage at the facility includes ISOs containing chemicals listed as Extraordinarily Hazardous Substances (EHS) as defined in New Jersey\u0092s Toxic Catastrophe Prevention Act (TCPA) at, N.J.A.C. 7:31 (which incorporates, by reference, the federal Chemical Accident Prevention rules at 40 CFR 68).  Onsite quantities of EHS may exceed applicable regulatory thresholds and, as such, the facility is subject to the requirements of TCPA.  To comply with TCPA, Boasso Global is required to prepare and implement a Risk Management Plan (RMP) to prevent and/or minimize the consequences of a catastrophic release or explosion.  A Program Level 3 Risk Management Plan (RMP) is being resubmitted as part of the 5-year update in accordance with 40 CFR \u00a7 68.190(b) with changes specified at N.J.A.C. 7:31-7.1(c)1 and 2.\n\n1.\tAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nAccidental release prevention is inherent within the design of the ISOs. EHS products must be handled appropriately to reduce potential exposure hazards to employees, visitors, and nearby members of the community.  Safe operation is enhanced by the careful manner of handling EHS products, storage of ISOs containing EHS in the restricted area of the secondary containm"

It also is company policy to comply with Federal and State rules and regulations.  \nEvaluation of the threshold quantity includes substances in a \"covered process\", defined as use, storage, manufacturing, handling, or onsite movement operations that have an EHS present.  Facilities are subject to the requirements of TCPA if the total quantity of EHS in covered processes exceed the threshold limits specified in N.J.A.C. 7:31-6.  Storage of ISO containers holding EHS constitutes a covered process as defined by TCPA.  \n\n2.\tThe Facility and Regulated Substances Handled\nThe covered process is limited to movement and storage of closed ISO containers.  EHS are not removed from their containers or transferred, heated, processed, or used in any other way at the facility.\nThe Boasso Newark Terminal handles and stores ISOs with maximum volume of 6,500 imperial gallons that are typically constructed from stainless steel and housed in steel framework to both allow for stacking and to protect the tank during shipping.  Twenty-foot (20\u0092) long ISOs are brought to the facility on trailer chassis by over-the-road trucks.  ISOs may be empty and clean, empty (but sometimes containing de minimis amounts of chemicals that cannot be pumped out of the container during delivery), or full or almost full of EHS chemicals.  Boasso\u0092s RMP covers EHS-containing ISOs that are full or almost full. ISOs are unloaded from the chassis by container handlers and are moved to an available temporary storage location onsite, also known as the restricted area of the secondary containment, by the container handler or by a yard truck and trailer chassis.  Empty ISOs may be stacked up"
