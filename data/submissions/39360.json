It will be a facility policy to be aware of and maintain compliance with applicable federal, state, and local regulation.  In the event of an emergency, the facility policy will be to notify the Waynesburg Fire Department and request response.\n\nFacility Description\nCGR operates a coal-bed methane gas (CMG) processing facility located in Whiteley Township of Greene County, approximately 7 miles south of Waynesburg.  This facility receives CMG from various underground areas of both the Cumberland and Emerald Mine, and processes this gas to prepare for delivery to sales quality pipeline (public utility).  Propane is stored on site for use as an additive in order to enhance the heating value of the CMG prior to delivery (sale).\n\nRegulated Substance\nPropane is stored in a 30,000-gallon horizontal storage tank, a minimum of 50 feet from the processing building.  This propane is stored as a pressurized liquid, and delivered to the processing facility by way of approximately 150 linear feet of 2-inch diameter pipeline (predominantly buried).  Prior to delivery to the processing plant the propane passes through an electric vaporizer, increasing the temperature in preparation for metering to the CMG.\n\nRegulatory Applicability\nA determination was made that CGR met the applicability requirements of 40 CFR 68.10, in that the maximum quantity of propane stored on site is greater than the threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds.  Propane can be exempted from the Chemical Accident Provisions of 40 CFR Part 68 when stored for use as a combustion fuel on site.  Additionally, an exemption can be similarly claimed where propane is held for r"

      "SummaryText": "etail sale (greater than 50%) directly to the end-user.  In this case however, propane will be sold directly to the public utility for ultimate use as a fuel.  CGR has conservatively assumed that the utility will deliver the bulk of this fuel to the residential community, as opposed to private use in onsite combustion equipment (as boilers).  Based on this assumption, CGR has determined that their propane storage represents a feedstock additive to the processed CMG, and that the facility is therefore applicable to 40 CFR Part 68.\n\nThis facility is not applicable to the United States Department of Labor Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA) provisions for ?Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals? defined by 29 CFR Part 1910.  Because these regulations were designed to protect onsite workers, 29 CFR 1910.119(a)(2)(ii) exempts ?normally unoccupied remote facilities? (no employee permanently stationed at facility).\n\nBased on these determinations, CGR was further determined to be a Program 2 applicable facility, subject to the Accidental Release Prevention Program requirements of 40 CFR Part 68.\n\nWorst Case Release Scenario\nThe worst case release scenario assumed that an accident resulted in a total quantity release (107,500 pounds) and vaporization of propane over a 10-minute period.  This quantity was then assumed to detonate resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.   The calculated distance to the vapor cloud explosion endpoint (1 pound per square inch overpressure) was determined to be 0.4 miles (2,112) linear feet.  \n\nIt should be noted that the scenario described above is very unlikely.  In an actual release, the flammable vapors would likely disperse without ignition, or burn instead of exploding (with more limited offsite consequences).  Further, the site-specific topography would diminish the chance of a vapor cloud explosion (increased wind speed enhancing dispersion) in addition to the likelihood of adverse consequences (dramatic elev"

This area is generally used for farmland with 6 public residences located within the vulnerability zone.  There are no schools, hospitals, prisons, public recreation areas, or other industrial areas located within this defined vulnerability zone.  Similarly, there are no national or state parks, forests, or monuments; wildlife sanctuaries, preserves, or refuges; or federal wilderness areas within this defined zone.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario\nThe selected ?more likely? alternative release scenario consisted of a tank overfill and relief valve lift resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  The release scenario for this event resulted in a propane release of 5,835 pounds and a corresponding distance of 475 linear feet to the overpressure endpoint.\n\nThis resulting distance to the endpoint extends offsite.  However, no public residence or otherwise sensitive environmental receptors are within this defined vulnerability zone.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\nBy submittal of this Risk Management Plan, CGR is in compliance with EPA accident prevention rules.  Additionally, the facility is in compliance with all state codes and regulations.  This propane system was designed, installed, and will be maintained in accordance with NFPA-58 and state law.\n\n5-yr Accident History\nThere have been no releases or accidents relating to the CGR propane system resulting in deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or ?sheltering in place?.\n\nEmergency Response Program\nEmployees of CGR will not respond to accidental releases of propane.  Rather, the facility will qualify as a ?Non-Responding Facility? and will adhere to an ?Emergency Response Action Plan? to ensure adequate emergency response:\n\nIn the event of any release posing a th"

The Waynesburg Fire Department has inspected the propane system and determined that they are capable of responding to an emergency associated with this system.  Further, these agencies are aware that they are the primary responders in any emergency relating to the CGR propane system.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nCGR is located on a plateau area high above the majority of the surrounding terrain.  Therefore, considerable attention has been given to the possible ramifications associated with a potential lightning strike.  Effective grounding has been implemented to protect facility equipment (including the propane tank and system) as well as facility electronic systems.\n\nNonetheless, CGR intends to further explore information sources relating to lightning protection including information provided by organizations dedicated to lightning issues (as Lightning Protection Institute, Arlington Heights, Illinois).  Although no changes to the existing system have been planned, those techniques/equipment determined to apply to the specifics of the CGR propane system will be investigated for potential effectiveness."
