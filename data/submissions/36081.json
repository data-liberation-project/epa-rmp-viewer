      "SummaryText": "Brazos River Authority\nWaco Metropolitan Area Regional Sewerage System\n\nThe Waco Metropolitan Area Regional Sewerage System is an innovative and cost-effective regional sewerage system that serves the wastewater treatment needs of the urban areas in and around Waco, Texas. The plant was opened in 1971 and has a system capacity of 22.0 million gallons per day actual flow; 37.8 million gallons per day permitted flow; and 83.0 million gallons per day permitted peak flow. Plant awards include the Operations and Maintenance Excellence Award in 1991 from the Texas Water Commission.\n\nOnly chlorine and sulfur dioxide are stored about their established threshold quantity.\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies \n\nThe facility?s policy requires a written emergency action plan, annual exercises and reviews of the plan, emergency response training for facility personnel and coordination with local responders. In addition, the facility Safety Officer and risk management consultants from our insurance company conduct semi-annual safety inspections.\n\n- Chlorine\nThe 1-ton cylinders are stored in a block building with one personnel door on the one side and one whole end of the building has sliding doors for handling the cylinders with overhead beam trolleys and hoists. The storage/feed capacity is 12 cylinders, 6 on each side. Each side is connected to the main header via whip lines. Each bank is controlled separately by pressure valving and switchover valves to the rotometers and gas feeders. The chlorine system changes from a pressure to a vacuum system at this point. Normally one bank of cylinders is feeding and the other bank is either empty or ready to be exchanged with the full cylinders or is full and on standby. The chlorine control room is adjacent to the storage area and has an intervening block/glass wall between the two areas. There is adequate valving to isolate and stop any leaking section of pipe from the individual cylinders to the actual indu"

The gas detection system sets off an audible and visual alarm in the event of a leak. Both the storage and control area have ventilation systems. There is also an open storage/staging area just outside the sliding doors of the storage/feed area. This area will hold 12 cylinders and is where cylinders are unloaded from the delivery truck or empty cylinders loaded on to the same truck.\n\n- Sulfur Dioxide\nThe one-ton cylinders are in a storage/feed area enclosed by a metal building with block walls. The area has room for 16 cylinders, 8 in each bank, but only 4 in each bank are manifold together. Each bank is separated using pressure valving and switchover valves going into the rotometers and gas induction system. The system changes from a pressure to a vacuum system here. There is a dividing block/glass wall between the storage/feed area and the control room area. There is one walk door for access to each area and a walk door from the control room to the storage/feed area. There are ventilation systems in both areas and the storage/feed area has one wall consisting of sliding door panels for loading and unloading cylinders using overhead trolleys and hoists. There is a gas detection system in place  that has an audible and visual alarm to warn of a gas leak in either the storage/feed areas or the control room. There is an additional outside storage/staging area adjacent to the large access doors with space for 8 additional cylinders. This area is used for offloading full and empty cylinders from the delivery trucks.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nChlorine\n\nAt any one time, chlorine may be stored in as many as 24 cylinders, each containing as much as 2,000 pounds of liquid chlorine. The chlorine is used to disinfect the treated wastewater prior to its discharge to the receiving stream. The chlorine feed equipment requires that the 24 cylinders be "

      "SummaryText": "divided into 4 groups of six cylinders each. Two groups are connected to the feed equipment with the remaining two groups placed in storage. Of the two groups connected, chemical is drawn form only one group. The other group is placed in stand-by and is activated by an automatic switchover valve. This valve is activated upon the depletion of all available chlorine from the first group of cylinders. Gaseous chlorine is withdrawn from the cylinders through regulators that require a vacuum to operate.\n\nUpon loss of the vacuum the regulator will close, thus shutting off the chlorine feed. After passing trough the regulator, the gas goes through the automatic switchover valve, a flow rate indicator, which can be adjusted manually or automatically. Finally, the gas passes through the ?Chlor-a-Vac? pump. This pump produces the vacuum that is requited for the chlorine feed system to operate. This pump is submerged in the treated effluent and mixes the chlorine gas wit the treated effluent. This mixing occurs within a concrete junction box prior to the chlorinated water flowing to a series of concrete basins that retain the water for a minimum of 20 minutes. This 20-minutes retention is required by federal regulations and needed to assure that water is adequately disinfected prior to being released to the environment.\n\nWhen the water leaves the chlorine contact chambers, suffer dioxide is injected into the water. This sulfur dioxide reacts with any remaining chlorine residual, dissipating both chemicals before the water is released to the receiving stream below. The sulfur dioxide feed system is essentially the same as the chlorine feed system and is described below.  \n\n Sulfur Dioxide\n\nEight sulfur dioxide (SO2) cylinders connected to the headers at the sulfur dioxide Storage Facility are arranged for active service in two banks of four cylinders each. Each one-ton cylinder contains 2,000 pounds of SO2.\n\nEach header is provided with a separate vacuum regulator to reduce the"

      "SummaryText": " gas from a varying supply pressure to a constantly regulated vacuum. The vacuum regulators are equipped with gas pressure gauges and vacuum-sealing 0-rings, to seal off the supply of gas in the event that the supply is exhausted and shut off. When the exhausted supply is replaced a fresh cylinder bank becomes the standby supply.\n\nVacuum is applied to the De-chlorination System by Chlor-a-Vac induction units. These units are suspended and are submerged to a depth of at least two feet below the minimum water surface. Induction units create a vacuum with motor-driven open propellers, which also serve to mix the sulfur dioxide gas with wastewater.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nWMRSS has the capability to respond to and mitigate the release of on-site hazardous chemicals that present a moderate health and/or safety threat to WMRSS and responding personnel, present a moderate potential for adverse environmental impact, are of limited size, and have low fire/explosion potential. If the spill release is beyond the capability of on-site personnel, the City of Waco?s and McLennan County?s HAZMAT teams will respond by calling 911. Training and exercises are conducted periodically.\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nIn the last 5 years, there has been one accidental release from the chlorine process that resulted in no deaths, only one injury, and no property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering-in-place, property damage, or environmental damage. The injured person fully recovered and returned to work the next day."
