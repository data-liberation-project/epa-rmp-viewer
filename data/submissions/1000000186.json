The City of Ravenna Water Treatment Plant is currently at a  Program Level 3.\n\n1 The City of Ravenna Water Treatment Plant (RWTP) Accidental Release Policy involves a unified approach that integrayes technology, procedures and management practices. All applicable procedures of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) Prevention Program are adhered to. The Ravenna Water Treatment Plant Emergency Reponce Program involves the preperation of responce plans which are tailored to the Ravenna Water Plant Facility and to the emergency responce services available in the community, and is in compliance with the USEPA Emergency Program requirements.\n\n2 The Ravenna Water Treatment Plant was built and put on line in June 1984 to supply water to the City of Ravenna residences, part of Ravenna Township and Rootstown Water Service Company to the south. The water system currently serves the entire City of Ravenna, parts of Ravenna Township and approximately two-thirds of  the supply to the Rootstown Water Service Company. An Emergency Water line to the City of Kent to the west is installed and currently nearing its final placement into service and an agreement to provide water to Portage County is in place with Ravenna supplying 100,000 to 200,000 GPD to an area north of Ravenna. The Water Plant is located at 5383 Lakewood Road next to the Lake Hodgson Recreational Facility and Reservoir. The plant includes a chlorination room, that containes liquid chlorine cylinders, a chlorinator and various safety devices. The amount of chlorine handeled is four one ton containers. The chlorination system was upgraded form a pressure system to a vacuum system in the summer of 1999 due to safety concerns. The chlorinator and equipment room is normally unmanned and can only be entered from a seperate outside entrance apart from the mai"

      "SummaryText": "n building. Water Treatment Operators visit the facility or room daily per shift and respond to any trouble alarms which may occur.\n\n3 The offsite consequence analysis (OCA) removed per 2004 update instructions.\n\n4 The General Ravenna Water Treatment Plant accidental release prevention program is based on the following key elements:\n-Process Safety Information\n-Process Hazard Analysis\n-Operating Procedures\n-Training\n-Mechanical Integrity\n-Management of Change\n-Prestartup Review\n-Compliance Audits\n-Incident Investigation\n-Employee Participation Plan\n-Hot Work Permit\n-Contractors\n\nChemical-specific prevention steps include avalibility of self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) worn by the operators during connection/disconnection of chlorine supply, awareness of hazardous and toxic properties of chlorine, and the presence of externally mounted detector for the chlorine room.\n\n5 No accidental releases of chlorine have occured at this facility (RWTP) in the past 5 years.\n\n6 The RWTP has an emergency responce program, which has been coordinated (reviewed) by the City of Ravenna Fire Department, which is a member of the local Emergency Responce Planning Committee (LEPC). This program includes an emergency responce decision tree and notification program. Emergency responce drills and drill evacuations are conducted every 12 months; emergency operating and response procedures are also reviewed at this time.\n\n7 Three (3) changes to improve safety (recommended actions) were identified in April 1999. These recommended actions have now been evaluated and implimented as required.\n\n8 On November 19, 2003 an Ohio EPA audit was performed. Over the next 3 months the Ravenna Water Treatment Plant corrected the deficiencies noted in that audit and received a conformation that our program is complete and accurate from the Ohio EPA on March 22, 2004."
