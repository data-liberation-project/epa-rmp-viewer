This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, gas plant trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\n \n\n DESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n \n\n The Raywood gas processing plant operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products (e.g., natural gas, natural gas liquids, and condensate) from raw natural gas. This plant has one regulated flammable: NFPA 4 flammable mixtures. \n\n \n\n GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n \n\n The following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the plant. Because processes at the plant that are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) risk management program (RMP) regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\n \n\n Employee Participation\n\n \n\n The Raywood gas plant encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention. Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team. Employees have access to all information created as part of the gas plant accident prev"

Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the gas plant and addresses each accident prevention program element. In addition, the gas plant has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and employee safety issue. These initiatives include forming teams to promote both process and personal safety. The teams typically have members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and plant management.\n\n \n\n Process Safety Information\n\n \n\n The Raywood gas plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. Specific departments within the gas plant are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information. A table summarizing the reference documents and their location is readily available as part of the written employee participation plan to help employees locate any necessary process safety information.\n\n  \n\n Chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/ exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs). This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals. For specific process areas, the gas plant has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in our Operating Procedures and/or Process Safety Information. The gas plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument syste"

This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n \n\n Process Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\n \n\n The Raywood gas plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled. Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\n \n\n The Raywood gas plant primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations. HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques. The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. \n\n \n\n The PHA team findings are forwarded to management for resolution. Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team. This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention. All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed. The final resolution of each finding i"

The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained. Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\n \n\n  Operating Procedures\n\n \n\n The Raywood gas plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate. The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process. \n\n \n\n In addition, the Raywood gas plant maintains Operating Procedures that provide guidance on how to respond to upper or lower limit exceedances for specific process or equipment parameters. This information is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\n \n\n Training\n\n \n\n To complement the written procedures for process operations, the Raywood gas plant has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.

Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\n\n \n\n Specialized Safety Features\n\n \n\n The Raywood gas plant has safety features on many units to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release. The following types of safety features are used in the covered processes:\n\n \n\n Release Detection\n\n \n\nA? Hydrocarbon detectors with alarms\n\n \n\n Release Containment/Control\n\n \n\nA? Process relief valves that discharge to a flare to capture and incinerate episodic releases\n\n \n\nA? Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated)\n\n \n\nA? Automated shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high temperature)\n\n \n\nA? Curbing or diking to contain liquid releases\n\n\n\nA? Redundant equipment and instrumentation \n\n\n\nA? Atmospheric relief devices.\n\n \n\n Release Mitigation\n\n \n\n \n\nA? Trained emergency response personnel\n\n \n\nA? Personal protective equipment (e.g., chemical protective clothing, self-contained breathing apparatus).\n\n\n\n FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n \n\n The Raywood gas plant has an excellent record of accident prevention over the past 5 years. There has been a decreasing trend in the frequency of accidental releases. None of the incidents that have occurred in the past 5 years resulted in offsite effects. We investigate every incident very carefully to determine ways to prevent similar incidents from recurring. \n\n \n\n EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\n\n \n\n The Raywood gas plant maintains a written emergency response program, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment. The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable su"

The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements. In addition, the plant has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment. Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties. The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to gas plant processes or other DCP Midstream gas plant facilities. The emergency response program changes are administered through the MOC process, which includes informing and/or training affected personnel in the changes.\n\n \n\n The overall emergency response program for the Raywood gas plant is coordinated with the Lea County local emergency planning committee (LEPC) and the local fire department. This coordination includes periodic meetings of the LEPC, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives. The Raywood  gas plant has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department). This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident. In addition to periodic LEPC meetings, the Raywood  gas plant conducts periodic emergency drills that involve the LEPC and emergency response organizations, and the gas plant provides annual refresher training to local emergency responders regarding the hazards of regulated substances in the gas plant.\n\n \n\n  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n \n\n The Raywood gas plan"
