In response to the congressional mandate, EPA promulgated the Risk Management Program Rule\n\n(RMP Rule).\n\n     The RMP Rule identified covered facilities on the basis of use/storage of threshold quantities\n\nof any of a long list of chemicals (see 40 CFR Part 68.130, Table 1) and required those facilities to submit to EPA a completed RMP by June 21, 1999.  Further, the RMP Rule requires that all covered\n\nfacilities must review all aspects of their respective plans and re-submit to EPA RMP updates every\n\nfive years thereafter as long as a facility is covered by the Rule.\n\n\n\nFINDINGS (as of September, 2004)\n\n     A second compliance audit and a hazard review was completed in September, 2004 for St. Bernard \n\nParish, Violet wastewater treatment plant as required by the RMP rule and the appropriate offsite\n\nconsequence assessment (OCA) modeling was re-visited.  No significant problems were noted by those \n\nefforts.  The OCA continues to predict a very small impact area such that area residents/occupants \n\nshould have little to no concern relative to the subject facility.\n\n     A Table top rehearsal of the Emergency Response Plan components will be held before the end of this year with the St. Bernard Parish LEPC and others.  This is to ensure that the first responders, e.g., local police and fire department personnel were properly trained and coordinated for first response"
