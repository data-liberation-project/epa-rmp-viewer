      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nTradeMark Nitrogen, Corp.  (TradeMark) is a producer of nitrogen-based fluid products located in Tampa, Florida.  An integral component of the manufacture of these products is anhydrous ammonia.  Inventory exceeds the 10,000-pound threshold for anhydrous ammonia set by EPA under the Risk Management Program (RMP) Rule codified at 40 CFR 68.  Pursuant to the requirements of the rule, TradeMark has prepared this Risk Management Program (RMP) Plan. We are proud of our environmental, health, and safety efforts and programs and our record in these areas.  The following sections outline our RMP plan.   \n \n\nOVERALL RESPONSIBILITY\n\nOur Technical Manager and Safety and Worker Protection Manager serve as the facility's RMP and PSM Coordinators, respectively.  Together, these individuals share the overall responsibility for ensuring that our facility operates in a safe and reliable manner.  This responsibility includes overseeing the implementation of the elements of our risk management program.  To ensure that our risk management program is appropriately developed and implemented, our President has assigned the role of RMP Coordinator to the Technical Manager, a staff member with the necessary background, training, and experience.  The RMP Coordinator, acting with the authority delegated directly from the President, has the responsibility for the development, implementation, and integration of the EPA RMP elements.  In addition, the RMP Coordinator works closely with the Safety and Worker Protection Manager to integrate the elements of OSHA's PSM program (where applicable) as required under Section 68.15 of the RMP rule.  \n\nThe RMP Coordinator serves as the chairman of the facility's RMP Steering Committee.  This committee comprises members with responsibilities for developing and managing specific elements of our risk management and process safety programs.  The members of this committee are assigned by the President based on recommendations f"

Currently, the members of the RMP Steering Committee include the following: \n\n *  RMP Coordinator (Technical Manager)\n *  PSM Coordinator (Safety and Worker Protection Manager)\n *  Production Manager\n *  Employee Representative(s)\n\nThe following sections identify the specific responsibilities for each aspect of our risk management and process safety management programs.\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENTS\n\nThe Technical Manager has the responsibility for (1) ensuring that offsite consequence analyses for each regulated process are consistently performed and documented in accordance with Sections 68.20 through 68.39 and (2) selecting the scenarios that will be reported in the facility Risk Management Program Plan as required under Section 68.165. The Safety Manager is responsible for ensuring that the accident history for each covered process is appropriately documented and maintained in accordance with Section 68.42 and 68.168 of the RMP rule.\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nTradeMark has had no reportable releases of anhydrous ammonia from the process since the commencement of operations at the Old Hopewell Road facility in 1983.  We have always taken a pro-active stance in the safety of our employees and the surrounding community and environment.\n\nPREVENTION PROGRAMS\n\nThe RMP and PSM Coordinators have the responsibility for ensuring that the facility has an integrated, effective, and compliant prevention program that meets EPA RMP (Sections 68.65 through 68.87 of the RMP rule) and OSHA PSM requirements.  Although the Coordinators have many specific individual responsibilities, some of the responsibilities for specific program elements are assigned to other members of the PSM and RMP Steering Committees (as listed in the following sections).\n\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION\n\nThe responsibility for process safety information (PSI) (Section 68.65 of the RMP rule) is divided between two individuals.

The PSM and RMP Coordinators identify candidate PHA team leaders from within the facility and ensure that they receive appropriate training before leading PHAs.  The Coordinators may also use outside contractors to lead PHAs when appropriate.  The other members of the RMP Steering Committee are responsible for (1) ensuring that the information and personnel necessary to conduct PHAs are available according to the PHA implementation schedule and (2) resolving recommendations that are assigned to their respective areas.\n\nOPERATING PROCEDURES\n\nIn accordance with Section 68.69 of the RMP rule, the Production Manager has the responsibility for ensuring that complete and accurate operating procedures are in place for all regulated processes.  The Production Manager works closely with the Technical Manager and the Safety and Worker Protection Manager to develop and maintain the facility's safe work practices.\n\nTRAINING\n\nIn accordance with Section 68.71 of the RMP rule, the Safety Manager has the responsibility for (1) ensuring that operations employees receive and understand training applicable to their specific jobs and the associated processes and (2) documenting the training.
