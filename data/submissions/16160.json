Box 430\nBrooten, MN     56316-0430\n\nFor further information, contact Randy Gruhlke, Operations Manager.\n\nRisk Management Plan - Executive Summary\n\n1.  The Facility Policy\n\nThe owners, management and employees of Lakeside Foods, Inc. are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia and propane.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.  The Facility Process\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the processing of peas, sweet corn and lima beans in a frozen state.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is used as a refrigerant in the processing of our vegetables.  Propane gas is used to fuel our boiler, providing hot water for the blanching step in our process.  Propane is also used as a fuel to provide heat to the facility during and after the pack season as needed.\n\nThe maximum amount of ammonia stored at the facility would be 21,000 pounds, most of which would be stored in the high-pressure receiver.\n\nThe maximum amount of propane gas stored would be 108,000 pounds within the 30,000 gallon storage tank.\n\n3.  The Worst-Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario\n\nA.  The worst-case release scenario for anhydrous ammonia would be the release of the total contents of the high-pressure receiver as a gas over ten minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 17,000 pounds .  Due to the fact that the high-pressure receiver is located within the facility, the EPA formula of 0.55 as a multiplication factor in relation to the mitigation factor of a release within a building, the total release would be 9,350 pounds at 935 pounds/minute.  According to EPA lookup tables, the distance to the toxic endpoint is 0.62 miles.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario for propane would be the failure of one 30,000 gallon storage tank"

According to EPA lookup tables, the distance to the toxic endpoint is .43 miles.\n\nB.  The alternative release scenario for anhydrous ammonia based on the hazard review is a two-minute release from a break in a 2-inch pipe.  Because some of the piping at the facility is located on the exterior, the mitigation factor of a building does not apply.  The release rate would be 5,954 pounds/minute with a total of 11,908 total mass release.  According to EPA lookup tables, the distance to the toxic endpoint would be 0.56 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for propane would be the failure of one 30,000 gallon storage tank when filled to 85% capacity, (108,000 pounds), resulting in two-thirds of a vapor cloud explosion.  According to EPA lookup tables, the distance to the toxic endpoint is (factor of .67 x .43 miles = .29 miles) 0.29 miles.\n\n4.  The Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements For The Storage And Handling Of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc. and the standards of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage And Handling Of Anhydrous Ammonia\".  For propane, NFPA-58 rules apply.\n\n5.  The Five Year Accident History\n\nA.  There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia or propane in the last five years that:\n      -  Have caused any deaths, injuries or significant damage at the facility.\n      -  Have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or           \n         environmental damage.\n\n6.  The Emergency Response Program\n\nThe facility has:\n\nA.  A written Emergency Action Plan , in accordance with OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.38.\n\nB.  Provided state and local authorities the Emergency Planning And Community Right-To-Know information as r"

There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia or propane recommendations for implementation."
