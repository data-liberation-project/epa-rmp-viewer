The program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of anhydrous ammonia. Overall, the program is designed to prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.\n\nOur company has an exemplary safety record, one that we are quite proud of. Our company has many policies and procedures in place to promote overall plant, worker and public safety.  We have: (1) prepared a unified program based on the PSM plan to meet CalARP obligations as well; (2) reorganized the program so that it meshes more closely with general Bee Sweet Citrus business practices; and (3) reviewed plan documentation forms and responsibilities.  The unified Risk & Process Safety Management Plan sets forth rules, procedures and practices that will help our employees protect themselves and our neighbors.\n2.    DESCRIPTION OF AMMONIA SYSTEM\n\nBee Sweet Citrus operates a commercial packing and storage facility for oranges in Fowler, CA.  The facility has two ammonia systems.  The following descriptions will explain each.\n\nDegreening Side\n\nBee Sweet Citrus' degreening side can hold a charge of 7,000 lbs.  The degreening side has an ammonia system that provides refrigeration capacity to eighteen cold storage rooms.  The rooms use ceiling suspended evaporator coils that contain chilled liquid ammonia.  A computer system provides subs"

From there, low pressure liquid is pumped to each cold room, where it passes through a solenoid valve, hand expansion valve and into evaporator coils.  Low temperature liquid circulates through the evaporator coils.  Low pressure and temperature gas and overfeed liquid passes through regulators and is returned to the liquid recirculator.  The residual liquid is separated from the gas in the accumulator and the suction gas is piped to two screw compressors which elevate the temperature and pressure of the gas.  The high pressure discharge from the compressors is sent to water cooled evaporative condensers where the high pressure gas ammonia is liquified and returned to a thermosyphon vessel  and from the thermosyphon vessel it returns to the high pressure receiver. High pressure liquid  from the thermosyphon vessel is supplied to the oil coolers on each screw compressor. High temperature liquid is evaporated in the oil cooler and a combination of high temperature gas and liquid is returned to the thermosyphon vessel by thermosyphon action.   \n\nFresh Side\n\nBee Sweet Citrus' storage side can hold a charge of 6,000 lbs.  The storage side has an ammonia system that provides refrigeration capacity to four cold rooms.  The rooms use ceiling suspended evaporator coils that contain chilled liquid ammonia.  Some of the ceiling suspended coils operate under flooded conditions and some under direct expansion.  A computer system provides substantial control and alarm capability.  \n\nThe flooded portion of the system operates as follows.  High pressure liquid from a high pressure receiver is piped to each cold room where it passes through an expansion valve into a low pressure accumulator vessel mou"

Low pressure and temperature gas collects in the accumulator vessel, and passes through a pressure regulator into a suction line.  The suction line returns the vapor to the primary accumulator vessel located in the engine room, which separates any residual liquid from the gas.  The gas is piped to two screw compressors which elevate the temperature and pressure of the gas.  The high pressure discharge from the compressors is sent to a water cooled evaporative condensers where the high pressure gas ammonia is liquified and returned to the high pressure receivers. Liquid separated from the suction return gas in the primary accumulator vessels drains into the liquid transfer vessel.  Operation of a float switch activated solenoid valve raises the pressure in the liquid transfer vessel to the point the liquid can be drained into the high pressure receiver.  \n\nThe direct expansion portion of the system operates as follows.  High pressure liquid from a high pressure receiver is piped to each dx coil, where it passes through a thermostatic expansion valve into a ceiling suspended coil.  Low pressure and temperature leaves the coil and passes through a pressure regulator into a suction line.  The suction line returns the vapor to the primary accumulator located in the engine room.  The rest of the process is identical to the flooded system.\n\nThe Bee Sweet Citrus facility was originally built more than 10 years ago and has been added to and modified several times over the years since then.  The facility was designed and installed by professional refrigeration engineers in accordance with industry standards at the time.  It was also built in compliance with the Uniform Mechanical Code and Uniform Building Code applicable at the time of construction.

Lastly, an emergency \"dump box\" contains switches and valves to turn off equipment and vent ammonia if necessary.\n    \nThe ammonia system at Bee Sweet Citrus' facility consists of vessels which are interconnected, or which are co-located such that a release of ammonia could impact the ability to operate vessels that are not directly connected.  Therefore, the main facility is treated as a single process.\n3.    GENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE & AMMONIA SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\nThe ammonia refrigeration systems at the  Bee Sweet Citrus facility are an integral part of the overall business.   The degreening side contains a charge of 7,000 lbs and the storage side contains a charge of 6,000 lbs. It is extremely important that it is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner.  Management is committed to making sure that all employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.  Bee Sweet Citrus has also conducted an off-site impact analysis of worst-case and alternate-case release scenarios for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release.  The results of this analysis are reported in the body of the program.\n\nOur refrigeration personnel monitor the ammonia refrigeration system/process and keep an active journal of all procedures and transactions that pertain to ammonia.  In addition, the system/process is checked frequently by our outside refrigeration contractor, California Controlled Atmosphere, who also performs an annual pre-season preventative maintenance review of our system/process equipment. \n\nWe inform our employees of the dangers of an accidental release of ammonia in pre-season safety meetings.  New employees are made aware of the potential risk of ammonia in an employee orientation meeting.  During these meetings we also discuss preventati"

FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nBee Sweet Citrus has not had any reportable accidents within the last five years.\n5.    EMERGENCY ACTION PLAN\nThis facility's emergency response program is based on the Cal/OSHA requirements for Emergency Action Plans (in California CCR Title 8, Section 3220, \"Emergency Action Plans.\"  Federally, Title 29 CFR 1910.38 and 1910.119), HAZWOPER (standard (in California CCR Title 8, Section 5192, \"Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response,\" and Title 29 CFR 1910.120). \nStrategically, we will respond defensively to a release.  Under this plan our ammonia refrigeration personnel will take whatever steps are necessary to bring a release under control. The first priority will be to operate the ammonia system to bring a release under control safely, from a distance, without donning personal protective equipment. To better prepare for this type of action, initial training to the defensive level (First Responder, Operations Level) as defined in the HAZWOPER regulations will take place within the next year. All response activities would be done in coordination with the local fire department and the Fresno County Fire Department and the Hazardous Materials Response Team.\n\nEvery year at the beginning of the season we review with our employees our evacuation procedures in the event of an emergency, including an ammonia release. \n6.    PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nOur company has an outstanding safety record, one that we are quite proud of.  Many policies and procedures have been implemented to promote overall plant, worker and public safety.  Nevertheless, Bee Sweet Citrus continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.  Preparation of this Risk & Process Safety Management Program has been the primary recent improvement, and implementation of the program is our plan for improved safety in the near future.\n\nThe Risk & Process Safety Management Program has been "

Our operator assisted in the writing of Standard Operating Procedures, and they are presented in a format that is easy to use.  \n\nFor the future, Bee Sweet Citrus now thinks of the Risk & Process Safety Management Program as a \"living document\".
