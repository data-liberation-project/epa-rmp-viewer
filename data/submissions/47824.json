      "SummaryText": "Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe management of Sara Lee is committed to maintaining a safe work environment. An Environment & Safety Administrator has been assigned to ensure that safe practices are followed in the specification and operation of systems involving hazardous chemicals. This site has developed and trained personnel to assist the Alameda County Fire Department to ensure rapid and appropriate response to ammonia emergencies. The site has specific and written evacuation, reporting, and response procedures in place to protect Sara Lee employees, the public, and the environment in the event of an ammonia release. \n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\nThe Sara Lee plant covered by this RMP is located at 2411 Baumann Ave in San Lorenzo, California. The facility is divided into two areas: Raw and Ready to Eat. The Raw portion of the plant receives, processes, and prepares meats for cooking or curing. The Ready to Eat portion of the plant packages the prepared products.\n\nProducts from this plant include Gallo Salame? Italian Dry Salame and Pepperoni; Galileo? Italian Dry Salame, Pepperoni, Roast Beef, Summer Sausage, Deli Style Cooked Meats; Deli d'Italia? Italian Dry Salame, Genoa, Mortadella, Cotto; Heineman & Stern? Roast Beef, Corned Beef, Pastrami, Loaves, Sliced Meats, Hard Salami and La Italia? Italian Dry Salame, Pepperoni. \nA stationary anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system is used for room cooling and process water chilling. The potential total anhydrous ammonia charge to the system is 15,000 pounds. This ammonia refrigeration system is the only process at this site to which the RMP requirements are applicable.\n\nThe site includes a large processing building with administration offices; the refrigeration engine room; the shipping and receiving areas; and employee and visitor parking lots. Some refrigeration equipment and piping are located outdoors. \n\nThe refrigeration system at the facility consists of piping,"

      "SummaryText": " valves, process equipment, and ammonia. The closed system cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for the cooling and storage of the products and production rooms. Changes in the pressure are directly related to changes in temperature (i.e., lowering the ammonia pressure lowers its temperature). Low pressure liquid ammonia provides refrigeration by removing ambient heat. Removal of ambient heat causes the liquid ammonia (contained with the system) to vaporize. Heat is later removed from the ammonia and discharged to the atmosphere as it is condensed back into liquid.\n\nRelease Scenarios\n\nThe worst-case release scenario considered for this process was defined as the greatest amount held in a single vessel (i.e., 13,000 pounds in the Controlled Pressure Receiver), taking into account administrative controls that limit the maximum quantity.  Since the vessel is located in the ammonia refrigeration engine room within 5 feet of an exterior door, there are no mitigating controls assumed. The estimated distance to the toxic endpoint for the worst-case scenario is 1.5 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario considered for this process is a release of ammonia from a ruptured liquid line caused by thermal expansion due to double blocking of the line. The largest-volume outdoor liquid line was assumed, and the entire length of this 6-inch nominal inside diameter line between blocking valves was included (100 feet). No administrative controls or mitigation measures were considered to limit the off-site consequence distance for this scenario. The estimated distance to the toxic endpoint for the alternative release scenario is 0.1 mile.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nPrevention of accidental ammonia releases at Sara Lee is accomplished through sound industry practice in the"

January 2007) resulting in onsite or off-site injuries, deaths, or property damage, or in off-site environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place. \n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nSara Lee has developed an Emergency Planning and Response document to ensure adequate preparedness with rapid and appropriate response to ammonia release emergencies. The plan is maintained at the site?s Safety Office. The document describes outside agency notification procedures in the event of an ammonia release, provides detailed evacuation procedures, and includes response procedures for the mitigation of ammonia releases. \n\nThe Fire Department will be used to respond to any catastrophic leaks.
