The rule requires facilities to provide an executive summary of the following information:\r\n\r\nA?A\u00a0\tAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\tAirgas Carbonic has developed and implemented a spill prevention control & countermeasure (SPCC) plan, an emergency action plan (EAP), and a process safety management (PSM) plan as part of its accidental release / emergency response program.  The programs involve a range of senior management personnel (including local production and management personnel and Airgas Carbonic's Corporate EHS Manager).  Additionally, Airgas Carbonic conducts regular safety meetings and training involving many levels of personnel.  Airgas Carbonic's policies and procedures are outlined in the respective plans.  Airgas Carbonic's corporate policy is to inspect, maintain and operate equipment and facilities to prevent accidents (including release of hazardous materials) and to train employees in prevention, as well as to prepare them to respond rapidly and effectively should an accident occur.\r\n\t\r\nA?A\u00a0Stationary Sources and Regulated Substances Handled - Refrigeration (anhydrous ammonia)\r\n\tAmmonia is used in the production of dry ice (CO2).  The facility operates a closed loop anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system with a total storage capacity of approximately 16,000 pounds.  The majority of the refrigeration components are located in the main manufacturing facility, with the exception of the condensers located outside the facility.\r\n\t\r\nA?A\u00a0General Accident Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\tThe Airgas Carbonic facility maintains a Process Safety Management (PSM) of Highly Hazardous Chemicals plan prepared in accordance with the Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) regulation 29 CFR"

As part of this program, maintenance personnel inspect the refrigeration system operating parameters and monitoring system regularly documenting observations.\r\n\t\r\nA?A\u00a0Five-year Accident History\r\n\tThere have been no accidents involving ammonia at this facility nor any off-site consequence that have resulted in death(s), injuries, property damage, evacuations, environmental damage or sheltering in place.\r\n\r\nA?A\u00a0Emergency Response Program\r\n\tAirgas Carbonic has implemented an Emergency Action Plan in accordance with OSHA regulations.  The facility retains an emergency response contractor to respond in the event of a hazardous material release, fire or other emergency situation.  The EAP contains specific information regarding emergency organization and procedures as well as incident notification, mitigation, and incident preparedness.  Airgas Carbonic conducts regular training including refreshers.  Also, Airgas Carbonic conducts periodic drills coordinated with local emergency responders (Hopkinsville Fire Department).\r\n\r\nA?A\u00a0Planned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\tAirgas Carbonic upgraded the ammonia system in May/June 2010 to increase througput capacity.  Additional safety equipment including exhaust fans and monitoring/detection system(s) are slated for installation before the end of 2010. Airgas Carbonic also plans to install a partition-wall to separate the ammonia refrigeration equipment from the ice manufacturing area and personnel. Also, the facility conducts regular equipment inspections (e.g., visual assessment for rust & corrosion) to ensure the mechanical integrity of the refrigeration system."
