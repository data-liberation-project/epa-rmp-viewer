This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. Our plant adheres to process safety policies, guidelines, and best practices that have been developed based on company and industry experience over the years. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the incident.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\nThe Ineos Nitriles USA LLC Plant is located at 1900 Ft. Amanda Road, Lima OH 45804 and is owned by Ineos LLC.  Our facility is a major producer of industrial chemical products. The plant's primary product, acrylonitrile, is manufactured by combining ammonia, propylene and air.  Acrylonitrile is a key ingredient in synthetic fibers, plastics and nitrile rubber.  We have 6 regulated substances present at our facility. These substances include Acrylonitrile [2-Propenenitrile], Hydrocyanic Acid, Propylene [1-Propene], Ammonia (anhydrous), Formaldehyde (solution) and Sulfur Dioxide (anhydrous). Hydrocyanic Acid [HCN] is a co-product produced in the acrylonitrile process and is used as a raw material for making a variety of chemicals. Propylene [1-Propene] is used for as a raw material for the production of acrylonitrile. Ammonia (anhydrous) is used as a raw material to combine with propylene for the production of acrylonitrile. Formaldehyde (solution) is used in a purification step for acrylonitrile co-product production. Sulfur Dioxide (anhydrous) is used as an inhibitor for the purification and storage"

These procedures are developed/revised by experienced operators as needed and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. The procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate. The procedures are revised as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\r\nSafe operating limits are also maintained to provide guidance on how to respond to upper or lower exceedences for specific process or equipment parameters. This information, along with the written operating procedures, is readily available to the process operators and other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\r\nThe INEOS Nitriles USA LLC plant has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety. Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous materials before process piping or equipment is opened, and (4) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space. These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\r\n\r\nTRAINING\r\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the INEOS Nitriles USA LLC plant has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process. New employees receive basic training in chemical plant operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. After the new operator demonstrates (i.e. throug"

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\r\nThis plant primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations. HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques. The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner. The LOPA (Layer Of Protection Analysis) method is employed during the PHA to evaluate the adequacy of credited protection layers.  \r\nTo help ensure that the process controls and or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, this plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years as long as the process exists. The recommendations from these updates are also forwarded to management. Final resolution of the recommendations is tracked, documented, and retained.\r\n\r\nOPERATING PROCEDURES\r\nThe INEOS Nitriles USA LLC plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process o"
