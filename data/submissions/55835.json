Windsor Foods, Benardi brands is a producer of frozen italian foods.  The facility is currently undergoing a change to the east refrigeration system, which will result in an overall decrease in the total amount of ammonia on-site.\n\nThe NAICS code for the facility is 311822.  A large portion of the facility is refrigerated to preserve products for processing and distribution.   \n\nThe facility uses ammonia for refrigeration, and is regulated under 40 CFR Part 68, the EPA RMP Rule. There are two (2) refrigeration systems onsite that are used for refrigerating coolers and freezers at the facility. \n\nThe amount of ammonia in the west refrigeration system is approximately 6,500 pounds.  The west refrigeration system is used for cooling in spiral freezers and compressor oil cooling.  The west refrigeration system consists of two (2) high stage compressors, one (1) low stage compressor, two (2) evaporative condensers, two (2) spiral freezers, one (1) low temperature recirculator with oil pot and ammonia pumps, one (1) intermediate intercooler, one (1) high pressure receiver, and one (1) auto purger.\n\nThe amount of ammonia in the new east refrigeration system has been calculated at approximately 13,500 pounds.  The new east refrigeration system will be used for cooling in spiral freezers, dock freezers, process freezers and coolers, storage freezers and coolers, and compressor oil cooling.  The new east refrigeration system consists of six (6) high stage compressors, four (4) low stage compressors, four (4) evaporative condensers, three (3) storage freezer evapor"
