Our processes are audited by the Safe Quality Food Institute, the only North American organization recognized by the Global Food Safety Initiative. We are SQF Level 3 Certified, the SQF's highest rating. We are committed to creating a clean, safe work environment, not only for food safety but also for the safety of our employees.

We will safely produce products to our customers' specification each time, and be recognized by our customers as the best supplier in our industry.\"\n\n\n\nQuincy Street Inc. is a privately held, for profit, organization with the primary objective of producing high quality pork based food for nationally known companies. The majority of our products are sold in both the retail and institutional market places. Due to the refrigerated food products that are produced, Quincy Street Inc. utilizes a series of coolers, spiral freezers and storage freezers to maintain the integrity of its products and raw materials. The chemical that is used at the facility to perform the cooling and freezing of the environment and products is Anhydrous Ammonia. Because of its moderate toxicity and slight flammability, ammonia is considered a hazardous material.\n\n\n\nQuincy Street Inc. is committed to maintaining safe manufacturing operations for our employees and the surrounding community. We follow all industry codes and standards, including the Michigan Occupational Safety and Health Administration (29 CFR 1910.119) and Environmental Protection Agency (40 CFR 68).
