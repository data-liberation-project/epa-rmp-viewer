It is also our policy to provide training to all employees in emergency response and evacuation procedures.\n\nECKERT COLD STORAGE utilizes an ammonia refrigeration system. The system contains 12,000 pounds of ammonia and  is used to cool and freeze vegetables.\n\nWorst-case scenarios and alternative scenarios have been modeled.\n\nECKERT COLD STORAGE has operated in Manteca since 1970 and has not had a release of ammonia in the past 5 years of operation.\n\nAs mentioned before all employees are trained in emergency response and evacuation procedures. Supervisors and Maintenance employees receive additional training, which includes the names and numbers of the organizations that must be notified in an emergency.\n\nChanges to improve the safety of the system are brought up in the Safety Committee meetings and discussed. If significant changes are made, the RMP document will be revised accordingly."
