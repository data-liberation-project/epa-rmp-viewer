      "SummaryText": "The Hillsborough County Water Department (HCWD) has an accidental release prevention policy integrating technology, established procedures and, management practices into an unified approach to risk management.  The HCWD operates a number of water and wastewater treatment facilities in unincorporated Hillsborough County.  These plants adhere to all applicable procedures and policies of the United States Environmental Protection Agency, the Florida Department of Environmental Protection and the Florida Department of Community Affairs.\n\nVan Dyke Wastewater Treatment Plant.\n\nThe Van Dyke Wastewater Treatment Plant is located at 191410 Ramblewood Road, Tampa, Fl  33556.  The site is in Northwest Hillsborough County.\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis.\n\nThe offsite analysis includes consideration of two chlorine release scenarios, identified a worst case release and alternative scenario.  The first scenario is defined by the EPA, which states the owner or operator shall assume that the maximum quantity in the largest vessel is released as a gas over ten minutes, due to an unspecified failure.  The alternative scenario is identified as more likely to occur than the worst case scenario.\n\nThe worst case scenario at Van Dyke WWTP involves an unspecified failure of a single one ton container of chlorine. The off site consequence analysis was performed for two sets of conditions both utilizing EPA lookup charts.\n\nThe first scenario followed the EPA definition for worst case and assumed the release of the entire amount of gas in ten minutes, use of the ERPG-2 as the toxic endpoint and consideration of the population within a full circle with radius corresponding to the toxic endpoint distance. EPA set these conditions to facilitate the performance of the offsite consequence analysis. The HCWD believes the EPA assumptions to be unrealistic.\n\nA. Only a fraction of the compressed liquified chlorine released to the atmosphere flashes to vapor.  The remaining liquid forms liquid droplet a"

This results in the formation of a very dense chlorine cloud consisting of vapor and liquid droplets with dispersion characteristics significantly different than for a cloud of chlorine gas.\n\nB.  Only the population with an elliptical plume extending downwind of the release point is potentially affected. The plume area, or footprint, is approximatley six percent of the area of the full circle.\n\nMitigation systems at the Van Dyke Wastewatger Treatment Plant include a chlorine leak detection system and vacuum piping.  The system will significantly reduce the amount of chlorine released in case of a pigtail or piping failure.\n\nRelease Prevention Program.\n\nThe HCWD release prevention program is based on several element:\nTraing of staff.\nPreventative maintenance program.\nState of the art process and safety equipment.\nAccurate, effective operating procedures.\nHazard review of equipment and procedures.\nIn house inspection program.\n\nChemiocal specific prevention steps include the availability of Self Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA) worn by operators during connection/disconnection of the chlorine containers, a high level of recognition of the hazardous and toxic properties of chlorine, and the presence of chlorine detection eqyuipment.  The facility maintains a chlorine repair kit."
