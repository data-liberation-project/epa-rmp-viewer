      "SummaryText": "t.\n\nPREVENTION PROGRAM:\n\nThe Tampa Terminal is subject to OSHA Process Safety Management Rule, and is therefore under the EPA Risk Management Rule. It is a Program 3 facility with a Program 3 Prevention Program. The OSHA PSM/EPA Prevention Program consists of a set of facility management policies and procedures which promote and recognize process safety and the prevention of accidents in plants that handle, use, store, and process hazardous chemicals above the threshold quantity specified. The procedures address all aspects of plant activities, including training, maintenance, operating procedures, process reviews, safe work practices, incident investigation, audits, and other activities in a manner to provide controls to prevent errors, failures, and inadvertent changes in a process which could result in accidents.\n\nThe prevention program consists of many elements and policies, which are briefly outlined below.\n\nEMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION: Employees participate in all aspects of the program, and are provided with the information developed in the program.\n\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION: All necessary process information and records are maintained in several convenient locations, including information on the hazards of the chemicals, process technology with safe operating limits, and equipment records and design requirements.\n\nPROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS: Contract employees, with extensive professional training in the methods of process hazard analysis (PHA), are retained to act as PHA team leaders and work in conjunction with the Terminal employees. These reviews are updated on a regular basis.\n\nOPERATING PROCEDURES: Operating procedures are in place for all aspects of the operation, including emergency operation and shutdown.\n\nOPERATIONS TRAINING: All operators receive initial training in the process and its operating procedures and are supervised by an experienced operator for a lengthy training period before being allowed to control the process on their own. They must pass "

All contractor employees are required to attend an initial 16 hour OSHA/MSHA structured class offered at several local community training facilities. Contractors are also required to have had recent site-specific training from the facility. Periodic evaluations are made to assure that work is completed in a safe manner.\n\nPRE-STARTUP REVIEW: A safety review is conducted on any new process equipment or any significant modification of the process. This assures that construction and equipment installed are in accordance with design, that all necessary procedures, including safety procedures, are in place, that necessary training is completed, and that hazard analysis or other requirements of management of change are completed.\n\nMECHANICAL INTEGRITY: This is a quality assurance procedure to assure that equipment, parts, materials, and installations are suitable for the applications intended. Maintenance employees are trained in process hazards and safety procedures applicable to their work. Inspections, procedures, and testing are conducted under this part of the program.\n\nSAFE WORK PRACTICES: Procedures and policies for all work permits and maintenance lockout/tagout\nprocedures are in force, and are periodically reviewed for completeness and effectiveness.\n\nMANAGEMENT OF CHANGE: No changes in the process or procedures are allowed without a review and authorization. Safety impacts, technical review, required procedure modifications, and training needed are all considered in this review.\n\nINCIDENT INVESTIGATION: Any accident, near-miss, or incident that resulted in, or could have resulted in, an ammonia release is promptly investigated by a facility team. Findings of the investigation team and their recommendations for corrective action are documented, as is the resolution of t"

The rule requires an analysis involving the release of the total contents of the largest storage vessel of ammonia at this site. This is called the \"worst case toxic release scenario\" (worst case scenario) and involves the release of 32,250 tons of ammonia. This release must be considered to occur over a 10- minute period and pooling of the ammonia can be considered when modeling this release. We have retained a consultant to model this unlikely release utilizing a model known as DEGADOSE. His modeling results, according to the rule, determined that there would be off-site impacts. This worst case is a requirement of the rule, regardless of whether the event is likely, or if it could even reasonably occur. \n\nAn alternate scenario, which is a more likely event, is required to be submitted. The alternate case chosen involved the release of ammonia from a transfer pipe where 96,000 pounds would be released over a 2 minute period. A significantly lower quantity is involved because various shutdown safeguards have been installed and operator intervention will tend to mitigate and limit the quantity in such cases. The same modeling techniques were applied and resulted in much lesser off-site impact.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES FOR SAFETY IMPROVEMENTS: \n\nSafety improvements are a continual and ongoing process at the Tampa Ammonia Terminal facility. This process is facilitated by the Prevention Program/Process Safety Management Program. Many process safeguards have been implemented as a result of the Process Hazard Analysis and the Incident Investigation activities. The increased emphasis on security measures since September 11, 2001 "

Findings of the audit are documented and any deficiencies are corrected and documented.\n\n5-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY: \n\nThe Risk Management rule requires inclusion of the 5-year accident history of the facility for all accidental releases that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or any known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage. Under these criteria, there have been three release incidents in the facility's last five years, although only one was of the Reportable Quantity of 100 pounds. These three incidents are reported in Section 6 of this submission and are summarized below.\n\n* April 1, 2002 at 1:45 p.m., duration of 5 minutes, vapor release from the 33K Storage Tank vacuum/vent valve, caused by warm ammonia from a discharging vessel creating a tank pressure spike and with human error contributing (poor communication with ship), estimated release of 1,300 pounds, resulted in no deaths, 16 first aid cases off-site, no property or environmental damage.\n\n* February 4, 2003 at 4:00 p.m., duration of less than one minute, vapor release from a safety valve on the inlet piping to the CP Condenser, caused by over-pressurization due to a combination of human error (failure to open valve to the Receiver) and mechanical failure (alarm switch failed due to bad wiring), estimated release of 25 pounds, resulted in no deaths, no injuries, no property or environmental damage, but required approximately 300 off-site personnel to shelter in place briefly.\n\n* March 5, 2003 at 11:00 a.m., duration of 10 minutes, liquid release vaporizing to the air from a pump seal, caused by gas pocket in pump causing false 0 pressure reading and human error (mechanic loosened seal without first purging pump with nitrogen), estimated release of 60 poun"
