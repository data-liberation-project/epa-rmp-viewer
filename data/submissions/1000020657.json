EPA requires regulated facilities to submit Risk Management Plans describing the risk management program at its facilities. This document is intended to satisfy the RMPlan requirements of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management system at Weyerhaeuser Columbus Cellulose Fibers.  \n\n\n\nAccidental release and emergency response policy:\n\n\n\nTo protect the environment and the health and safety of our employees and the public, we expect full compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. The facility's emphasis on accident prevention is demonstrated by having one of the lowest Recordable Injury Rates in the industry, being among the first pulp & paper facilities in the United States to achieve OSHA Voluntary Protection Program (VPP) Star status and through emphasis on continuous improvement in its safety programs. \n\n\n\nThe emergency response program has a trained emergency response team with equipment for responding to on-site fires, hazardous material releases, emergency medical response and rescue. The program has a dedicated emergency response coordinator responsible for coordinating the weekly training and development of the emergency response team. Response activities have been discussed with the Lowndes LEPC and county fire departments and LEPC meetings have been conducted at the facility to increase their awareness of the hazards at the plant as well as the resources. \n\n\n\nThe commitment to an injury free work environment is supported by a safety management system that includes\n\n?    OSHA Star Voluntary Protection Plan certification\n\n?    Plant Safety & Health Guideline Documentation including Safe Work Practices\n\n?    Job Safety Analysis\n\n?

The facility manufactures bleached kraft pulp and employs about 350 employees. The bleached kraft pulp operation manufactures papergrade and fluff pulp. The papergrade and fluff pulp is sold and made, respectively, into fine paper and absorbent products such as diapers.\n\n\n\nChlorine dioxide is the only RMP covered chemical used, manufactured or stored on the plant site in quantities above the designated Threshold Quantity. Chlorine dioxide (ClO2) gas is a yellowish/green gas used to bleach kraft pulp. There are 2 ClO2 solution storage tanks with a volume of 94,000 gallons each. The chlorine dioxide generator is capable of manufacturing about 600 gallons/minute at a concentration of about 11.2 grams/liter solution (1.12%). \n\n\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program:\n\n\n\nThe CCF accident prevention p"

In the worst-case situation, this type of release would coincide with meteorological conditions that would result in minimal dilution of the vessel contents. The endpoint for toxic substances is the maximum airborne concentration below which nearly all individuals can be exposed for up to one hour without developing serious health effects which could impair the ability to take protective cover.  The toxic endpoint for Chlorine Dioxide is 0.0028 mg/L (Appendix A of Part 68).  The distance to endpoint was determined using RMP*Comp, a software program developed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).\n\n\n\nThe worst-case scenario for the CCF facility involves a tank rupture, which would result in the release of both of tanks, since the tanks are in communication.  This corresponds to a release of 188,000 gallons of Chlorine Dioxide. With a density of 11.2 grams/liter the 188,000 gallons translates to approximately 17,572 pounds of chlorine dioxide.  The distance to endpoint for this release is approximately twenty five miles (25) miles.\n\n\n\nHazard Assessment, Alternative Release Scenario:\n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario is an event more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario and will reach an endpoint offsite, unless no such scenario exists. In determining the distance to endpoint for the alternative release scenario, any mitigation controls employed in the process can be used.  The distance to endpoint for the alternative release scenario was determined using RMP*Comp.\n\n\n\nThe most likely alternative scenario for the CCF facility would also involve a tank rupture.  The release rate would be approximately 5.4 pou"

Approximately 50 yards from the tanks is another gas detector which adds another level of warning.  The detectors would allow for faster mitigation of the leak.  The alarm sounds at 1 ppm.  The bleach plant control room can close the connection between the tanks.  Additionally, a manual emergency stop is approximately 100 yards to the west of the tanks.  The corresponding distance to endpoint for the alternative scenario would be 0.4 miles.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information:\n\n\n\nIn accordance with RMP requirements the covered stationary sources must compile and maintain on-site safety information related to the regulated substance, processes, and equipment.   The information includes the following:\n\n1.     Material Safety Data Sheets;\n\n2.     Maximum intended inventory of the vessels;\n\n3.

Development of Standard Operating Procedure (SOPs) are assigned to employees that have recognized knowledge, experience, and job skills related to the assigned procedure. \n\n3.    Implementation of new processes or procedures is assigned to a commissioning team. These assignments typically include an opportunity for a critique of the work processes and procedures.\n\n\n\n\n\nEmployee Training: \n\n\n\nCCF trains employees to safely and effectively perform their assigned tasks. Employees are trained through self-taught learning materials including operation manuals, educational modules and computer based education programs. In addition, employees are trained one-on-one through on-the-job training in the field. Employees are encouraged to identify education needs and take part in education development and implementation. Skills are demonstrated through written exams, oral exams, and through proficiency demonstrations. The requirements of 40 CFR Part 68 allows the responsible official of the facility to certify that any employee involved in the process has been trained regarding process operations.  This certification can be found in Appendix B, Form 4. \n\n\n\nRefresher training is required as well as the initial training.

In these audits, adherence to both Corporate and mill policies, internal procedures and standards are verified.

Team members at CCF have an integral role in the interface with contractors working at the site. They often work side-by-side with contract employees and have a high level of knowledge about how the contractor's work can affect or be affected by the process or adjacent processes. Each site team member and contract employee is encouraged to ask questions and to raise concerns about unsafe work activities or conditions. Site team members are expected to inform contract employers of the potential hazards of fire, explosion or toxic releases when repairing equipment so that contractors can work on it safely. Contractors are given a PSM Safety Orientation to the hazards of the process, how to protect themselves from those hazards and what to do in the event they do get exposed. After the Safety Orientation they must pass a written exam to document their understanding of the material presented. \n\n\n\nEmergency Planning and Response: \n\n\n\nCCF facility has established a written emergency response program to help safely respond to accidental releases of hazardous substances.
