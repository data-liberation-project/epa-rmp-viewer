The goal of each investigation is to determine the cause(s) and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to Refinery management for review and approval. Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with employees and contractors who could be affected by the findings. Incident investigation reports are retained for at least five years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHA studies.  Management reviews are regularly performed to ensure the quality of investigation program.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information \n\n\n\nThe refinery maintains a variety of procedures, drawings and technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents contain safety related information on topics such as process operation, process equipment, chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters, and equipment design basis.

New operators must first successfully complete a comprehensive series of classroom training sessions on refinery operations.  The new operators are then paired up with more experienced operator to learn process specific procedures, duties and tasks.  After the new operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) they have an adequate knowledge to perform the plant operating duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  The operator is then fully qualified upon completion of the Formal Operating Training Program requirements. In addition, operations personnel receive refresher training on operating procedures at least every 3 years to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained.
