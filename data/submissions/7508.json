This program will help prevent the occurrence of, or minimize the consequences of, catastrophic release by stating our policies and guidelines for the management of process hazards in start-up, operation, inspection, maintenance and the other matters addressed in the federal standard.  Our program calls for maximum employee participation and includes all elements of the employee participation provisions of the federal standard.  We shall, at a minimum: (1) consult with employees and their representatives on the conduct and development of the process hazard review and other elements of the risk management plan, and (2) provide to our employees and their representatives access to the process hazard review and all other information required to be developed under that standard.   \n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe City of Edmond believes that preventative maintenance is the key to minimizing the potential for accidental releases.  Standard Operating Procedures have been reviewed and revised to enable the employees to perform their work in a safe and efficient manner.\n\nThe City of Edmond has chosen to be a non-responding facility in the event of an emergency.  Responsiblity for emergency response to an accidental release has been given to the Edmond Police and Fire Departments and the State and Local Emergency Planning Committee.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Water Treatment Plant (WTP) utilizes chlorine for disinfection of treated water.  The maximum inventory and threshold quantities for chlorine is shown below:\n\nChemical                       Maximum Inventory (lbs.)
