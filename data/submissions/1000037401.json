If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to immediately vacate the premises, move to a safe location, and notify the Blairsburg Volunteer Fire Department (via 911 call) and request that it respond to the emergency. Incidental to the notification to the fire department, a call to the Region 5 LEPC will be made.\r\n\r\nWhile we have planned for an emergency, it is acknowledged that a real emergency will be unexcepted and may very well be different and cannot be ensured to duplicate what we have planned. In reality, the situation that develops may not happen in the manner in which it has been planned. In that event, what we may have planned will serve only as a guideline to follow. \r\n\r\nThe Emergency Action Plan for this facility describes certain procedures that are intended to minimize the hazards associated with the human health and the environment from fires, explosions, the sudden and unexpected release of chemicals (i.e. Anhydrous Ammonia), tornadoes, bomb threats or other accidents or acts of God which might occur on our premises.\r\n\r\nThe primary emergency response coordinator for the Blairsburg, Iowa locations is Mike Nelson, Operations Manager. His work and 24 hour emergency response numbers are provided in the Registration Section of this document. The 24 hour emergency response number provided in that section also provides a telephone tree for additional individuals who are available and can respond to an emergency at that location.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE ANHYDROUS AMMONIA STORAGE/DISTRIBUTION PLANT AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCE HANDLED AT THE NEW COOPERATIVE BLAIRSBURG FERTILIZER PLANT\r\n\r\nThis facility is a bulk anhydrous ammonia storage and distribution plant.

The anhydrous ammonia plant is only operated on a seasonal basis (Spring and Fall). Full-time equivalent employee numbers were computed on that basis.

The anhydrous ammonia system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with ANSI Standard k-61.1989 and state law. \r\n\r\nIn addition the company has specific operating procedures in place intended to minimize the potential for an accidental (and potentially catastrophic) release of anhydrous ammonia. Finally, NEW Cooperative has extended to the Blairsburg Fire Dept the opportunity to visit our anhydrous ammonia plant, to participate in mock emergency simmulation training, and to avail themselves of specific anhydrous ammonia health hazard information and training provided by the company.\r\n\r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY: There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the last five years that have caused any deaths, injuires, evacuations, shelterings in place, property damage or enviromental damage.\r\n\r\nIn the event of an emergency involving our anhydrous system, it is the policy of NEW Cooperative to immediately notify the Blairsburg Fire Dept and the Region 5 LEPC to request that they respond to the emergency.
