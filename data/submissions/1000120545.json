This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program covering design and installation, maintenance, operating procedures and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n2.  \tThe Facility and the Regulated Substances Handled\nThe primary function of the Salt Lake City Water Reclamation Plant (Water Reclamation Plant), is the processing of wastewater and sewage. The one regulated substance present at this facility is chlorine, which is used for disinfection. Our chlorine process and storage facility is capable of a maximum inventory of 32,000.00 pounds; however, the actual quantity of chlorine stored on-site is generally limited to approximately 24,000 pounds.\n\n3.  \tThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program \nThe Water Reclamation Plant has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA. This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with generally recognized wastewater treatment codes. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that are in place/maintained:\n\nProcess Safety Information (PSI)\nSalt Lake City Water Reclamation Plant maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\nThe Water Reclamation Plant conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently. The methodology used to carry out these analyses is What If/Checkl"

The Water Reclamation Plant contracted with Risktec, a third-party Risk Assessment and Management Company to conduct the review/revalidation. The process included personnel from Risktec as well as a cross-sectional team of qualified Plant personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Salt Lake City Water Reclamation Plant maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nThe Water Reclamation Plant has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes. For the chlorine processes, operator competency training is conducted annually. For other processes, refresher training is provided at least every three years and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nThe Water Reclamation Plant conducts detailed maintenance checks and inspections of process equipment to ensure proper operation. The checks and inspections of the following equipment are completed at specific intervals; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps. Checks and inspections are completed by Plant personnel that have attended the training necessary to qualify them for the task. All checks and inspections are documented and any equipment deficiencies identified are reported and corrected in a safe and timely manner.   \n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at Water Reclamation P"

Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employees whose job tasks are affected by any modifications in process conditions are promptly made aware of the change(s) and if/when needed, are provided with training on any changes to their tasks resulting from the modification.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at the Water Reclamation Plant. These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nThe Water Reclamation Plant conducts audits on a regular basis to determine the extent to which the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented. These audits are carried out at least every three years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner. The most recent audits were  conducted by Risktec, a third-party Risk Assessment and Management Company, in January, 2025.\n\nIncident Investigation\nThe Water Reclamation Plant promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance. These investigations are undertaken to identify the factors that contributed to or caused the incident as well as identifying any corrective actions to minimize or eliminate the potential for reoccurrence. All reports are retained for a minimum of five years.\n\nEmployee Participation\nThe Water Reclamation Plant believes that process safety management and incident prevention are an integral part of and supports our goal of continuous improvement.

Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out.  The Salt Lake City Water Reclamation Plant has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related the contractor's work and the processes.  Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\n\n4.  \tFive-year Accident History\nThe Water Reclamation Plant has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last five years.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies, no accidental releases have occurred during this period.\n\n5.  \tEmergency Response Program\nThe Water Reclamation Plant has adopted a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public.\n\nTo ensure reliable operation, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.
