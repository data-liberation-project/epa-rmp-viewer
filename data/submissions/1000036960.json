The Terminal consists of two interconnected operational areas, referred to locally as the East and West Terminals.  The East Terminal portion encompasses an area of 41 acres and is located on the southern bank of the Savannah River at 1 Woodcock Road.  The West Terminal portion encompasses an area of 10 acres and is located at 2 Wahlstrom Road.  The terminal provides tank storage for liquid chemicals, petroleum, liquid fertilizers, and lube oil products.  Materials are distributed by terminal via tank trucks, railcars, and barge.\r\n\r\nTransportation containers that have been unhooked from the motive power that delivered them to the site (e.g., truck or locomotive) and left on site for short-term or long-term storage are part of the stationary source.  At the Savannah terminal railcars are delivered by the railroad company and are unhooked from the locomotive. The east rail siding can unload two butane railcars at the same time.  Since the railcars are co-located, the maximum quantity of each railcar must be totaled.  The butane in the railcar is blended into gasoline stored in tanks at the facility.  The terminal does not currently operate any permanent butane storage.  \r\n\r\nThe butane blending has been designed to meet the requirements of standards set forth in NFPA 58 and is operated in compliance with the OSHA standard for the storage and handling of Liquefied Petroleum Gases (29 CFR 1910.110). The facility has also implemented a Process Safety Management Program (PSM) in compliance with the requirements of OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119. The PSM program requires routine training of detailed written operating procedures, and development of an Emergency Response Action Plan (ERAP). These requirements, and the safety requirements of the referenced standards, provide for the continued safe operation of the facility.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the PSM program developed according to OSHA, Epic Midstream has develop"
