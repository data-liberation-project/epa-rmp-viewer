      "SummaryText": "Great Plains Ethanol is operating as an ethanol fuel production plant located Chancellor, in Turner County, South Dakota.  As a requirement of the Clean Air Act Amendments 112\u00ae Accidental Release of Hazardous Air Substances program, Great Plains Ethanol has reviewed the original risk management plan (RMP) for any chemical stored on-site that will be above the reporting threshold of 10,000 pounds and have updated the information to provide current chemical information usage at the facility.   This revision to the original RMP Submission is made to document changes in the reportable chemicals used by the facility.  The original RMP submission included the use of anhydrous ammonia by the facility - processes used by Great Plains Ethanol were updated to no longer require the use of anhydrous ammonia.  Since anhydrous ammonia is no longer used by Great Plains Ethanol, we are updating our RMP to reflect the absence of that chemical at our facility.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nGreat Plains Ethanol is committed to the protection of its employees, the greater community and the environment from hazardous substances used in the ethanol fuel production process, specifically pentane as a constituent of the natural gasoline used as the ethanol denaturant.   The denaturant is added to the ethanol to make the ethanol unfit for human consumption as required by Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms regulations.  It is the policy of Great Plains Ethanol to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  In the event of an emergency, including an accidental release of denaturant, it is the policy of Great Plains Ethanol to notify the Turner County Sheriff Department and evacuate all employees at the facility.  \n\nRegulated Substances Handled\nThe facility produces fuel grade ethanol from corn and a process by-product known as dry distillers' grain with solubles, which is used as a livestock feed.  The fuel ethanol production process requir"

      "SummaryText": "es use of a denaturant (natural gasoline) which is reported to contain approximately 40 percent pentane (we used 60% for reporting), an RMP regulated substance.  The maximum amount of natural gasoline on-site is estimated to be 339,300 pounds (total pentane is 203,580 pounds).  The natural gasoline is stored in an above ground tank as a liquid and is introduced to the fuel ethanol in the final stage of production.  The denaturant tank is located in the facility's tank farm area which includes a secondary containment dike.  Great Plains Ethanol has evaluated the worst-case and alternative case scenarios as it related to pentane.  An emergency action plan for these scenarios has been prepared and implemented. Great Plains Ethanol has coordinated emergency response with the local authorities and conducts drills.  \n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\nThrough completion of this RMP, Great Plains Ethanol has complied with the EPA requirements under 40 CFR Part 68 and OSHA Process Safety Management requirements.  Process safety information and operations/maintenance procedures are documented on-site.  Periodic functions such as process hazard analysis, training, change management and incident investigation are conducted on a regular basis.  Audits of the overall RMP will be conducted on a regular basis to assure compliance with EPA regulations.\n\nFive Year Accident History\nGreat Plains Ethanol has not had any accidents which may have caused death, injuries, environmental or property damage, evacuations or in-place sheltering in the last five years."
