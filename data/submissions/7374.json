Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nMemphis Distribution Center is part of the  Kroger Company . The facility is a  warehouse that  stores perishable and frozen food products for assembly and distribution to over 100 retail outlets. The facility operates an ammonia refrigeration system to provide cooling and freezing capabilities.  The amount of anhydrous ammonia (CAS #7662-41-7) contained in the system is in excess of 10,000 pounds.  The maximum inventory in the system is approximately 36,000 pounds.  Since an ammonia release from the system could pose a risk of offsite public and/or environmental impact and the system is regulated under the OSHA PSM standard (29 CFR 1910.119), the system is subject to the Program 3 requirements of the EPA's RM program.\n\nC.   Summary of Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nThe worst-case release scenario at the Memphis Distribution Center facility involves the release of 18,367 pounds of ammonia over a 10 minute period due to the failure of the Medium Temperature Vertical Recirculator vessel.  This quantity represents the maximum capacity of the recirculator vessel.  Under worst-case weather conditions, ammonia could travel 1.7 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public. This distance has been calculated based on the method provided in the EPA Risk Management Program (40 CFR 68) Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario is unlikely for the following reasons:\n\n\t \tThe worst-case weather conditions which were used for this scenario are not typical;\n\t \tI"

Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nMemphis Distribution Center recognizes management's responsibility in protecting its employees, the public, the environment, equipment, and property.  The safety and health of all personnel are very important.  The control of accidents has been and will continue to be a basic responsibility of all personnel in the Memphis facility.\n\nTo accomplish the company's goal in preventing accidents, the facility has established a Plant Safety Program.  The objectives of the Plant Safety Program are to: maximize safety performance, eliminate human suffering and the economic burden  resulting from injuries and accidents and reduce losses associated with damage of property.\n\nOne of the activities associated with the Plant Safety Program has been the development and implementation of accidental release prevention and emergency response programs which are designed to comply with OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals, 29 CFR 1910.119), and EPA's Risk Management Program (RM program) regulation (Risk Management Programs for Chemical Accidental Release Prevention, 40 CFR Part 68).  Mr. Mabry Ford, Distribution Maintenance Manager, is responsible for implementation of the Risk Management Program.\n\nThe purpose of the accidental release prevention and emergency response programs is to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents.  Overall, these programs help prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses environmental impacts and physical property damage.\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs help prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices which govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment.
