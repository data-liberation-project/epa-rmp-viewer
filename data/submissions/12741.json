Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nWe at Diversified CPC International, Inc. are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nWe have 5 regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include Isobutane  [Propane, 2-methyl], Propane, Methyl ether  [Methane, oxybis-], Butane and Difluoroethane  [Ethane, 1,1-difluoro-].  Isobutane  [Propane, 2-methyl] is used for an aerosol propellant.  Propane is used for an aerosol propellant.  Methyl ether  [Methane, oxybis-] is used for an aerosol propellant.  Butane is used for an aerosol propellant.  Difluoroethane  [Ethane, 1,1-difluoro-] is used for an aerosol propellant.\n\nThe maximum inventory of Isobutane  [Propane, 2-methyl] that is expected to be present in this facility based on process/operational  requirements is 282850.00 lb. while Propane, Methyl ether  [Methane, oxybis-], Butane and Difluoroethane  [Ethane, 1,1-difluoro-] are expected to be present at our facility in quantities of 190600.00 lb., 165000.00 lb., 72200.00 lb. and 63500.00 lb. respectively.\n\n3.    The Worst Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenarios, including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\n\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equations.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and "

Under worst case weather conditions, the calculated distance of 0.42 miles is obtained corresponding to an endpoint of 1 psi overpressure.\n\nOne alternative release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 flammable substances involves a release from Propane.  The release is assumed to result in a Vapor Cloud Explosion.  The scenario involves the release of 88650.59 lb. of Propane in 10 minutes.  The release is also controlled by active mitigation measures that include deluge system.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the flammable endpoint of 1 psi overpressure is 0.22 miles.\n\nAnother alternative release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 flammable substances involves a release from Isobutane.
