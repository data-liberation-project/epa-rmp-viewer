They are the first responders and are responsible for calling in Adams County HazMat and other supporting organizations if needed.  They also provide incident command in the event of a large spill or fire.\n\nRisk management and emergency preparedness was a part of ICC's operations long before the RMP rule was published.  ICC's proactive attitued towards Risk management is reflected in the facility design, the operating procedures, the cooperation with local responders, and the employee's attitudes.  This RMP summarizes the existing Emergency Response and Risk Management plans at ICC.  \n\nOn September 25, 2003, ICC completed modifications to the facility to come into compliance with HM 232 which requires design and implementation of a Site Security Plan.  ICC's HM 232 implementation was reviewed by the Department of Transportation in January, 2004.  The ICC site continues to operate in accordance with the requirements of HM 232."

      "SummaryText": "Industrial Chemicals Corporation (ICC) is a small business engaged in the wholesale distribution of bulk chemicals.  They have operated at the Arvada facility since 1971 with an excellent safety record.  Although ICC handles a number of chemicals, only ethyl ether  and piperidine are covered under the Risk Management Plan (RMP) rule.  ICC's Emergency Response Plan and overall Risk Management Plan were developed in the early 1990s for the entire facility, and ICC's RMP for ethyl ether and piperidine are based on these existing plans.\n\nPiperidine is delivered in 44,000-pound loads in a dedicated, 3-compartment tanker truck to the ICC facility.  The tanker truck is held on site until the customer requests delivery.  ICC delivers one compartment full (about 1850 gallons) to the customer and returns the partially filled trailer to the ICC facility.  Deliveries continue until the trailer is empty, at which time the trailer is driven to the supplier facility for refilling.  No transfers or processing occurs at the ICC site.\n\nEthyl ether is delivered in tank trucks containing approximately 7,500 gallons (45,000 lb).  These tank trucks are parked overnight at the unloading area and are unloaded into 55-gallon drums for delivery to customers.  The empty tanker is removed the same day unloading is completed.  Drums of ethyl ether are stored on site in a refrigerated storage trailer or in a sprinkled warehouse.  All transfers are conducted in accordance with industry-recommended equipment, and there has never been an incident involving ethyl ether at the ICC facility.\n\nICC has installed a number of passive and active safety controls to promote the safe handling of ethyl ether.  These measures include extensive concrete diking to stop the flow of any ether spilled during transfer and detailed written procedures describing transfer operations and emergency responses.  Large quantiteis of absorbent are always stored on site at ICC in the event of a spill in the diked area.\n\nEmerge"
