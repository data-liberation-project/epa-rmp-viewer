This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training of personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our refinery adheres to federal and state regulations, industry standards and practices, corporate process safety standard, facility process safety policies and guidelines, and best practices developed based on years of company and industry experience.  Our policy is to implement controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. If an accidental release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source And Regulated Substances\n\nThe Mandan Refinery is located at 500 Old Red Trail in Mandan, ND. The refinery is owned by Marathon Petroleum Corporation.  The refinery processes up to 74,000 barrels of crude oil per day in a variety of processes to produce petroleum products such as gasoline, diesel fuel, jet fuel, and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). The refinery has eight (8) processes that contain materials above the RMP threshold quantity rule. Two processes are classified as program level 1 and six (6) processes are classified as program level 3.  All covered processes contain regulated flammable mixtures above the threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds. The flammable mixtures typically contain various regulated substances such as but not limited to hydrogen, methane, ethane, propane, butane, and pentane. In addition, one process contains hydrogen fluoride above the 1,000 pound threshold quantity and one process contains ammonia above the 10,000 pound threshold quantity.\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program Steps\n\nFollowing is a sum"

Because processes at the refinery that are regulated by the EPA RMP regulation are also subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to carry out the accident prevention program.\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nThe Mandan Refinery encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the refinery accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the refinery and addresses each accident prevention program element.  In addition, the refinery has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and employee safety issues.  These initiatives include forming multi-disciplinary teams to promote both process and personal safety. Examples of these are the Joint Health and Safety Committee and the Area Safety Committees.  \n \n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe Mandan Refinery keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. Asset divisions within the refinery are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information. A table summarizing the reference documents and their location is readily available as part of the process safety overview information\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure haz"

This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For specific process areas, the refinery has documented safety-related operating limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in a Safe Operating Limits Table.  The refinery ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).  In addition, tables summarizing the consequences of deviation from these limits and the corrective actions to take are readily available.\n\nThe refinery also maintains technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, piping and instrument drawings, etc.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provide a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nThe Mandan Refinery has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe Mandan refinery uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of"

This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. \n\nThe PHA team recommendations are presented to management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA recommendations is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive prompt attention.  All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA team recommendations are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each recommendation is documented and retained.\n\nTo ensure that process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the Mandan Refinery periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five (5) years and will be conducted at this frequency for the life of the process.  The results and recommendations from these updates are documented and tracked.  Once again, the team recommendations are forwarded to management for consideration and their final resolution is documented and retained.\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe Mandan Refinery maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process.

This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\nThe Mandan Refinery has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.  Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance and a procedure for safe removal of hazardous materials before process piping or equipment is opened, (3) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work), and (4) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entering a confined space.  These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Mandan Refinery has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in refinery operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through written and/or oral tests, skills demonstration) adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.
