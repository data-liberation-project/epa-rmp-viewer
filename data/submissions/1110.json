Utility Districts Water Treatment Plant is located approximately 5.2 miles East of the city of McMinnville in the county of Warren in the state of Tennessee traveling toward sparta on Hwy. 70s.The Water Plant is embedded in the mountianous region of the cumberland plato surround by wooded areas and some scattered residential neighborhoods.\n B.    The WaterTreatment Plant serves some 20,000 people with over 900 hundred miles of pipe. We have approximatly 6,000 lbs.(3 months supply) of Chlorine on hand most of the time for potable water disenfection.  The Chlorine is kept in a separate containment room being constructed of concrete brick and block with no potential fire hazards. The Clorination room has an Accutek 35 leak detector with audible and visual alarms in the case of a chlorine leak. The lab area is with in 60 ft. of the clorination storage building. The plant is manned 24 hours a day , which would give a quick response to any Chlorine leak hazard. \n C.     The risk management plan is tailored to Warren Co. Utility Dist. Emergency plan and is compliance with the EPA and the Tennessee Occupational Saftey and Health Assoc.. \n D.     Warren Co. Utility Dist. has used Ton Chlorine containers since its startup in 1983 with out any accidental releases. We always implement and practice the stringent and most recent safety standards. \n E.      In the event of a disaster the worst case scenario was modeled using the EPA assumptions and concluded to end piont of 2.9 miles and an estimated population of 1200 people. The alternative release scenario concluded to an end point of .7 miles and estimated population of 400 people."
