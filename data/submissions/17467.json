THE OWNER, MANAGEMENT, AND EMPLOYEES OF FITTERER OIL, NEW ENGLAND ND, ARE COMMITTED TO THE PREVENTION OF ANY ACCIDENTAL RELEASE OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA. IF AN ACCIDENTAL RELEASE SHOULD OCCUR, THE FACILITY IS PREPARED TO WORK WITH THE LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENT, LEPC, OR OTHER AUTHORITIES, TO MITIGATE ANY RELEASE AND TO MINIMIZE THE IMPACT OF THE RELEASE ON PEOPLE AND THE ENVIRONMENT.\n\nII. FACILITY INFORMATION:\n\nA. THE PRIMARY ACTIVITY AT THE FACILITY IS THE STORAGE AND HANDLING OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA FOR SALE TO FARMERS.\n\nB. ANHYDROUS AMMONIA IS RECEIVED, STORED, AND DISTRIBUTED FOR APPLICATION ON CROPS AS A FERTILIZER NUTRIENT.\n\nC. THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY STORED WOULD BE 157,896 POUNDS IN TWO 18,000 GALLON STORAGE TANKS. (Note: maximum quantity allowed to be stored is 85% of storage tank size)\n\nIII. THE WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO:\n\nA. THE WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO WOULD BE THE RELEASE OF THE TOTAL CONTENTS OF A STORAGE TANK OVER TEN MINUTES. THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY RELEASED WOULD BE 157,896 POUNDS, WHICH REPRESENTS THE VOLUME OF THE STORAGE TANK AT 85 PERCENT CAPACITY AS LIMITED BY DESIGN STANDARDS. THE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) IS 2.61 MILES.\n\nB. THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO IS BASED ON A RELEASE FROM A BREAK IN A TRANSFER HOSE. THE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) IS .83 MILES.\n\nIV. THE ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM:\n\nA. THE FACILTY HAS IMPLEMENTED THE PROVISION OF THE SAFETY REQUIREMENTS FOR THE STORAGE AND HANDLING OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA, K-61.1, PIUBLISHED BY THE AMERICAN NATIONAL STANDARDS INSTITUTE INC.\n\nB. THE FACILITY HAS IMPLEMENTED THE STANDARDS OF THE US OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION (OSHA) 29 CFR 1910.111, STORAGE AND HANDLING OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA.\n\nV. THE FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\n\nA. THERE HAS BEEN NO ACCIDENTAL REL"

PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\n\nA. SAFETY IMPROVEMENT IS AN ON-GOING PROCESS AT THE FACILITY. PERIODIC EVALUATIONS ARE PERFORMED TO ASSESS THE MAINTENANCE OF SAFE CONDITIONS AND EVALUATE EMPLOYEE TRAINING. THERE ARE NO SPECIFIC ANHYDROUS AMMONIA SAFETY RECOMMENDATIONS AT THIS TIME."
