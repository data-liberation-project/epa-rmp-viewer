We shall, as a minimum: (1) consult with employees and their representatives on the conduct and development of the process hazard review and other elements of the risk management plan, and (2) provide to our employees and their representatives access to the process hazard review and all other information required to be developed under that standard.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe City of Galveston believes that preventative maintenance is the key to minimizing the potential for accidental releases.  Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) have been reviewed and revised to enable the employees to perform their work in a safe and efficient manner.\n\nThe EPA has adopted a policy for non-responding facilities (another entity has agreed in advance to respond to the release).  This facility is a non-responding facility.  The City of Galveston Fire Department is the first responder.\n\nThis emergency response program does not include responses to incidental releases of hazardous substances, including chlorine and sulfur dioxide, where the substances can be ?adsorbed, neutralized, or otherwise controlled at the time of the release by employees in the immediate release area, or by maintenance personnel?.\n\nThe City of Galveston has taken steps to train the operators, supervisors, and maintenance crews to be knowledgeable in the emergency response program.

Above all, all employees know where the phone numbers of the first responders are located should a release occur.\n\n\n\n \n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Main Wastewater Treatment Plant utilizes chlorine for disinfection and sulfur dioxide for dechlorination of the treated wastewater.  The maximum inventory and threshold quantities for these chemicals are shown below.\n\nChemical    Maximum Inventory (lb.)    Threshold Quantity (lb.)\nChlorine        36,000        2,500\nSulfur Dioxide        28,000        5,000\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis includes a worst-case release scenario and an alternative release scenario as defined in 40 C.F.R. 68.  A dense-gas dispersion model (SLAB) was used to determine endpoint distances for both scenarios.  A dense-gas model is required since both chlorine and sulfur dioxide are heavier than air.  The model?s input parameters are summarized in the table below.\n\nSLAB Input Parameters\n    Worst-Case Scenario    Alternative Scenario\nWindspeed (m/s)    1.5    3\nAtmospheric Stability Class    F    D\nTemperature (?

The population data was estimated using the Block Uniform Density Group Method in Landview III which uses the 1990 U.S. Census to estimate population.  The public and environmental receptors are listed in Section 8 of this plan.\n\nSLAB Output Results\n    Worst-Case Scenario    Alternative Scenario\n    Chlorine    Sulfur Dioxide    Chlorine    Sulfur Dioxide\nImpact Radius (miles)    4    3.2    0.7    0.6\nEstimated Population with Impact Area      57,000    52,000    1,200    300\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe City of Galveston has implemented a General Accidental Release Preventi"
