This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. The most recent Offsite Consequences Analysis - Flammables, Worst-Case Release Scenario Analysis - Flammables, Alternate Release Scenario Analysis - Flammables, Offsite Impacts (Population and Environmental), as well as the Five-Year Accident History were updated June 2021 with no major changes noted.\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t2.\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\tOur facility's primary activities encompass Henkel manufactures a variety of aerosol products.  Based on predictive filing, there could be as many as 14 substances and mixtures used in the aerosol process. These substances include Butane, Difluoroethane  [Ethane, 1,1-difluoro-], Isopentane, Dimethylether, Propane,and Isobutane  [Propane, 2-methyl]. Butane is used for aerosol propellant.  Difluoroethane  [Ethane, 1,1-difluoro-] is used for aerosol propellant. Isobutane  [Propane, 2-methyl] is used for aerosol propellant. Isopentane is used for aerosol propellant. Propane is used for aerosol propellant. Dimethylether is used for aerosol propellant.  \r\n\t\r\n\t3.\tThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\tOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.

The methodology used to carry out these analyses is HAZOP and What if/Checklists.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and will be revalidated at a regular interval of 5 years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.
