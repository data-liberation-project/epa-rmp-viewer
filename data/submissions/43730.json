      "SummaryText": "The Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority (PRASA) system has developed a Risk Management Plan (RMP) for management and prevention of risks associated with storage and use of chlorine, a regulated toxic substance, at Quebradillas Water Filtration Plant.  The RMP was prepared in compliance with 40 CFR Part 68 and Clena Air Act (CAA) Section 112(r)(1).  The Prevention Program elements build upon the facility's Process Safety Management (PSM) system prepared in compliance with 29 CFR Part 1910.119.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nIt is PRASA's policy to comply with applicable Federal and Puerto Rico requirements.  The chlorination process at the Quebradillas Water Filtration Plant uses chlorine, a hazardous toxic substance regulated by EPA, OSHA, and PROSHO.  Due to the hazardous characteristics of chlorine, the Quebradillas Filtration Plant observes various safety precautions in the storage, conveyance and the use of chlorine.  The safety precautions are necessary to protect employees, contractors, and visitors at the Quebradillas Water Filtration Plant and the immediately surrounding areas.  Safety precautions include procedures and equipment to minimize the potential for accidental release, as well as a written emergency response program for response to any chlorine release that may occur.\n\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe Quebradillas Water Filtration Plant supplies water to the surrounding community.  Chlorine is used to desinfect the water, destroying microorganisms that could cause illness in humans.\n\nChlorine is delivered to the facility via truck in ton containers.  The storage building has space for up to six full containers, a total of 12,000 pounds of chlorine.  Chlorine containers are connected to vacuum chlorinators.  The chlorinators regulate chlorine use.  From the chlorinators, chlorine gas is distributed under vacuum to injectors.  The injectors combine the gaseous chlorine with water.  The"

      "SummaryText": "chlorinated water is mixed with the water plant flow for distribution.\n\nWorst-case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nThe worst-case release scenario was determined following EPA's Risk Management Program Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.  The worst-case release scenario is a vapor release of the entire contents of a ton container over a ten minute period (200 pounds of chlorine per minute).  Other worst-case assumptions required by EPA include a low wind speed (1.5 meters per second), stable atmosphere (class F), rural topography, and no active mitigation of the release.\n\nEPA requires the determination of the area (zone of vulnerability) which may be exposed to a chlorine concentration of 3 ppm or greater.  According to the American Industrial Hygiene Association, 3 ppm is the maximum concentration of the chlorine in air below which nearly all people could be exposed for one hour without serious health effects.  Based on  the worst-case assumptions, the zone of vulnerability was determined to extent 1.3 miles from the chlorine area.\n\nThe following are known to be within the zone of vulnerability for the worst-case release scenario: residences and recreation areas (river).\n\nApproximately 1300 residents are located within a 1.3 mile radius of the chlorine storage area.  Many of these residents would not actually be impacted in even a worst-case release, as the chlorine would travel in the direction of wind.  No know environmental receptors (such as state parks or officially designed wildlife preserves) are located within the zone of vulnerability.\n\nThe conditions and parameters for the worst-case scenario are specified by EPA.  A more realistic alternative release scenario was examined, also following EPA's Risk Management Program Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.  The alternative release scenario is a vapor release of the entire contents of a ton container through a broken 3/8 inch flexible connector tube.  If the container was not shut off, the contents w"

More typical weather conditions are also used (wind speed of 3.0 meters per second, atmospheric stability Class D).  Other conditions remain the same as in the worst-case scenario (rural topography and no mitigation of the release).\n\nThe zone of vulnerability for the alternative release scenario is determined to extend 0.1 miles from the chlorine storage area.  Approximately 20 residents and a recreation area (river) are located within a 0.1 miles radius of the chlorine storage area.  These residents and a recreation area could be impacted, depending on the direction of wind.  No known environmental receptors are located within the zone of vulnerability.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-specific Prevention Steps\n\nPRASA complies with PROSHO requirements for Prevention Programs and for Process Safety Management.  Operators, maintenance staff and contractors are informed of chlorine hazards, and hazard signs are posted in the chlorine storage area.  Standard operating procedures have been developed, and employees who work with chlorine are provided training.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nPRASA has an emergency response program.  Chlorine gas detectors are located within the storage area for early detection and warning of any leak.  Leak repair kits are maintained on site, and operators area trained in how to quickly stop any leak that may occur.  The emergency response program is  coordinated with Civil Defense for notification of the public.\n\nPRASA periodically conducts various training programs, including emergency response training.  All PRASA facilities are scheduled to receive refresher training by  December 2005.\n\nFive-year Accident History\n\nWithin the past five years there have been no unplanned releases of chlorine in excess of 10 pounds resulting in injuries or significant properly damage on site; or known offsite injuries, evacuations, sheltering"

Issues identified from a PHA are then addressed in PRASA's Prevention Program.  Recommendations from the most recent PHA include more frequent training in operating and maintenance procedures, and an improved preventive maintenance program.  An audit of the RMP and PSM programs will be conducted within three years to verify the effectiveness of the program"
