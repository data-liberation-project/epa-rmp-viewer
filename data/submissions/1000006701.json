      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\r\nWe at Tate & Lyle, Houlton are strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety. This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\r\n\r\nTHE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\r\nOur facility's primary activities encompass the manufacturing of modified starches for industrial use. We have one regulated substance at our facility. This substance is Propylene Oxide [oxirane, methyl-]. Propylene Oxide is used for starch production substitution.\r\n\r\nThe maximum inventory of Propylene Oxide at our facility is 230,000lb. A railcar containing a maximum of 180,000 lb is staged into the facility when the Propylene Oxide tank is at or under 50,000 lb.\r\n\r\nTHE WORST CASE SCENARIO AND THE ALTERNATE RELEASE SCENARIOS\r\nWe used EPA's RMP Guidance for Offsite Consequence Analysis, RMP Comp* and RMP Submit* to evaluate the Worst Case and Alternate Release Scenarios for Propylene Oxide. The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\r\n\r\nTHE PROPYLENE OXIDE WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO submitted involves a catastrophic release from the Propylene Oxide railcar outside of the sump area under the car. A Propylene Oxide railcar may contain more than the maximum inventory of the facility's Propylene Oxide bulk tank. At class F atmospheric stability, 1.5m/s wind speed, and urban topography the distance of 9.3 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.59 mg/L.\r\n\r\nTHE PROYLENE OXIDE ALTERNATE RELEASE SCENARIO involves a break of a transfer line between a full rail car pressurized to 30 psig with a nitrogen blanket and the Propylene Oxide bulk storage tank. The scenario involves a rel"

The Propylene Oxide release would continue for 789 minutes until the pressure falls to atmospheric. The toxic liquid released is assumed to form a pool on the ground within the containment area that directs any spills back to the diked area around the bulk tank. Assuming neutral weather conditions of class D atmospheric stability and 3 m/s wind speed and an urban topography the maximum distance to the endpoint of 0.59 mg/L of Propylene Oxide is less than 0.1 miles.\r\n\r\nTHE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND THE CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\nour facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA. This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-30 Standard, 1957 edition, applicable ANSI and ASME standards and per chemical supplier recommendations. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\r\n\r\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION- Tate & Lyle, Houlton maintains a record of safety information that descrbes the chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment design associated with all processes.\r\n\r\nPROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS- Our facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently. The methodology used to carry out these analyses is the \"What If Scenario\". The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at regular intervals. Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner. The most recent PHA review for the Propylene Oxide system was performed in June 2009.\r\n\r\nOPERATING PROCEDURES- For the purpose of safely conducting activities within our covered processes,"

These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operation, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and startup after a maintenance shutdown. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the process.\r\n\r\nTRAINING- Tate & Lyle, Houlton has acomprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes. Refresher training is provided as needed. \r\n\r\nMECHANICAL INTEGRITY-  Tate & Lyle, Houlton carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations. Process equipment examined by these checks includes: pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps. Qualified personnel carry out maintenance operations with previous training in maintenance practices. Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed. Any equipment deficiencies identified by maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\r\n\r\nMANAGEMENT OF CHANGE- Written procedures are in place at Tate & Lyle, Houlton to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures. The most recent review/revision of maintenance procedures was performed in March, 1999. Process operators, maintenance personnel, or any other employee whose job task are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\r\n\r\nCOMPLIANCE AUDITS- Tate & Lyle, Houlton receives corporate audits on a regular basis to determine compliance with applicable environmental and safety regulations. The chemical supplier also performs regular audits of the Propylene Oxide storage and handling facilities at the plant. Any corrective action required"

These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring. All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\r\n\r\nEMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION- Tate & Lyle, Houlton truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort. Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements. In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule, Including information resulting from process hazards analysis.\r\n\r\nCONTRACTORS- Our company hires contractors to conduct specialized and routine maintenance and construction activities. Long term relationships have been established with the contractors that work on a routine basis. All contract personnel are required to have site specific training. The contractor training must be documented before a contract worker is allowed on the job site. The contractor safety representative meets with an Tate & Lyle, Houlton representative regularly. The contractor notifies Tate & Lyle, Houlton about any incident that results in a near miss, accident, or injury of contract personnel. Tate & Lyle, Houlton keeps copies of the entire meeting notes and incident investigation reports to document past safety performance. Tate & Lyle, Houlton has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related to the contractor's work and the processes.

The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas. The Facilities Emergency Response plan was up-dated in July 2008.\r\n\r\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced. In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require modified emergency response.\r\n\r\nAroostock County Emergency Planning Committee is the Local Emergency Planning Committee with which our emergency plan has been coordinated and verified."
