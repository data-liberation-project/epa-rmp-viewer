Kerr-McGee is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n2.  Our facility's primary activities encompass Oil and Natural Gas production.  We have seven regulated substance present at our facility.  These substances include Methane, Ethane, Propane, Isobutane, Butane, Isopentane, and Pentane.  These substances have been identified as a Flammable Mixture within the Flammable Worst case scenario.  These liquids are the natural gas liquids that will be separated from the produced gas before the gas is pipelined from the lease.\n\n3.  The worst case release scenario submitted for Program 1 Flammable Mixture involves a catastrophic release from a Storage Tank.  In this scenario, 149,804 lbs. of a Flammable Mixture containing the substances identified above, is released.  It is assumed that the entire quantity is released as a vapor, which finds an ignition source, with 10 percent of the released quantity participating in a vapor cloud explosion.  Under worst case weather conditions, the calculated distance of 0.40 miles is obtained corresponding to an endpoint of 1 psi overpressure.\n\nThere is no Alternative Release Scenario\n\n4.  Our facility has taken all the necessary steps required of a Program Level 1 facility to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA.  This includes the preparation of an Emergency Response Plan which has been coordinated with the appropriate local responders.\n\n5.  This is a new facility and thus, has no history of any pr"

Kerr-McGee carries a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials as such may relate to this facility.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first-aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment will be regularly inspected and serviced.  In addition, the plan will be promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.  Any changes regarding emergency contact information will be provided to the EPA within one month of the change.\n\nThe chairman or committee representative of the Calcasieu Parish Emergency Planning Committee has been coordinated, presented, and verified with our emergency plan.\n\n7.  As this is a new facility, Kerr-McGee will implement what it deems appropriate to guarantee a safe operation.  We will continuously monitor the operations and improve and/or update items related to making this facility a safer operation."
