Anhydrous ammonaia is considered hazardous by EPA, OSHA, etc.  The same properties which makes anhydrous ammonia valusble as a cold storage chemical, also makes it necessary to observe certain precaustions when handling and using anhydrous ammonia for refrigeration purposes.  Overall, the prevention of unnecessary human exposures, reducing the threat to our own personal health as well as our co-workers, and reducing the threat to nearby members of the community is the main goal of incorporating this Risk Management Plan into our daily operations.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle and use anhydrous ammonia combined with the operations and maintenance procedures provided by the manufacturer of the ammonia refrigeration system, as well as the training of our employees.\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is meat processing from carcass.  To aid in the quality of our process, we utilize an ammonia refrigeration system for cooling and freezing of our product.  The refrigeration system supplies several room throughout the facility.  Anhydrous ammonia is condensed and cooled through the utilization of the refrigeration system.  Anhydrous ammonia is liquified under pressure in the storage vessel which is located on the ground (north side of building) behind the maintenance room.  This liquid ammonia is condensed and cooled through the ustilization of the refrigeraion system.  The maximum amount of anhydrous ammonia in the system is 15,400 pounds.\n\nOur employees (maintenance) conduct proper start-up procedures as listed in the manufacturer's Operation & Manitenance manual for the refrigeration system.  These personnel also review the operating procedures and maintenance tasks, when needed, to insure the proper and safe use of the ammonia in the refrig"

The maintenance tasks are visually conducted daily, and monthly system checks are completed when needed.  Any actual system maintneance (i.e. changing valves, etc.) is completed safely and as needed.  The mechanical integrity of the system is completed by keeping a listing of parts recommended by the manufacturer for change-out when needed.  Maintenance personnel on staff assist in the mechanical integrity and general maintenance up-keep of the system.  The facility has a Process Safety management Plan which is being incorporated into the daily routine to comply with the Level 3 Prevention Program Requirements under EPA/RMP requirements; and to comply with OSHA's Process Safety Management requirements.  Prairieland Processors, Inc. also has a Lock-out/Tag-out program, Hazard Communication program, Confined Space program (if needed), and an Emergency Action Plan to aid in the prevention of accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  These programs, along with the Process Safety Management program comprises a large portion of Prairieland Processors' prevention program.\n\nThe emergency response (action) program was developed with the assisatance of Environmental Data Services, Inc., the Arkansas City Fire Department, and the Cowley County LEPC.  If an anhydrous ammonia release occurs at the 604 Goff location, employees will notify Emergency Maintenance personnel on duty to inform them of a release.  Maintenance employees will determine the extent of a release, and take other notifiaction/evacuation procedures if the release warrants such action.  The emergency action plan consists of maintenance personnel isolating the release point by shutting off supply valves to the affected release point, or by a manual shutdown of the entire refrigeration system if necessary.  If this action does not stop/mitigate the release of ammonia, evacuation/mitigation procedures will begin with the notification to Ar"

At this time, a head count will be made to insure all employees are accounted for according to Area Managers.  The 911 cal should have been made by this time to notify emergency response agencies (Arkansas City Fire Dept., and Cowley County LEPC)  of the release, and to start mitigation/evacuation prcedures of the system and affected population.\n\nThe worst case scenario is the failure of the storage vessel and all ammonia in the system.  This would result in a release of 15,400 pounds of ammonia liquid and/or vapor into the atmosphere.  Active mitigation was considered for this release scenario, however, in a worst case scenario, all efforts and shutoff devices would fail.  This release would result in a distance to endpoint of 1.6 miles.  The area surrounding the facility is considered rural based on the flat terrain, and little obstructions in the immediate area.  The worst case scenario would impact approximately 942 persons in the entire 1.6 mile radius.  This is the entire are, and does not reflect actual numbers due to wind direction.  This information was determined by the use of RMP Comp, and Landview software programs.\n\nThe alternate release scenario was completed for this facility based on the most probable type of equipment failure which could occur at this facility.  A valve packing failure could result in a release of anhydrous ammonia.  The amount of ammonia released would be small based on the liquid line sizes throughout the facility.  This valve packing failure could result in the release of 75 pounds of ammonia into the atmosphere in a 15 minute time frame.  This release of ammonia would have a distance to endpoint of less than 0.10 miles, and would have no impact on the surrounding population.\n\nIt is Prairieland Processors, Inc. intention to fully"
