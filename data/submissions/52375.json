The facility is located in Greensboro, NC and stores and distributes petroleum products such as gasoline and diesel.  The recent addition of butane for blending into gasoline has required the facility to comply with the PSM and RMP regulations as greater than 10,000 lbs will be stored onsite.  \n\nThe regulated substance at this facility is butane.  The equipment which handles butane includes five pressure vessels and associated piping.  The pressure vessel and associated piping may contain over 1,244,524 lbs of butane.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe Greensboro II Terminal has a strong commitment to worker and public safety, along with resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and contractors in design, installation, operations, and maintenance procedures.  If an emergency were to occur, it is the company\u00bfs policy to notify the Guilford County LEPC and request that they respond to the emergency.\n\nWORST CASE AND ANTERNATIVE CASE RELEASE SCENARION DESCRIPTIONS\n\nThe major safety concern for the butane blending system is fire and explosion.  The worst case scenario was modeled as vapor cloud explosion (using RMP*Comp) involving the failure of one of the butane storage tanks filled to the maximum level (60,000 gallons capacity with maximum fill set to 85% or 51,000 gallons).  The resulting distance to the endpoint of 1 psi overpressure extends offsite and at least one residence is within this distance.  The alternative release scenario is a one-square inch puncture of the butane vessel resulting in a 10 minute release of butane and subsequent explosion modeled using RMP*Comp.  The resulting distance to endpoint does extend offsite,"

      "SummaryText": "but it does not extend to any residences within the vicinity of the facility. \n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND MAINTENANCE PROGRAM\n\nThe regulated butane storage/blending process in the facility is compliant with the thirteen (13) elements of Process Safety Management and other employee training programs, along with operating and maintenance procedures.  The process controls listed in Section 7.4e were chosen based on whether or not they were used as safeguards in the last PHA for this facility or if they were recommended from the latest PHA and installed prior to the RMP submittal.  There may be other process controls in this facility that were not identified as safeguards in the last PHA.  The facility has no Trade Secrets.  The facility complies with the Federal and State requirements for leak detection of valves, pumps, and flanges.  Inspections are conducted and documented to ensure the integrity of the regulated equipment.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere has been no accidental release from the butane process at the Greensboro II terminal as this is a new process for butane blending.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe facility maintains a written Emergency Response Plan.  The butane blending process is new to the Greensboro II facility, so no accidental releases have occurred in the past 5 years.  In the event of fire or explosion, or a release of a regulated substance from the butane process, entry within the distance to the specified endpoint may pose a danger to public emergency responders.  Therefore, emergency responders should not enter the area unless directed through the unified or incident command process.  The undersigned certifies that to the best of my knowledge, information, and belief, the information submitted is true, accurate, and complete.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nNo changes are currently planned to the butane process.  As opportunities for improvement associated with the new butane process arise at the Greensboro II Te"
