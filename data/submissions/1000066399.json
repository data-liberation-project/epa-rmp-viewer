Standards codified by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration at 29 CFR 1910.119 are not applicable to the operations at this facility because the facility is operated as a retail operation and is exempt from the OSHA standards.  However, the OSHA standards at 29 CFR 1910.111, Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, are applicable and are included in the Risk Management Program (RMPr) document that is implemented by this Facility.\r\n\r\nThis electronic submittal provides conservative estimates of the offsite consequences of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia from the Grand Ridge, IL Facility located 835 Railroad Avenue, Grand Ridge, IL 61325.  The electronic RMP summarizes the policies and procedures implemented by the Grand Ridge, IL Facility to minimize the likelihood of an accident.  The electronic RMP also summarizes the actions that the Grand Ridge, IL Facility has taken to ensure that a response to a release will be implemented in a proper and timely manner.\r\n\r\nPURPOSE FOR UPDATING RMP\r\n\r\nHelena is submitting this as a Correction.  Changes made include updates to the: (1) Company name; (2) RMP Implementation Manager and Emergency Contact; (3) dates of last revision to the RMP prevention program elements; and (4) most recent compliance audit date.  \r\n\r\nFACILITY\r\n\r\nThe Grand Ridge, IL Facility is a retail agricultural chemical facility and operates one (1) covered process that includes Storage and Handling of anhydrous ammonia in Nurse Tanks.  This Facility owns and operates (12) 1,000-gallon nurse tanks.  Helena performs this operation in accordance with its RMPr accident prevention program.  \r\n\r\nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nWorst case and alternative case consequence analyses were completed for the single covered process that"

The worst case scenario release for the Retail Facility assumes that all the contents in the largest single Nurse Tank are released.  For this Facility, the largest Nurse Tank is a single 1,000-gallon Nurse Tank.  The release was modeled as if the ammonia tank was punctured on the side at the ground level. The resulting release of ammonia was modeled as a ground level horizontal jet.\r\n\r\nThe alternative (or more likely to occur) scenario was completed for the storage and handling covered process as well.  The alternative release for the Nurse Tank assumes a 60-minute release from a pressure relief valve that is not seated properly.  \r\n\r\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe Facility Operations Manager implements the risk management planning process at this Facility.  The Operations Manager is assisted by other Helena staff, as directed.  The Operations Manager is responsible for ensuring that Helena Staff are properly trained in the implementation of the Prevention Program which includes Safety Information, Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Maintenance, Compliance Audits, Incident Investigations, and Emergency Contingency Plans.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\n\r\nHelena's Grand Ridge, IL Facility is a non-responding Facility. Helena has coordinated emergency response activities with its local emergency planning coordinator and local fire department.\r\n\r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nThere have been no on-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage; or off-site deaths, injuries, property damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place, in the past five (5) years because of the ammonia operations at the Grand Ridge, IL Facility.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nThe Risk Management Plan implemented by Helena Chemical Company at the Grand Ridge, IL Facility complies with the requirements of the Clean Air Act, Section 112(r). The RMP will be updated as the Grand Ridge, IL F"
