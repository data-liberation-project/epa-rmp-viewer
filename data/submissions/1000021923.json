The facility poses a certain risk to the community since chlorine is a flammable/explosive material.  This plan outlines the facilities plans to minimize that risk and displays the efforts and resources put into the accident prevention program. \n\n1.2\tAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n1.2.1\tProcess Safety Information\n\nProcess Safety Information (PSI) pertains to any process which is covered under the RMP regulations and shall be used to enable the employer and employees to understand and identify hazards involved with chlorine while operating.  For the purpose of identifying the hazards of chlorine, a Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) is provided in Appendix B.  \n\nThe maximum intended inventory is two 2,000 lb cylinders of compressed chlorine located inside the facility.  The chlorine is then fed from the cylinders to different areas of the treatment system via underground piping.  \n\nIf the air within the chlorine room becomes unsafe due to a chlorine leak, there are detection sensors that trigger alarms and lights which notify the employees and the local fire department.  \n\nInformation pertaining to the equipment in the process can be found in the office of the plant superintendent and may be viewed by employees upon request.  These specifications include materials of construction, piping and instrument diagrams, ventilation system design, design codes and standards employed, and safety systems.  The equipment used at the plant complies with recognized and generally accepted good engineering practices.\n\n1.2.2\tOperating Procedures\n\nTo change a chlorine cylinder the WWTP has developed the following standard operating procedure (SOP) to provide employees with clear writt"

Secure the cylinders on the scale with a safety chain before removing the protective\ncylinder hoods.\n2. Remove the brass outlet cap found on a ton container outlet valve.\n3. Remove any foreign material that may be in the outlet valve recess. Place a new lead washer on the inlet adapter portion of the cylinder or container yoke. Never reuse an old lead washer.\n4. Place the yoke over the outlet valve and insert the inlet adapter into the valve. Make sure that the inlet adapter and lead washer seat firmly against the outlet valve. Then tighten the yoke screw until the yoke is snug on the outlet valve.\n5. Only use the cylinder or container valve wrench provided by the chemical supplier to tighten the yoke or operate the outlet valve. Never, under any circumstance, use a pipe wrench or any ill fitting wrench on the yoke/outlet valve since this will round off the soft metal of the square valve stem. Do not use any wrench that is over ten inches in length to open a stubborn valve because of the danger of bending or breaking the valve"

If the valve still will not open, call the chemical supplier immediately. Do not make any extraordinary attempts to open a stubborn valve. There is a risk to your life and/or the public may be endangered if any further means to open the valve are taken.\n\nFor procedures that will be used in dealing with a leak or spill of chlorine see the section titled Emergency Response Program.\n\nSOP's shall be reviewed by operators of the process to verify all necessary procedures are included with easy-to-understand instructions.\n\n1.3\tDescription of the Facility and Regulated Substances\n\nThe plant is located in Harrodsburg (Mercer County), Kentucky at coordinates 37\u00c2\u00b046'35N and 84\u00c2\u00b052'03 W.  The property is located along Cornishville Road in a rural area and is bordered primarily by residential farmland.  The facility treats a mixture of domestic, commercial, and industrial wastewater from the City of Harrodsburg.  With a design capacity of 2.68 MGD, the facility uses screening, settling, rotating biological contactors as well as a settling lagoon system to achieve treatment.  Chlorination and sulfur dioxide are used for disinfection and de-chlorination.\n\n\nFacility Owner and Operator:\nCity of Harrodsburg\n965 Cornishville Road\nHarrodsburg, KY \nTelephone 859-734-2113\n\nChlorine is stored inside the facility in two 2,000 lb cylinders (see Figure  for chlorine storage and handling areas).  The chlorine is converted at this location from a liquid phase to a gas phase to be used within the treatment process. The gas is then transported via an underground pipeline to the different areas of the plant including the chlorine contact basin, lagoons 1, 2, 3, and 4, the plant influent, and the sludge mixing box.\n\n1.4\tProcess Hazard Assessment Results\n\nIt is the responsibility of the Harrodsburg WWTP to perform Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) on all processes held at the fa"

The checklist is found below:\n\nWhat if?\n\nThe following items discuss some of the hazards scenarios which might be associated with the chlorination process.  While not all items are posed with the words what if, readers should consider these items with what if this happened ? or what if I didn't do it this way ?\n\nSpecial care should be taken to inspect all lines on at least an annual basis.  Even Schedule 80 PVC becomes brittle over time when exposed to chlorinated water.\n\nA check of the chlorine alarm system should be performed on at least a quarterly basis.  The chemical supplier, Living Waters of Cincinnati, should be contacted for assistance if needed (502)-863-2874).  If the alarm system fails in the event of a chlorine leak, an employee could easily be overcome upon entering the building.\n\nAlso, on a quarterly basis, the blowoff lines should be checked to see that they are clear.  Insects have rarely been known to plug these lines with nest material.\n\nIf a chlorine cylinder is not seated properly in the floor boots they may move once on the manifold and break the transfer lines and release chlorine.  This supposes that the vacuum cutoff fails.  Valves on the cylinders should always be closed tightly before and during cylinder changes\n\nIf any of the ejectors, flow tubes or controllers become damaged chlorine may escape in large quantities.  This supposes that the vacuum lock devices on one of the cylinders fails simultaneously.  As with all system components, these devices should be inspected at least quarterly for corrosion, damage or hairline fractures.\n\nWater supply valves should always be open before operating the system with positive chlorine pressure.  Without water flow in the system, gaseous chlorine may be discharged to the flash mix or clearwell resulting in high concentrations in the atmosphe"

A copy of this document will suffice for the process safety requirement.\n\n1.5.3\tMechanical Integrity\n\nReview and maintenance of the Operations and Maintenance Manual (O&M) for the Harrodsburg WWTP is done in accordance with the management of change procedures detailed below.  Deviation from normal procedures can lead to releases of gaseous chlorine which, potentially within seconds, can lead to lethal concentrations of the gas.  See Section titled Operating Procedures for operational procedures adapted from the plant O&M manual.  The most serious and most frequent consequence of deviation from those procedures is a potentially life threatening release of chlorine gas.

Typically, the system can handle pressures up to 200 psi.  This pressure is not achieved in the cylinder until a temperature of 120 degrees Fahreheit is reached.  For this reason, the building should be well ventilated in hot weather.  There is no lower limit on either temperature or pressure.\n\nAll inspections and test performances shall be documented using the form in Appendix D.  In the event a deficiency is present, it shall be corrected before continued use or by means to operate safely.  \n\nLiving Waters is responsible for the integrity of the pressurized chlorine cylinders.  Living Waters  inspects the cylinders before delivering them to the site.\n\n1.5.4\tHot Work Permit\n\nNo hot work is performed at the Harrodsburg WWTP currently.  The chlorination processes at the WWTP have no welded connections.  As such, hot work is not anticipated to take place on the system.\n\nHowever, in the event that the facility performs work involving electric or gas welding, cutting, brazing, or similar flame or spark-producing operations on or near a covered process, the Harrodsburg WWTP will be required to issue a hot work permit.  The permit provides documentation that fire protection and prevention measures were in place prior to the work as required by the regulation.  A hot work permit is also used to identify the date of work and the object on which hot work is to be performed.  The permit shall be kept on file until the hot work is complete. \n\n1.5.5\tManagement of Change\n\nA practice of management of change means that plant personnel may not alter any operations practices or policies or change piping or configuration of chlorine handling processes without going through certain steps.

Report findings shall be addressed, documented, and retained for a minimum of five years.  \n\n1.7\tEmergency Response Program\n\nThe purpose of this section is to provide operators with the procedures that will be used in dealing with a leak or spill of chlorine. Spills and leaks of hazardous materials will be classified as one of the following:\n\nSmall Leak or Spill   Release of a chemical that may cause minor irritation to the eyes, throat or nose. A small leak on a cylinder or ton container is often stopped by shutting off the outlet/supply valve or by minor repairs.\n\nLarge Leak or Spill   Release of a chemical that will cause an immediate, painful burning sensation to the lungs, eyes, nose and/or throat. It will be characterized by a visible cloud of gas vapors or liquid escaping from a cylinder or drum. A large leak on a compressed gas cylinder or container will also be accompanied by the noise of escaping gas.

In the case of large leaks, the local DES should be contacted as outline in the DES TAB-Q-7 document attached as Appendix .G\n\nThe majority of small leaks will occur at either the outlet valve or the PVC feed line.\n\na) Operators will use the buddy system when investigating leaks.\n\nb) Find a chlorine leak by using a commercial grade of ammonia in a squeeze bottle. Spray the ammonia vapor around the outlet valve and the feed line. When the ammonia vapor comes into contact with the leaking chlorine gas, a white cloud will form.\n\nc) When the location of the leak has been found, shut off the outlet supply valve and make repairs (tighten the packing nut, replace the lead washer or PVC line).\n\nd) If a one ton container of chlorine gas continues to leak after the outlet supply valve has been shut off, immediately notify the general manager, the assistant manager, and the wastewater treatment plant supervisor and/or the assistant chief operator and inform them of the situation. Telephone the chemical supplier to seek assistance in shutting off the container.\n\ne) Note the occurrence of each leak in the daily log book.\n\nLarge Leak or Spill Repair Procedures\n\nAs stated previously, a large leak or spill will involve a quantity of hazardous material that escapes into the atmosphere and has a lethal potential for the plant operators/general public. With this in mind, the most important consideration in dealing with a large leak is the immediate notification of the proper authorities (see Appendix A).\n\nIn keeping with the county DES plans, water plant personnel are to leave the plant in the event of a chlorine leak or significant spill of any hazardous substance.  Significant means anything that cannot easily and certainly be handled by plant personnel on-site at the time of the release.  When in doubt follow the DES procedure.  DES plans (Appendix A) require you to leave the plant and go to the staging area.  From there, dial 911 from your mobile phone.  If you do not have"

When notifying the police and fire departments (911), calmly explain the type of chemical involved in the emergency and the severity of the hazardous chemical release. Also provide the wind direction or the direction any hazardous gas vapor may be traveling so that civilian evacuation downwind can be properly planned and executed.\n\nIt is not anticipated at this time that WWTP personnel will assist in response efforts for a large spill.  An outside firm is expected to be contracted for such incidents.\n\nAll accidents/incidents involving hazardous chemicals should be documented carefully using the Incident Report Form found as Appendix E.  This should be completed by plant personnel regardless of what outside agency responds to incidents.  Copies of these forms should be kept in the main WWTP office.  \n\n1.8\tPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nNo changes are needed at this time.  The plant shall maintain the practices as stated within this document for operations to remain safe for the community/public and process employees.
