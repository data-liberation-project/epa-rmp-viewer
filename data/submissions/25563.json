Facility Policy.\n\n     The owners, management and employees of Farmers Coop Association (Brighton) are\n     committed to providing a safe workplace free of accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia and\n     propane.  Health, safety, and environmental compliance are a fundamental part of every employee's\n     job.  It is facility protocol to adhere to applicable Federal, State, and local laws and to implement\n     appropriate controls to prevent accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia and propane.  If an\n     accidental release were to occur, the facility would respond in accordance with its Emergency Action\n     Plan and is prepared to work with local fire department, the Local Emergency Planning Committee \n     and other authorities to control and mitigate the release and minimize the impact of the release\n     to employees, the environment, and general public.\n\n2.  Facility Information.\n\n     The primary activity at the facility is the storage and handling of fertilizers for direct sale to\n     farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application.  Anhydrous\n     ammonia is stored at the facility in one 18,000-gallon storage tank.  This tank is located directly East\n     of the office.  Ammonia is also stored in 30-1000 gal wagons that are stored next to the storage\n     tank.  The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia stored would be 224,000 pounds.  Propane is\n     stored in one 30,000 tank which is located on the West edge of the facility. The maximum quanitity of\n     propane stored would be 94,400 pounds.  The maximum fill level of each tank is 85% of the total\n     capacity, which is controlled by a liquid level guage.\n\n3.  Worst-Case Scenario and Alternate Release Scenario.\n\n     a.     The worst-case scenerio for each would be the release of the total contents\n           "

The distance to the end point (point of dispersion of\n             the gas to 200 parts per million, or ppm) is 2.1 miles.\n\n             Propane - The maximum quantity released would be 94,400 pounds, which\n             represents the voulme of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited\n             by design standards.  The distance to the end point is 0.4 miles.  The endpoint\n             represents the lateral extent of a pressure wave of 1 psi overpressure from an\n             assumed explosion of the gas.\n\n     b.     The alternate release scenarios, based on the most likely potential, or the\n             five-year accident history, are:\n\n             Anhydrous Ammonia - A release from a break in a 3-inch transfer hose, lasting 2\n             minutes before automatic or manual shut-off intervenes to stop the flow.  The\n             maximum quantity released would be 26,640 pounds.  The distance to the \n             endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.6 miles.\n\n             Propane - A release from a hose rupture in a 4-inch hose 25-feet long caused by a\n             pull-away.  The active mitigation devices are assumed to work as designed,\n             limiting the release to the contents of the hose, a maximum of 69 pounds.  The\n             distance to the end point (point of 1 psi overpressure) is 0.03 miles, or 175 feet.\n\n\n\n\n4.  Accidental Release Prevention Program.\n\n     1) Safety Information: The facility was designed and constructed in accordance with applicable\n     Federal and State of Iowa regulations.  All plans and procedures maintained at the facility are\n     periodically reviewed by facility management for safety updates and changes.  M"

The reviews identifiy the opportunity\n     for equipment malfunctions or human errors that could cause an acccidental release, the safeguards\n     used to control hazards and prevent releases, and the steps used to detect or monitor releases.\n     The results of the reviews are documented and problems identified are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n     3) Operating Procedures: The facility maintains written procedures for the handling and storage of\n     anhydrous ammonia and propane.   The procedures generally follow the provisions of the Occupational\n     Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) standard, 29 CFR 1910.111,\"Storage and Handling of\n     Anhydrous Ammonia\".  The ANSI Standard has been adopted by reference by Iowa Administrative\n     Code Part 21-Chapter43-Rule 43.6(200)-Standard for the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.\n     The applicable standard for propane is NFPA - 58.  The written procedures are reviewed by facility\n     management on a regular basis and revised as necessary.\n\n     4) Training: All employees at the facility that handle anhydrous ammonia participate in a training\n     program.  Training of all employees consists of classroom type instruction (e.g. reading safety\n     information, operating procedures, response measures followed by a written test) and on-the-job\n     supervision.  All employees are trained annually.  The training program is reviewed by facility\n     management on a regular basis and revised as necessary.
