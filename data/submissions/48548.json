This\ncommitment is inherent in our comprehensive accidental release prevention program, which covers areas such\nas design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the\nprocesses at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of\nregulated substances. If such a release does occur, our highly trained emergency response personnel are at\nhand to control and mitigate the effects of the release. We are also completely coordinated with Ottawa\nCounty LEPC, which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n2 The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nLeprino Foods Company (LFC) operates a cheese and whey manufacturing facility. The plant is located at\n2400 Rich Street, Allendale, Michigan. LFC maintains one 112R listed substance in a regulated quanity on\nsite. Anhydrous Ammonia, CAS # 7664-41-7, is used to provide refrigeration for the manufacturing process\nThe maximum intended physical inventory of Anhydrous Ammonia located at the LFC plant is approximately\n69,583 lb.\n3 The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nLeprino Foods Co. has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention\nrequirements set forth by the EPA under 40 CFR part 68. The Ammonia refrigeration process is the only\nprocess at our facility that is subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119. The following\nsections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\nProcess Safety Information\nLeprino Foods Company maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards,\noperating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nLepr"

Any\nfindings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Leprino Foods Company\nmaintains written operating procedures. These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial\nstartup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal\nshutdown and startup after a turnaround. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to\noperators involved in the processes.\nTraining\nLeprino Foods Company has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are\noperating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes. Refresher\ntraining is provided at least every three years and more frequently as needed.\nMechanical Integrity\nLeprino Foods Company carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper\noperations. Process equipment examined by these checks include, among others, pressure vessels, storage\ntanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.\nMaintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.\nFurthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.
