      "SummaryText": "Kugler's Ulysses Dealer Fertilizer Plant (UDF) is located on the edge of an industrial area approximately two miles southwest of Ulysses, Kansas.  The facility produces liquid agricultural fertilizer for use in surrounding areas.  Kugler Oil Company, the parent company of UDF is a family owned corporation located in McCook, Nebraska.  The principal officers of the parent company as well as the manager of UDF are all very active in the affairs of their local communities and are just as interested in the health and welfare of their neighbors as they are of their own families.\n\nThe Ulysses facility has two 30,000 gallon (maximum capacity) anhydrous ammonia storage tanks used in the manufacture of liquid fertilizer.  All other chemicals stored at this facility are either (1) not considered hazardous or (2) are stored below the threshold amounts to be considered under Part 68 of the Risk Management Program (RMP).\nAccess to this plant is funneled through a single entrance which passes around the administrative building.  The storage tanks are in plain sight of employees at this facility and are visually monitored to prevent any unauthorized access to the equipment.  Kugler Oil Company has met all SARA Title III and Tier Two and EPRCA 312 reporting requirements.\n\nWhen developing the facility's Risk Management Plan (RMP), many alternative scenarios were envisioned which could involve the accidental release of ammonia gas from the storage tanks.  The most probable of these scenarios is the release of excess pressure due to natural solar heating of an overfilled anhydrous ammonia storage tank.  With the release of 100 pounds of liquid material over a ten minute period, the maximum predicted travel of the resulting vapor cloud would only involve about six persons within the two residences within a 0.2 mile radius.\nSince the time of its acquisition in 1976, there has been only one recordable anhydrous ammonia release.  This occurred August 31st, 2013, at 10:48 p.m.  26,000 lbs."

This valve was subsequently replaced and placed on a routine inspection/replacement work order.  No major injuries or fatalities were reported due to this release.\n\nIn the case where an ammonia vapor cloud would leave the premises of the UDF, our employees are trained to inform the local population via the Grant County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) whose agencies can provide for notification of those residents likely to be affected so that they may evacuate the area.  The Ulysses fire department has been onsite and performs periodic walk through's.\n\nThe Kugler Oil Company has always been very pro-active in meeting accepted industry standards for storage and handling of the various chemicals with which they store onsite.  Safety is of paramount concern and to that end, they hired an internal Safety & Compliance Director on April 3, 2017 who also works with an outside Loss Prevention Control consultant.  Part of the company's Safety Program Directive states that it is the intent of management that full implementation of the Safety Program will benefit this facility, and as such it is a high priority of the facility.  The benefits include preventing accidents, reducing overall operating costs by reducing down time, repair costs, time and costs spent in training new employees, reducing workers compensation claims costs, and increasing productivity through a better trained and motivated workforce.\n\nThe Kugler Company at this, and all other locations, requires all materials and procedures meet the State of Kansas and Industry Standards ANSI K61.1 for construction of Ammonia handling facilities.  The Kansas Department Agriculture regularly inspects this facility to assure integrity of materials and equipment.  UDF personnel are regularly trained on the maintenance and operation of all facility equipment. Our goal is to be a good neighbor and maintain an operat"
