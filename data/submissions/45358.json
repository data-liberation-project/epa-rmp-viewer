      "SummaryText": "The facility covered in the Risk Management Program (RMP) includes the City of Marshall Water Treatment Plant.  The plant currently utilizes an aeration basin, four sedimentation basins, eight filters and two clearwells.  The process included in the RMP is the chlorine disinfection process.  Currently the plant uses one ton chlorine cylinders (2000 lbs.).  The chlorine system includes four cylinders mounted for use, with two cylinders on-line (4000 lbs.) and two cylinders ready for service on stand-by (4000 lbs.).  The facility is regulated under the current rule since the threshold quantity for chlorine is 2,500 lbs.  The facility utilizes several other chemicals and processes.  These chemicals are either not on the list of regulated toxic substances or do not exceed the current threshold limits.\n\nThe prevention program developed for the plant consists of several different sections, including safety information, hazard review, operating procedures, training, maintenance, compliance audits and incident investigations.  The safety information includes material safety data sheets for each chemical, maximum inventories, safe operating limits, equipment specifications and codes and standards for design.  The plant will maintain a form specifying the current safety information used and document any changes as that occur.  The hazard review information includes the forms necessary for the reviews that will be performed at least every five years for the different processes.  The operating information includes standard operating procedures for the initial startup, normal operations, emergency and normal shutdown and startup following an emergency or normal shutdown.  A form is provided to document procedures and any problems when changing chlorine cylinders.  A copy of the chlorine manual is included for basic chlorine system operating information.  The training information includes job descriptions and certification that all employees have been trained for the processes an"

Maintenance information includes a copy of the operations and maintenance manual for the chlorinators.  Forms are provided to document testing and inspections, including a Daily Work Log, Maintenance Inspection Report, Equipment Data Sheet, Preventative Maintenance Record, Equipment Lubrication Schedule and Spare Parts Inventory.  The compliance audit information includes the forms necessary for the audit and the certification to be completed every three years.  Incident investigation information includes the Accident Investigation Report to be completed upon occurrence of an accident involving chemical processes.  The Accident Investigation Summaries are maintained for at least five years.  \n\nThere have not been any recorded accidents over the past five years at the Water Plant.  \n\nThe emergency response program includes only incidental releases as handled by plant employees.  These releases include leaks encountered when installing the cylinders for use, dismantling the chlorine cylinders and any minor releases found upon inspection or testing of the equipment.  Proper equipment is maintained at the plant for use in the incidental release situations.  Major releases will be handled by outside assistance.  The plant is currently set-up to contact the City of Marshall Fire Department for assistance with chemical releases.  The local Hazmat team will then be contacted by the fire department if needed.  The First Call emergency contact system is also available for persons in Harrison County.  The fire department will initiate contact with the First Call program for assistance.  \n\nThe City of Marshall Water Plant is scheduled to be under construction before the next RMP submission is due.  Any changes that affect the chlorine processes will be revised to reflect the changes.  The RMP manual will be maintained and stored at the plant."
