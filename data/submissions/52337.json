This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of the facility?s processes.  It is the practice of Enterprise Products Operating L.P. (Enterprise) to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to, control and contain the release.\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Pioneer Cryogenic Plant located in Lincoln County, Utah is owned by Enterprise Gas Processing L.L.C. and is operated by Enterprise Products Operating, L.L.C.\n\nThe Pioneer Cryogenic Plant is an integrated gas processing, hydrocarbon liquid recovery and residue gas delivery facility.  The plant is designed to utilize the cryogenic turbo expander process to recover natural gas liquids from the inlet gas, and is assembled from prefabricated, skid-mounted process components and some individual foundation mounted equipment.  Produced natural gas is delivered to the facility from a gas gathering system and inlet gas pipeline.  The gas passes through an inlet slug catching facility where liquids that condense in the gas gathering system are separated and stabilized.  The gas from the slug catcher is processed utilizing a turbo expander based cryogenic process to remove recoverable natural gas liquids.  Finished products are residual natural gas and extracted hydrocarbon liquids which are removed from the plant by pipeline systems.  \n\nThe Pioneer Cryogenic Plant was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances exceeded the threshold quantity.
