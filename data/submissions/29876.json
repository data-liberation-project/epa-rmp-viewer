This facility meets the definition of a small business stationary source in Section 507\u00a9 of the Clean Air Act.\n\nGoldstar Cooperative \n2116 County Road S\nNew Richmond, WI 54017\n\nFor further information contact: Thomas Overby, Compliance Manager\n\nRisk Management Plan \u00bf EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n1.The Facility Policy\n\nThe owners, management, and employees of Goldstar Cooperative are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.Facility Information\n\n\u00b7The primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.\n\u00b7Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for both direct application and for blending into mixed-grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients.\n\u00b7The maximum quantity stored would be 140,196 pounds in our 30,000 gallon storage tank. \n\n3.The worst-case release scenario and the alternate release scenario.\n\nA.The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes. The maximum quantity released 140,196 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards. The distance to endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 6.9 miles.\n\nB.The alternative release scenario is a release from the break in a transfer hose. The distance to endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.3 miles.\n\n4.The accidental release prevention program.\n\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of \u00bfSafety Requirements for the storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\u00bf, published by the"
