The facility stores up to 5,550,000 pounds (lbs.) of \"regulated flammable substances\" contained within the NGL in a single process.\n\nProcess Controls are in place at the facility, to prevent or minimize an emergency release, include various automatic and manual shutoffs, alarms, vents, relief and check valves, excess flow devices, and grounding equipment.  In addition, the facilty is equiped with UV/IR detection and LEL/HAM (Hazardous Atmosphere Monitors).\n\nThe Worst Case Scenario was assumed to be the relase of the total quanity of the 75,000 gallon NGL bulk storage tank forming a vapor cloud within the lower and upper flammability limits which detonates.  For flammable substances, the endpoint is overpressure of 1 pound per square inch for vapor cloud explosions.  Under EPA requirements the WCS assumes weather condications that allow the chemical to travel as far as possible, and further assumes that none of the facility's mechanical controls or safety systems are functioning.  Based on these assumptions, the WCS vapor cloud explosion could potentially effect nearby resedences, commericial and industrial areas.  The process controls mentioned in previous paragraph minimize the potential for the WCS to occur.\n\nThe facility complies with Ocuupational Safety and Health Administrations (OSHA) regulations, including the Process Safety Management (PSM) requirements.  Facility personnel undergo operaitons competency training and testing including emergency response drills.  The response training and drills program includes notification to local emergency response agencies as available during the response training.  Agencies also receive applicable SARA Tier II chemical inventory reports annually.  In addition the facility is in"
