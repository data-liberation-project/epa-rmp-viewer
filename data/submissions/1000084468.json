Description of the Savannah, GA Facility\n\nThe Savannah, GA facility is located at 5565 Export Blvd., Garden City, GA 31408. The facility provides transportation and public warehousing services for manufacturers, distributors and end users of prepackaged specialty chemicals. Warehousing activities include shipping, receiving and storage of chemicals as specified by customer requirements. The chemicals stored at the Savannah, GA Warehouse include chemicals containing toxic hazards. Boron Trifluoride, Hydrogen Chloride, anhydrous, Ammonium solutions > 20% & Epichlorohydrin are the only RMP regulated substances handled at the site.\n\n1.2.2. Description of the Warehousing and Storage Processes\n\nRinchem receives Boron Trifluoride, Hydrogen Chloride, anhydrous, Ammonium solutions > 20% & Epichlorohydrin by truck as shipped from the manufacturer or distributor. It is unloaded from the truck using a forklift and staged for inspection. After the material passes quality and safety inspection, it is placed into the hazard specific storage area until it is shipped to the end user. The storage location of each material is tracked in an electronic inventory management system.\n\nAfter an order is received, Rinchem ships"

Those recommendations that are planned for implementation will be discussed in \"Planned Changes to Improve\n\nSafety\". The safeguards shown include both administrative and technological safeguards that prevent, detect, or mitigate releases of chlorine.\n\n1.4. The Five Year Accident History\n\nThere has never been a reportable accident involving Boron Trifluoride, Hydrogen Chloride, anhydrous, Ammonium solutions > 20% & Epichlorohydrin or any other chemical at the Rinchem Company Inc, Savannah, GA Warehouse.\n\n1.5. The Emergency Response Program\n\nOverall safety at the Rinchem Company, Inc, Savannah, GA Warehouse is governed not only by our ability to prevent accidental releases of Boron Trifluoride, Hydrogen Chloride, anhydrous, Ammonium solutions > 20% & Epichlorohydrin from occurring, but also by the ability to mitigate any accidental releases of the above-mentioned materials. Rinchem has contracted an emergency response team to minimize the effects of accidental releases of Boron Trifluoride, Hydrogen Chloride, anhydrous, Ammonium solutions > 20% & Epichlorohydrin to employees (vapor dispersion modeling demonstrates no impact to public receptors). Rinchem management has opted not to respond to releases of these chemicals by containing the spill when it can be safely done and using contracted services for spill cleanup.\n\nThe Savannah, GA Warehouse Emergency Response Program consists of:\n\n Emergency Action Plan and Contingency Plan, (SOP 7900 F1)\n\nEnvironmental, Safety, and Health"
