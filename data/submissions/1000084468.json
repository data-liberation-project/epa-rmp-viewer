Rinchem has contracted an emergency response team to minimize the effects of accidental releases of Boron Trifluoride, Hydrogen Chloride, anhydrous, Ammonium solutions > 20% & Epichlorohydrin to employees (vapor dispersion modeling demonstrates no impact to public receptors). Rinchem management has opted not to respond to releases of these chemicals by containing the spill when it can be safely done and using contracted services for spill cleanup.\r\nThe Savannah, GA Warehouse Emergency Response Program consists of:\r\n Emergency Action Plan and Contingency Plan, (SOP 7900 F1)\r\nEnvironmental, Safety, and Health"
