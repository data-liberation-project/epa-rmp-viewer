      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nThis report contains the Risk Management Plan (RMP) for the ammonia refrigeration system located at the Good Humor-Breyers Ice Cream facility in Framingham MA.  The RMP was prepared by Primatech in accordance with the requirements of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RM Program) regulation (Risk Management Programs for Chemical Accidental Release Prevention, 40 CFR Part 68).\n\nThe information presented in this report reflects the data element requirements and numbering sequence of the final EPA RMP submission.  \n\nA. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nGood Humor recognizes management's responsibility in protecting its employees, equipment, property, and the environment.  The safety and health of all personnel are very important.  The control of accidents has been and will continue to be a basic responsibility of all personnel in the Framingham facility.  \n\nTo accomplish the Company's goal in controlling accidental losses, the facility has established a Plant Safety Program and a Plant Safety Team.  The objectives of the Plant Safety Program are to:  achieve maximum efficiency and safety performance, reduce losses associated with damage of property, and the economic burden resulting from injuries and accidents.  \n\nOne of the activities associated with the Plant Safety Program has been the development and implementation of accidental release prevention and emergency response programs which are designed to comply with OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals, 29 CFR 1910.119), and EPA's Risk Management Program (RM program) regulation (Risk Management Programs for Chemical Accidental Release Prevention, 40 CFR Part 68).  The Engineering Services Manager, is responsible for implementation of the Risk Management Program. \n\nThe purpose of the accidental released prevention and emergency response programs is to prevent the occurr"

      "SummaryText": "ence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents.  Overall, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs help prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices which govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment.  These rules are detailed and improved as necessary.  They are also communicated to and accepted by all employees at the facility.  \n\nB. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nGood Humor operates an ice cream production facility in Framingham, MA.  The facility operates an ammonia refrigeration system to provide cooling and freezing capabilities.  The amount of anhydrous ammonia (CAS #7662-41-7) contained in the system is in excess of 10,000 pounds.  The maximum inventory in the system is 50,000 pounds.  Since an ammonia release from the system could pose a risk of offsite public impact and the system is regulated under the OSHA PSM standard (29 CFR 1910.119), the system is subject to the Program 3 requirements of the EPA's RM program.\n\nIn the ammonia refrigeration system, liquid ammonia (High Pressure Liquid:  HPL) is fed to the Silos, Glycol Chillers, Ice Cream Freezers, King Units, Compressors, and Intercooler from the High Pressure Vessel.\n\nC. Summary of Worst -Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nThe worst-case release scenario at the Framingham facility involves the release of 16,190 pounds of ammonia over a 10-minute period due to the failure of the high-pressure receiver.  The maximum quantity in the high-pressure receiver is represented by the entire vessel capacity, normally this vessel is maintained at a level much lower than full capacity. The scenario has been developed based on the method provided in the Risk Management Program (40 CFR 68) Guidance for Ammo"

There are =\" liquid feed lines to the silos and ice cream freezers. This scenario has been developed based on the method provided in the Risk Management Program (40 CFR 68) Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration.\n\nThe alternative release scenario is unlikely for the following reasons:\n\n7 The high pressure liquid line is located in enclosed areas that could help to contain such a release;\n7 Industry standards were followed for the manufacture and quality control of these lines;\n7 Ammonia is not corrosive in this service;\n7 Most of the lines are elevated to minimize potential damage from fork lifts;\n7 The "

Description of the Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe prevention program consists of the following elements:\n\n7 Employee Participation:  This program involves the employees in establishing and implementing the program.  Employees are also to be involved when a process hazard analysis is conducted.  The program also ensures that all employees have completed access to the program.\n7 Process Safety Information:  Written information has been collected which enables the employees to identify and understand the potential hazards in the system.  The written information includes the ammonia MSDS and a description of the design of the ammonia refrigeration system.\n7 Process Hazard Analysis:  Formal studies using the What-If Technique have been conducted to look at that system and identify potential hazards.\n7 Operating Procedures:  Written, detailed procedures have been developed which describe the steps which should be followed to safely operate the ammonia refrigeration system.\n7 Training:  A training program has been developed which ensures that employees are trained on all aspects of the system and on the duties which they should perform to ensure the safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system.\n7 Contractors:  All contractors are screened and evaluated before they perform work on or near the ammonia refrigeration system.  The contractors are also periodically evaluated to ensure that they perform work by following safe work practices.\n7 Pre-Startup Safety Review:  A pre-startup safety review is completed for all new ammonia projects to verify that all safety program"

Five-Year Accident History\n\nOne ammonia-related incident was identified for the Framingham facility in the previous five years.  On February 12, 1997, approximately 6.8 pounds of liquid ammonia was released over a three to four second time period.  The event was initiated as a result of improper removal of the cap on a level float for an ice cream freezer during verification of the float steam position.  The event was reported to the Framingham Fire Department and Framingham Emergency Medical Services.  Two employees received first-aid treatment from a physician and were released to return to work.  One employee received medical treatment for a freeze burn due to skin contact with liquid ammonia and was hospitalized overnight and then released.  This incident did not result in property damage or offsite impacts.  As a result of this incident, the operating procedures were revised for removal of caps on level controllers.\n\nF.

Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThree changes to improve safety were recommended to the equipment (hardware recommendations) when the ammonia refrigeration system was most recently analyzed during revalidation of the process hazard analysis (PHA) in July 1998.  The recommended changes will be evaluated and implemented as required."
