They are all on the toxic substances list and are:\n\u00bfEthylenediamine (EDA) \u00bf Final product.\n\u00bfAmmonia (anhydrous) \u00bf Raw material.\n\u00bfAmmonia (aqueous) \u00bf Raw material.\n\n3. Offsite Consequence Analysis  \nEPAs Risk Management Program (RMP) Rule requires that offsite consequence analysis (OCA) be performed to estimate the potential for an accidental release of a regulated substance that might potentially affect the public or the environment.  This OCA includes the development of worst and alternative release scenarios for the release of toxic substances.  The OCA allows for the consideration of administrative controls in estimating potential scenario impacts.  EPA\u00bfs computer Program, RMP*Comp, Version 1.07, was used to model the release scenarios.\n\nWorst Case Release Scenarios\nThe worst-case scenario is based on EPA required assumptions, is highly unlikely, and has never occurred at this facility.\n\n\nAlternative Case Release Scenarios  \nPer the RMP requirements, alternativ"

General accidental release prevention program and chemical specific prevention steps. Following is a brief summary of the elements that Huntsman\u00bfs Freeport Plant has implemented to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements outlined by EPA as well as with the Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard.  \n\n\u00bfProcess Safety Information\nHuntsman\u00bfs Freeport Plant maintains a compilation of current and accurate written safety information to identify and understand the hazards of the process.  This includes information pertaining to:\n\u00bfHazards of regulated substances: For each regulated substance, there is a Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) that discusses the physical properties of the chemicals, exposure hazards, the required personal protective equipment and the appropriate first aid and emergency treatment for exposure.\n\u00bfThe technology of the process:  Includes a discussion of process chemistry, safe upper and lower limits of temperature and pressure and analysis of consequences of deviation.\n\u00bfEquipment in the process:  Includes such information as materials of construction, diagrams of the piping and instrumentation, safety systems and design codes.\n\n\u00bfProcess Hazard Analysis\nHuntsman\u00bfs Freeport Plant has performed Process Hazard Analysis on each process to identify the potential hazards, identify any previous incidents (that had likely potential for catastrophic consequences in the workplace), the adequacy of the engineering and administrative controls applicable to the hazards and their inter-relationships such as appropriate application of detection methodologies to provide early warning of increases. The PHAs also address consequences of failure of engineering and administrative controls, facility"

The Freeport Plant utilizes the HAZOP methodology, a recognized and generally accepted method, for identifying and evaluating hazards in the process.  The Freeport Plant assigns employees to the HAZOP team who are knowledgeable in the HAZOP methodology and the specific process.  The HAZOP team develops recommendations to reduce the potential hazards, which, if approved, are implemented within a reasonable period of time. The Huntsman Freeport  Plant will complete a PHA Revalidation every 5-years meeting the requirements of the PSM and RMP Standards.\n\n\u00bfOperating Procedures\n\tHuntsman Freeport Plant maintains written operating procedures that were developed in consultation with operators to provide clear instructions for safely conducting activities associated with a covered process.  The procedures address steps for all operating phases, safety systems, control measures and precautions to prevent exposures to process hazards.  The procedures are reviewed and revised annually to ensure their accuracy and completeness.\n\n\u00bfTraining\n\tHuntsman\u00bfs Freeport Plant provides initial training as well as refresher training to employees to assure that the required level of skills and knowledge are maintained.  The training emphasizes safety and health hazards, emergency operations, and safe work practices.  All operators receive periodic refresher training.\n\n\u00bfMechanical Integrity\nHuntsman\u00bfs Freeport Plant has developed a program for maintaining the operating components of the process (including pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown system controls, and pumps) through the mechanical integrity program.  The program is comprised of well-trained personnel who follow maintenance, testing and inspection programs that ensure proper function of process equipment.\n\n\u00bfManagement of Change (MOC)\nH"

      "SummaryText": "untsman\u00bfs Freeport Plant has established and implemented a written procedure to manage changes to process chemicals, technology, equipment, procedures, and any changes to the facility that affect a covered process.  The procedure assures that, prior to any change, the following issues are considered: the technical basis for the proposed change, its impact on safety and health, any modifications to operating procedures, the necessary time period for the change, and any authorization requirements.  Employees involved in operating a process, as well as maintenance and contract employees whose job will be affected, are informed of and trained in the change.  If necessary, the process safety information and operating procedures are updated.  \n\n\u00bfPre-Startup Review (PSSR)\nHuntsman\u00bfs Freeport Plant performs Pre-Startup Safety Reviews when the addition of or a modification to the facility is made that is significant enough to require a change in the process safety information.  The Pre-Startup Safety Review confirms, prior to the introduction of highly hazardous chemicals, that construction and equipment is in accordance with design specifications; safety, operating, maintenance and emergency procedures are in place; Management-of-Change requirements are met; and training of employees affected by modifications is complete.\n\n\u00bfCompliance Audit\n\tHuntsman\u00bfs Freeport Plant performs audits of its compliance with the provisions of its Process Safety Management program.  Teams comprised of employees, with appropriate knowledge of audit techniques, process safety and operating experience, conduct audits every three years to verify that the procedures and practices developed are adequate and being followed.  The findings of the audit team are reviewed and appropriate corrective actions are implemented and tracked until resolved.\n\n\u00bfIncident Investigation\nHuntsman\u00bfs Freeport Plant investigates any incidents that resulted in, or could reasonably have resulted in, a catastrophic release o"
