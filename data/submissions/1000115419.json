      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nFowler Packing Co. recognizes the company\u0092s responsibility in ensuring the safety of the public, its employees, the environment, equipment, and property.  This commitment is reflected in a comprehensive accidental release prevention program that addresses the design, installation, operation, maintenance, and employee training associated with the ammonia refrigeration system at the Fowler Packing Co. facility in Fresno, California.\n\nFowler Packing Co. senior management is not only committed to offering superior service, but also to maintaining a safety and environmental program to promote a safe environment for all employees and the surrounding communities.  Management administers the safety and environmental policies and programs. These programs include but are not limited to forklift safety, hazard communication, lockout/tagout, Hazardous Materials Emergency Business Plan, employee safety training, Emergency Action Plan, as well as the Risk Management Plan.\n\nFowler Packing personnel circulate throughout the plant, taking note of unusual conditions in any portion of the system. In the event that an ammonia leak is discovered, the person nearest to the leak will alert any personnel in the immediate area who are unaware of the danger, and Cold Storage Manager and/or their supervisor.  Outside emergency responding agencies are also notified as appropriate, which is detailed in the Emergency Action Plan policy.\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe Fowler Packing facility is located at 8570 S. Cedar Avenue in Fresno, California.  The facility is located approximately 4.9 miles west of Highway 99 and 1.9 miles east of Highway 41. The area immediately surrounding the facility is rural with a mixture of farmland and residential areas.\n\nThe facility\u0092s Plant 1 and 2 ammonia refrigeration systems maintain a maximum of 21,000 and 28,000 pounds respectively.

The only composition change that occurs within the system are phase changes, as ammonia is cycled through various stages of liquid and vapor, similar to the refrigerant in a household refrigerator.  The refrigeration systems are closed-loop systems without any regular emissions or releases.  Any leaks / unanticipated ammonia odors are noted and repaired immediately.\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nA prevention program is in place to minimize the risk of hazardous chemical releases in accordance with the California Occupational Safety and Health Administration (Cal-OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (Section 5189 of Title 8, CCR) and the EPA Risk Management Program.  This prevention program covers those processes that handle ammonia above the threshold quantity of either PSM or RMP rules.\n\nThe prevention program provides a structured approach to preventing accidents. Some of the specific activities in the prevention program include:\n\n  --  Process Safety Information includes the compilation of the technical design details of each refrigeration system, including manufacturer specifications, piping diagrams, safety system design, etc.  PSI is made available to all applicable employees upon hire and is accessible at all times.\n  --  Process Hazard Analysis studies are completed every five years by qualified personnel using techniques approved under the PSM standard to identify and mitigate the risks associated with the design and operations of each of the regulated processes (ammonia refrigeration systems).\n  --  Operating Procedu"

Refresher training is also provided at least every three years.\n  --  Contractors that work on or near ammonia refrigeration equipment are vetted to ensure contractor employees are properly qualified and trained before coming onsite.  Fowler Packing Co. also provides training regarding the facility\u0092s safe work practices.\n  --  The Management of Change policy requires facility personnel to evaluate proposed changes to the ammonia systems to ensure that new hazards are not introduced, and that the various PSM / RMP elements are kept current based on changes.\n  --  Pre-Startup Safety Reviews are conducted to ensure that conditions for safe operation have been satisfied prior to starting new or modified equipment.\n  --  The Mechanical Integrity policy details the prescribed inspections, testing, and maintenance activities that are conducted on all ammonia refrigeration system equipment, as well as some auxiliary systems.  This includes preventative maintenance + inspections conducted by Fowler Packing Co. personnel as well as by outside refrigeration contractors.\n  --  A Hot Work Permit policy assures that hot work conducted around ammonia refrigeration equipment and/or piping is done safely and properly.\nIncident Investigations are conducted for unanticipated ammonia issues, and actions are recommended as appropriate to avoid similar situations from occurring again as part of a continuous improvement effort.\n  --  Routine Compliance Audits are conducted to assure that the PSM / RMP elements are developed in accordance with the regulations as well as industry standards and best practices.

The training, qualifications, and safety awareness of the operations, maintenance, and management personnel are a key element in reducing and mitigating risks associated with handling ammonia.\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nAn emergency planning and response policy has been developed at the Fowler Packing Co.  It is based on Cal-OSHA\u0092s requirements for Emergency Action Plan (CCR Title 8, Section 3220), as well as EPA\u0092s Emergency Response Plan.\n\nFacility personnel receive annual training regarding the emergency response procedures and the evacuation plan.  In the event that an ammonia leak is discovered, the person nearest to the leak will alert any personnel in the immediate area who are unaware of the danger, maintenance personnel, and/or their supervisor.  Maintenance personnel will determine what procedures and personnel are necessary to remedy the problem.  All employees evacuate to the assembly areas.  Notifications of response agencies as well the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) is also detailed the Emergency Response policy.  The Fowler Packing Co. facility also has an established relationship with the local Fire Department and County Hazardous Materials Response Team who may be called in to assist depending on the scope of an emergency situation.\n\nThe Emergency Plan policy contains procedures detailing how the facility will react to accidental ammonia releases and other emergencies such as fires, earthquakes, power outages, etc.  This policy has been coordinated with the local emergency service agencies.\n\nThe facility\u0092s Emergency Action / Response Policy includes the following elements:\n\n  --  Key Facility Personnel and Responsibilities\n  --  Outside Agency Notification Contact Information\n  --  Detailed Action Plans for Internal Departments\n  --  First Aid Procedures\n  --  Emergency Medical Treatment Procedures\n  --"

The release must have caused at least one of the following: \n\n  --  On-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage (\u00a768.42(a)); or\n  --  Known offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place (\u00a768.42(a)).\u0094\n\nAn investigation into the facility\u0092s accident history revealed that there have been no significant ammonia releases over the past five years (July 2019 \u0096 July 2024) that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 100 pounds or the California state requirement mandating immediate reporting of any release or threatened release of a hazardous material.  In addition, there have been no injuries resulting from an ammonia release at the facility.\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nFowler Packing Co. has worked to address safety issues as they arise in a continued effort to ensure a safe working environment.
