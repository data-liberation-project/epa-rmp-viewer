All current applicable ANSI and ASTM standards are strictly followed regarding the maintenance and operation of this facility.\n\nDiamond Vogel - North Inc. is a producer of liquid architectural and industrial coatings. One of the processes utilized here is the incorporation of Toluene diisocyanate (TDI) as a pre-cursor resin for making certain coatings. The TDI is stored in a single 6,000-gallon vessel that is in an isolated room. The controls for the incorporation of the TDI into the mixing process are in a second separate room. All of the parts on the storage vessel and the incorporation process are approved for use with TDI.\n\nThe facility is only operated during normal business hours, operating only a single work shift. A hard-wired alarm system and a quick response security company protect the facility during all non-work hours.\n\nDiamond Vogel - North Inc. has taken a number of steps to insure the integrity and safety of the process, and for accident prevention.\n1. The Toluene diisocyanate storage and transfer systems adhere to all applicable ANSI, ASTM, NFPA, and OSHA requirements.\n2.
