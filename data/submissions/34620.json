All current applicable ANSI and ASTM standards are strictly followed regarding the maintenance and operation of this facility.\n\nDiamond Vogel - North Inc. is a producer of liquid architectural and industrial coatings. One of the processes utilized here is the incorporation of Toluene diisocyanate (TDI) as a pre-cursor resin for making certain coatings. The TDI is stored in a single 6,000-gallon vessel that is in an isolated room. The controls for the incorporation of the TDI into the mixing process are in a second separate room. All of the parts on the storage vessel and the incorporation process are approved for use with TDI.\n\nThe facility is only operated during normal business hours, operating only a single work shift. A hard-wired alarm system and a quick response security company protect the facility during all non-work hours.\n\nDiamond Vogel - North Inc. has taken a number of steps to insure the integrity and safety of the process, and for accident prevention.\n1. The Toluene diisocyanate storage and transfer systems adhere to all applicable ANSI, ASTM, NFPA, and OSHA requirements.\n2. Annual training is required for all personnel handling, or transferring the TDI. The training includes properties of the product, safe handling procedures, first aid, and emergency response and process shutdown procedures.\n3. Proper use and storage of personal protective equipment.\n4. Use of good management processes, as specified by industry standards and training aids.\n5. Periodic scheduled maintenance and safety inspections.\n6. Proper qualifications of contractor personnel.\n7. Maintenance of sensors and alarms, to warn of any system malfunction.\n\nThe Toluene diisocyanate storage vessel is kept in a sealed, limited access room. Personnel entering this room"
