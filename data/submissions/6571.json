In order to remove harmful pathogens from water before it is distributed, the plant chlorinates water in the final steps of treatment.   Three tons of chlorine are stored on site in the form of gas liquified by pressure.\n\n    Chlorine is a water-soluble, poisonous gas that is highly irritating to the respiratory organs.  At concentrations of 15 parts per million (ppm), chlorine is immediately irritating to humans by inhalation.  At concentrations of 50 ppm, chlorine is dangerous even for brief exposures, and exposures of 1,000 ppm may be fatal even if exposure is brief.  Long term damage from chlorine gas exposure includes changes in the trachea, bronchi, emphysema, and congestion in the respiratory system.  Short term effects include coughing, vomiting, headache, and chest pains.  However, the human olfactory sense can detect chlorine concentrations as low as 3.5 ppm, so extensive exposure rarely occurs.\n\n\n2.0 RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\n    In accordance with federal regulation, plant management has modeled for two accidental release scenarios: \"worst-case\" and \"alternative-case.\"  Worst-Case Analysis uses conservative assumptions to determine the greatest distance that a release will travel before it is not longer a hazardous threat.  Alternative-Case Analysis demonstrates an off-site impact for a smaller release.  Scenarios are described briefly below.\n\n    A) Worst-Case Scenario for Chlorine Release\n         The worst-case scenario describes a situation in which a one-ton storage container releases all 2,000 pounds of the chlorine gas it contains in ten minutes.  Under stable atmospheric conditions with a one and one-half meter per second wind, toxic concentrations of chlorine gas would spread to a radius of 1.3 miles from the release site, affecting a residential population of 1968 people.

Under slightly unstable atmospheric conditions with a three meter per second wind, toxic concentrations of chlorine would travel to a radius of 0.9 miles from the release site, affecting a residential population of 943 persons.  Safety inspections and safety plans are in effect to help ensure against this type of release.\n\n    Several mechanisms already in place ensure quick response time and release control.  These mechanisms include relief valves, manual and automatic shutoffs, alarms and emergency procedures, and emergency air supply.  Also, the placement of chlorine containers within an enclosed structure slows spread time, therefore increasing time for emergency response and public notification.  Control mechanisms serve to make both release scenarios highly unlikely.\n\n\n3.0 ACCIDENT HISTORY & ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n    The Radford Water Treatment Plant can certify that there have been no releases of chlorine in the past five years that have resulted in any off site impact.  The plant is proud of its accident-free history and has put into effect an extensive accidental release prevention program to maintain its excellent safety record.  \n\n    As an affected facility under Occupational Health and Safety Act Process Safety Management (OSHA PSM) requirements, the plant is a Program 3 participant.

The overall purpose of the PHA is to comply with the PSM/RMProgram regulations and to prevent or minimize the effects of a chemical release.

The First Response Team is comprised of operators and maintenance staff from the water and wastewater treatment plants who are trained to safely contain and repair an emergency chlorine leak.  The plant conducts awareness-level emergency response training of all personnel on-site.  In addition, all personnel who are emergency response team members receive responder-level training, depending on their assigned duties and responsibilities in an emergency.\n\n    Community responder organizations who will assist in major incidents will be provided with a copy of the ERP and subsequent updates.  TheRadford Emergency Services Coordinator will arrange for one meeting, drill, or exercise each year with these local organizations to promote preparedness for effective response in the event of an incident.  The Radford Emergency Services coordinator will also be responsible for outreach to any institutions (i.e., schools) in the area as needed to implement the plan.\n\n\n5.0 NOTES\n    Some of the chlorination equipment is in the process of being replaced.
