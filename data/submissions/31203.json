The facility is located at 4753 E. Commerce Ave in Fresno CA, 93725. The surrounding area is industrial and is sparsely populated. The facility has an Emergency Response Plan to insure that all regulated substances are stored and transported in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations.                                                    Through the Emergency Response Plan, Chem Quip Fresno has assessed the potential affects of an accidental release of a hazardous substance. This assessment includes a worst case scenario and one alternative scenario.                                      The Chem Quip Fresno facility has established a prevention program to prevent the accidental release of a regulated substance. This program includes safety precautions, maintenance, inspections, and employee training                                                    A response program has also been established that requires specific actions to be taken in the event of an emergency. These actions include procedures for notifying public and local agencies responsible for responding to accidental releases, information on emergency health care, and employee response training measures.

There is one Chlorine Cylinder Recovery Vessel (coffin) on site for DOT approved transport and containment of any cylinder suspected of having a leak. SCBA as well as level \"B\" chemical resistant suits are also maintained on site.
