The function and thermodynamics of each major component type in the system is summarized below:\r\n\r\nHigh Pressure Receivers\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the high pressure receivers is to provide a safe location to add and store high pressure liquid ammonia in the refrigeration system. High Pressure Receiver 1 receives high pressure liquid from the condensers and supplies high pressure liquid to each zone of refrigeration and screw compressor. The high pressure receivers are also used to provide storage for ammonia not being used in the process at any given moment. High Pressure Receiver 1 is equipped with a main liquid feed shut-off valve (king valve) that is clearly labeled and can be used to stop the flow of ammonia throughout the system. Under normal conditions, the high pressure receivers contain high pressure liquid and vapor ammonia.\r\n\r\nFlooded Accumulators\r\n\r\nThe purpose of each flooded accumulator is to provide a supply of low pressure liquid ammonia to the evaporators. Each accumulator is equipped with an expansion valve which expands the high pressure liquid into a low temperature and pressure liquid as it enters the vessel. The flooded accumulators supply, by gravity, low pressure liquid to the associated evaporators. Liquid and vapor returned from the evaporators is separated inside the flooded accumulators to allow only the vapor to be returned to the main suction accumulator. Under normal conditions, the flooded accumulators contain low pressure liquid and vapor ammonia.\r\n\r\nAir-Cooling Evaporators (Flooded)\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the air-cooling evaporators is to remove heat from the air in order to maintain a predetermined space temperature. The air-cooling evaporators receive liquid from the flooded accumulators. The evaporators contain a set of continuo"

Due to the low pressures and temperatures maintained in the evaporator, the liquid refrigerant absorbs a great deal of heat from the surrounding area and evaporates. To increase the rate of heat removed, the evaporators use an electric fan to move warm air over the coils of cold liquid ammonia. Once the liquid has evaporated to form low temperature and pressure vapor, it returns to the supplying vessel. The liquid ammonia enters the bottom of the evaporator coil and as the liquid boils into a vapor, it rises through the coil and returns to the flood accumulator. Under normal conditions, the air-cooling evaporators contain low pressure liquid and vapor ammonia.\r\n\r\nPlate and Frame Heat Exchangers\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the plate and frame heat exchangers is to remove heat from the glycol solution being pumped through it. The plate and frame heat exchangers receive liquid from High Pressure Receiver 1 or a flooded accumulator where it flows through the channels in the plates and absorbs the heat from the glycol solution on the opposite side of each plate. Low pressure liquid and vapor exits the plate and frame heat exchangers and is returned to the supplying vessel. Under normal conditions, the plate and frame heat exchangers contain low pressure liquid and vapor ammonia.\r\n\r\nMain Suction Accumulator\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the main suction accumulator is to prevent liquid from entering the compressors. The main suction accumulator receives vapor from the flooded accumulators and separates any residual liquid from the vapor to allow only the vapor to be piped to the suction of each compressor. Liquid in the main suction accumulator drains by gravity into the liquid transfer vessel. The main suction accumulator is equipped with a high level float switch that is wired to shut down the compressors in the event of a high level situation. This prevents liquid ammonia from entering the compressors. Under normal conditions, the main s"

The liquid transfer vessel receives liquid from the main suction accumulator. Once the liquid level in the liquid transfer vessel reaches the float switch, the three way solenoid valve is energized for a period of time causing the liquid transfer vessel to become subject to high pressure and allowing the liquid to drain by gravity into the high pressure receiver. Under normal conditions the liquid transfer vessel can contain either high or low pressure liquid and vapor.\r\n\r\nCompressors\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the compressors is to raise the temperature and pressure of the low pressure gas in order to reject the heat absorbed in the evaporators to the atmosphere. The compressors receive low pressure vapor from the main suction accumulator and discharge high pressure vapor to the evaporative condensers. The compressors are equipped with high discharge pressure cutouts to shut the equipment off if the pressure exceeds the setpoint. Under normal conditions, the compressors contain both high and low pressure vapor ammonia.\r\n\r\nEvaporative Condensers\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the evaporative condensers is to reject the heat absorbed in the evaporators to the atmosphere. The evaporative condensers receive high pressure, superheated vapor from the compressors and supply high pressure liquid to the High Pressure Receiver 1. The condensers use air and water to cool the warm ammonia as it passes through a series of tubes within the condenser. As the cooling medium of air and water draws the heat from the vapor, the refrigerant condenses into a liquid and flows to the High Pressure Receiver 1. Under normal conditions, the evaporative condensers contain high pressure liquid and vapor ammonia. \r\n\r\nSafety Systems\r\n\r\nAmmonia Detection System\r\n\r\nThere are three (3) ammoni"
