The control systems are equipped with redundant safety systems which are designed to correct or shutdown the processes if certain parameters are exceeded.   All of the processes covered by RMP utilize scrubbers and flares to neutralize emissions from the process and minimize potentially harmful releases to the atmosphere.  \n\nMaintenance of equipment containing hazardous substances is also a key element in preventing accidental releases.  In addition, any changes made to the processes are carefully reviewed prior to implementation to ensure that safety and environmental risks are recognized and addressed.  Finally, while many steps have been taken to prevent accidental releases, in the event that an accidental release does occur, it is formally investigated to determine the root causes and to prescribe corrective actions to prevent the release from recurring in the future.\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe Institute Site had one accidental release from an RMP-covered process that meets the RMP incident reporting criteria during the last five years. In this incident, which occurred on November 2, 2006, a flanged joint in an unloading line from a railcar containing chloroform developed a leak, which resulted in a release of approximately 1500 pounds of chloroform to the surrounding ground area.  The spill was contained and the contaminated soil was removed and properly disposed without injury or further incident.  \n\nThere was an additional incident involving a covered process (Methomyl), but no reportable quantities of RMP-listed chemicals were released during the incident.  The incident occurred on August 28, 2008 when a runaway decomposition overpressured a unit tank leading to its rupture and subsequent fire.  There were two on-site fatalities associated with the inci"

A precautionary shelter in place was called in the local communities.  \n\nAdditionally, there were two previous incidents, on October 6, 2006, and June 27, 2007, both involving discharges of chloroform to the Kanawha River higher than levels permitted by the site's NPDES permit, due to leaks in process equipment.  These were erroneously reported as RMP Accidents in the 2007 RMP submission, but did not result in any environmental damage, hence they do not meet the definition of an RMP Accident, per 40 CFR Part 68.42 (a).\n \nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe Institute Plant maintains an on-site  emergency response team to handle fires, explosions, toxic vapor releases, medical, chemical spills, and natural disasters and rescue emergencies.  It also participates in local fire and industrial mutual aid systems.  The Institute Plant has a dedicated in-plant Emergency Operations Center capable of modeling events using real-time meteorological data, trained incident commanders, and a trained and state-certified emergency squad on site at all times.  Additionally, a plant-wide notification system is in place in the event of an emergency.  The plant has an onsite dispensary and medical professional as well as full-coverage with Emergency Medical Technicians (EMTs).\n\nCHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThere are many operating and mechanical changes that continuously occur to improve the safe operation of the Bayer CropScience facilities.  These occur as a result of the periodic risk-based process hazard assessment review process, as described above."

Written procedures are maintained and are followed by Institute personnel.  Release-reporting procedures are included in Institute's manufacturing process units which prescribe immediate and follow-up reporting to federal, state, and local authorities, including the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), the U.S. Coast Guard, the West Virginia Division of Environmental Protection (WVDEP), and the state and local emergency planning centers (EPCs),  as required by federal, state, and county protocol.  The plant maintains an emergency response team with appropriate training and equipment to respond to releases of toxic or flammable materials inside the plant.  The plant also has mutual-aid agreements with local fire departments for response to various emergencies including chemical releases.\n\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nThe Institute Plant is located eight miles west of Charleston, WV on the north bank of the Kanawha River.  The site has a total area of 460 acres, which is owned by Bayer CropScience.  Portions of the site are leased to Union Carbide (Dow), Praxair, and Reagent Chemical Company.\n\nBayer CropScience, an agricultural chemical based company, operates a multi-product, multi-process chemical plant.  The plant has five basic manufacturing units along with several other production facilities primarily responsible for producing raw materials used in the manufacture of agricultural chemicals.  The principal products produced at the Institute site are SEVIN brand Carbaryl, TEMIK brand Aldicarb, LARVIN brand thiodicarb, RHODIMET AT-88, Carbofuran and Carbosulfan.  Bayer CropScience also provides personnel to operate and maintain the Dow chemical facilities.  Praxair, Catalyst R"

      "SummaryText": "efiners, and Reagent Chemical operate their own facilities inside the site.\n\nBayer CropScience currently has four production processes at this site that are covered by the RMP rule.  Three of those processes, Methyl Isocyanate, Phosgene/Chlorine, and Aldicarb support the Bayer CropScience (agricultural chemicals) business.  The fourth process, RHODIMET&trade;, supports the Adisseo Animal Nutrition business, which is operated for Adisseo by Bayer CropScience.   A fifth process, Methomyl, is no longer subject to the RMP rule, as the process has been permanently shut down in August, 2009.\nThe Phosgene/Chlorine process receives and uses chlorine for a reaction with carbon monoxide produced by the adjoining Praxair unit to produce phosgene.  Chloroform is used in the Phosgene process to provide cooling.  The phosgene is then reacted with monomethylamine in the manufacture of methyl isocyanate in the Methyl Isocyanate (MIC) process.  Ammonia is stored onsite to be used in case of a phosgene release in a steam-ammonia curtain mitigation system.  Chloroform is used in the MIC process to provide cooling.  The Aldicarb process produces a crystalline material kept in a liquid solution that is further processed off-site before it is used as an insecticide. .  The Aldicarb process uses methyl isocyanate, produced by the MIC Unit, and trimethylamine as raw materials.  The RHODIMET&trade; AT-88 facility produces methionine hydroxy analog that is used in poultry feed supplies.  Ammonia is used as a raw material for this process.\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nManaging Process Safety at the Institute Site requires proactive identification, evaluation, and mitigation or prevention of chemical releases that could occur as a result of failures in processes, procedures, or equipment.  We maintain a process safety management program that requires a systematic approach to evaluating the whole process. Using this approach, the proces"

The various levels of protection  that have been incorporated into the design and operation of the unit process to prevent or mitigate the release of hazardous chemicals are evaluated periodically and  revised as needed to assure their effectiveness at each level.  Ultimately, the major objective of process safety management of hazardous chemicals is to prevent unwanted releases of hazardous chemicals which could expose our employees, the community and the environment to serious hazards.\n\n The processes subject to the RMP regulation are also subject to OSHA process safety management (PSM) regulation.  OSHA's PSM regulation is intended to prevent potential releases inside the plant and the RMP program is meant to help control and prevent releases which may affect off-site human health or the environment.\n\nAccidental releases from these processes are prevented by studying the hazards of the processes to identify potential hazards and implementing procedures, installing control devices and systems, and providing training to control those hazards.  The processes are periodically evaluated to assess the risk of the operations by current standards and to make improvements where necessary.  For methyl isocyanate and phosgene in particular, on-site inventories have been minimized as far as practicable in order to minimize the potential impact in the event of a release.  In 1992 and 1993, the Phosgene process was rebuilt and the MIC process was modified to achieve these improvements following a thorough study of potential release scenarios.  A project is currently under construction in the MIC process to reduce the onsite inventory of MIC by 75%.  The project is scheduled for completion"
