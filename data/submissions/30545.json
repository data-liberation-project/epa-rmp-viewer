It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled:\n\n\n\nOur Facility's primary activities encompass cold storage of grapes. We have one regulated substance present at our facility. This substance is Ammonia (anhydrous) and is used for our refrigeration system.\n\n\n\nThe maximum inventory of Ammonia (anhydrous) at our facility is 7500.00 lbs.\n\n\n\n3. The Worst Case Release Scenarios and the Alternative Release  Scenarios, including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each scenario:\n\n\n\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equations. The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\n\n\nThe worst-case release scenario submitted for Program 2 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from Ammonia refrigeration system. In this scenario 7500 lbs. of Ammonia (anhydrous) is released. The toxic liquid released is assumed to form a 1-cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place. The entire pool is estimated to evaporate over 10 minutes. At Class D atmospheric stability and 3.0 m/s wind speed, the maximum distance of 0.2 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L. \n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Ammonia (anhydrous) involves a release from Ammonia refrigeration system. The scenario involves the release of 10 lbs. of Ammonia. The toxic liquid is assumed to be released to form a 1-cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place. The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated after 5 minutes. A passive mitigation control such as the enclosure around the assumed leak has been tak"

The release is also assumed to be controlled through the emergency shutdown controls. This active mitigation system has the effect of minimizing or eliminating the release of ammonia. Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L of Ammonia (anhydrous) is 0.02 miles. \n\n\n\n4. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the           Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:\n\n\n\nOur Facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA. This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1998 Edition. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\n\n\nSAFETY INFORMATION:\n\nAnthony Vineyards maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\n\n\nHAZARD REVIEW:\n\nOur Facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently. The methodology used to carry out these analyses is \"What If\". The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of every five years. Any findings related to the hazard review are addressed in a timely manner. The Hazard Review update is tentatively scheduled for 07/01/2004 following the submittal of this RMP.\n\n\n\nOPERATING PROCEDURES:\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Anthony Vineyards, Inc. maintains written operating procedures. These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operation"

The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\n\n\nTRAINING:\n\nAnthony Vineyards has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes. Refresher training is provided at least every year and more frequently as needed. Anthony Vineyards clearly identifies the operators who require training and what objectives we require them to learn. Anthony Vineyards also evaluates the training program itself to verify that it is working. \n\n\n\n\n\nMAINTENANCE:\n\nAnthony Vineyards carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations. The equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps. Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices. Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed. Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\n\n\nCOMPLIANCE AUDITS:\n\nAnthony Vineyards conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented. The compliance audit is tentatively scheduled before 12/31/2004 following the submittal of the RMP. These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\n\n\nINCIDENT INVESTIGATION:\n\nAnthony Vineyards promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.

Quarterly safety inspections and ongoing safety training are some of the major steps we want to take to improve safety at our facility.
