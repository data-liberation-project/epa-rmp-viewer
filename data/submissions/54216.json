(MarkWest)Anderson Dehydrator Station located in Anderson, Texas is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers such areas as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is the policy of MarkWest to implement appropriate controls to prevent the possible release of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, MarkWest will be coordinating with the Anderson County, Texas Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) which provides emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\r\n\r\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substance Handled\r\n\r\nThe primary function of the MarkWest facility encompasses natural gas liquid (NGL) extraction.  NGL is the one substance present at the facility that is regulated by Risk Management Plan (RMP) regulations.  This flammable substance is a mixture comprised of propane, normal butane, isobutane, and natural gasoline (pentanes and hexanes). \r\n\r\nThe NGL is extracted from a natural gas transmission pipeline.  Once extracted, the NGL is stored in a 19,000-gallon capacity pressure vessel.  The Y-Grade is then transferred offsite via pipeline.\r\n\r\nThe total quantity of product stored in the vessels is administratively controlled to ensure that the vessels are not filled above 90% of full capacity.  Additionally, pressure relief devices provide added assurance that the vessels are not over-filled to pressures above 250 pounds per square inch (psi).  These controls are in place to prevent the potential for over-pressurization which could cause structural damage to the vessels and lead to a release"

The worst case and alternative case radii of effect were determined utilizing RMP*Comp software provided by the EPA.\r\n\r\n\r\n4.\tThe General Accident Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nMarkWest has taken all the necessary steps to comply with accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA regulations.  \r\n\r\nThe following briefly describes the elements of the release prevention program in place at the MarkWest Anderson Dehydrator Station.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\n\r\nMarkWest maintains a detailed record of written safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associated with all processes.\r\n\r\nHazard Review\r\n\r\nMarkWest will be conducting a comprehensive study to ensure that the hazards associated with the processes at the facility are identified and controlled efficiently.  The studies will be undertaken by a team of qualified personnel in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at regular intervals.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis will be addressed in a timely manner.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of safely conducting activities within covered processes, MarkWest maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial start up, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, normal shu"

The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved with the process.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTraining\r\n\r\nMarkWest has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that the employees operating processes are completely competent in the operating procedures associated with the processes.  New employees receive basic training in process operations followed by on-the-job supervision until they are deemed competent to work independently.  Refresher training is provided as needed.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\n\r\nThe integrity of mechanical operations at MarkWest is ensured through documented maintenance checks on process equipment.  Process equipment examined by these checks include among others: pressurized storage vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls, and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits\r\n\r\nMarkWest conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  These audits are carried out every three years as required by RMP regulations (40 CFR 68.58) and any corrections required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and timely manner.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation\r\n\r\nMarkWest investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident, as well as any corrective actions needed to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a period of five years.\r\n\r\n5.\tFive Year Accident History\r\nMarkwest has had an excellent record of preventing accident"

Due to stringent release prevention policies, there have been no accidental releases during this period.\r\n\r\n\r\n6.\tEmergency Action Plan\r\n\r\nA written emergency action plan to deal with accidental releases of regulated substances is retained at the MarkWest facility.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including medical treatment, evacuations, and notification of local emergency response agencies and the public.\r\n\r\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within processes that would require a modified emergency response.\r\n\r\nThe Anderson County, Texas LEPC is the local emergency response agency with which our emergency response plan has been coordinated and verified.\r\n\r\n7.\tPlanned Changes to Improve Safety  \r\n\r\nMarkWest will continue to monitor the implementation of the RMP program at the Anderson Station to ensure that accidental release of NGL does not occur.  To date, no operational changes have been identified or deemed necessary to improve safety at the facility.\r\n\r\n8.\tConclusion\r\n\r\nMarkWest has taken all necessary measures required by EPA and OSHA regulations to ensure the continued safe operations of the MarkWest Anderson Dehydrator Station.  The Risk Management Plan provided herein summarizes the active release prevention program that is currently in place at the facility.  This risk management program illustrates MarkWest\u00bfs commitment to employee, public, and environmental safety.  In the unforeseeable event that a release does occur, MarkWest\u00bfs emergency action plan combined with the assistance of the Anderson County, Texas LEPC provide assurance that such an event will be successfully and safely mitigated."
