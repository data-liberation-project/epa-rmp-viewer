A Management of Change document is routed to critical personnel to evaluate the change.  A Process Hazard Analysis may be be conducted if there are potential concerns, and resolutions must be completed prior to starting up the new process.  Process Safety Information such as relief valve calculations, procedures, etc. are also updated to ensure a safe design and operations.  A Pre-Startup Safety Review is also conducted to confirm equipment, procedures, instrumentation, etc. will ensure safe operations. \n\n\n\nDetails of our accident prevention efforts are contained in the Texas Operations General Operating Procedures, the Texas Operations Authorized Safe Practice Manual and the Standard Operating Procedures of each production unit.  These documents specify practices and procedures to help ensure the safety of our employees, our contractors, our community, and the environment.\n\n\n\nDetails of the emergency response efforts are contained in the above documents as well as the Texas Operations Emergency Plan.

Description of Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nStationary Source Description\n\n\n\nEastman Chemical Company is a leading international chemical company that produces chemicals, fibers, and plastics.  Founded in 1920 in Kingsport, Tennessee, as a unit of Eastman Kodak Company, Eastman Chemical Company was spun off in 1994 and is now an independent, publicly held company traded on the New York Stock Exchange (ticker symbol EMN).  Eastman has customers worldwide with annual sales greater than $10 billion.  With corporate headquarters in Kingsport, Eastman employs ~13,000 people in ~30 countries.\n\n\n\nEastman Chemical Company (Tyler Terminal Facility) is located on a 320-acre site in Smith County near Tyler, Texas.  The Tyler Terminal Facility receives butane, ethylene, propane and propylene by pipeline and truck and stores these materials in above-ground tanks and in underground caverns in a salt dome formation over 1,000 feet below the surface.  There are no chemical manufacturing operations at the Tyler Terminal Facility.  The materials received and stored at Tyler Terminal are sent by pipeline to the Texas Operations Longview site where they are used in the manufacture of over 40 different chemical intermediates, solvents, coatings, resins and plastics.  No consumer items are made directly at Texas Operations.  Instead, the Texas Operations products are supplied to industrial customers for use in the manufacture of hundreds of consumer items which enhance the quality of life of millions of people worldwide.  These products include automobile interiors, paints, tires, food preservatives, adhesives, furniture, cosmetics, pha"

It does not have any of the toxic substances listed in 40 CFR Section 68.130 in quantities above the threshold limit.\n\n\n\nFlammable Gases and Liquids\n\n\n\nBasic Information:\n\n\n\nTexas Operations uses flammable gases and liquids in many of its operations.  Four examples of flammables handled and stored at the Tyler Terminal facility include ethylene, ethane, butane and propane.  All of the gases handled at the Tyler Terminal Facility are colorless gases with a mild petroleum type odor and all are extremely flammable.  Leaks of these materials can ignite and create a flash fire or a vapor cloud explosion.\n\n\n\nUses:\n\n\n\nTexas Operations uses ethane, butane and propane as feedstock for the Texas Operations Longview site.  Ethylene is used by the Texas Operations Longview site as one of the basic building blocks for most of the other chemicals produced.\n\n\n\n\n\nIII. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nTexas Operations utilizes a \"layers of protection\" approach to protect people and the environment.  This approach includes, but is not limited to the following elements:\n\n\n\nDesigning For Safety\n\n\n\n* Storage tanks, vessels, and equipment are designed and constructed to strict industry and government standards.\n\n* Process design and operations are analyzed for safety prior to their installation, and periodically thereafter, in accordance with the requirements of OSHA's Process Safety Management standard.\n\n* Control systems and instruments provide continuous monitoring of operating conditions and alarm operators of upset conditions.\n\n* Emergency shutdown systems automatically shut down operations to a safe state if emer"

These include an extensive piping and equipment corrosion and vibration inspection and correction program as well as a comprehensive critical instruments testing and verification program.\n\n* Both internal and corporate audits are conducted on a regular schedule to help ensure compliance with company safety procedures and regulations.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\n\n\n* Operators are initially trained on the specifics of the process they will be running.  Refresher training is supplied at least every three years. \n\n* New Operators and Maintenance Mechanics take an extensive Apprenticeship Training Program.  This program covers multiple crafts (ex. Field Mechanic, Safety Inspector) and is registered by the U.S. Department of Labor.

In addition, Texas Operations provides a site-specific contractor Safety and Health orientation for all contractors employed at the work site.\n\n\n\nIn addition to the above elements, Texas Operations is an OSHA Volunteer Star site in the federal OSHA Voluntary Protection Program (VPP). VPP is a cooperative program between employers and OSHA to improve worker safety and recognize outstanding safety performance and programs.  Texas Operations is one of fewer than 400 sites nationwide to qualify for Star status.  To maintain Star status, Texas Operations must meet specific safety performance measures and pass an OSHA VPP inspection every few years.\n\n\n\n\n\nIV. Five Year Accident History\n\n\n\nIn the five years previous to the submission of this report, the Tyler Terminal facility has had no RMP reportable incidents.\n\n\n\n\n\nV. Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\nTexas Operations maintains a comprehensive site emergency response plan.  Employees train annually on the plan as they prepare for a plantwide drill.  Key elements of the emergency response plan as it relates to community emergency response include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n\n\n* Selected Tyler Terminal Facility employees are provided with specialized training and proper personal protection to allow them to respond to flammable gas and liquid leaks, disperse vapors with water, stop the leaks and extinguish a fire.\n\n* For emergencies beyond the capabilities of Tyler Terminal employees to respond and control, outside assistance is available from the Tyler Fire Department and Smith County emergency response oragnization by calling the 911 emergency number.\n\n* For significant emergencies, emergency response personnel from the Texas Operations Longview site are dispatched to the Tyler Terminal Facility to assist.\n\n* Texas Operations maintains a comprehensive site emergency plan for the Tyler Terminal Facility which includes procedures for no"
