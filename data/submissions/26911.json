Facility accidntal relaease and emergency response policy.\n\nThe management and employees of Carroll Service Company are committed tot he prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should accur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minnimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.  The stationary source and the regulated substances handled.\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonis is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.  Access to the site is restricted to authorized employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.\n\nThe maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia that can be stored would be 112,000 pounds, this would include the large tank and the nurse tanks.\n\n3. The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of the storage tank released as a gas over a 10 minute period.  The maximum quantity released would be 56,000 pounds, this would represent the volume of the largest storage tank as limited by design.\n\nThe distance to the endpoint of .14 mg/L for the worst-case scenario is .84 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario based on the most likely potential incident is a release from a break in a transfer hose.\n\nThe distance to the endpoint of .14 mg/L for the alternative scenario is .1 miles.  This release has the possibility of extending beyond the facility boundaries.\n\n4. The accidental release prevention program.\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention"
