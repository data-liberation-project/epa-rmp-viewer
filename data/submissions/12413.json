The plant has a capacity of 10 million gallons of finished water per day.  It has one RMP covered process - chlorination of the drinking water for microbiological control.  The Cavin Plant is subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management requirements and is therefore a RMP Program Level 3 process.\n\nOMU takes its role in the safety and well being of the community seriously and goes to great lengths to ensure that its facilities and operations do not impact its neighbors adversely.  Emergency response plans and procedures are in place to ensure that employees and neighbors of our facilities will not be exposed to harmful releases.\n\nThe Process\nThe Cavin plant uses gaseous chlorine to disinfect the drinking water produced.  Chlorine is stored in 2000 pound cylinders with a maximum on site at any one time of 10 cylinders.  The entire process takes place in a totally enclosed building which is monitored continuously for chlorine leaks.  In the event of a significant leak, a scrubber system will activate to neutralize the chlorine before it can be released from the building.\n\nWorst Case Release Scenarios\nThe RMP requires that the \"Worst Case\" release scenario be addressed.  For the Cavin Plant, the worst case is a failure of a cylinder which releases all of the gas (2000 pounds) in a ten minute period.  This case assumes no scrubbing and no containment from the chlorine building.  In this case, the chlorine could affect receptors within a two mile radius of the plant.  It is estimated that this could affect 7,370 persons.\n\nAn alternate \"worst case\" scenario reviewed is if there is a severe piping leak.  In this case, the scrubber would be in service and the potential radius affected is 0.48 miles.  It is estimated that this could affect up to 265 persons.\n\nIt is emphasized that these are \"worst case\" condition"

      "SummaryText": "s.     \n \nRelease Prevention\nOMU has a program in place at the plant to prevent situations that could lead to a release of chlorine.  Some elements of this program are: employee training; equipment maintenance; equipment inspection program; and contractor management.  These are designed to provide that the system is well maintained and that employees and contractors are aware and informed of the risks and proper procedures for working on and around the chlorine system.\n\nOMU also has in place continuous monitoring and controls such as the enclosed building and scrubber for minimization of the possibility of chlorine escaping from the facility.  \n\nFive Year Accident History\nWe have had no accidental releases of chlorine in the previous five years.\n\nEmergency Response Program\nOMU has an emergency response program that is coordinated with the local Emergency Management Agency and police and fire departments.\n\nPlanned Improvements\nThe chlorine facilities are new and well designed and there are no plans for modifications.  OMU will continue to review its training program and procedures and make improvements where possible."
