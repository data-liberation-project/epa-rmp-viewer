Intermediates in the manufacture of the products include nitric acid, and ammonium nitrate solution.  The regulated substances, as defined by 40 CFR Part 68, which are present at the facility in more than a threshold quantity are ammonia and chlorine.\n\n\n\nIt is CF's policy to prevent accidental releases from the Woodward Plant by effective process safety management programs and procedures that include:  participation by all plant employees in every element of PSM; regular analysis of process hazards utilizing current and accurate process safety information; maintaining current and accurate written operating procedures; providing timely and comprehensive training for all employees involved in operating and maintaining process equipment; overseeing the activities of contractors and ensuring that they are trained to perform their job safely; following established pre-startup safety review and management of change procedures to ensure that modifications are adequately evaluated for safety; administering a comprehensive mechanical integrity program to ensure that process equipment is maintained in accordance with good engineering practices and accepted industry standards; investigation of incidents when they occur to promptly correct deficiencies and learn from the experience, and audit the entire PSM program on a regular basis to verify that all elements, procedures, and systems are in place and adequate.  In addition, it is the Woodward Plants policy to maintain a current and accurate written emergency response plan, a system to notify facility neighbors in the event of a release, and to coordinate emergency response planning with local authorities and exercise those plans annually.\n\n\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis:\n\nThe Woodward Plant's Toxic Worst Case Scenario involves anhydrous ammonia and has offsite impact"

      "SummaryText": ".  The Alternative Release Scenario for ammonia is a 2\" pipe break, resulting in the release of 80,000 pounds over a 60-minute period.  The distance to the toxic endpoint for ammonia (200 ppm) is estimated to be 0.57 miles.  The Alternative Release Scenario for ammonia (water solution, greater than 20% ammonia) is seal failure on the Strong Aqua Ammonia Pump resulting in a release of 1592 pounds over a 10 minute period.  The distance to the toxic endpoint in 0.1 miles.  The Alternative Release Scenario for chlorine is a 3/8\" pipe break resulting in a release of 1,704 pounds over a 60 minute period.  The distance to the toxic endpoint for chlorine (3 ppm) is estimated to be 0.20 miles.  The Flammable Worst Case Release Scenario for Syngas (Hydrogen and Methane) is for the release of 8680 pounds of Hydrogen and Methane with an overpressure endpoint of 1 pound per square inch at 0.2 miles.  The Alternative Release Scenario for Syngas (Hydrogen) involves a 1\" tube failure at E-2222 with a release of 1110 pounds over a 10 minute period.  The overpressure endpoint of 1 pound per square inch would be at 0.08 miles.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program:\n\nThe Woodward Plant has a comprehensive Process Safety Management (PSM) Program and is subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's standard for process safety management of highly hazardous chemicals found in 29 CFR Part 1910.119.  Key elements of the PSM program include:  1) stringent design standards of equipment which incorporate substantial safety factors and include state of the art monitoring and control instrumentation designed specific for ammonia manufacturing and storage service; 2) extensive ammonia manufacturing process specific process safety information that is accurate and up to date; 3) well trained operating, maintenance, and contract personnel; 4) written operating and maintenance procedures and safe work practices specific to the ammonia manufacturing industry; 5) mechanical integrit"

The release was a result of an overpressure situation in the process (UAN #2 Plant) that casued a pressure relief valve to vent ammonia to the atmosphere.  The release resulted in off-site impact.  A neighbor approximately 1 mile from the plant was forced to shelter in place due to the strong odor of ammonia at his business location.\n\n\n\nOn October 15, 2012 a maintenance technician in our maintenance shop had a solution of approximately 40% ammonia sprayed in his eyes when he opened a ball valve on a pump that had been in prior ammonia solution service.  The ammonia solution that was in the pump had pressured up and was released when he opened the valve.  The technician rinsed his eyes for 15 minutes and was then taken to the eye doctor for an evaluation.  He was prescribed an antibiotic as a precaution to prevent infection.    \n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program:\n\nThe Woodward Plant has a comprehensive Emergency Response Program which includes a written plan that is coordinated with local authorities, a 60-plus member emergency response team, and emergency notification system that utilizes both in-plant sirens and the Community Alert Network telephone system.  Woodward Plant personnel are active members of the Woodward County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  The plant exercises its emergency response plan annually and also participates in countywide drills that are staged by the LEPC and other local emergency response authorities.\n\n"
