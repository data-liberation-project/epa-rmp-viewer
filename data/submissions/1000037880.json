Manassas Terminal in Manassas, Virginia, we are committed to providing a safe work environment for employees and to being a responsible corporate citizen. We believe that excellent performance in the areas of health, environment, safety and security goes hand-in-hand with operational excellence and financial success. In fulfilling this commitment, we will comply with regulatory requirements and provide and maintain a safe working environment using acceptable and proven business practices. All Sunoco Logistics employees will strive to identify and eliminate hazards which could result in injury and illness, damage to the environment, property damage, and security losses.\n\n\n\nThe Manassas Terminal is operated and maintained in a manner that protects the environment, as well as the health and safety of our employees, contractors and the community in which we operate. We promote health, safety, and the environment through programs of awareness, compliance, prevention and protection.  These programs include a combination of accidental release prevention and emergency response planning.  This summary provides a brief overview of the risk management activities that we have designed and implemented.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Manassas Terminal is an onshore, bulk petroleum storage terminal used in the storage and distribution of petroleum products to retail and commercial end-users. The Terminal handles and stores various grades of unleaded gasoline, low-sulfur diesel, No. 2 fuel oil, butane, ethanol, and various other petroleum based additives.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAMS\n\nOur accidental release prevention programs and emergency planning and response programs help us effectively manage the hazards posed by our regulated substances to our employees, the public, and the environment.

The offsite consequence analysis consisted of evaluating both worst-case scenarios and alternative case release scenarios. Sunoco Logistics has submitted these release scenarios to the United States Environmental Protection Agency.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe Manassas Terminal has an excellent record of accident prevention.  The terminal keeps records for all significant accidental chemical releases that occur at our facility.  This is a \"new\" butane blending process; consequently, there have been no accidents within the past five (5) years resulting from the chemical release of materials covered under the EPA RMP regulation. \n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nResponse actions are coordinated with the Stonewall Jackson Volunteer Fire Department/Prince William County Department of Fire and Rescue and Prince William County Office of Emergency Management.  A Facility Response Plan (FRP) is in place to inform employees what to do in case of a release, fire, and to notify emergency responders when there is a need for a response.\n\n\n\nThe Manassas Terminal maintains compliance with local, state and federal regulations i"
