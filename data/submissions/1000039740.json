We have undertaken this process to manage the risks involved with the storage, handling, and use of Anhydrous Ammonia in an industrial refrigeration process.\n\n\n\nOur goal is to promote and ensure overall worker and community safety.\n\n\n\nSugar Creek Packing is a food processing facility which covers 88,000 square feet and employs approximately 535 direct hire employees and an additional 150 contractor personnel. \n\n\n\nSugar Creek Packing has implemented an Environmental Health and Safety Management System to enable our facility to prevent the occurrence, and to minimize the consequences, of releases of Anhydrous Ammonia.\n\n\n\nOur EHS Management System has been designed and implemented to prevent incidents involving both worker and our ammonia refrigeration process.  The Management System is detailed to our facility operations and is continuously improved upon.  \n\n\n\nSugar Creek Packing has organized our process safety management program pertaining to our ammonia refrigeration process into a library consisting of five volumes.\n\n\n\nVolume I of the PSM/RMP Library contains our policies and procedures: \n\n\n\n1) The Employee Participation Program outlines the involvement of management and hourly employees in regards to the development, implementation, and management of the policies, procedures and practices involved with a successful EHS Management System.\n\n\n\n2) The most recent Process Hazard Analysis which outlines a thorough, orderly, systematic approach in which the facility identified and evaluated hazards of the process, and the means in which these hazards are managed.\n\n\n\n3) The employee training program provides employees with a working knowledge of an ammonia refrigeration system and "

The program is designed to ensure these contractors are properly trained in the hazards associated with their work in relation to our refrigeration process, the hazards of our refrigeration process, the safe work practices (including safe work permits) required while working at the facility, and the emergency response procedures so that they may report emergencies and respond to facility alarms. \n\n\n\n5) The Management of Change and Pre-Startup Safety Review Programs have been developed to provide a \"checks and balances\" system to manage changes in the facility and to verify that these changes are safe and consistent with company standards.\n\n\n\n6) The safe work practices, such as Hot Work, Confined Space, Lockout / Tagout, Line Break, Contractor Work Permits, etc.) that have been implemented at the facility. \n\n\n\nVolume II incorporates information on the ammonia refrigeration components such as the compressors, purgers, pressure vessels, heat exchangers, evaporators, condensers, pumps, piping systems, ventilation system, instrumentation, and pressure relief systems. This information is used as a reference source for the refrigeration technicians and emergency responders to positively identify system components, operate process equipment, maintain the process, troubleshoot deviations within operating limits, and safely respond to process upsets.\n\n\n\nVolume III incorporates a complete listing of all valves within the ammonia refrigeration process battery limits, piping and in"

These SOPs describe the proper steps for preparing components for start-up, starting the components, monitoring normal operation of the process, shutting down components as part of normal operation and restarting equipment as part of normal operation, shutting down equipment for maintenance and restarting equipment after maintenance, and shutting down equipment in emergency situations and restarting equipment after an emergency shutdown.

This information includes consequences of deviation from standard operating norms and the steps to avoid and/or correct the deviation.\n\n\n\nVolume V contains Operation and Maintenance Information for the ammonia refrigeration system equipment including manufactures information, spare parts list, maintenance procedures, and preventative maintenance procedures.  The facility utilizes a Centralized Maintenance Management System (CMMS) to manage the integrity of the refrigeration equipment.  As part of this CMMS, personnel (including contractors) follow established maintenance procedures to ensure that all work done on the process meets Sugar Creek Packing company standards.  \n\n\n\nThe facility also incorporates additional safety items such as refrigeration piping label identifiers, tagging of all ammonia system valves and components that relate directly to the standard operating procedures and the CMMS.\n\n\n\nSugar Creek Packing Frontenac facility has had no incidents that would quali"
