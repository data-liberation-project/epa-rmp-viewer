Introduction:\n\nThe Royster-Clark Nitrogen Terminal in Meredosia receives\n\nfertilizers from barges, stores the fertilizer in tanks, and\n\nloads trucks. The facility has one anhydrous ammonia tank\n\nand four urea ammonium nitrate (UAN) liquid fertilizer\n\nstorage tanks.\n\n\n\nB.   Accidental Release Record:\n\n\n\nThe Royster-Clark Nitrogen, Meredosia Terminal, has an\n\nexcellent safety record with no deaths or serious injuries\n\nto facility personnel since it was constructed in 1964.\n\n\n\nThe facility safety record is direct result of continued\n\nemphasis on safety by management, employees, contractors,\n\nand truck drivers. There have not been any releases from the\n\nTerminal that meet the description of an RMP accidental\n\nrelease.\n\n\n\nIn case of a reportable chemical accident, information in\n\nthe RMP will be updated within six (6) months of the date\n\naccident accrued.\n\n\n\nC.   General Accidental Release Prevention Policies And\n\n  Activities:\n\n\n\nRoyster-Clark Nitrogen believes safety and concern for the\n\nenvironment must be second nature to all employees and\n\ncontractor personnel.\n\n\n\nThe entire Royster-Clark Nitrogen team works together to\n\nensure the facility complies with OSHA'S Process Safety\n\nManagement standards and the accident prevention program are\n\ncontinuously improved. A networked computer management\n\nsystem is utilized to provide our employees with the\n\nnecessary tools and records to maintain the safety of the\n\nprocess. This teamwork is an integral part in the safety\n\nefforts of the facility.\n\n\n\nAccident release prevention steps include the fourteen-\n\nelement program for Process Safety Management, a management\n\nsystem, corporate oversight of the facility, and a focus on\n\ncontinuous improvement.\n\n\n\nRoyster-Clark Nitrogen encourages all employees to\n\nparticipate in the facility's safety program.

Five Year Accident History:\n\n\n\nThe Royster-Clark Nitrogen Meredosia Terminal has an\n\nexcellent safety record with no deaths or serious injuries\n\nto any of its personnel. In addition, the terminal has\n\noperated without a lost time accident for over twenty-eight\n\nyears. There have not been any incidents that meet the\n\ndefinition of a RMP recordable release.\n\n\n\nG.   Emergency Response:\n\n\n\nThe facility Emergency Action Plans covers accidental\n\nreleases of plant chemicals, natural disasters, emergency\n\nresponse practices and procedures, and process safety\n\ntopics. The plan is reviewed at least annually with all\n\nemployees.\n\nAll permanent employees have the required Hazmat training,\n\nincluding an eight-hour refresher course annually. Each\n\nemployee and permanent contractor is trained on the\n\nfacility's Emergency Response policies and procedures at\n\nregularly scheduled safety meetings.\n\nThe Terminal manager and his assistant attend monthly\n\nCommunity Advisory Panel meetings. This panel includes other\n\narea industries, Meredosia Village board members, local\n\nemergency response agencies, community leaders and citizens.\n\n\n\nThe Emergency Response Plan is followed in the event of an\n\nemergency. The emergency alarm system is tested once each\n\nmonth and an emergency drill is held at least annually.\n\n\n\nUpdates to emergency contact information will be reported\n\nwithin one month of change.\n\n\n\nH.   Planned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\n\n\nThe Royster-Clark Nitrogen Meredosia Terminal will utilize\n\nemployee input and industry best management practices to\n\ncontinuously improve safety, environmental, and all\n\noperations.\n\n\n\nI.
