In this way we promote overall plant and worker safety.\n\nOur PSM/RMP programs enable our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of highly hazardous materials as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents.  Overall, the PSM/RMP programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.\n\nOur PSM/RMP programs prevent accidents because of the focus on the rules, procedures, and practices which govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment.  These rules are improved as necessary.  They are also communicated to and accepted by all employees at the facility.\n\nOur ammonia refrigeration system consists basically of a cycle where liquid ammonia is evaporated while removing heat from the air or liquid surrounding it.  The ammonia is always contained inside tubes, pipes or vessels.  The vapor is then compressed and condensed so that liquid ammonia returns back to the coolers to initiate the cycle again.\n\nWorst Case Release Scenario:\nFailure of the high pressure receiver containing 11,700 lbs. of ammonia resulting in a ten minute release.  Under worst case scenario conditions, ammonia could travel 0.9 miles per RMP Comp. calculations before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public.  This scenario is unlikely to occur for the following reasons:\n1.  Worst case scenarion conditions ar uncommon\n2.  Compliance with industry standards for the manuf"

Installed ammonia sensors warn of leaks\n7.  The system is monitored over a 24-hours period seven days a week by Security. \n8.  An emergency action plan is in place at the facility\n9.  A PHA and review of the worst case scenario has allowed for the implementation of engineering and administrative controls to minimize the chance for such a total release to occur.\n\nAlternative Case Release Scenario:\nCorrosion of the pipe connection to the intercooler vessel results in a release of 151 lbs/min for 5 minutes.  Under common weather conditions, ammonia could travel 0.1 miles per RMP Comp calculations before disersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public.  This scenario is unlikely for the following reasons:\n1.  Preventative maintenance in place regularly maintains and inspects piping\n2.  There are pressure relief valves and pressur regulators that prevent sudden pressure increases\n3.  We regularly have personnel present around this equipment\n4.
