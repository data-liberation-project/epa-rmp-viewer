Personnel whose job tasks are affected by a modification in the process are promptly apprised of the modification and provided training to address the modification.\n\nPre-Startup Review - A pre-startup safety review was conducted prior to the startup of the new process.  Established pre-startup safety review procedures assured that construction and installation of covered process equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for a safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation and all elements of the RMP are in place.\n\nCompliance Audits - TVA conducts environmental and safety audits on a regular basis and will determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  The audits will be conducted at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits will be promptly and safely implemented.\n\nIncident Investigations - Any incident that results in or could reasonably result in a significant release of a regulated substance is promptly investigated.  Procedures ensure that investigations are undertaken to identify the circumstances leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the situation surrounding the release does not reoccur.  All reports will be retained for at least 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation - TVA believes in a team approach to process safety management and accident prevention.  Employees are encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.

      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nI. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Policies\n\nEnvironmental protection and enhancement are essential elements of TVA's integrated resource management mission. TVA exhibits progressive environmental leadership in managing its unified river and power system for multiple public benefits, including the production of reliable, competitively priced power. TVA is committed to setting the standard for environmental excellence among utilities and federal agencies, and to making the Tennessee Valley a model in sustainable energy, resource, and economic development and management. TVA assures that employees are aware of their environmental responsibilities, use effective environmental processes, and are held accountable for performance. \n\nTVA management and employees will be responsible for maintaining compliance with environmental requirements and striving for environmental excellence in performing their respective duties.  We will assure environmental protection and reduce risks to our employees and communities in which we operate through proper environmental review of new developments and through safe technologies, operating procedures, and emergency preparedness.  All activities will be conducted in accordance with current environmental and health and safety regulatory requirements.\n\nII. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe affected facility consists of an anhydrous ammonia storage facility including six 30,000 gallon storage tanks with supporting unloading equipment, vapor compressors and liquid transfer pumps, piping to convey the liquid ammonia, vaporizers to convert ammonia from a liquid to a vapor, an ammonia vapor transport line, and a gas dilution and injection system to inject ammonia into a selective catalytic reduction emission control system.\n\nThere is only one regulated substance at the facility - anhydrous ammonia.  With six 30,000 gallon storage tanks, the maximum amount of anhydrous ammonia in the storage faci"

Summary of Worst Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nThe Worst Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances to the end point for each reported scenario, were developed.  To perform the required offsite consequence analysis for the facility, the very conservative EPA RMP*Comp model was used.  \n\nThe worst case release scenario involves the complete rupture of one 30,000 gallon storage tank.  A maximum release of 130,110 pounds of anhydrous ammonia over a 10 minute period was considered.  The released quantity has not been limited by a system of administrative controls.  Under worst case meteorological conditions of Class F stability and 1.5 m/s wind speed, the ammonia vapor would have offsite end point concentrations impacting populated areas.\n\nThe alternative case release scenario with the worst credible case offsite impact involves the release of 26,622 pounds of ammonia vapor loss from the failure of a pressure sfety valve to reseat or from ruptured vapor piping.  Under typical meteorological conditions of Class D stability and 3 m/s wind speed, the ammonia vapor would have offsite toxic end point levels.\n\nAn alternative case release scenario with the most likely, most sever case involves the release of 100 pounds of liquid ammonia from a failing transfer hose during the unloading of liquid ammonia from a rail car or truck tank.  Under typical meteorological conditions of Class D stability and 3 m/s wind speed, the ammonia vapor would have offsite toxic end point levels.\n\nIV.

The Hazardous and Operability Study (HAZOP) analysis methodology was used to assess the potential hazards of the process.  The study was conducted by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering, control logics, and process operations.  Findings resulting from the analysis were addressed.  The HAZOP analysis was conducted on March 29-31, 2005.\n\nOperating Procedures - TVA has established and maintained procedures for safely conducting activities within our covered process.  The procedures cover various operational phases including initial startup, normal startup, normal shutdown, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, and startup following a turnaround or emergency shutdown.  The information is readily available to operators and maintenance personnel involved in the process and the information is periodically reviewed to assure it is current.\n\nTraining - TVA's training program is comprehensive and is implemented to ensure that all personnel involved in the operation and maintenance of the process are properly trained in the safe operation and maintenance of the process and knowledgeable of the hazards of the process.  The personnel are provided with refresher training at least every three years or more often if needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity - TVA conducts well documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure safe and reliable operations.  All process equipment routinely checked includes storage tanks and pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and venting systems, controls and pumps, emergency shutdown systems, and monitoring devices.  All maintenance operations conducted on the covered process are performed by qualified personnel who have had proper training.

Five Year Accident History  \n\nThe anhydrous ammonia facility has not had a reportable release event in the past 5 years.\n\nVI. Emergency Response Plan\n\nTVA has an emergency response plan in place to respond to accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response plan requirements including adequate first aid and medical treatment, safe shelter-in-place locations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, and qualified contractor responder for post-incident decontamination of affected areas.  The plan will be promptly updated to address any pertinent changes within the process that would require a modification of the emergency response plan.  In addition, periodic emergency response drills are conducted to keep employees, contractors, and local responders familiar with the plan."
