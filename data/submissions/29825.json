Michigan Avenue Partners purchased the above ground assets of the facility shortly thereafter and Longview Aluminum L.L.C was formed in February 2001.  Plant operations were curtailed by February 28th, 2001 and all above ground assets are curently being liquidated.  \n\nThe Longview Reduction Plant of Reynolds Metals Company poured its first aluminum on September 12, 1941.  The plant capacity is approximately 204,000 metric tons per year.   It is located on a 562 acre site along the Columbia River in Western Washington.  Refined bauxite ore (alumina or Al2O3) is received by ship from Australia.  The alumina is reduced to aluminum metal by the Hall-Heroult process, which occurs in the Horizontal Stud Soderberg potlines.  Electricity is passed through a solution of molten cryolite in which the ore has been dissolved.  Aluminum is separated from oxygen, which reacts with a carbon anode.  The aluminum metal is tapped or siphoned from the potlines for casting into ingot and billet.  The Longview Reduction Plant is a high purity facility, which turns out aluminum that is better than 99.90 percent pure. \n\n2.0    Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe policy of Reynolds Metals Company is to provide a safe, environmentally responsible, and productive work place for all of its employees.  In this regard, Reynolds is committed, at all levels, to the safe operation of processes using highly hazardous chemicals.  Reynolds employees, from senior management to line technicians, are dedicated to the safety of their fellow employees, the community, and the environment.  Accidental release prevention is an important element of Reynolds' comprehensive safety program.\n\n3.0    Regulated Substances Handled\n\nChlorine\n\nChlorine is used in the cast"

Chlorine gas is mixed with an inert carrier (nitrogen) to a concentration of 5% to 20%.  The mixed fluxing gas is injected below the surface of the molten aluminum in the furnaces where it rises to the surface.  The alkali metals react with the chlorine to form salts, particulate impurities are adsorbed onto the surface of the bubble and float to the surface, where they are removed as dross.\n    \n \nIn a separate process, chlorine is used to disinfect and deodorize well water before it is added to the plant water supply system.\n\nThe amount of chlorine on-site was significantly reduced in 1999.  Previously, chlorine was supplied from a 55-ton capacity rail car.  It is now dispensed from 1-ton containers and 150-pound cylinders. The maximum chlorine on-site is thirty one 1-ton containers and ten 150-pound cylinders.\n\nPropane\n\nNatural gas is used as a fuel in the casting furnaces and in fixed and portable heaters found throughout the facility.  There are six propane storage tanks on-site that serve as a backup to the natural gas supply, four 20,000 gallon tanks and two 30,000 gallon tanks.  If the natural gas supply is curtailed, the liquefied-compressed propane is vaporized and mixed with air creating a gas with combustion properties similar to natural gas.  This allows combustion without adjustments to the burner or control systems, if the fuels have to be switched.  The propane backup system has only been used six times in the past fifteen years.\n\n4.0    Release Scenarios\n\nWorst Case Release Scenario - Chlorine\n\nThe worst case scenario for a toxic release is the release of an entire 1-ton container of chlorine in 10-minutes.  This scenario is provided by the RMP Off-site Consequence Guidance Analysis.  The toxic endpoint is 0.0087 mg/l.  The endpoint distance is 1.3 miles and includes public receptors such as residences, recreation areas, and commercial, "

This release was modeled using ALOHA V. 5.1.  The distance to the endpoint is 0.86 miles.  The off-site consequences of such a release would impact residences, recreation, and neighboring industrial areas.\n \nWorst Case Release Scenario - Propane\n\nThe worst case scenario for a flammable gas would be the release, vaporization and detonation of the contents of the largest tank.  This scenario is provided by the RMP Off-site Consequence Guidance Analysis.  The endpoint is 1 psi overpressure, which will break windows and damage buildings.  People in this area could be injured by flying glass or debris.  The distance to the endpoint is 0.54 miles.  The off-site consequences of such an event would impact neighboring industrial areas and public recreation areas.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario - Propane\n\nThe alternative flammable gas release is a failed pressure relief valve on the 30,000 gallon tank and a resulting vapor cloud fire.  This scenario is modeled by the RMP Off-site Consequence Guidance Analysis.  The endpoint, in this case, is the Lower Flammability Limit or LFL.  This is the lowest concentration of a flammable gas which will burn if ignited.  The distance to the endpoint is <0.1 miles.  This scenario does not impact any off-site receptors. \n\n5.0    Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nReynolds uses a multi-tiered approach to implementing its chemical safety programs, which includes accidental release prevention.  Reynolds employs a full-time safety manager and a Certified Industrial Hygienist who are responsible for ensuring compliance with all federal, state, and local health and safety regulations.   \n\nThe Reynolds Longview Reduction Plant Safety Committee conducts comprehensive inspections of their respective areas.  In addition, the plant safety director and the plant safety team co-cha"

The Safety Department forwards reports to department superintendents or general supervisors for action.\n    \nThe reduction plant employees working in production and chemical use areas receive Hazard Communication training.  Hazardous waste handlers receive training annually.\n\nFinally, there is a fully equipped hazardous materials emergency response team on each shift trained in the incident command system.  \n\n6.0    Accidental Release History\n\nThere have been 6 non-reportable bi-gas chlorine/nitrogen releases at the facility in the past 5 years.  Each of the releases was limited to less than 1 pound of chlorine and did not have any off-site impact.  There have not been any releases of propane at the facility in the past five years.\n\n7.0    Emergency Response Team\n\nThe Longview Reduction Plant has a comprehensive emergency response program.  There is a written emergency response plan with specific checklists for chlorine releases and other types of hazardous incidents.  The emergency response team includes 12 - 20 members on each work shift.  Team members are trained to the technician level and all members receive instruction in the incident command system.  There is a fully equipped hazardous materials trailer on-site that can be moved to the incident base within minutes of alarm notification.  \n\nThe ERT coordinator has overall responsibility and authority to maintain the emergency response program, including acquisition of emergency response equipment and training of personnel.  The incident commanders have the authority to dedicate company resources required to respond to an emergency and responsibility to ensure successful implementation of the plan, including maintenance of emergency equipment and staffing emergency response teams."
