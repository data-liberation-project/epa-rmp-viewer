The branch located in Springfield is one of the branches located in Missouri.  G.S. Robins has specialized in serving the unique chemical needs of the Midwest.  The Springfield branch is involved with chemical storage and transportation.  Employees at the branch location work with the chemical containers, but do not open any of the containers.\n\nG.S. Robins and Compay is a long time member of the National Association of Chemical Distributors (NACD).  Through NACD, G.S. Robins has committed and pledged to constantly improve the management and handling of chemicals by following NACD's Responsible Distribution Process (RDP).  RDP is a system that promotes continuous improvement in the health, safety, and environmental performance of all member companies.  G.S. Robins' implementation of the RDP includes a commitment to comply with relevant environmental, health, and safety regulations.  The senior management at G.S. Robins has formally accepted theses guiding principles.\n\nRDP includes guiding principles for all aspects of environmental, health, and safety.  These include:  communication with emergency response officials, operating our facilities in a safe manner, responding to community concerns about chemicals, and to make health, safety and the environment a priority.  In order to verify that G.S. Robins has complied with the guiding principles of RDP, the NACD conducts a third party verification.  The on-site verification is conducted by a third party.  The third party audits G.S. Robins every three years.\n\nThe primary activities at the Springfield branch consist of the following:  drum and tote storage, material loading and unloading, and transportation.  The Springfield facility of G.S. Robins has two of the 140 chemicals identified by the EPA above the threshold quantity.  These chemicals are:  sulfur dioxide and chlorin"

      "SummaryText": "e.  \n\nThe worst-case scenario for the GSR-Springfield facility involves chlorine.  Chlorine is stored on-site in three different types of containers.  These containers are: 2,000 lb cylinder and 150 lb cylinder and 90 lb cylinder.  The worst-case scenario demonstrates all of the chlorine on-site being released at one time.  The maximum amount on-site is 8180 lbs.  The scenario would be either a fire or explosion causing a complete release of all material at one time.  The scenario has an offsite impact radius of 1.3 miles (estimated distance to Toxic Endpoint).  The modeling was done using the RMP COMP program.  The liklihood of this scenario taking place is remote.  The chlorine is stored in the facilities outside storage area.  G.S. Robins does not have the maximum amount of inventory on-site at all times.  Currently, G.S. Robins and Company is investigating methods to reduce the amount of inventory on hand.\n\nThe alternative scenarios at GSR-Springfield consist of problems that are more likely to happen.  As a chemical distributor, we move large quantities of chemicals.  During the moving or storage of a chemical, there is always the chance that a container could begin leaking.  The leaking could be caused by several factors including: overfilling, jostling during transportaion, or just a leak.  GSR employees are all trained on safe material handling and how to properly handle spills and leaks.  All chemicals reported are stored in the outdoor chemical storage area.  The following are the alternative scenarios at G.S. Robins-Springfield.  These alternative scenarios were completed on the RMP COMP modeling program.\n\nALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS FOR OUTDOOR CHEMICAL STORAGE\nThe outdoor chemical storage consists of two sizes of cylinders.  The Alternative Scenarios represent incidents that are most likely to occur than the worst-case scenario.  GSR moves a large amount of material through the facility each year.  The types of incidents that are likely to occur are: drum lea"

In additions, the plan contains information on emergency contacts, plant layouts, and emergency reporting requirements.\n\nCHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nG.S.
