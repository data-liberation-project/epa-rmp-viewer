The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the stationary source\r\n\r\nTo address concerns of an accidental release, prevention and emergency response, all plant and field personnel are trained in ammonia emergency response procedures and use of appropriate protective equipment.  Refresher training and emergency response drills are conducted on a periodic basis to ensure personnel are equipped, trained, prepared, and practiced in responding to ammonia emergencies.  The last evaucation drill was performed on 02/01/2012.\r\n\r\nAs a result of information gathered during preparation of this Risk Management Program, Continental Refrigerated Services, University Park, Illinois continues to commit resources to further increase employee awareness and equipment reliability and to establish operator training and preventive maintenance programs.  As a demonstration of Continental Refrigerated Services high degree of commitment to public safety and service, Continental Refrigerated Services is taking action to decrease the risk of ammonia exposure to the public by implementing recommendations made during the Process Hazards Analysis and Off-site Consequence Analysis.\r\n\r\n2.

The five-year accident history\r\n\r\nA five-year accident history: there have been no reportable incidents within the last 5 years.  To prevent and/or minimize any potential future release of anhydrous ammonia, Continental Refrigerated Services is continuing to implement a detailed Process Safety Management program (Preventive Program 3).\r\n\r\n6. The emergency response program\r\n\r\n Emergency response is discussed in Section 5 of the RMP.  Continental Refrigerated Services has a detailed Emergency Response Plan (ERP) for their facility.  The purpose of this plan is to provide the means for rapidly determining the appropriate response for any emergency that may develop at the facility such as an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  Continental Refrigerated Services conducts scheduled drills of the emergency response plan. The Emergency Response Program is written, includes specific actions to be taken in response to an accidental release, includes procedures for informing the public and local agencies responsible for responding to an accidental release, and includes information on emergency health care.\r\n\r\n\r\n7. Planned changes to improve safety\r\n\r\nContinental Refrigerated Services is incorporating and addressing any recommendations resulting from the Process Hazard Analysis and Compliance Audit conducted in 2009.
