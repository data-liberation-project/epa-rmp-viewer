The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at our facility:\n\n\n\nIt is the intention of Western Management to commit to the personal, property and environmental safety to all surrounding life and environment that could possibly be affected in any manner by the business conducted at this facility.\n\n\n\nOur policy is SAFETY FIRST.  The personal safety of each employee of this company is of primary importance.  To the greatest degree possible, management will provide all mechanical and physical facilities required for personal safety.  Our objective is the safety program reducing our exposure to accidents to the absolute minimum.\n\n\n\nQuarterly Safety Audits are done at our facilities to insure compliance with all regulations and safety practices.\n\n\n\nOUR GOAL IS ZERO ACCIDENTS AND ZERO INJURIES.\n\nThrough a cooperative effort by each employee, we will attain our goal.\n\n\n\nWe recognize the responsibilities for safety are shared:\n\n\n\n1.    The employer accepts responsibility for leadership of the safety program, for its effectiveness, and safeguards providing a safe work place.\n\n\n\n2.    Employees are responsible for wholehearted cooperation of the safety program, including compliance with all rules, and practicing safety while performing their duties.\n\n\n\nEmployees are very actively involved in the safety program.  Western has monthly safety meetings for all employees.  The evacuation plan is practiced regularly.  Western has a SAFCOM committee which consists of at least one employee from every department.    The purpose of the SAFECOM committee is to allow employees to voice concerns and suggestions regarding the safety program in place at Western.\n\n\n\nOur policy is SAFETY FIRST.  The personal safety of each employee of this company is of primary importance.\n\n\n\nB.

Several trailers could be present at the location at any time. \n\n\n\nC.  The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario:\n\nWe used the computer program \"RMP comp\" as guidance for both scenarios.  Both scenarios included acetylene as this is the only product that falls under the guidelines.  For both scenarios, the endpoint is within 0.2 mile from the plant.  The public receptors within the 0.2 mile radius of the plant are a lime storage and sales facility and a residential house.  Both are located on Western International property.\n\n\n\nD. The general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\n\n\nWestern complies with the OSHA PSM regulations and NFPA 51A guidelines. \n\n\n\nWestern takes pride in having done it right the first time before an accident or incident would require any form of additional safety measures.  This facility has multiple gas monitors throughout the production areas and fire detectors.  The monitors are set to alarm at 10 % of the lower explosive limit (LEL). \n\n\n\nE. The five year accident history:\n\nNo accidents to report in the last five years.\n\n\n\nF.  The emergency response program:\n\nCoordination of Emergency Response for this facility consists of tours taken by the Bellville Fire Department and Local EMS system.  Western's Safety and Compliance Director is actively involved in the local LEPC.  Western invites the local Fire Department to our facility as part of their training program to familiarize them with our facility and products.  These tours and training received count as required hours the Fire Department members to remain certified. \n\n\n\nAll Western personnel also receive training on emergency response.  Evacuation drills are conducted at least annually or whenever a change in process would occur.  Monthly safety me"

We believe that properly trained personnel are safe personnel and therefore have no intentions of reducing the importance of safety.  Safety First will remain the policy for this company.
