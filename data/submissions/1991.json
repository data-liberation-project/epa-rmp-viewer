      "SummaryText": "1. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION & EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES:\nThis facility is a storage depot for local customers for just in time (JIT) shipments. Safety depends upon hte manner in which we handle these products combined with the safety devices inherent in the design of the facility.  Safe work practices and training of our personnel supplement the inherent safe design of the plant.\n\n2. THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED:\nThe primary purpose of this facility is the storage, preparation, painting, and shipping of specialty gases used in the electronics and fiber optics industries.  The material regulaed at the facility is Trichlorosilane due to the aggregate storage of this flammable substance over 10,000 lbs.  It is stored in UN rated containers (550 lbs. Product) and shipped locally via DOT approved vehicles and drivers.\n\nThe regulated substancs handled and triggered at this facility are:\n-Trichlorosilane: Flammable Liquid >15,000 total storage on site.\n\n3. THE WORST CASE SCENARIO AND THE ALTERNATE RELEASE SCENARIO, INCLUDING ADMINISTRATIVE CONTROLS AND MITIGATION MEASURES TO LIMIT THE DISTANCE FOR EACH REPORTED SCENARIO:\nBecause this facility is a program level 1, both the Worst Case and Alternate case do not apply. The initial worst case calculations determined no \"Off-Site Receptors.\"\n\n4. THE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS:\nThe facility complies with the Federal EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Plan and OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation.  The design and construction of the facility complies with applicable local and industry code.\n\n5. FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\nPer the requirements of EPA RMP, there have been no accidents or accidental releases of flammable liquids, toxic liquids, or toxic gases that could have had off-site consequences.\n\n6. THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\nThe facilities emergency resposne program is based upon OSHA's Hazwoper standard and the CGA COMPGEAP p"

      "SummaryText": "rogram defined by NFPA 472.  At this site, employees are trained to recognize emergencies and initiate emergency response from outside agencies.  They have been trained to OSHA's Operations Level as a minimum or as a HazMat Technician.  The employees receive annual refresher training in their role in the emergency plan. Emergency Response activities have also been coordinated with the local municipalities.  This includes communications with surrounding industry and emergency services.  Periodic drills are conducted with these groups/agencies to review the effectiveness of our emergency procedures. A drill is held each May with site employees, Chandler F. D. and Gila River F. D personnel. This is done through our annual Emergency Response Training Program offered free of charge to the local emergency services.\n\n7. PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\nSafety and Environmental Protection is of utmost importance to Solkatronic Chemicals.  Through OSHA and the Compressed Gas Associaiton codes / regulations, the implementation fo the CMA Responsible Care initiative, and excellent Accident Prevention Programs, improvements to safety performance are an ongoing continuous improvement process.  The sites injury rate / OSHA Recordable rate has been (0) for the last two years with the site over (4) four years withou a Lost Time Accident."
