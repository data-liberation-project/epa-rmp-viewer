(R&M), Marcus Hook, Pennsylvania Refinery hereafter referred to as the Marcus Hook Refinery, we are committed to operating and maintaining our processes in a safe, reliable and environmentally sound manner. We believe that excellent performance in health, safety, and the environment goes hand in hand with operating reliability, and that outstanding performance in all areas is required to achieve financial success.  Our company adheres to the guidelines of the Coalition for Environmentally Responsible Economies (CERES)--a comprehensive environmental code of conduct for corporations.  The Marcus Hook Refinery plays a major role in supporting this commitment.  \n\nThe Marcus Hook Refinery is designed, operated and maintained in a manner that protects the environment, as well as the health and safety of our employees, contractors and the community in which we operate.  We promote health, safety, and the environment through programs of awareness, compliance, prevention and protection.  These programs include a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\nA. A description of our facility and the use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP rule\nB. An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\nC. A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule\nD. An overview of our emergency response program\nE. An overview of planned changes to improve safety \nF. Supplemental information regarding our RMP Data Elements\n\n\nA.

The Marcus Hook Refinery has been in business at the same location since 1901. The refinery can process sweet crude oil obtained primarily from the North Sea and West Africa. Other functions on the 781-acre site are research and development. \n\nIn our processes, we use the following chemicals that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant off-site consequences in the event of a major accidental release:\n\nToxics\n\nEthylene Oxide is the only toxic in the Marcus Hook Refinery that meets the threshold quantity specified by the RMP regulation. \n\nFlammables\n\nThe Marcus Hook Refinery has a number of flammables which are in threshold quantities that are specified by the RMP regulation: Hydrogen, Methane, Ethane, Ethyl Mercaptan, Propane, Propylene, Isobutane, Butane, Butene, Isobutene, 1-Butene, 2-Butene-cis, 2-Butene-trans, 1,3-Butadiene, Isopentane, Pentane and Pentene.\n\nThese chemicals are used in one or more of seventeen (17) refinery processes covered by the RMP rule under program level three.  Our accidental release prevention programs and emergency planning and response programs help us effectively manage the hazards posed by these chemicals to our employees, the public, and the environment. \n\n\nB. GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION MEASURES\n\nThe centerpiece of Sunoco's accidental release prevention program is Process Safety Management (PSM).  Sunoco has implemented a management system for PSM, which assigns responsibilities to specific individuals. The fourteen (14) elements of PSM, which are outlined below, constitute the framework by which process safety and accident prevention are managed in the refinery.  \n\nPSM Prevention Program Elements \n\n     1. Employee Participation\n\nEmployee participation is ba"

      "SummaryText": "sed on the principle that employee involvement in various areas of PSM is key to maintaining a Process Safety system that has an \"our\" attitude. Our employee participation plan helps ensure that all employees have appropriate involvement in developing and implementing PSM. Employees are involved in Health and Safety committee activities, safety meetings, Process Hazard Analysis studies, pre-startup safety reviews, incident investigations, and the development of operating and maintenance training and procedures.\n\n     2. Process Safety Information\n\nProcess Safety Information (PSI) is compiled for each process covered by PSM and is made available to all personnel involved with or affected by that process via an internal computer-based Intranet.  PSI includes information pertaining to the hazards of the highly hazardous chemicals used or produced by the process, information pertaining to the technology of the process, and information pertaining to the equipment in the process.  This information is essential for supporting all of the other elements of our PSM program. \n\n     3. Process Hazard Analysis\n\nProcess Hazards Analyses (PHAs) are performed by experienced employee teams for each process covered by PSM. Our PHA teams are composed of personnel with engineering and process operating experience and a trained PHA team leader. Studies are conducted according to an established schedule, and each study is updated/revalidated at least every five years (or more often if necessary because of process changes). These comprehensive studies systematically review each unit to identify and assess hazards in the design or operation of the units.  Additional controls are recommended for any unmitigated hazards that are identified. Results of the PHA's are documented in reports that are made available to personnel. \n\n     4.

Training\n\nEmployees who are responsible for safe operation of the process units are provided with initial training and periodic refresher training.  This training includes a general overview of the process, properties, safety and health hazards of chemicals in the process, as well as a detailed understanding of the process operating procedures and safe work practices. Training is conducted using a combination of classroom training, computer-based training, and on-the-job training.

A written Management of Change procedure has been established and implemented to manage changes to process chemicals, technology, and equipment.  The procedure provides guidance, designates responsibilities and establishes steps to implement changes in the refinery. This program helps ensure that inadvertent or unintended changes are prevented, that any safety and health impacts are addressed, that affected procedures are updated, and that employees are informed of and trained in the approved changes. The Marcus Hook Refinery uses a computer-based software program to assist in tracking and processing change requests. Results of the Management of Change process are documented and maintained in the software program, and made available to all personnel.         \n\n     8. Pre-startup Safety Review\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews are performed by experienced teams as a final check to ensure the safety of new or modified process facilities before they are placed in service. The review confirms items such as: construction and equipment are in accordance with design specifications; safety, maintenance, operating, and emergency procedures are in place and are adequate; PHAs have been performed on new processes and all recommendations have been resolved; PSI documentation has been properly updated; MOC requirements have been satisfied for modified processes; and training has been completed (and documented) for affected employees.\n\n     9. Compliance Audits\n\nThe refinery Process Safety Coordinator is responsible to ensure that the procedures and practices developed under the PSM system are being followed.

Incident Investigation\n\nAn experienced team promptly investigates incidents that result in, or could reasonably have caused, a catastrophic release, fire or injury.  A systematic investigation process is used to determine the root cause of an event, analyze them and develop solutions to correct the situation and prevent it from recurring.  The investigation team then recommends and implements additional controls in order to mitigate hazards associated with the incident.  Incident causes are tracked, trended and published by the Safety Department.  The published reports are shared with employees and relevant findings are communicated throughout the Sunoco organization.\n\n     11. Hot Work Permit\n\nHot work permits are issued for any work that could create a source of ignition on or near a PSM-covered process unit. The hot work permit program ensures that OSHA's fire prevention and protection precautions, specified in 29 CFR 1910.252(a), are in place before hot work (work involving electric or gas welding, cutting, brazing, or similar flame or spark-producing operation) begins on or near a process.

FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe Sunoco Marcus Hook Refinery keeps records for all significant accidental chemical releases that occur at our facility. During the past five years, we have had two accidents resulting from the chemical release of materials covered under EPA's RMP rule. Both accidents were deemed RMP-reportable because the releases resulted in an onsite personnel injury that required medical treatment.  No offsite consequences occurred due to either incident. We have conducted formal incident investigations to identify and correct the root causes of the event and to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future.  The following is a brief summary of the incidents and the investigation results.\n\nOn August 18, 2000, an operator completed loading of an ethylene railcar, applied steam to the exterior of the loading hoses to vaporize any ethylene left in the hose, and depressured the hoses.  The operator verified that there was no pressure in the hoses and then proceeded to disconnect t"

The incident investigation revealed that the gauge used to measure pressure in the hose was the wrong type of gauge and that the operator was not utilizing Personal Protective Equipment correctly during the railcar loading process.  After the incident, the correct gauge was installed, the operating procedure for railcar loading was revised, and all operators were retrained on this revised procedure and the proper Personal Protective Equipment requirements.\n\nDuring a turnaround, a propylene arsene treater had been taken out of service and depressured and purged to the flare.  The final de-pressuring was completed through an open bleeder.  This bleeder was selected to show contractors working on the flare line that there was no pressure in the vessel.  The vessel contains a bed of catalyst that serves the purpose of removing any arsene from the propylene before going to storage.  As the vessel sat for ~1 week, pressure was building up in the vessel due to the heat of the day which caused propylene (entrained in the catalyst) to expand.  The bleeder that was left open either clogged or material precipitated to the bottom of the vessel creating a liquid seal.  Pressure was unable to relieve through the bleeder.  The pressure built up high enough to the point that on September 20, 2004, the bleeder became unclogged and propylene escaped from the bleeder.  One contractor employee breathed in the propylene and was treated on-site and subsequently sent to the hospital for further evaluation/treatment.  The individual was release from the hospital the same night and returned to work the following day.  The incident investigation determined the need for a refinery wide operational procedure to track and identify open bleeders during different types of work (e.g., pump, vessel, line) and subsequent training on the new procedure.    \n\n"
