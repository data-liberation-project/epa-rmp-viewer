      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nRISK MANAGEMENT PLAN\nMATAGORDA GAS PLANT\nGULF TERRA, INC.\n\nThe Matagorda Gas Plant has a long-standing commitment to employee and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Gulf Terra\u00bfs policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances; however, if a release does occur, trained gas plant personnel will control and contain the release and emergency personnel (when appropriate) will respond to ensure the safety of our employees and the public. \n\nThe Matagorda Gas Plant is located approximately 1.5 miles east of Highway 35 on FM 521 near Palacios, Texas in Matagorda County. The facility is a cryogenic natural gas processing plant designed for the extraction of liquid (raw mix) Y-grade product from a gas stream.  This liquid product consists of ethane, propane, butane and gasoline, which are regulated flammable substances.  Mixed liquids product from the liquids extraction plant is delivered via a pipeline that has the capacity to transport liquids containing ethane.  In order to establish as safe an environment as possible for employees and the public, Gulf Terra has elected to maintain minimum inventories (well below the threshold quantity) of toxic substances. \n\nBased on criteria outlined in the Accidental Release Prevention Program (ARP), the Matagorda Gas Plant is a Program 1 process.  The plant was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances were present in the process and if they exceeded the threshold quantity.  All equipment and vessels are considered to be connected and/or co-located; consequently, for the purposes of the ARP Program, all equipment and vessels are part of a single process.  The identification of even a single vessel exceeding threshold quantities of a regulated flammable or tox"

It was determined that a single vessel of the flammable liquid mixture exceeded threshold quantity.  The identification of this exceedance indicates that the Matagorda Gas Plant is a covered process with a regulated substance subject to offsite consequence analysis.  \n\nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS \u00bf WORST-CASE SCENARIOS (WCS)\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has defined a worst-case release as \"the release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a vessel or process line failure that results in the greatest distance to a specified endpoint.\"  A WCS analysis is required for each toxic substance in a covered process while only one WCS analysis is required for regulated flammable substances as a class.  WCSs are assumed to occur at ground level with meteorological conditions defined as atmospheric stability class F (stable atmosphere), wind speed of 1.0 meters per second (2.2 miles per hour), and an ambient air temperature of 25\u00baC (77\u00b0F).  Topography for WCSs are distinguished between rural and urban.\n \nRegulated flammable substances or mixtures containing flammable substances include both gases and volatile liquids.  The WCS assumes that the total quantity of a vapor cloud is released and detonates.  The endpoint for a WCS involving a regulated flammable substance or mixture is an overpressure of 1 pound per square inch (psi).  For a regulated flammable substance, consequence distance determination is based on its heat of combustion.  For regulated flammable mixtures, the component with the highest heat of combustion can be used for consequence distance determination or, if preferred, directly calculated using equation C-1 of the Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance Document (OCA"

The quantity of a regulated substance/mixture used to determine distance to endpoint is the largest quantity of a regulated substance/mixture in a single vessel.                                                                     \n \nThe flammable liquid mixture evaluated at the MGP is a mixture of methane, ethane, propane, butanes, pentanes, and hexanes contained in a pressurized storage vessel in liquid form.  The largest vessel quantity of the flammable liquid mixture at the site was the Product Surge Tank, which has a capacity of approximately 30,000  gallons (119,682 lbs.). Using the criteria outlined in the ARP rule, this mixture represents the facility's WCS for flammables.\n\nAlthough methane was identified as having the highest heat of combustion (50,029 kjoule/kg) while acting only as a minor component (<3% liquid volume), it was determined that its use would provide a more conservative consequence distance.  The distance to the endpoint of 1 psi overpressure for the worst-case release of the flammable liquid mixture was calculated using the RMP Comp program and was determined to be equal to 0.4 miles.  The distance to endpoint is less than the distance to any public receptors - a mandatory criterion for all Program 1 processes.\n\nThe Worst Case Scenario (WCS) associated with a release of flammable substances in Program 1 processes at the Matagorda Gas Plant is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) involving the full inventory of the product surge tank containing 119,682 lbs. of  product, of which ethane is the major constituent. The maximum distance to the 1-psi over pressure endpoint for this WCS is 0.4 mile. Although Gulf Terra has numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credits for passive and/or active mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating this WCS. \n\nThe vessel was built and installed to ASME Pressure Vessel Code Section VIII Standards.

These tests are conducted as part of the mechanical integrity element of Gulf Terra\u00bfs PSM program, which the plant has had in place for the past several years. Ultrasonic testing is also performed on non-insulated piping and vessels in the plant to determine that the wall thickness of the piping and vessels meets service requirements. \n\nAn Alternate Release Scenario (ARS) for flammable substances at the gas plant is not required since the covered RMP process at the facility is a Program 1 progress.  The facility does not have any toxic substances held above the threshold quantity, so an analysis of worst-case release scenarios and alternate release scenarios for all regulated toxic substances is also not required.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nMGP has not had any accidental releases during the past five years which meet the criteria for an accidental release as discussed in 40 CFR 68.42.\n\nLOCAL EMERGENCY RESPONSE COORDINATION\n\nThe MGP has coordinated its emergency response activities with the local emergency planning and response agencies as required in 40 CFR 68.12(b)(3)."
