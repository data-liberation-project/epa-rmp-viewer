      "SummaryText": "   This facility complies with requirements for Anhydrous Ammonia storage. Farmers Cooperative Company owns this fertilizer facility, and it is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, andlocal laws. We sell anhydrous ammonia to farmers for fertilizer use only. The storage tank consists of 30,000-gallons of anhydrous ammonia and associated piping, valves, and other miscellaneous equipment.  Our worst-case scenario is failure of the 30,000-gajllon storage tank when filled to the greatest amount allowed. According to EPA's look-up table, the distance to the endpoint is 4.4 miles. There are schools, residences, public recreational areas, and businesses within the distance to the endpoint, with a total population of 1581. This facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations. The ammonia system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with OSHA (29CFR 1910.111) We have never had an accident involving ammonia that caused death, injuries, property or environmental damage, or evacuations.  In the event of an emergency involving our ammonia tank, it is our policy to notify the Shell Rock Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency. They would intern call the Hazmat Team in Waterloo. We have discussed this policy with the fire department. Members of the fire department have inspected our ammonia tank. The Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship perform regular yearly inspections of this facility. An employee that is trained in Ammonia Safety performs daily inspections. Safety relief valves, fittings, and hoses are replaced in accordance with the law.Maintenance records are kept on all anhydrous ammonia equipmeny."
