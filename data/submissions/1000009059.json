If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitagate any release and minimize the impact of the\nrelease to people and the environment.\n\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.  Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.  \n\nThe maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia that can be stored would be 286,922 pounds, this includes the amount of anhydrous ammonia that could be stored in nurse tanks.\n\n\nThis facility complies with EPA'S Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.  This facility has implemented the provisions of \" Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American national Standards Institute, Inc. as adopted by state regulation and the standards of the U. S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration,\n29 CFR 1910.11, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.\n\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:  have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, shelter in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n\nRIVERLAND  FS, Inc. has  a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OHSA standard, 29 CFR \n1910.38;  provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.
