Senior management administer the safety and environmental policies and programs.  These programs include but are not limited to forklift safety, hazard communications, lockout/tagout, Hazardous Materials Emergency Business Plan, employee safety manuals, manufacturers documentation, Emergency Response, as well as the Risk Management Plan.\n\n\n\nWawona Frozen Foods has independently coordinated emergency response efforts with the local Fire Department.  In the case of an ammonia-related emergency, it is the policy of Wawona Frozen Foods to evacuate the production area and to allow the HazMat team to respond to the emergency.  If an ammonia release could potentially impact the local community, a Community Notification Plan would be activated.  This plan has been developed and implemented with input from local fire, police, and medical officials.  If an ammonia release were to extend into the neighboring community, a Shelter-In-Place plan would go into effect.\n\n\n\nThe refrigeration system is a closed loop system similar to a residential refrigerator.  There are no emissions or planned releases of ammonia.\n\n\n\nB. STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\n\nWawona Frozen Foods Ranch facility maintains one ammonia refrigeration system that cycles the refrigerant, or ammonia, from liquid to gas and back again.  The system has a low pressure or low side, where the refrigerant absorbs heat as it evaporates, and a high pressure or high side, where the refrigerant vapor gives off heat as it is condensed back into a liq"

Refrigeration is maintained by isolating the low side in some form of insulated enclosure where goods are chilled or frozen.  \n\n\n\nAmmonia is the regulated substance of concern.  The Facility has two engine areas that use a combined total of 11,057 pounds of ammonia in this single process.\n\n\n\nC.  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nThe Wawona Frozen Foods Ranch ammonia refrigeration system has many safety features.  Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system. \n\n\n\nThe Process Safety Management program ensures that all security and safety procedures are addressed.  Staff are trained in operation, maintenance and emergency procedures related to the operation of the ammonia refrigeration system.  All refrigeration equipment and ammonia vessels are equipped with automatic pressure safety relief devices to prevent pressure build-up beyond safe equipment operation levels.  A preventative maintenance program assures that equipment is maintained and serviced on a regular schedule and that worn, aging, or defective components are replaced as required to maintain equipment in good operating condition.  Controls and safety devices are tested regularly to ensure proper operation.\n\n\n\nD.  FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThe CalARP Program defines \"accident\" as the following:\n\n\n\n\"An unanticipated emission of a regulated substance or other extremely hazardous substance into the ambient air from a stationary source.\"\n\n\n\nThe release must have caused at least one of the following:\n\n\n\n?    On-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage (19CCR2750.9(a)); or\n\n?    Known offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place (19CCR2750.9(a)).\"\n\n\n\nBased on the above definition and an investigation into the facility's accident history conduct"

      "SummaryText": "ed during the Process Hazard Analysis meeting on October 26, 2016, there have been no releases of ammonia that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 100 pounds in the past five years (October 2011 - October 2016). In addition, there have been no injuries resulting from an ammonia release, nor any releases or \"near misses\" that warranted an internal incident investigation.\n\n\n\nE.  EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nWawona Frozen Foods' Emergency Response Plan was designed to ensure a safe and healthy working environment.  The policy at Wawona Frozen Foods is to identify and correct unsafe conditions and work practices before an incident can occur.  The Emergency Response Plan outlines the company safety policy, responsibilities, accident investigation, and proper safety training procedures required to provide a safe work place.  \n\n\n\nWawona Frozen Foods' Emergency Response Plan is outlined in the PSM/RMP documentation and the Injury and Illness Prevention Program (IIPP) and focuses on responding to ammonia releases.\n\n\n\nEvacuation Routes and Procedures\n\nIn the event of an emergency requiring evacuation, personnel will be instructed to vacate the premises to the designated assembly area.  This is upwind of the release and typically at the northeast corner of the facility.  \n\n\n\nMitigation Measures\n\nA group response team will be established to assess the situation and be available to assist the Fire Department.  Certain trained personnel are authorized to shut down the ammonia refrigeration system while exiting the area.  SCBAs are maintained and personnel are trained for response with assistance from the Fire Department.\n\n\n\nF.  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nWawona Frozen Foods is planning to complete several items over the next year as their continued effort to provide a safe work environment for their employees.  These changes include the following items:\n\n\n\n1.  Continue to train all employees in PSM/RMP/CalARP and safety programs.\n\n\n\n2.  Continue to have employe"
