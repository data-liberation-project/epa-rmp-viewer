This is borne out by well established safety policies and procedures. Equipment specifications, installations and operations are closely controlled to prevent releases of hazardous substances.\r\n\r\nIncluded in this commitment is the safety of its employees and the public. An emergency response plan is in effect which includes procedures for informing the public and emergency response agencies, documentation of proper first-aid and emergency medical treatment and procedures and measures for emergency response after a release occurs. An offsite emergency response plan has been submitted to the Local Emergency Planning Committee in accordance with the Emergency Planning and Community Right To Know Law.\r\n\r\nPlastics Engineering Company's North Avenue Plant produces phenolic resins and phenolic molding compounds. One of the raw materials used in the production of phenolic resins is a 52% solution of formaldehyde in water. The solution is received by tanker truck and stored in two tanks which are located in a diked area on the west end of the plant. The solution is pumped to the plant as needed for the various batches of resin. The amount of formaldehyde in the storage system exceeds the threshold amount as defined in the RMP rule, therefore, this process is subject to the rule. This process must meet the Program 3 requirements of the rule because it is subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard.\r\n\r\nThe RMP rule requires that the owner prepare one worst case release scenario and one alternative release scenario for each toxic substance held in a covered process. The North Avenue Facility has one covered process containing a toxic substance (Formaldehyde Storage System). The release scenarios are as follows:\r\n\r\n1.\tFormaldehyde Worst Case Release Scenario\r\nThis scenario is the instantaneous release of one tank containing formaldehyde solution as defin"

The area of concern was determined by using the AFTOX modeling program. There are no environmental receptors in the area of concern.\r\n\r\n2.\tFormaldehyde Alternative Release Scenario\r\nThis scenario was determined by using the results of the HAZOP (Hazard and Operability Study) that was performed on this process. The release would be caused by a failure of a tanker truck unloading hose. It is assumed that the entire contents of the tanker truck would be spilled into the concrete containment area at the unloading station. The formaldehyde would be released to the atmosphere by evaporation. The area of concern was determined using the AFTOX modeling program. There are no environmental receptors in the area of concern. Mitigation measures include the concrete containment area, operator attendance while unloading and a hose inspection program in conformance with industry standards.\r\n\r\nThe accidental release prevention program for the covered process is part of a comprehensive safety program at the North Avenue facility. The elements of the program that affect the processes are as follows:\r\n\r\n1.\tEmployee Participation\r\nPlastics Engineering Company has long recognized the need for the participation of employees in safety programs and in initiating safety improvements in their work areas. Employees participate in the Safety Representative Program, process hazard analyses, pre-startup safety reviews, and development of operating instructions.\r\n\r\n2.\tProcess Safety Information\r\nProcess safety information is compiled on the chemicals used in the processes, the technology of the processes and the equipment used in the processes. This information is updated regularly through the management of change program and the process hazard analysis reviews.\r\n\r\n3.\tProcess Hazard Analysis\r\nThere is an ongoing program to conduct process hazard analyses"

The procedures are updated through the management of change procedures.\r\n\r\nWritten standard safety procedures are in effect for operations such as lockout/tag out, hot work, confined space entry, opening process equipment and piping, and to control access into the facility by outside contractors or support personnel.\r\n\r\n5.\tTraining\r\nThe employees involved in operating the covered processes, are trained in the operation and the operating procedures for the process.
