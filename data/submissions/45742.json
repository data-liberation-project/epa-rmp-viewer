The Facility Policy\n\n\tMFA Incorporated the MFA Exchange and the employees of the MFA Bulk Plant in Chamois are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Chamois Fire Department, and other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information\n\n\tThe primary activity at the facility is the receiving, storage and distribution of anhydrous ammonia for direct application as a crop nutrient.\n\n\tThe maximum quantity stored would be 56,078 pounds in our 12,000 gallon storage tank. Product will be received by tanker truck which typically holds 50,000 pounds.  The facility also has an 8,000 gallon storage tank which holds 37,386 pounds.  The facility has 15 1,000 gallon nurse tanks that when filled would hold approximately 65,025 pounds.  There are also two 400 gallon and one 560 gallon applicators that would hold approximately\n5,896 pounds.  Therefore, the facility has a total storage capacity of approximately 164,385 pounds.  \n\n\n\n3. The Accidental Release Prevention Program.\n\n\tThe facility has implemented the provisions of Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1, 1981, published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., the Missouri Anhydrous Ammonia regulations and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, Storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia. The facility will work to meet the newest codes as time and budgets allow.\n\n\n4. The Five-year Accident History\n\n\t\n     There was an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia that \n     occurred at this facility on 8/21/02.  The release was \n\tcaused by two men att"
