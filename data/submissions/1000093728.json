Inc., an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Chevron Corporation, and by wholly owned subsidiaries of Phillips 66, and is headquartered in The Woodlands, Texas. \r\n\r\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED \r\nThe Port Arthur Terminal consists of a Dock & Storage facility and under normal operating conditions may contain several flammable substances (1,3 butadiene, and flammable mixtures containing propane, propylene, 1,3 butadiene, isoprene, butane, isopentane, and pentane in varying amounts) above the RMP threshold quantity, at any given time. The Port Arthur Terminal Dock & Storage facility are connected to each other and considered as (1) process unit and are remotely located from the CPChem manufacturing main plant. There are no RMP regulated toxic materials above threshold quantities at the Port Arthur Terminal.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\nJefferson County Local Emergency Planning Committee (409-835-8757) is the primary organization responsible for coordinating emergency response operations for this area. Chevron Phillips Chemical is an active member of this organization.

This facility is also covered by numerous EPA and Texas Commission on Environmental Quality regulatory requirements designed to limit the impact on the environment and we are in substantial compliance with these regulations. Port Arthur Terminal conducts regular Process Hazard Analyses (PHA) for the process to identify potential hazards as well as controls, systems, and recommendations to mitigate those hazards. Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner. The Terminal maintains Operating Procedures and Process Safety Information that describes the chemical hazards associated with regulated substances at the facility. The facility also has processes in place for Training, Compliance Audits, Incident Investigations, Management of Change (MOC), Employee Participation, Hot Work Permitting, and Contractor Safety Performance to ensure continual commitment to safety. Access to the Port Arthur Terminal is restricted to authorized employees, management personnel, and authorized contractors/visitor.\r\n\r\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY \r\nThere have been zero (0) accidents with on-site or off-site effects in the last five years involving chemicals that are on the 40 CFR PART 68.130 List of Substances and meeting the RMP criteria for accidents at the Port Arthur Terminal.\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO"

The Port Arthur Terminal manages all aspects of process safety through employee participation at all levels in the organization. Each element of the PSM and RMP standards is assigned to a responsible organizational position to maintain the systems that ensure compliance with regulatory requirements and management of that aspect of process safety. We have adopted a program of continuous improvement which can involve changes to plant design, operating procedures, or safety systems. The facility continually uses the MOC/ PSSR and PHA processes, to implement and evaluate changes to the equipment and chemical processes, and to determine if change will occur to the Alternative or Worst Case Release scenarios that have been previously identified. The facility also uses extensive facility siting procedures/ requirements, to continuously evaluate personnel safety and process hazards."
