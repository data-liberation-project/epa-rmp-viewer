              "Description": "The Port Arthur Terminal consists of a Dock & Storage facility and under normal operating conditions may contain one, or up to all three of the following RMP regulated flammable substances, (Propylene/ Propane, Raw Pyrolysis Gasoline, and Naphtha) above the RMP TQ, at any given time. These three regulated substances are mixtures. There are no RMP regulated toxic materials above threshold quantities at the Port Arthur Terminal. Under normal operation, the Terminal Dock site allows for the unloading of barges. However, under emergency conditions it is possible to load the regulated substance (1,3 Butadiene), via barge, which is then subsequently shipped out. The Terminal Storage site consists of two PP storage bullets, two storage tanks (C-6, C-16), and may receive material by barge, truck, or pipeline. Naphtha and/or Raw Pyrolysis may be stored in the C-6 / C-16 tanks as feedstock and Propylene / Propane is stored in the bullets as feedstock. The Port Arthur Terminal Dock & Storage facility are connected to each other and considered as (1) process unit. The following prevention program is linked to the RMP regulated flammable mixture (Propylene/ Propane). Per 68.25(2)(11), Worst Case Release scenario(s) for Raw Pyrolysis Gasoline and Naphtha, which reflects the greatest potential impact/ endpoint distance, have been submitted to represent all of the regulated flammable substances. Per 68.28(a) the Alternative Release scenario for Naphtha (pool fire) or Raw Pyrolysis Gasoline (pool fire) is submitted to represent all the flammable substances. Modeling results for Worst Case Release and Alternative Release scenarios are on file at the plant for all of the regulated substances. The Port Arthur Terminal is covered by OSHA Process Safety Management and Coast Guard Regulations.\n\n\n\nNote the last RMP submittal had four processes, which was one per chemical. The whole process is storage and the PHA's are conducted on the whole process at once, which is interconnected. Thus, the plant was treated as a single process for this RMP submittal.",

With approximately 5,000 employees, the LLC and its affiliates own more than 10.5 billion in assets, including various manufacturing and research facilities in eight countries. Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC is equally owned by Chevron U.S.A. Inc., an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Chevron Corporation, and by wholly owned subsidiaries of Phillips 66, and is headquartered in The Woodlands, Texas. \n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED \n\nThe Port Arthur Terminal consists of a Dock & Storage facility and under normal operating conditions may contain several flammable substances (1,3 butadiene, and flammable mixtures containing propane, propylene, 1,3 butadiene, isoprene, butane, isopentane, and pentane in varying amounts) above the RMP threshold quantity, at any given time. The Port Arthur Terminal Dock & Storage facility are connected to each other and considered as (1) process unit and are remotely located from the CPChem manufacturing main plant. There are no RMP regulated toxic materials above threshold quantities at the Port Arthur Terminal.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nJefferson County Local Emergency Planning Committee (409-835-8757) is the primary organization responsible for coordinating emergency response operations for this area. Chevron Phillips Chemical is an active member of this organization. Chevron Phillips Chemical Co. is also a member of Sabine Neches Chiefs Association, a mutual assistance emergency response organization dedicated to providing fire protection and safety management resources to the petrochemical industry of Jefferson County.

Chevron Phillips Chemical Co., Emergency Response Group would also respond to any event at the Port Arthur Terminal. The Terminal is covered by emergency procedures and processes from both the main Port Arthur facility as well as its own.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVTION PROGRAM AND PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe Port Arthur Terminal is covered by OSHA Process Safety Management and Coast Guard regulations and to the best of our knowledge we are in substantial compliance with these regulations. This facility is also covered by numerous EPA and Texas Commission on Environmental Quality regulatory requirements designed to limit the impact on the environment and we are in substantial compliance with these regulations. Port Arthur Terminal conducts regular Process Hazard Analyses (PHA) for the process to identify potential hazards as well as controls, systems, and recommendations to mitigate those hazards. Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner. The Terminal maintains Operating Procedures and Process Safety Information that describes the chemical hazards associated with regulated substances at the facility. The facility also has processes in place for Training, Compliance Audits, Incident Investigations, Management of Change (MOC), Employee Participation, Hot Work Permitting, and Contractor Safety Performance to ensure continual commitment to safety. Access to the Port Arthur Terminal is restricted to authorized employees, management personnel, and authorized contractors/visitor.\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY \n\nThere have been zero (0) accidents with on-site or off-site effects in the last five years involving chemicals that are on the 40 CFR PART 68.130 List of Substances and meeting the RMP criteria for accidents at the Port Arthur Terminal.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO"

The Port Arthur Terminal manages all aspects of process safety through employee participation at all levels in the organization. Each element of the PSM and RMP standards is assigned to a responsible organizational position to maintain the systems that ensure compliance with regulatory requirements and management of that aspect of process safety. We have adopted a program of continuous improvement which can involve changes to plant design, operating procedures, or safety systems. The facility continually uses the MOC/ PSSR and PHA processes, to implement and evaluate changes to the equipment and chemical processes, and to determine if change will occur to the Alternative or Worst Case Release scenarios that have been previously identified. The facility also uses extensive facility siting procedures/ requirements, to continuously evaluate personnel safety and process hazards."
