The facility receives dehydrated  natural\n\ngas  by  pipeline,  removes condensable natural  gas  liquids\n\n(NGLs)  and  carbon  dioxide,  and  ultimately  delivers  the\n\nnatural  gas  to  a  transmission pipeline.   The  Bull  Fork\n\nCompressor Station is co-located with the Bull Fork  Unit  #2\n\nproduction facility.\n\n\n\nOperators  of  the  facility have an on-going  commitment  to\n\nsafety   and   accident  prevention.   This   commitment   is\n\ndemonstrated by upper managements support of an  active  EH&S\n\nprogram. An employee training program is implemented as  part\n\nof  a  comprehensive EH&S management system and  the  use  of\n\nestablished  design  and construction standards  (API,  ASME,\n\nNEC),  and  the  installation of a state-of-the  art  process\n\ncontrol  and monitoring system.  The facility was constructed\n\nby  skilled  tradesmen who, in many cases, were  required  to\n\ndemonstrate  their skills and pass certification requirements\n\nprior  to  working  on  the project.   On-going  construction\n\ninspection  and  quality assurance procedures included  x-ray\n\nexamination  of welds for additional quality control.   Shop-\n\nfabricated  equipment mounted on skid units were  used  where\n\npossible to minimize field construction.\n\n\n\nAt  this  facility, critical process parameters are monitored\n\nremotely  on  a 24-hour basis using supervisory  control  and\n\ndata acquisition (SCADA) technologies.  This approach enables\n\noperation  without  full-time onsite  personnel.   The  SCADA\n\nsystems permit both automated and operator-directed responses\n\nto  process"

Plant personnel  are  trained  to\n\nrespond  to remote alarm conditions with both remote and  on-\n\nscene  responses.  Various automatic process  safeguards  and\n\ninterlocks are intended to preclude a release.  If a  release\n\nshould   occur,  these  systems  allow  an  immediate  remote\n\nresponse  from  trained operators as well as  alerting  other\n\npersonnel to the need for an onsite response.\n\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe  Bull  Fork Compressor Station consists of  a  number  of\n\nproduction units and/or scrubbers to remove liquids from  the\n\nnatural gas process stream, a membrane unit to remove  carbon\n\ndioxide,  and  two  Joule-Thompson (JT)  expansion  units  to\n\nextract  natural gas liquids (NGL).  Currently  the  facility\n\nprocesses  approximately 4 to 6 million standard  cubic  feet\n\nper  day  (MMscf/day) of dehydrated natural gas  and  the  JT\n\nexpansion units extract approximately 600 gallons of NGL  per\n\nday.    Planned  upgrades  to the  plant  will  increase  the\n\nthroughput of the facility to approximately 30 MMscf/day.\n\nThe  extracted  NGL  is  a flammable  mixture  consisting  of\n\nmultiple  regulated  flammable substances including  methane,\n\nethane,  propane,  butane, and pentane.   Included  with  the\n\nregulated  flammables are additional non-regulated flammables\n\nin  the C-6 through C-10+ range.  The NGL is currently stored\n\nat  ambient  temperatures in single  18,000  gallon  pressure\n\nvessel maintained at approximately 230 psig to control  vapor\n\nrelease.  As part of the planned facility expansion, a second\n\n18,000  gallon  NGL  storage vessel will be  added.

The production facility consists  of\n\nmultiple  production units that separate produced  water  and\n\ncondensate  from  the  gas stream.  The  condensate  contains\n\nmultiple  regulated  flammable substances including  methane,\n\nethane,  propane,  butane, and pentane.   Included  with  the\n\nregulated  flammables are additional non-regulated flammables\n\nin  the  C-6 through C-10+ range.  The separated liquids  are\n\nstored in two (2) 300 bbl vertical atmospheric storage tanks.\n\n\n\nThe  flammable  material storage capacity for the  co-located\n\nfacilities will total 65,400 gallons following the completion\n\nof  the  expansion  project.

No regulated toxic materials are stored  at\n\nthe facilities.\n\n\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis\n\nAt the subject facilities, regulated flammable substances are\n\ngenerated and stored as a result of three separate processes;\n\nthe  separation of slop liquids, the extraction of  NGL,  and\n\nthe  separation of produced condensate.  Storage vessels  for\n\nthe  three  processes are not connected; however the  vessels\n\nare  located  in  close  proximity.   Due  to  the  lack   of\n\nintervening distance between the process vessels, a  fire  or\n\nexplosion involving vessels for one process could potentially\n\nspread  to the remaining storage vessels. Therefore, for  the\n\npurposes of the offsite consequence analysis, the production,\n\nslop and NGL vessels are all considered to be one process.\n\n\n\nThe  worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with a  release  "

Operators have written  instructions  for\n\nnormal    operations   and   emergency   responses.     These\n\ninstructions  include  normal  and  emergency   startup   and\n\nshutdown,  as  well  as a variety of special  procedures  for\n\nrestarting  and adjusting various components of the  process.\n\nIn  addition  to  the written procedures, there  are  various\n\nsupplemental  training activities including safety  meetings,\n\ninternet-based  self  instruction, and  on-the-job  training.\n\nTraining   is   verified  by  a  combination  of   documented\n\nexperience,   observational  methods  and   verbal   testing.\n\nTraining   is  documented  in  writing,  and  reinforced   by\n\nrefresher training at least every three years.\n\n\n\nContractors.    The  facility uses  various  contractors  for\n\nmajor   plant   modifications  and  for  specific   scheduled\n\npreventative   maintenance   and   unscheduled    maintenance\n\noperations.  Contractors are required to attend a site safety\n\nbriefing   at   the  start  of  any  new  work.   Contractors\n\nperforming  continuing  services  are  required  to   provide\n\ndocumentation of training to facility personnel.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits.  Compliance audits of the general facil"

To-date, no audits have been performed other\n\nthan those associated with construction quality assurance.\n\n\n\nIncident  Investigation.  Incidents (involving a catastrophic\n\nrelease)   will   be   documented  and   investigated.    The\n\ninvestigation will begin within 48 hours of the release,  and\n\na  written  analysis  of  the cause and  recommendations  for\n\nfuture  prevention will be prepared, discussed with  affected\n\npersonnel,  and retained for a minimum of 5 years.   To-date,\n\nthere have been no catastrophic incidents.\n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nThe facility is newly constructed and to-date there have been\n\nno   accidents  involving  regulated  substances  that   have\n\nresulted  in  any  onsite  injuries or  significant  property\n\ndamage or any offsite response.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nA general Emergency Response Plan (ERP) has been prepared for\n\nseveral EnCana facilities, including the Bull Fork Compressor\n\nStation.  This general plan includes specific actions  for  a\n\nvariety of personnel, ranging from first responder to  senior\n\nmanagement.   There  is a comprehensive  list  of  names  and\n\ntelephone numbers in the ERP for key Bull Fork personnel  and\n\nemergency  responders.  The primary response  agency  is  the\n\nRangley,   Colorado  fire  department.   In   addition,   the\n\nemergency  response  program is  also  coordinated  with  the\n\nGarfield County local emergency planning committee (LEPC)  in\n\nGlenwood  Springs.    The  ERP is periodically  reviewed  and\n\nupdated as conditions require.\n\n"
