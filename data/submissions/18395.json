This interface provides the means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident. In addition to periodic LEPC meetings, the Aneth Gas Plant conducts periodic emergency drills that involve the LEPC and emergency response organizations, and the facility provides annual refresher training to local emergency responders regarding the hazards of regulated substances in the facility.\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\nThe Aneth Gas Plant resolves findings from PHAs, some of which result in modifications to the process. All the recommendations from previous PHAs, safety audits, and incident investigations are completed.  The following types of changes are expected over the next few years in response to PHA, safety audit, and incident investigation findings:\n* Planned annual review of operator training.\n* Planned review of process safety information on processes for PHA revalidation.\n* Planned annual review of personnel training programs.\n* Planned annual review written operating procedures."

This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.  In addition, the Aneth Gas Plant evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor. Facility personnel periodically monitor contractor performance with regard to their safety obligations.\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs):\nThe Aneth Gas Plant conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information. The purpose of the PSSR is to see that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service. This review provides one additional check that construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready. A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\nMechanical Integrity:\nThe Aneth Gas Plant has established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition. The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures. In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.\nMaintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response pla"

If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if situation presents an immediate safety concern), or a management of change team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary.\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance.  The Aneth Gas Plant incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs. This helps determine that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\nSafe Work Practices:\nThe Aneth Gas Plant has long-standing safe work practices in place to help provide worker and process safety. Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to isolate energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous substances before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work), and (5) a permit and procedure to verify that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space. These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help perform operations and maintenance activities safely.\nManagement of Change:\nThe Aneth Gas Plant has a comprehensive system to manage changes to all covered processes. This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process o"

Changes are reviewed to (1) determine that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change. Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes. In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.\nIncident Investigation:\nThe Aneth Gas Plant promptly investigates all incidents related to a covered process that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss or personal injury. The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to facility management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings.  ncident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidations. \nCompliance Audits:\nTo help determine that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the Aneth Gas Plant periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented. Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years. Both hourly and staff personnel participate in these audits. The audit"

This commitment is demonstrated by our efforts in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will evaluate the situation, take actions within the capabilities of the facility, and/or notify the necessary outside agencies.\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES:\nThe Aneth Gas Plant located in Montezuma Creek, Utah, U.S.A., operates Gas Compression and Gas Processing to extract petroleum products (e.g., PROPANE, BUTANE, ISOBUTANE, PENTANE, ISOPENTANE) from natural gas. The Aneth Gas Plant) has regulated flammables, including: MIXTURE OF PROPANE, BUTANE, ISOBUTANE, PENTANE, and ISOPENTANE, which are regulated substances.\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS:\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with a release of flammable substances at the Aneth Gas Plant) is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) involving the largest inventory of MIXTURE OF PROPANE, BUTANE, ISOBUTANE, PENTANE, ISOPENTANE contained in a single vessel/storage tank. A written procedure is in place to limit the maximum inventory in this vessel/storage tank to 330,000 lbs. (80% of the maximum capacity). The entire inventory is assumed to release and ignite, resulting in a VCE. Although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for passive mitigation measures was taken into account in evaluating this WCS.\nThe alternative release scenario (ARS) for flammable substances at the Aneth Gas Plant is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) involving propane from a Refrigerant Makeup vessel.
