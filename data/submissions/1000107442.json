Contractors that meet the minimum safety requirements are then judged to determine which one can provide a quality job at the lowest cost. If a contractor currently working in the plant is under consideration, the facility reviews recent safety audits and contacts plant personnel on the job site to verify satisfactory job performance before the facility authorizes the purchase order.\n\nThe Palatka Mill requires all contractors to complete a computer based training program that highlights the most hazardous areas in the mill.  The training includes the mill's safe work practices, and the emergency response procedures for the mill. The mill provides SDSs for the hazardous materials that may affect the contractor work area, copies of plant safe work practices and policies, and emergency response actions associated with the contractor's work. The mill then introduces personnel with whom they will communicate.\nThe Palatka Mill requires contractors to perform the following tasks to help ensure process safety:\n\ni.

Georgia-Pacific Palatka Mill's Regulated Substances\n\nGeorgia-Pacific's Palatka Mill is a pulp and paper mill primarily involved in the manufacture of brown/bleached pulp and paper products. As part of this manufacturing process, the mill produces and stores Chlorine Dioxide for the use of bleaching pulp. The Chlorine Dioxide solution system, which includes the generation, storage and distribution of the Chlorine Dioxide, is considered a Program Level 3 RMP covered process.  \n\n3. Accidental Release Prevention Program \n\nGeorgia-Pacific's Palatka Mill has always used a prevention program to help prevent accidental releases of hazardous substances. Beginning in 1992, the Palatka Mill formalized this prevention program for the Chlorine Dioxide system to comply with the 14 elements of The United States Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard 29 CFR 1910.119. In 1996, the EPA RMP Rule established that a Program Level 3 prevention program would become a requirement for these processes as well. The Palatka Mill's Program Level 3 Prevention Program under the RMP Rule is essentially the same as the OSHA PSM Program, except that the RMP also focuses on protecting th"

As part of this commitment, the company has established a system to help ensure the safe operation of the chemical processes at this facility. One component of this system is a Risk Management Program that helps manage the chemical process risks at the Palatka Mill and addresses compliance with the requirements of the United States Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Regulation 40 CFR Part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs. One of the requirements of the Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions is to submit a Risk Management Plan (RMP) describing the Risk Management Program at our Palatka Mill. This document is intended to provide the public with a description of the Risk Management Program in use at the Georgia-Pacific Palatka Mill.\n\nThe Risk Management Program at the Palatka Mill consists of three core elements:\n\nI. Hazard assessments which serve to help us understand the potential off-site consequences of hypothetical accidental releases.\n\nII. Prevention programs which serve to help maintain and safely operate the process which contains more than the threshold quantity of Chlorine Dioxide. \n\nIII. Emergency response program which serves to help respond to accidental releases of Chlorine Dioxide from the covered process. \n\nAlthough the Risk Management Program at the Palatka Mill helps provide assurance that our mill is maintained and operated in a safe manner, it is only one component of the overall safety program.
