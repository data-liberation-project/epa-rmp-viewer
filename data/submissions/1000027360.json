It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal, State, and local regulations. If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to immediately notify the Pomeroy Volunteer Fire Department (via a 911 call) and request that it respond to the emergency. Incidental to the notification to the fire department, a call to the Region V, Iowa LEPC will be made.\r\n\r\nWhile we have planned for an emergency, it is acknowledged that a real emergency will be unexpected and may very well be much different and cannot be ensured to duplicate what may have be planned. In reality, the situation that develops may not happen in the manner in which it has been planned. In that event, what may have been planned will serve only as a guideline to follow.\r\n\r\nThe Emergency Action Plan for this facility describes certain procedures that are intended to minimize the hazards associated with human health and the environment from fires, explosions, the sudden and unexpected release of chemicals (i.e., Anhydrous Ammonia), tornadoes, bomb threats or other accidents or acts of God which might occur on our premises.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      \r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE ANHYDROUS AMMONIA STORAGE/DISTRIBUTION PLANT AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCE HANDLED AT NEW COOPERATIVE INC. formerly TERRA INTERNATIONAL INC., POMEROY, IOWA:\r\n\r\nThis facility is a bulk anhydrous ammonia storage and distribution plant. The anhydrous ammonia that is stored at  this facility is distributed to agricultural crop producers in the surrounding area who utilize the anhydrous ammonia for crop nutrient purposes. \r\n\r\nThe system consists of three (3) storage tanks with associated piping, valves, liquid pump(s), and other miscellaneous equipment and an unidentified number of nurse tanks.

      "SummaryText": "y operated on a seasonal basis (Spring and Fall). Full-time equivalent employee numbers were computed on that basis. At a maximum, the plant operates a total of three months (1/4 of the year). The FTEs for this company location is one (1).\r\n\r\nTHE WORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS:\r\n\r\nThe worse-case scenario is the failure of the largest tank when filled to the greatest amount allowed (85% of capacity), resulting in the release of the total volume in a gaseous (hazardous ammonia vapor cloud) form. According to EPA's RMP* Comp Program (Version 1/06), the distance to the endpoint is 3.3 miles. The alernative release scenario involves the transport delivery vehicle pulling away from the intake lines into the storage plant without diconnecting the transfer hose. The resulting release (according to EPA's RMP*Comp Program) has a distance to endpoint of 0.1 miles. Since this facility is located in relatively close proximity to the Town of Pomeroy, provisions have been designed to notify all affected persons. An evacuation plan is in plan and in place. \r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS:\r\n\r\nThis facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable State and local codes and regulations. The anhydrous ammonia system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with ANSI Standard K-61.1-1995 and State law. \r\n\r\nIn addition the company has specific operating procedures in place intended to minimize the potential for an accidental (and potentially catastrophic) release of anhydrous ammonia. Finally, NEW Cooperative, Inc. has extended to the Pomeroy Volunteer Fire Department the opportunity to visit our anhydrous ammonia plant, to participate in mock emergency simulation training, and to avail themselves of specific anhydrous ammonia health hazard information and training provided by the company.\r\n\r\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\r\n\r\nNEW Cooperative, Inc., Pomeroy, Iowa has not experienced any"
