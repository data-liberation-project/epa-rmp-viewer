      "SummaryText": "Cedar County Coop West Branch is an agricultural retail cooperative that handles anhydrous ammonia as a nitrogen source for retail use in crop production.  We store it in a stationary storage tank and is transferred to portable tanks that are transported out to farms.  We are in compliance with all state and federal regulations.  If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the Cedar County Fire Department and LEPC.  We have had no accidents in the past 5 years and have no plans to change any safety procedures.  We adhere to safety regulations in OSHA 29 C.F.R. 1910.111 and ANSI k61.1 under state code. Our emergency action plan is followed under code 29 C.F.R. 1910.38  Our worst case scenario is a valve failure of a storage tank.  Under RMP COMP our toxic endpoint is 6.9 miles with an affected population 4123 people.  Our alternative scenario was a pipe leak that had a toxic endpoint of 1.6 miles that affected 226 people."
