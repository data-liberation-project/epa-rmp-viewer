      "SummaryText": "1.  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nPactiv Corporation is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent in our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the processes at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances and to train employees regarding the safe operation of processes involving regulated substances. Although such an event is unlikely, employees are trained to react to unplanned releases of regulated substances.  In addition, the plant coordinates with local and other emergency response organizations that provide highly trained emergency response personnel to help control and lessen the effects of any accidental release.\n\n2.  The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances\n\nThe primary manufacturing activity at this plant involves the production of plastic consumer products such as polystyrene foam plates, bowls, food containers, and trays. One substance present at the Canandaigua facility, iso-pentane, is regulated by United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) under the Risk Management Program   and is referenced in this document by the term \"regulated substance\".  Iso-pentane is used as a foaming agent in the production of the polystyrene foam.  \n\nThe maximum inventory of iso-pentane possible at the Canandaigua facility exceeds the 10,000 pound RMP threshold.\n\n3.  The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe Canandaigua facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under EPA's 40 CFR Part 68.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1967 Edition.  A number of processes at the facility are subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119. The "

The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that are in place at the facility.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nPactiv Corporation maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating guidelines and equipment designs associated with the processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nThe Canandaigua facility conducts extensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The approach used to carry out these analyses is a \"HAZOP/Modified What If\" process.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering, process operations, and safety and are revalidated at a regular interval of approximately every 5 years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Pactiv Corporation maintains written operating procedures. These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily available to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nPactiv Corporation uses a detailed training program to ensure that employees who are operating processes using regulated substances are skilled in the handling, operation, and maintenance procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least once every 3 years and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nPactiv Corporation carries out routine, periodic maintenance inspections and preventive maintenance on process equipment to help ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these inspections include bu"

Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with training in maintenance practices.  These personnel are provided specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by maintenance inspections are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures at Pactiv Corporation are in place to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of changes and provided training, as needed, to deal with these changes.\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at Pactiv Corporation.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that equipment and procedures are complete and suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nPactiv Corporation conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the requirements set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  These audits are carried out at least once every 3 years and corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\nPactiv Corporation promptly investigates any incident that results in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance. These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent a potential release from recurring.  Incident investigation reports are maintained on site for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation\nPactiv Corporation truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is"

Many employees participate in safety initiatives within the plant.  Over 80 employees participate as members of various emergency response teams, including Process Safety Management, fire response, spill response and emergency medical teams that cover all shifts, 24 hours/day, 7 days/week. In addition, Pactiv employees have access to the information created as part of our facility's implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses.\n\nContractors\nOn occasion, Pactiv retains contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of the contractor's safety performance and program is carried out.  Pactiv Corporation has a strict policy of informing contractors of known potential hazards related to the contractor's work and the Pactiv processes.  Contractors are also informed of the procedures for emergency response that they are required to follow should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\n\nHot Work\nThe facility maintains a hot work program and issues a hot work permit for hot work conducted on or near the covered process.  Hot work is performed by qualified personnel who complete each permit and fulfill its requirements prior to the start of a hot work operation.  These permits are kept at the job site until the conclusion of the hot work operation.  Completed hot work permits are kept on file in the facility's safety office.\n\n4.  Five-year Accident History\n\nPactiv Corporation is proud of its excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years.  There have been no accidental releases during this period.\n\n5.  Emergency Response Plan\n\nPactiv Corporation has developed a written emergency response plan to deal with fires and releases of hazardous materials.  The plan "

The plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within the processes that would require a modified emergency response. In addition, emergency response equipment (fire extinguishers, etc) is regularly inspected and serviced.\n\n6.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSeveral developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program, including upgraded iso-pentane pumping systems with secondary containment and vapor detection alarms, upgraded tank and piping leak detection systems, and an automated tank car sprinkler protection system. Approximately 100 iso-pentane system improvements recommended from process hazard analyses\nhave been implemented.\n\nOur facility has exemplary occupational safety and health programs which encompass employee involvement, recognition for safe work, partnership with OSHA and continuous hazard identification activities."
