      "SummaryText": "hemicals on earth - the location contains 98 of the world's 110 known chemical elements.  Searles Valley Minerals extracts, chemically processes and ships minerals and inorganic chemical compounds to customers all over the world.  The company currently produces soda ash, sodium borates, boric acid and natural sulfate.  \r\n\r\nA unique liquid-liquid extraction (LLX) process for manufacturing boric acid has been operated at the Facility since 1962.  An organic extractant was developed and patented for use in this process.  The boric acid process is based on the ability of the organic extractant to form a compound with certain boron compounds found in the Searles Lake brines to form a compound that has very specific properties.  \r\n\r\nBoric acid production consists of 2 processes: liquid-liquid extraction (LLX) and evaporation-crystallization.  The liquid-liquid extraction process consists of 2 sections:\r\n1.\tA loading section where boron, sodium and potassium are extracted from the lake brine, and combined into the organic extractant used in the LLX Plant. \r\n2.\tA stripping section where the boron, sodium and potassium are stripped from the organic extractant by contact with a dilute acidic aqueous solution to form an aqueous solution of boric acid and sodium and potassium sulfates (called the strip solution), and to regenerate the extractant for re-contact with Lake Brine.\r\n\r\nIn the evaporation-crystallization section the dilute aqueous strip solution is evaporated and the boric acid is separated from the mixed sulfates by fractional crystallization.\r\n\r\nDescription of Regulated Substance Use\r\nThe extractant is produced at the Facility by mixing a manufactured product (called P20) with kerosene in predetermined volumes according to specific procedures.  P20 is produced in the P20 Plant (at the Trona Facility) and it can be described as a 50% weight solution of specific phenolic compounds in a kerosene base.  The purpose of P20 is to provide the raw material for making the ex"

P20 is manufactured in a batch process (currently one batch per day on average) in which each batch consists of approximately 900 gallons of P20 product.  P20 product is stored in a tank for use at the LLX Plant to produce extractant.\r\n\r\nChlorine and 37-percent concentrated formaldehyde solution (both of which are regulated substances) alongwith other raw materials are used in the manufacture of P20 Product.  Chlorine, in one ton containers, is used in a batch process in which a measured amount of liquid chlorine is fed from a one-ton container, through a chlorine vaporizer, to an intermediate process reactor in which para-nonylphenol is chlorinated.  This intermediate product (chlorinated para-nonylphenol) is then used as one of the raw materials alongwith 37-percent concentrated formaldehyde solution in the presence of sodium hydroxide, water and borax at controlled temperatures and retention times for the manufacture of the P20 Product.  \r\n\r\nThe storage, handling and use system for chlorine at the Trona Facility consists of the following:\r\n\u00bf\tReceipt of one-ton chlorine containers;\r\n\u00bf\tUnloading/Loading hoist;\r\n\u00bf\tFive one-ton containers in a storage area;\r\n\u00bf\tA one-ton container weighing station;\r\n\u00bf\tLiquid chlorine transfer pipelines;\r\n\u00bf\tA liquid chlorine evaporator area;\r\n\u00bf\tGas chlorine transfer pipelines;\r\n\u00bf\tA fumes scrubber system;\r\n\u00bf\tChlorine absorber system; \r\n\u00bf\tCooling water pipeline; and\r\n\u00bf\tProcess instrumentation and detection and monitoring devices;\r\n\r\nThe formaldehyde storage, handling and use system at the Trona Facility consists of the following:\r\n\u00bf\tA condensation reaction area;\r\n\u00bf\tTransition product pipelines and product pipeline;\r\n\u00bf\tFormaldehyde storage tank and containment area;\r\n\u00bf\tFormaldehyde transfer lines and transfer pump; \r\n\u00bf\tSodium Hydroxide, borax, water and kerosene transfer lines; \r\n\u00bf\tProcess instrumentation and detecti"

These site security provisions are intended to prevent unauthorized access to Facility areas including those areas where chlorine and formaldehyde are stored, handled or used, thus adding a level of safety for the storage of chlorine and formaldehyde at the Facility.\r\n\r\nES 2.0\tACCIDENTAL RELEASE SCENARIOS\r\n\r\nThe Federal RMP regulations and the CalARP RMP regulations require that at least two types of release scenarios be evaluated for their potential to impact off-site populations:\r\n\r\n\u00bf\tthe worst case release; and\r\n\u00bf\tan alternative release (an accident scenario that is more credible than the worst-case release scenario).\r\n\r\nA number of hypothetical accidental release scenarios were postulated and evaluated for the Five Year Federal RMP/CalARP RMP Update.  These scenarios were categorized into worst-case release scenarios and alternative release scenarios.  Each of these categories of hypothetical accidental release scenarios is discussed below.\r\n\r\nCHLORINE\r\n\r\nWorst-Case Release Scenario\r\nIn this scenario, one of the five one-ton containers of chlorine on site experiences a catastrophic failure due to an unknown event.  This scenario could be initiated by an external event (i.e., an airplane, missile or meteorite impacting the chlorine storage area where the one ton containers are located).  It is highly improbable that this scenario would be initiated by a seismic event. However, the possibility of this scenario being initiated by a seismic event cannot be completely discarded.  This scenario is considered to be extremely unlikely.  In the extremely unlikely case that this scenario occurs, up to 2,000-pounds of chlorine could be released (in the worst-case).  The release of chlorine would occur outdoors.  Thus, it was assumed that the chlorine released during the catastrophic accident form a cloud of chl"

These scenarios include situations such as delivery of a leaking one-ton container of chlorine to the Facility, a pinhole leak in the chlorine transfer piping (liquid or vapor transfer lines), a partial or complete failure of the chlorine transfer lines (liquid chlorine) at various points in the system (above-ground), or a partial or complete failure of the chlorine transfer lines (chlorine vapor) at various points in the system (above-ground).  In order to be conservative in the estimation of the vulnerable zone, it was assumed that 2000-pounds of chlorine gas were released during an event in which the one-inch valve on one of the containers is sheared off due to some unknown external event.
