Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.  The storage and handling system consists of 30,000 gallons storage tank, loading risers, associated plumbing and nurse tanks.  Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.\n     The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia that can be stored would be 140, 000 pounds.\n\nThe accidental release prevention program.\n     This facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations. This facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc. as adopted by state regulation and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".  Compliance with these regulations and on-going training of our employees make up our accident release prevention program.\n\nFive year accident history.\n     There have been no accidental release of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\n       - have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor\n  "
