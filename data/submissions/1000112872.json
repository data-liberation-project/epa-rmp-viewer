      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nWestern Power and Steam II LLC stores and utilizes anhydrous ammonia in a selective catalytic \nreduction (SCR) process at their facility, northeast of Bakersfield, California. It is Western Power and Steam II LLC's policy to comply with all applicable governmental regulations. Further, it is Western Power and Steam II LLC's objective to be a responsible citizen of the community in all of its business activities.\n\nWestern Power and Steam II LLC emphasizes safe and environmentally sound operating practices and procedures through their employee training programs. In addition to job specific training, operators and maintenance personnel receive training in fire prevention, hazardous materials handling, safe work methods, and safe use of equipment. Additionally, emergency response procedures have been established by Western Power and Steam II LLC.\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Western Power and Steam II LLC cogeneration facility is owned and operated by Grade 6 Oil,  LLC. The plant, which is located in the Kern River Oil Field, northeast of Bakersfield, California, began commercial operation in the spring of 1990.\n\nCogeneration, in the case of the Western Power and Steam II LLC facility, is the simultaneous \nproduction of thermal energy and electrical energy from the combustion of a single fuel source. \nCombustion of the fuel takes place in a gas turbine that is physically coupled to an electric \ngenerator. Waste heat from the gas turbine's exhaust flows into a heat recovery steam generator \n(HRSG). The HRSG extracts the heat from the exhaust gases and produces steam for thermally enhanced oil recovery. Electricity is produced at the same time via the electric generator coupled to the combustion turbine.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is used at the Western Power and Steam II LLC facility to create a reducing \natmosphere in the SCR process. This reducing atmosphere"
