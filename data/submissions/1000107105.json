The tanks are also equipped with a dual relief system which includes bursting disc and pressure relief valves that discharge to a properly designed relief valve vent system.  The tanks also have an overfill protection system.  This system automatically isolates the tanks at the 90% full level to prevent the tanks from being overfilled and causing a potential spill or release.  The pressure on the tanks is controlled by venting the gas to a hydrogen recovery system eliminating the venting of gas to the atmosphere.  There is an automatic water deluge system on the tanks and the truck fill zone.  The deluge system is flow tested annually.  Vacuum on the tanks is tested to ensure there are no internal leaks.  The process and fire systems are monitored by a computer control system.  The operation is manned 24/7.  \n\n\nFive-year Accident History\n\nThe McIntosh Hydrogen facility accident history indicates continuous safe operation of our covered chemical process over the last five years. There were no covered process releases that resulted in an EPA RMP recordable accident.\n\nEmergency Response Programs\n\nLinde has an emergency response program in place to minimize the effects of accidental release of regulated substances on employees, the public, and the environment. \n\nFor other than minor incidents Linde has in place an emergency response plan in coordination with the Washington County LEPC and the McIntosh Volunteer Fire Department.  \n\nAll facility employees are trained in their role in the emergency plan and emergency drills are conducted at least annually.\n \nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nLinde has a commitment to safety that is expressed in a company-wide goal of Zero/Zero, which means zero accidents and zero injuries or illnesses at each and every location. We look to constantly improve the safety of our processes using recommendations developed through the prevention program and a program soliciting safety"

      "SummaryText": "Facility Description\n\nThe Linde facility at McIntosh, Alabama is a Liquid hydrogen Production Plant.  We receive raw hydrogen gas produced as a by-product from a nearby chemical plant via pipeline.  This hydrogen gas is compressed and purified by removing moisture and other contaminants.  The purified gas is then sent to our hydrogen liquefier.  This part of the process uses liquid nitrogen which is produced on site and expansion turbines to make the final cryogenic liquid hydrogen product.  The liquid hydrogen is stored on-site in insulated storage tanks and shipped by tanker truck to customers throughout the country.\n\nAs an alternate source of hydrogen gas for our liquefier, we also have a Steam Methane Reformer (SMR) on site.  This process produces hydrogen gas by combining natural gas (mostly methane) and steam across a catalyst to produce hydrogen gas.  This gas is sent to our hydrogen purifier and eventually to the hydrogen liquefier to produce the final liquid hydrogen product.\n\n\nRegulated Substances\n\nThis facility uses, manufactures, or stores a chemical listed in part 68 of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, beyond a threshold quantity, as established by the EPA; \nHydrogen, which is purified, liquefied and stored on this site and then shipped out via cryogenic liquid transport. \n \n\nAccidental Release Prevention Policy\n\nLinde is dedicated to being the best performing industrial gas company in all aspects of our business, including safety, health, and environmental affairs. Our safety, health, and environmental policy call for a commitment to protecting the health and safety of our employees, neighbors, and the surrounding environment. This policy is the basis for engineering and construction programs that produce equipment and process systems that minimize the possibility of accidental chemical releases and operational safety programs that ensure safe operation of our facilities. Linde is committed to the continuous improvement of these programs."
