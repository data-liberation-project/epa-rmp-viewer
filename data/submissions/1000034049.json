      "SummaryText": "RODUCTS\r\n\r\nAmmonia solutions and chlorine are used in the water treatment industry. The same properties that make these chemicals valuable as a commodity also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling to reduce the threat to nearby members of our community as well as to the employees of the company.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal, State, and Local regulations. These chemicals are not packaged at the Lancaster site. The site receives the chemicals in packages, places them in storage, and then ships them to customers.\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE & EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\r\n\r\nBrenntag Southwest maintains emergency equipment specifically designed for use in an emergency to stop leaks from product containers.
