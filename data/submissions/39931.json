The facility is an existing operating\n\nsource. This document has been prepared in order to address the following issues:\n\n\n\n     Acknowledge the operation of an existing source with processes subject to the RMP\n\nregulations and requirements.\n\n     Incorporate revisions to the RMP pursuant to the requirements of the CalARP and 40\n\nCFR 68 regulations.\n\n\n\nThe RMP addresses the requirements of the California Accidental Release Program (CalARP) as\n\nadopted by the State of California as outlined in California Code of Regulations (CCR), Title 19.\n\nThese federal and state requirements build upon the provisions of the \"general duty clause\" of the\n\nClean Air Act Amendments of 1990, and the federal RMP program requirements in 40 Code of\n\nFederal Regulations (CFR) 68, which require the following activities of all facilities which\n\nproduce, process, store, or handle listed substances:\n\n\n\n     identify hazards\n\n     design and maintain a safe facility\n\n     prevent releases\n\n     minimize the consequences of releases.\n\n\n\nThe required approach to accomplishing the above, pursuant to the CalARP and Federal RMP\n\nregulations, is to have a documented risk management plan, which outlines the steps and\n\nprocedures a facility must take to prevent and mitigate accidental releases. BFP has chosen to\n\nprepare and implement its RMP for the anhydrous ammonia system in order to fulfill its\n\nobligations with respect to the RMP regulations and the General Duty clause and to protect its\n\nemployees and the surrounding community from the effects of accidental releases.\n\n\n\nPursuant to 40 CFR 68.155 and CCR Title 19, Section 2745.3, the following summary is given:\n\n\n\n"

Principal process equipment includes the boilers, steam turbine, air\n\npollution control systems, fuel handling systems, ammonia storage and delivery system, and\n\ncooling tower. The site elevation is approximately 3250 ft. above mean sea level. The exhaust\n\nstack heights are approximately 125 ft. above grade.\n\n \n\nEmission controls incorporate Best Available Control Technology (BACT). Each boiler is\n\nequipped with electrostatic precipitators for control of particulate matter, and ammonia injection\n\n(Thermal DeNOx) for the control of NOx emissions. Anhydrous ammonia is used as the NOx\n\nreduction reagent.
