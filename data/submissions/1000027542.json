      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\r\n\r\nThe BP Cherry Point Refinery has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release. Non-essential personnel will be evacuated to more remote locations outside the main refinery.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nThe BP Cherry Point Refinery operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products from crude oil.  The refinery has several regulated flammables: isobutane, butane, pentane, propane, and flammable mixtures.  In addition, the refinery uses aqueous ammonia, which is a regulated toxic substance.  Other toxic substances common to refineries were evaluated; hydrogen sulfide, anhydrous ammonia, sulfur dioxide, and mercaptans do not exceed their respective threshold quantities and therefore are not reported.\r\n\r\nCrude/Vacuum Unit\r\n\r\nThe Crude/Vacuum Unit consists of two processes.  The Crude Unit is the initial process unit in the refinery, and is designed to remove salt and sediment from raw crude oil then heat and fractionate the crude into finished and intermediate products.  The Vacuum Unit is designed to process crude tower bottoms in the vacuum diesel fractionator tower and the vacuum tower.  Negative pressure (i.e., a vacuum) is required to fractionate this heavy material without forming coke.  The Crude Unit is Program Level 3 because of regulated flammable mixtures.  The calculated weight of the flammable mixtures stored in this unit is 74,000 pounds (lbs). \r\n\r\n#1 Reformer/Naphtha HDS Unit\r\n\r\nThe #1 Reformer/Naphtha Hydrodesulfurization (HDS) Unit c"

The design basis provides for a \"future case\" where the unit can process cracked feedstocks under more severe conditions, although numerous modifications still need to be made to accomplish this.  As currently designed, the unit processes straight-run diesel feeds from the crude unit.  The ULSD process combines hydrogen with straight-run diesel feeds and processes them in a high-pressure reactor filled with specialty catalyst.  The reaction produces hydrogen sulfide, which is then separated from the diesel stream and removed from the process through amine scrubbing.  The amine hydrogen sulfide mixture is recycled to the sulfur recovery plant and processed into molten sulfur.  The unit consumes 6 to 7 million standard cubic feet per day of 220 pounds per square inch gauge hydrogen and is designed to reduce the sulfur in the diesel from 6,800 parts per million (ppm) to less than 15 ppm.  The ULSD Unit is Program Level 3 because of regulated flammable mixture and liquids.

Because processes at the refinery that are subject to the EPA RMP regulation are also subject to the OSHA PSM standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\r\n\r\nEMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION\r\n\r\nBP Cherry Point employees have always been encouraged to be involved in all aspects of operating this facility. Through the years, an open working relationship has developed between employer and employee. This relationship is evident in the employee involvement in many areas, such as the following:\r\n\r\n1. Operations and Maintenance Procedures\r\n2. Operations Manuals and Simplified Flow Diagrams\r\n3. Training Programs\r\n4. Process Hazards Analysis\r\n5. Safety Committee\r\n6. Emergency Response Team\r\n7. Turnaround Planning\r\n8. Contractors Safety Council\r\n9. Prestart-up safety review\r\n10. Incident investigation\r\n11. Safety Standards and Policies\r\n\r\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION\r\n\r\nThe BP Cherry Point Refinery maintains a variety of technical documents that help ensure safe facility operation.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Specific departments within the refinery are assigned responsibility for maintaining and updating process safety information.\r\n\r\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safe"

For specific process areas, the refinery has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters.  The refinery ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems.\r\n\r\nThe refinery also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes, to ensure that safety features are not compromised.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nThe BP Cherry Point Refinery has a comprehensive program to ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazards Analysis (PHA) performed at Cherry Point will be via either hazard and operability studies (HAZOPs) or What-If Checklist studies.  The HAZOP and What-If Checklist processes are based on the principle that a team approach to hazard analysis will identify more problems than when individuals work separately and combine results.  The PHA team is comprised of individuals with varying backgrounds and expertise brought together to thoroughly review the process hazards through collective brainstorming.\r\n\r\nThe team's findings are forwarded to local management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation measures is tracked until complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, tr"

These periodic reviews are conducted every five years.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.\r\n\r\n\r\nOPERATING PROCEDURES\r\n\r\nThe BP Cherry Point Refinery maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  Through the management of change process, these procedures are kept current and accurately maintained.  \r\n\r\nThis information is readily available to operators in the process units and for other personnel to use, as necessary, to perform their job tasks safely.\r\n\r\n\r\nTRAINING\r\n\r\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the refinery has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in process operation.  \r\n\r\nNew employees receive basic training in refinery operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with an experienced operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner, they can work independently.  In addition to initial training, all operators periodically receive refresher training to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every three years.  \r\n\r\nAll of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.

The simulators are fully functional and can duplicate all unit characteristics, and can also be used to simulate proposed changes to determine whether safety parameters could be violated.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTRACTORS\r\n\r\nThe BP Cherry Point Refinery uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the refinery has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow the site safety rules, and (6) inform refinery personnel of any hazards that they encounter during their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.  In addition, the refinery evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the contractor selection process.  Refinery personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\r\n\r\nPRE-STARTUP REVIEWS\r\n\r\nThe BP Cherry Point Refinery conducts a process startup safety review for any new facility or facility modifications that require a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the safety review is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment in service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all su"

The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures.  In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process equipment.\r\n\r\nMaintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training inspections and tests.  These inspections and tests are performed to ensure that the equipment functions as intended and is within acceptable limits.  If a deficiency is identified, employees correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service, or a team will review equipment use and determine what actions are necessary to ensure its safe operation.\r\n\r\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance.  The BP Cherry Point Refinery incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs to ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when making repairs.\r\nThe mechanical integrity program was developed and documented by the Engineering Authority and is updated by the Engineering Authority, as needed.\r\n\r\n\r\nSAFE WORK PRACTICES"

Examples of these practices include: (1) electronic control of unit entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (4) a permit and procedure to control \"hot work\" activities, and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.  These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\r\n\r\nMANAGEMENT OF CHANGE\r\n\r\nThe BP Cherry Point Refinery has a comprehensive system to manage process changes.  This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology, procedures, and other facility changes are properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls will not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training for the change.\r\n\r\nINCIDENT INVESTIGATION\r\n\r\nThe refinery promptly and thoroughly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.

Incident investigation reports are retained for at least five years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA re-validations.\r\n\r\nCOMPLIANCE AUDITS\r\n\r\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the refinery periodically conducts an audit to determine whether procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.  Compliance audits are conducted at least every three years.  The audit team forwards its findings to refinery management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.\r\n\r\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nThe processes at the refinery have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation. The accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all program EPA-RMP covered processes at the refinery. Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by (1) equipment failures and (2) human errors. In addition to the accident prevention program activities, the refinery has safety features on many units to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of a release. The following types of safety features are used in various processes:\r\n\r\nRELEASE DETECTION\r\n\r\nHydrocarbon detectors and hydrogen sulfide detectors with alarms.\r\n\r\nRELEASE CONTAINMENT/CONTROLS\r\n\r\nProcess relief valves that"

The frequency of accidental releases has been extremely low. The refinery has not had any release that has gone outside of the refinery boundaries. There have not been any OSHA recordable injuries resulting from a flammable release or a toxic release in the past five years. Every incident is investigated carefully and changes are instituted to prevent such an incident from happening again.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\r\n\r\nThe BP Cherry Point Refinery has implemented an emergency response program (ERP) to prepare for potential incidents, respond to them effectively, and recover from their impacts.  The goal of the program is to protect worker and public safety, as well as the environment.  The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  In addition, the refinery has procedures that address maintenance, inspec"

Employees receive training in these procedures, as necessary, to perform their specific emergency response duties. \r\n\r\nThe ERP includes a set of potential incidents that are used for emergency drills, including accidental release of toxic gases (ammonia), accidental release of flammable materials resulting in a fire and explosion, and accidental spill of hazardous materials on the ground within the refinery perimeter.  \r\n\r\nThe BP Cherry Point Refinery uses an Emergency Management Organization, known as the Incident Command System (ICS), to respond to and manage incidents.  The ICS has a hierarchical (i.e., chain-of-command) structure that places the highest responsibility on the Emergency Manager, who has the overall responsibility for the emergency.  The Emergency Manager delegates direct command responsibilities to the Incident Commander, who has the highest authority during an emergency.  The Emergency Manger is a liaison between the Incident Commander, the public, and the Company.  The next level of responsibility resides on four section chiefs: Command Chief, Operations Chief, Planning Chief, and Logistics/Finance Chief.  All section chiefs receive directions from the Incident Commander during an emergency.  Each position within the organization has specific assignments and responsibilities, defined in the ERP.  The ICS is expanded or contracted to meet the needs or requirements of an emergency; as the scope and complexity of an emergency expands, so does the ICS.\r\nThe overall emergency response program for the BP Cherry Point Refinery is coordinated with the Whatcom County Local Emergency Planning Committee.  This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives.
