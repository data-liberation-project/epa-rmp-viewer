Policies and procedures are in-place to assist the staff with compliance with applicable hazardous materials rules and regulations. The Process Safety Management (PSM) Team at the facility is responsible to ensure appropriate procedures and safety measures are in-place to protect our employees and the surrounding community. The PSM Team is comprised of the Distribution Center Director, Maintenance/Safety Manager with assistance from the Senior Director Facility Services Engineer, Corporate Environmental, Health & Safety Manager and from the outside refrigeration contractor.\n\n\n\n    The facility is located in a commercial/residential area located off of Highway 72 west northwest of the City of Lumberton, NC. The facility consists of a warehouse house/distribution center for dry and frozen grocery products. The main warehousing facility is approximately 336,500 square feet and the property is approximately 19 acres in .  The areas around the facility consist of some commercial businesses, residences and open space. The terrain is mostly flat with some open space and forested areas. The facility is characterized by paved areas of asphalt and concrete around the facility. The area north of the site includes a small stream and some wooded areas. The area east of the site consists of an unoccupied manufacturing facility. To the west there is a small residential area and mainly open space to the south. \n\n\n\n    Nash Finch Lumberton receives and stores grocery product for eventual distribution to retail stores in the Lumberton area, North Carolina as well as other nearby states. Grocery products include dry goods, frozen products as well as meat and other perishable items. The facility has a fuel island that provides fuel for the operational needs of the truck fleet and a tru"

The facility is connected to city water and sewer services.\n\n    \n\n    Hours of operation are up to 24 hours per day, 7 days per week.  Personnel at the facility include a distribution center director plus administrative staff, warehouse staff and truck drivers. Headcount at the facility is approximately 175 associates (warehouse staff and drivers).\n\n\n\nPart of the facility is a cold storage warehouse for the storage of frozen and perishable food products. The refrigeration for this part of the facility is provided by an ammonia refrigeration system. The ammonia system contains approximately 13,500 pounds of anhydrous ammonia. In this system, ammonia is the heat transfer medium that is compressed, cooled through the use of evaporative condensers and distributed to cooling evaporators throughout the ammonia refrigerated parts of the facility to maintain appropriate temperatures for the products stored in each area.\n\n\n\nBecause of the use of hazardous materials on-site, the facility is regulated by federal and state hazardous material rules and regulations. The ammonia, diesel fuel and sulfuric acid (used in powered industrial truck batteries) are regulated under the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know (EPCRA) regulations. The Risk Management Plan (RMP) is required under the Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions under the Clean Air Act (40 CFR Part 68). The facility has also registered with the Department of Homeland Security since its ammonia quantity exceeds the 10,000 pound threshold for registration (6 CFR Part 27).\n\n\n\nFrom an occupational safety and health perspective the facility is subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard which covers the management and use of the anhydrous ammonia on-site and is required to have an emergency response plan. Other OSHA rules such as lockout tag out, fall protection, confined space; powered industrial trucks, etc. also apply to the facility."

      "SummaryText": " \n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is the process presenting the most risk to our employees and the surrounding community. Safe guards in the form of computer control systems employing sensors and interlocks to shutdown the system in the event of an equipment malfunction or release of ammonia are built into the system. Alarm sensors are placed within the ammonia engine room (processing center) and throughout the facility to alert plant staff of any ammonia releases within the facility. Detailed emergency plans and procedures are in-place to warn our employees and the surrounding community in the event of a release. \n\n\n\nThere have been no ammonia releases from the facility since completion of the last risk management plan. Incident investigation procedures are in-place to ensure any potential future release is thoroughly investigated to determine the \"root cause\" of the incident and to ensure appropriate corrective action is implemented quickly and efficiently.\n\n\n\nThe facility has a detailed emergency response program to handle fire, ammonia releases or natural disasters. All employees receive training during new hire orientation sessions and periodic refresher training to ensure they understand the facility emergency response procedures. Attachments to Part 6 of the Process Safety Management Plan provide detailed coverage of potential ammonia release scenarios and the appropriate actions in response to those scenarios. In the event of an ammonia release, the employees are provided information over the facility public address system as to the nature of the release and instructions where they should assemble. Given the safety hazards of ammonia, the safest place maybe within the facility; if evacuation is necessary, the employees are given directions to the appropriate outdoor assembly point based on the direction of the wind. Evacuation drills are periodically held to ensure the employees are familiar with the emergency response procedures.\n\n\n\nThe Robeson County L"

      "SummaryText": "EPC is charged with the primary responsibility for emergency response at this location. Nash Finch - Lumberton has adopted the INTEGRATED CONTINGENCY PLAN format preferred by EPA and OSHA for preparing and implementing its onsite Emergency Action and Response Plan.  Under this plan, emergency training and practice drills will be frequent and will cover a multitude of potential scenarios. Key managers will become involved immediately upon the recognition and characterization of all non-incidental ammonia releases, and their duties will be as follows: (a) coordination of and direction to onsite and external emergency responders; (b) notification of agencies and on-site safety and security; (c) protection and continuation of business operation and employees welfare; and (d) communication with the public as necessary.\n\nNash Finch Company continues to investigate and implement changes to the ammonia process in order to improve safety and minimize risks associated with it. The annual operating budget includes sufficient allocation of fiscal resources to continuously maintain and improve the process and promote the training of operators and supervisory personnel.\n\n\n\n"
