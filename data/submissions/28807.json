      "SummaryText": "The Brady Hot Springs Geothermal Power Plant (Brady) is wholly owned by Brady Power Partners (BPP), a Nevada general parntership and subsidiary company of Ormat Nevada, Inc. Brady is a geothermal electric power generation facilty with a nominal generating capacity of 18.0 megawatts (MW). Geothermal fluids averaging 300 F flow from 7 production wells to three steam turbines and a secondary binary bottoming unit. Geothermal fluids are re-injected via ten injection wells.  The Brady facility is located in Churchill County on private and federal land leases comprising 8,000 acres. The physical plant is located on approximately 5 acres in Section 1, T22N R26E.  The leased acreage covers the defined geothermal resource area and receptive injection zones. Brady uses n-pentane as the motive fluid in the Ormat Energy Converter Unit. In the OEC, the n-pentane serves as the motive fluid transferring heat from the geothermal brine and steam. The n-pentane is recycled within a closed loop system. The OEC unit does not deplete the quantity or quality of the n-pentane throughout its operation, with the exception of minor fugitive operational losses. There have not been any accidents or events associated with the n-pentane process. Based upon EPA's RMP Comp model, the distance to the endpoint of concern for the worst case event is estimated at 0.2 miles. There are no public receptors within this radius."
