The emergency response procedures are contained at the front of the RMP and these procedures will be implemented in the event of an accidental release or the threat of such a release.\n\nThis facility processes natural gas and oil from an oil & gas well. A JT unit is used to remove some of the heavier hydrocarbons in the natural gas stream thus making this facility a gas plant under the RMP regulations even though NGL are not stored in a pressurized storage tank. The small volume of liquids dropped out by the JT unit are stored in the condensate storage tank at atmospheric conditions. The oil product is stored in a single 300 barrel tank and removed from the site via transfers to tank truck.  The facility is subject to the RMP requirements since it contains threshold quantities of regulated substances (i.e. > 10,000 lbs of a flammable liquid pentane).  The oil products are a mixture of hydrocarbons consisting of methane, ethane, butane, isobutane, propane, pentane, and isopentane.  For purposes of determining the largest weight on site, the highest density substance was used (pentane for condensate).\n\nThis facility has one applicable worst case release scenario. This  scenario  involves an explosion and fire from a condensate release from the single largest tank which is 300 barrels.  This scenario yields a distance to the endpoint of 0.1 miles.  Section 3.1 of this RMP shows the calculations used for this scenario.  An alternative scenario is not required for this facility because it is classified as a Program 1 site.  The worst case release scenario used the maximum capacity of the single largest vessel thus no administrative controls or mitigation measures are used to limit the volume thus limiting the distance to the endpoint.\n\nSince this facility is a Program 1, a documented prevention program is not r"

Emergency response procedures have been developed and are contained at the front of the RMP and these procedures will be implemented in the event of an accidental release or the threat of such a release.\n\nAt present time, there are no planned changes to improve safety."
