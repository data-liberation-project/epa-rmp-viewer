The plant is located on a 2,417-acre site; however, only about 348 acres are developed.  The Delisle Plant manufactures a single product, Titanium Dioxide (TiO2), under the trade name TiPure(TM).  Titanium dioxide is manufactured via the chloride-ilmenite process in which naturally-occurring ilmenite (TiO2) is directly chlorinated to make Titanium Tetrachloride (TiCl4); the TiCl4 is subsequently re-oxidized to yield pure TiO2. \r\n\r\nThe DeLisle Plant has two production lines.
