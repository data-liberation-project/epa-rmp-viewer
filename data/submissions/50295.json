Dillons Distribution Center submits this Executive Summary of the Risk Management Plan (RMP) for the Distribution Center in Hutchinson, KS.  Distribution Center operations include storage and distribution of perishable foods and grocery supplies.  Dillons has been in operation at this site for over 45 years providing quality grocery products to Dillons stores around the region.\n\nA.   Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nDillons Distribution Center recognizes management's responsibility in protecting its employees, the public, the environment, equipment, and property.  The safety and health of all personnel are very important.  The control of accidents has been and will continue to be a basic responsibility of all personnel in the Dillon Distribution Center.\n\nTo accomplish the company's goal in preventing accidents, the facility has established a Plant Safety Program.  The objectives of the Plant Safety Program are to: maximize safety performance, eliminate human suffering resulting from injuries and accidents and reduce losses associated with damage of property.\n\nOne of the activities associated with the Plant Safety Program has been the development and implementation of accidental release prevention and emergency response programs which are designed to comply with OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals, 29 CFR 1910.119), and EPA's Risk Management Program (RM program) regulation (Risk Management Programs for Chemical Accidental Release Prevention, 40 CFR Part 68).  Mr. Tim Herrman, Maintenance Manager, is responsible for implementation of the Risk Management Program.\n\nThe purpose of the accidental release prevention and emergency response programs is to prevent the occurrence, and mini"

Overall, these programs help prevent accidental fatalities, injuries , illnesses, environmental impacts and physical property damage.\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs help prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices that govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment.  These rules are detailed and improved as necessary.  They are also communicated to and accepted by all employees at the facility.\n\nIn addition to the Plant Safety Program, Dillons Distribution Center follows these corporate safety guidelines. \n\n     Employee Handbook Plant Safety Rules\n     Kroger Contractor Safety Rules\n     Kroger Safety Inspection and Abatement Plans\n     Safety Process Improvement Teams\n     \n\n\nB.   Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nDillons Distribution Center is part of Kroger Dedicated Logistics Inc.  The facility is a warehouse of over 350,000 sq. ft. that stores perishable and frozen food products for distribution to retail outlets.  The facility operates an ammonia refrigeration system to provide cooling and freezing capabilities.  The amount of anhydrous ammonia (CAS #7662-41-7) contained in the system is in excess of 10,000 pounds.  The maximum inventory in the system is approximately 29,000 pounds.  Since an ammonia release from the system could pose a risk of offsite public and/or environmental impact and the system is regulated under the OSHA PSM standard (29 CFR 1910.119), the system is subject to the Program 3 requirements of the EPA's RMP program.\n\n\nC.   Summary of Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nThe worst-case release scenario at the Dillons Distribution Center facility involves the release of 14,800 pounds of ammonia over a 10 minute period due to the failure of the control pressure receiver (CPR-1).  This quantity represents the"

Under alternative release weather conditions, ammonia could travel 0.1 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public.

Employees are also to be involved when a process hazard analysis is conducted.  The program also ensures that all employees have complete access to the program.\n\n         Process Safety Information: Written information has been collected which enables the employees to identify and understand the potential hazards in the system.
