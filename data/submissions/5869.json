Accidental release prevention and emergency policies:\nThe primary function of Arkansas Valley Co-op Fowler Anhydrous Ammonia Plant is to act as an anhydrous ammonia retail distribution facility.  We are committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  Safety at our facility depends upon the manner in which we handle anhydrous ammonia as well as on the various safety devices incorporated in the design of our equipment.\nFurthermore, comprehensive training received by our employees adds to the inherent safety of our distribution facility.\n\nOure emergency response program is based upon the Regulatror Consultants Incorporated guidelines for developing plant emergency procedures: How to Control Anhydrous Ammonia Leaks.  In addition to the presence of appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of anhydrous ammonia, if a release does occur, we are completely coordinated with the La Junta Fire Department, which provides highly trained emergency responce personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\n2.  The stationary source and the regulated substances handled:\nThe purpose of this facility is to distribute anhydrous ammonia to retail customers for use as fertilizer.  Anhydrous Ammonia arrives at our facility by transport truck, and is stored in one 12,000 gallon tank.  This facility is equiped to load retail delivery tanks.  Access to this site is restricted to authorized employees, and authorized contractors.  The regulated substance handled at this facility is anhydrous ammonia.  The maximum amount of anhydrous ammonia that can be stored at this plant is 60,000 pounds.\n\n3.  The worst case scenario(s) and the alternative release scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each scenario:\nWe have calculated worst case release scenarios based on the RMP-COMPS-TNT-ENERGY Method.  For alternative release scenario analyses, we have used the look-up tables and equations provided by the EPA in"

      "SummaryText": " the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.  The worst case release scenario submitted for anhydrous ammonia involves a catastrophic release of anhydrous ammonia.  This involves the release of 60,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  Under the worst case weather, the maximum distance of  point 1.63 miles was obtained corresponding to the end point of one PSI overpressure.  The alternative release submitted for program 2 involves the release of anhydrous ammonia resulting in a vapor cloud.  In this scenario 2,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia is released in 10 minutes.  The release is controlled by active mitigation controlling the distance to end point to .25 miles.\n\n4.  The accidental release prevention program:\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirments for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc. and the standards of the U. S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".\n\nHazard Review:  a check list was used to carry out the hazard review at our facility.  The review focused on operating procedures, equipment functions, and handling practices to identify possible hazards.\n\nOperating procedures:  Arkansas Valley Co-op Association maintains written operating procedures.  The procedure addresses various modes of operations such as normal operation and emergency shut down.  This information is reviewed every year.\n\nTraining:  Arkansas Valley Co-op Association utilizes the Regularory Consultants Incorporated Training and we also perform on the job training.\n\nMaintenance:  Arkansas Valley Co-op Association carries out maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper function.  Any equipment deficiencies that are reported are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nCompliance Audits:  Audits are carried out every three years  as required by the state OSHA department and on an annual basis by the"
