      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe facility uses ammonia as a refrigerant within a closed system.  Ammonia is a hazardous substance that must be handled properly in order to prevent accidental releases and injuries.  It is the policy of the American Foods Group/Dakota Pork Industries facility located in Mitchell, South Dakota to conduct all operations (including the ammonia refrigeration system) in a safe manner.  This policy extends to all employees and contractors at the facility.  American Foods Group/Dakota Pork Industries implements this policy towards chemical and general safety through on-going employee participation, training, written operating procedures, maintenance, inspections, safety committee meetings, and safety reviews/evaluations.  These programs are in effect at the facility to prevent the accidental release of ammonia.  In the event of an ammonia accident, the facility has an Emergency Action Plan to notify the appropriate authorities and safely evacuate the facility.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nAmerican Foods Group/Dakota Pork Industries is located at 915 East Havens Street in Mitchell, South Dakota which is 1 mile north of the I-90.   The original warehouse and refrigeration system were built prior to the 1950's.  The area immediately surrounding the facility is rural.\n\nThe primary business of American Foods Group/Dakota Pork Industries is to provide refrigeration for processing and storage of pork products.  In order to conduct operations, the facility uses approximately 15,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant within a closed system with a  maximum intended inventory of 20,000 pounds.  The refrigeration system, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, and then back to high pressure liquid) in order provide refrigeration for processing and storage of po"

Typical operating conditions range from 0 psig on the low pressure side of the system to 172 psig on the high side of the system.  \n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nIn order to operate the ammonia refrigeration system, the facility complies with the following risk management regulations:\n\n1)  OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM); and\n2)  EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP).\n\nThese regulations impose numerous requirements on the facility to ensure the safety of the public and on-site workers.  The following summarizes the key compliance programs that have been implemented by  American Foods Group/Dakota Pork Industries to prevent the accidental release of ammonia from the facility.  The Operating Procedures program ensures that the ammonia system is operated in a safe manner.  The Training program ensures that personnel fully understand how to perform their jobs in a safe manner.  The Mechanical Integrity program ensures that the ammonia system is in proper working condition based upon routine testing, inspections, and maintenance according to manufacturer's specifications and industry standards.  The Management of Change program ensures that process modifications are implemented in a safe manner.  The Pre-Startup Safety Review program ensures that adequate safety measures are in place before ammonia is introduced into a process.  The Hot Work Permit program ensures that  American Foods Group/Dakota Pork Industries? employees and contractors perform hot work (e.g. welding) in a safe manner.  The Contractor Safety program ensures that contractors understand the hazards of ammonia and must take specified precautions to safely complete job requirements.\n\nIt is important to note that the refrigeration system has been designed with several safety features to prevent the accidental release of ammonia.  For example, the compressors are equipped with safety mechanisms that will cause the units to shut down if oper"

Also, level indicators, alarms, and switches are installed in key points within the system to monitor the supply of liquid ammonia and to ensure that a vessel is not overfilled. \n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nA review into the accident history of the facility revealed that there has been no reportable releases of ammonia at American Foods Group/Dakota Pork Industries over the past five years (April 2000 - April 2005).\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe facility has established an action plan in the event of an emergency which could include an ammonia release, blackout, fire, earthquake, etc.  The facility does not respond to releases of ammonia; therefore, the action plan is similar to that of a fire - evacuate the building and notify the appropriate responders. \n\nAmerican Foods Group/Dakota Pork Industries maintains a safety committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated as needed. This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM/RMP regulations.  In the event that a ammonia leak is discovered, the person nearest to the leak will alert any personnel in the immediate area who are unaware of the danger.  The American Foods Group/Dakota Pork Industries Safety Coordinator will determine what procedures and personnel are necessary to remedy the problem.  Emergency agencies will also be notified as necessary as outlined in the Emergency Action Plan.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe refrigeration system was thoroughly examined for safety hazards by way of a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA).  The PHA consisted of a:\n\n? Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) study;\n? series of safety checklists; a"
