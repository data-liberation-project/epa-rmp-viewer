Our goals are to promote and strengthen mutual understanding and deepen trust in what we do.\n\nFreeport Site implements these policies through site-specific programs and procedures. Freeport Harbor Terminal Risk Management Plan information was presented to the community in Nov.1997.\n\n\n\nFacility Description:\n\nThe BASF Corporation Freeport Harbor Terminal stores Anhydrous Ammonia.  Ammonia is a basic building block chemical and is used in the manufacturing of many common products. The largest users of ammonia are the agricultural fertilizer business.  BASF uses ammonia as a basic raw material in the production of chemicals used to produce fertilizers and a variety of nylon plastics\n\n \n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program:\n\nTo prevent accidental releases, this facility is in compliance with the EPA Risk Management Program, and the OSHA Process Safety Management standard, and has fully implemented the American Chemistry Council's Responsible Care Management System.  \n\n\n\nThe ammonia harbor terminal vessel is equipped with automatic shut-off and relief devices have been installed to handle fluctuations in temperature and pressure.  Warning alarms, leak detectors, regular equipment inspections, and pressure monitoring in pipes and vessels provide layers of protection for employees and the community.  In addition, the ammonia terminal storage vessel is a double walled \"tank within a tank\".  This greatly reduces potential for leaks.\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History:\n\nThis facility has had no accidental releases over the past five years which meet the reporting criteria.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program:\n\nEmergency response programs are in place for both internal preparation and coordination with the community.  The Freeport Harbor Terminal plan is coordinated with the Brazoria County Local Emergency Planning Committee to ensure community safety.  Drills are coordinated with the community and the community warning sirens are tested weekly.  In the event of an incident"
