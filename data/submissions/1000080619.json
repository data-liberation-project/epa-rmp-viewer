      "SummaryText": "1. Corporate Prevention and Emergency Response Approach\n\n\n\nThe Pine Hills Water Treatment Plant (WTP) is owned by the Orlando Utilities Commission (OUC). The facility has developed and maintains accident prevention programs and an emergency response plan to prevent and mitigate the effects of hazardous chemical releases. The OUC Corporate Environmental Department provides advice and funding on hazardous chemical emergency issues. The OUC Response to chlorine emergencies from the plant is coordinated through the Water Production Division Pershing Control Center, from which all OUC Water Plants are controlled and managed.  The Pershing Control Center is manned 24-hours a day, 7-days a week. \n\n \n\n2. Description of Stationary Source\n\n\n\nThe Pine Hills WTP is located on at 5601 Santa Anita Street, Orlando, Orange County, Florida. Pine Hills WTP adds chlorine through their chlorination process in order to disinfect the City's water supply.  Liquefied chlorine gas is stored in up to twenty one-ton containers at the Chlorination process building. Five one-ton containers are on-line at all times feeding the system, with five containers on standby to draw from when the first five are exhausted. There are ten more one-ton containers in storage. The total chlorine inventory in the process at any one time is 40,000 lbs. This is greater than the 2,500 lb. RMP threshold quantity for chlorine. This process is fully enclosed in a building.\n\n\n\nThe chlorine building at Pine Hills WTP is equipped with an automated chlorine scrubber system. Two chlorine detectors are located inside the building, one in the chlorine dock area and one in the chlorination room. If the chlorine detectors indicate that chlorine is present at a concentration above the preset level, the louvers of the building will automatically close and the scrubber will start. The scrubber fan will pull the released chlorine gas through the scrubber, which chemically removes the chlorine from the air. The scrubber can handle"

      "SummaryText": " a full one-ton container of chlorine before the scrubbing medium is exhausted. The chlorine detectors are also interlocked to an audible and visual alarm at the site and audible and visual alarms on the Operator's control panel at the Pershing Control Center. The Control Panel will also indicate to the operator that the scrubber has started. When the Operator sees the chlorine alarm, he can dispatch OUC personnel and City or County emergency response personnel to the site immediately if necessary. Additionally, an emergency shutoff valve actuator is installed on each chlorine ton container, which allows remote isolation of the container contents in an emergency.  If the chlorine detectors indicate that chlorine is present then the emergency shutoff valves will close automatically.  The emergency shutoff valves can only be opened manually. \n\n\n\n3. Prevention Program\n\n\n\nFor the Chlorination process, this facility exceeds the chlorine threshold quantity of 1500 lbs. for the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard, 1910.119; however, this is an unmanned facility and is therefore not subject to the PSM requirements. For RMP compliance purposes, this places the Pine Hills WTP Chlorination process in the Program 2 level. The Pine Hills WTP facility will address all elements for the Prevention\n\nProgram 2 as required by the RMP rule.\n\n\n\nThe Prevention Program 2 contains the following elements: a Process Hazard Review of the process, the collection and documentation of Process Safety Information, a Preventative Maintenance Program, written Operating Procedures, a Compliance Audits program, Safety Training for operations and maintenance personnel, and an Incident Investigation procedure. This Prevention Program will promote continued safe operation and prompt correction of deficiencies. The Prevention Program receives full support of plant management and involvement of employees at all levels.\n\n\n\n4. Accident History\n\n\n\nThe Pine Hills WTP facility has had no accidental re"

The Plant Operator at the Pershing Control Center has accident assessment capabilities and can respond immediately to all emergencies by dispatching appropriate personnel to the site. The OUC Water Production mechanics have been trained in chlorine safety and have a procedure for addressing small releases of chlorine. The current procedure has been coordinated with the Orange County Hazardous Materials Response Team, and the Regional Local Emergency Planning Committee. In the event of a large release, as defined in the OUC Chlorine Gas Release procedure, the local public responders will conduct response operations and act as Incident Commander. OUC Water Production personnel will assist if required. Notification is made locally by dialing 911, and by notifying Florida State Warning Point at (800) 320-0519.\n\n"
