There are three active 625-ton Anhydrous Ammonia storage spheres on site and a 30% Aqua Storage tank with the capacity of 85,000 gallons.\n\nScenarios\n\tWorst-Case\n\tThe worst-case scenario is the catastrophic failure of a 625-ton storage sphere of Anhydrous Ammonia filled to the administrative level of 85%. The scenario assumes the release of 530 tons of Anhydrous Ammonia vapor over a ten-minute period. No mitigation was considered in this scenario.  The toxic end point from the resulting Ammonia vapor cloud would reach offsite endpoints and public receptors.\n\n\tAlternate-Case Anhydrous Ammonia: \n\tAn alternate-case scenario is the failure of a pressure relief valve. A pressure relief valve fails in the open position and causes ammonia to vent at a rate of 730 pounds per minute.  The release is expected to be isolated within 30 minutes.  The release model indicates that distance to the toxic end point would be 0.5 miles.  This end point could reach a residential population of 5.  Further mitigation can be achieved by using water mist from fire hoses to absorb Ammonia vapor out of the air.\n\nAlternate-Case 30% Aqua Ammonia:\n\tAn alternate-case scenario is the leaking of 30% Aqua Ammonia solution from a defective pump seal at the loading pump.  The leak is at the rate of 225 pounds per minute into a 130 by 80 foot diked area around the storage tank and pump.  The release is expected to be isolated within 60 minutes.  The release model indicates that the toxic end point of the Ammonia vapor cloud formed by the evaporating Ammonia would be 0.43 miles.  This end point could reach a residential population of 5.  Further mitigation can be achieved by using the sump pump in the dike to pump the leaking liquid into another tank and using water mist from fire hoses to absorb Ammonia vapor out of the air. \n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program & Chemical Specific Prevention\n\tA number of different approaches are used to prevent accidental releases from occurri"

Since the beginning the employees and management have had accident prevention and training programs in place for the safety of the general public and employees of the facility.  These programs include detailed operator training, operating instructions, maintenance procedures, active employee safety committees, safety inspections and emergency procedures. The Facility has implemented the OSHA Process Safety Management system.  This tool has further enhanced our safety program for processes that could pose a hazard to the employees and the public.  \nIn the event that an accidental release were to occur, Coastal St. Helens Chemical has established an Emergency Action Plan in conjunction with the St Helens Rural Fire Dept to insure the effects will be minimized.  Arrangements have also been made with Cowlitz Clean Sweep of Longview, WA. to provide additional resources to emergencies. \n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances.\n\tThe Coastal St. Helens Chemical facility produces nitrogen-based fertilizers.  Products shipped from the facility are Anhydrous Ammonia, Aqua Ammonia, Urea Prills, Urea-Ammonium Nitrate Solution and Carbon Dioxide.  These products are manufactured from natural gas, air and water.  For RMP planning purposes the whole site is considered the stationary source.\n\tAnhydrous Ammonia is produced in a continuous process on site and stored for sale, converted to Aqua Ammonia, or further processing with Carbon Dioxide to manufacture Urea.  Another portion of the Anhydrous Ammonia is used to manufacture a water solution of Ammonium Nitrate, which is mixed with Urea to form a fertilizer solution.\n\tThe regulated substances handled on site in quantities larger than the threshold amounts are Anhydrous Ammonia and 30%"

A computer system is used for instrumentation and controls and is protected from power outages with a battery back up.  Vessels are equipped with various temperature, pressure and level alarms.  Remotely operated isolation valves are used.  Critical areas have secondary containment and curbing.  Fire monitors are strategically located around the process.\n\tThe operations program ensures fully and continuously trained operators.  Emergency shutdown systems and procedures are in use.  Prestart-up safety reviews are conducted for new and modified processes and equipment.  Management of change procedures are used.  The process equipment has safe upper and lower limits recorded.  Daily routine equipment and leak checks are carried out.  A work permit system is used for process unit installation and maintenance that covers entry control, lockout/tagout procedure, hot work, line taps, and confined space entry.  \n\tIn maintaining our plant integrity, Coastal has a fully equipped maintenance department with well-trained and experienced maintenance personnel. Craft training and testing is used for certification.  A preventative maintenance program is in effect, which includes corrosion/erosion monitoring. A contractor qualification, selection and safety training procedure is in effect for all outside contractors working on site.\nIn pulling the facility into a safe working team the safety department is active in total employee involvement of the safety program.  Weekly team safety meetings and monthly plant representative safety meetings are held.   Monthly safety inspection tours of the operating process are held, and monthly plant management safety meetings are held.  \nIn addition to the preceding accident prevention activities the facility uses the following types of safety features in the various processes for release control:\n\t-Valves to permit is"
