The key element of release containment, control, and mitigation is the permanent foam chamber installed in the roof of the storage tank.  External monitors and other fire suppression equipment are stored near the vicinity of the tank.  Operators are trained to respond in the event of a small release, such as a pump seal failure, and have authority to shut down the process if a hazardous condition occurs.  \r\n\r\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nThere have been no accidents or incidents in the last five years related to the light straight run process that require reporting in the five-year accident history.  \r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\r\n\r\nSandersville Refinery maintains an emergency response program that includes a plant emergency response team (PERT).  The program covers a variety of regulatory requirements in addition to RMP including TIER II reports for EPCRA, emergency action plans, emergency response plans, SPCC plans, pipeline spill response plans, and process safety management plan.\r\n\r\nAll employees are trained under OSHA's 24 Hour Hazardous Waste Operator Standard and go through fire brigade training as well.  Emergency response courses are conducted on a monthly basis throughout the year.   Sandersville Refinery also periodically coordinates with local emergency responders.  This includes conducting on-site table top and field drills.  \r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nSandersville Refinery is currently engineering a safety-instrumented system that will reduce the likelihood of releases of flammable materials to the atmosphere during certain upset operating conditions.  Installation is anticipated for the next unit turnaround."

Contractors are expected to know and follow Sandersville Refinery's safety standards and to work under the oversight of a Sandersville Refinery supervisor at all times while in the plant. \r\n\r\nSandersville Refinery has also developed numerous risk management and safe work practices to prevent releases of regulated substances.   These include:\r\n - An inspection, testing, and preventative maintenance plan to ensure the ongoing mechanical integrity of the light straight run process equipment, which includes the proper operation and maintenance of the tank's internal floating roof, rotating equipment, and piping.  \r\n - Safe work practices such as lock-out / tag-out, line breaking procedures, permit-required confined space entry procedures, hot work permit procedures, and control over entry into process areas to minimize potential for releases during maintenance activities.\r\n - Management of change and pre-startup safety review procedures to evaluate proposed changes to the process safety information for the light straight run process and verify equipment is ready for service following significant changes.\r\n\r\nAccident and incident investigations are also conducted whenever there has been an accident, near miss, or other incident.  Where a potential for catastrophic release is identified, causal factors are evaluated and corrective actions implemented to reduce the likelihood of future releases.  \r\n\r\nA compliance audit as required by OSHA's PSM standard is conducted at least every three years and includes the light straight run process.

For example, employees are involved in writing and reviewing procedures, participate in process hazard analyses (PHA) and incident investigations, as well as on the plant emergency response team (PERT).  Safety suggestions are also collected on an informal basis and communicated with management.  \r\n\r\nProcess safety information for the light straight run process is compiled in the Sandersville Refinery PSI manual, which is maintained by site engineering personnel and made available to employees both in hard copy and electronically.  In addition to typical hazard communication information, documents are also kept on key process parameters, piping and instrumentation diagrams, chemical mixture, technical manuals for key equipment, and industry guidelines for safe operations in petroleum refineries.\r\n\r\nAn initial process hazard analysis was conducted for the light straight run process and is revalidated at least every five years.  The primary methodology for this analysis is the what if method, which is appropriate for bulk storage facilities.  Any recommendations from the PHA are reviewed by management and implemented as soon as practicable.   \r\n\r\nSandersville Refinery employees are also subject to extensive training for both routine operations of the refinery as well as emergency operations.

This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nHSRC's Sandersville Refinery located in Sandersville, Mississippi operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products, primarily asphalt related, from raw crude oil. Within the refining industry we are known as a topping operation in that our focus is on the 50% to 55% of the barrel of crude which is asphalt.  The remaining fractions of the crude barrel are primarily used as feedstock for Sandersville's sister refinery.   The Sandersville refinery is considered small by industry standards with a maximum capacity of 12,500 barrels per day. \r\n\r\nSandersville Refinery's light straight run, a mixture of flammable materials that contains regulated substances butane, n-pentane, and isopentane in quantities greater than 1%, is the stationary source's only process covered by EPA's Risk Management Plan (RMP) rule.  Light straight run is produced in the crude distillation process and stored in tanks on site before it is transferred offsite for further processing.    \r\n\r\n(Note:  When reporting in RMP*eSubmit, only one chemical and its amount can be selected per process for each worst case scenario.  Because of this, the worst case scenario is listed as the quantity of n-pentane released; however, the entire weight of the flammable mixture was used to model the distance to endpoint.)  \r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENT PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nSandersville Refinery has"
