We observe all necessary safety precautions in handling anhydrous ammonia to prevent unnecassary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health and to reduce the threat to nearby community. It is our policy to adhere to all applicable  federal, state and local rules and regulations. Safety depends unpon the manner in which we handle anhydrous ammonia, the safey devices inherent to the design of this facility, the safe handling procedures that we use and the training of our personnel.\n\nThis facility complies with ANSI K-61.1 and OSHA 1910.111 requirements of anhydrous ammonia storage. If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the local emergency response agency. \n\nA description of your facility and regulated sustances handled:\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is storage. We receive anhydrous ammonia by transport truck and store it as a liquid in a pressurized vesssels. Access to the process is restricted to authorized employees and contractors. The maximum amount of anhydrous ammonia that can be stored at the facility is 24,000 gallons (water capacity).\n\nThe worst case and alternative release scenarios:\n\nThe worst-case release scenario is failure of one 12,000 gallon tank when filled to its maximum allowable capacity (85% @ 60F), resulting in a release of anhydrous ammonia. The distance to the endpoint of 140 ppm is 1.66 miles based on the dense gas dispersion model Degadis. This distance extends beyond the facility boundary and there are esimated to be 248 residents, commercial/industrial areas and churches within the distance to endpoint.\n\nThe alternative release scenario is failure of a 12 foot length of 3 inch hose due to a cracked hose or failed fitting. The operator observe the leak and isolates the hose by cutting of the shut-off valves. The contents of the ho"

The anhydrous ammonia system is designed, installed and maintained in accoradance with ANSI K-61.1, OSHA 1910.111 and state law.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nwe maintain safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters abd equipment designs associated with our anhydrous ammonia storage facilities.\n\nProcess Hazard Review\nWe conduct comprehensive studies reviews to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently. These activites are undertaken by qualified personnel with expertise in process operations and are revalited at a regular interval. Any findings related to the hazard anaysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Prodedures\n\nWe  maintain written procedures for operation of the anhydrous ammonia storage facility. These procedures address various modes of operation including initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and starup after a turnaround. The information is readily accessible to operators.\n\nTraining\n\nWe have a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes. Refresher training is provided at least every three years.\n\nCompliance Audits \n\nWe conduct compliance audits on regular basis to comfirm that the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.

All reports are retained for minimum of 5 years.\n\nFive-year accident history:\n\nDue to our  comprehensive safety program, this facility has never had an accident involving anhydrous ammonia that caused deaths, injuries, property or enviromental damage, evacuations, or shelterings in place.\n\nThe emergency response program:\n\nIn the event of an emergency , it is our policy to notify the local emergency response agency and request that they respond to the emergency.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety:\n\nWe will continue to implement our safety program to guarantee that our facility is operated in a safe and reliable manner and to ensure the safety of our employees and the surrounding community."
