This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of the facility's processes. The Samson policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances.\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nSamson Exploration, LLC, operates the Willow Marsh Facility located at, 10720 Old Sour Lake Road, Beaumont, TX, 77713 (lat/long N 30.083172 W 94.225686) in Jefferson County, Texas. \n\n\n\nThe Willow Marsh Facility takes the production stream from the Buckley #1 and Bartlett #1 wells through the required treating for sales to the Kinder-Morgan (K-M) gathering line.  The production stream is combined after bulk separation, secondary separation and allocation metering at each well.  The stream then enters the Willow Marsh site through pig traps and combines going to the main site shut-in valve (the \"orange\" valve) and another separator prior to a hydrogen sulfide stripping vessel.  Hydrogen sulfide is removed via contact with SulfaTreat granular material.  Gas is dehydrated through a single glycol contactor and separated before entering a refrigeration skid (with shell and tube exchanger pre-cooler) to lower the hydrocarbon dew point to meet the K-M gathering system requirements.  Cooling through the refrigeration skid is via four series freon loops.  Controllers local to the skid adjust the number of compressors needed to meet the temperature set point on the cold separator.  After the refrigeration skid, liquids go to the NGLs storage tank and are later transported offsite via tanker trucks. \n\n\n\nThe Willow Marsh Facility was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substan"

All equipment and vessels are considered to be connected and/or co-located; consequently, all equipment and vessels can be considered as part of a single process. The identification of even a single vessel exceeding threshold quantity of a regulated flammable or toxic substance would subject a process to threshold determination for offsite consequence analysis.\n\n\n\nSamson identified one flammable liquid mixture and zero regulated toxic substances. The identification of this exceedance indicated that the Willow Marsh Facility is a covered process with a regulated substance subject to offsite consequence analysis.\n\n\n\nConcerning the emergency response policy at the facility, the owner has made the decision that employees will respond to accidental releases of regulated substances and, if safe to do so, attempt to stop the source of the leak. \n\n\n\n40 CFR 68.155  The owner or operator shall provide in the RMP an executive summary that includes a brief description of the following elements:  (a) The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the stationary source. (b) The stationary source and regulated substances handled.  (c) The general accidental release program and chemical specific prevention steps. (d) The five year accident history. (e) The emergency response program. (f) Planned changes to improve safety.\n\n\n\nThis facility processes Natural Gas Liquids (NGLs) which are stored in one (1) 18,000 gallon pressurized bullet tanks. The facility is subject to RMP requirements since it is a natural gas processing plant producing NGLs and contains threshold quantities of regulated substances as indicated in the following table:\n\n\n\nNatural Gas\n\n           Regulated Quantity Percent\n\n                    Substance (lbs)          (>1%)\n\nEthane                10,000                9.1904\n\nPropane               10,000               23.339\n\ni-Butane              10,000               12.46"

However, since Samson employees will respond, emergency response procedures have been developed and are contained in this RMP.  These procedures will be implemented in the event of an accidental release or the threat of such a release. Copies of this facility Emergency Response Plan are kept with operating personnel, at the local field office, Samson Intranet site and the corporate office.  Employees will respond to accidental releases of regulated substances and, if safe to do so, attempt to stop the source of the leak. Emergency response activities are also coordinated with the local fire department as required in 40 CFR 68.12(b)(3).\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nSamson is committed to operating the Willow Marsh Facility in a safe manner for workers, the public, and the environment. Samson personnel have an opportunity to make suggestions that could improve the safety of the facility during regional safety meetings. Samson will also conduct compliance audits and hazard reviews as required and make improvements to safety, based on findings of the audits and reviews.\n\n"
