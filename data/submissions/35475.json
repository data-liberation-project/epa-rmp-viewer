The Plant is owned and operated by the Coachella Valley Water District (with a mailing address of P.O. Box 1058; Coachella, California 92236).  The District\u00bfs initial submittal for WRP No. 9 was made to USEPA and to the Riverside County Department of Environmental Health on June 21, 1999.\n\nThe purpose of this document is to comply with the risk management planning requirements as set forth in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 40, Part 68 (also known as the Federal Risk Management Plan Regulations) and the California Code of Regulations, Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5, Article 3, Section 2745.3 (also known as the California Accidental Release Prevention Program Risk Management Plan \u00bf CalARP RMP Regulations).  The scope of the Federal RMP and CalARP RMP includes all operations conducted at the subject facility that involve the storage, handling and/or use of chlorine (i.e., chlorine is the only regulated substance handled at the Plant).\n\nPolicy Statement\nIt is the Policy of the Coachella Valley Water District (District) to conduct ALL District activities safely to prevent Job related accidents, illnesses, and injuries to employees and others and damage to District and Others\u00bf property.  A well organized safety program provides a safe working environment and promotes increased efficiency at ALL levels (IIPP).\n\nES 1.0\tDESCRIPTION OF STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nThe primary operation conducted at WRP No. 9 is the treatment of wastewater (NAICS Code 22132 \u00bf Sewage Treatment Facilities).  \n\nWater Reclamation Plant No. 9 is a wastewater treatment plant that treats domestic wastes."

The Plant is manned on the day shift and the process is monitored 24-hours per day, 7-days per week, 365-days per year at the District Headquarters located in Coachella.\n\nMaximum Inventory of Regulated Substances\nThe District\u00bfs Maximum Inventory of Chlorine is 4,000-pounds (i.e., two one ton containers of chlorine).  \n\nSite Security\nIn order to ensure the security of the site, the District has erected a chain link fence around the entire site.  Additionally, the site is equipped with a perimeter security system.  Lastly, ALL building entries are equipped with intruder alarms to alert Control of unauthorized access.  These site security provisions are intended to prevent unauthorized access to areas of the Plant where chlorine is stored, handled or used and seek to provide an added level of safety for the storage of chlorine at the Plant.\n\nES 2.0\tACCIDENTAL RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nThe Federal RMP regulations and the CalARP RMP regulations require that at least two types of release scenarios be evaluated for their potential to impact off-site populations:\n\n\u00bf\tthe worst case release; and\n\u00bf\tan alternative release (an accident scenario that is more credible than the worst-case release scenario).\n\nA number of hypothetical accidental release scenarios were postulated and evaluated for the Five Year Federal RMP/CalARP RMP Update.  These scenarios were categorized into worst-case release scenarios and alternative release scenarios.  Each of these categories of hypothetical accidental release scenarios is discussed below.\n\nCHLORINE \n\nWorst-Case Release Scenarios for Chlorine \nIn this scenario, one of the one-ton containers of chlorine on site experiences a catastrophic failure due to an unknown event.  This scenario could be initiated by an external event (i.e., an airplane, missile or meteorite impacting the chlorine storage enclosure or area where the one ton cont"

However, the possibility of this scenario being initiated by a seismic event cannot be completely discarded.  This scenario is considered to be extremely unlikely.  In the extremely unlikely case that this scenario occurs, up to 2,000-pounds of chlorine could be released (in the worst-case).  The release of chlorine would occur outdoors.  It was assumed that the chlorine released during the catastrophic accident forms a cloud of chlorine vapor which is then free to migrate off-site.  Utilizing the methodology specified by USEPA, the estimated vulnerable zone for this hypothetical accidental release scenario is approximately 1.3-miles.\n\nAlternative Release Scenarios for Chlorine\nAlternative release scenarios which are considered to be more likely to occur are those which may result in the release of anywhere from less than one-pound to up to 450-pounds of chlorine.  These scenarios include situations such as delivery of a leaking one-ton container of chlorine to the Plant, a pinhole leak in the chlorine transfer piping, a partial or complete failure of the chlorine transfer lines (100-percent vapor) at various points in the system (out-doors or in-doors), the rupture or separation of the flexible connections from the online one-ton container, or a leak from the valve assembly of the one ton container.  In order to be conservative in the estimation of the vulnerable zone, it was assumed that 450-pounds of chlorine was released (over a 30-minute period) during an accident involving the valve assembly on an online one ton container.  The resulting cloud of chlorine vapor was assumed to freely migrate off-site.  Utilizing the methodology specified by USEPA, the estimated vulnerable zone for this hypothetical accidental release scenario is approximately 0.1 miles.\n\nES 3.0\tFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nDuring the five years preceding the submittal of the Five Year Federal"

These devices are located throughout the Plant and monitor various aspects of Plant Operations.  \n\nAlarms\nWRP No. 9 is equipped with Leak Detectors that are designed to detect chlorine in the chlorine storage and use areas at or above 1-ppm.  When one of these detectors senses a gas leak at or above 1.0-ppm, audible alarms activate locally and an alarm is transmitted to District Control at Headquarters.  At 3-ppm the visual alarm (beacon light) on top of the building is activated.  Ventilation fans in the chlorinator room run constantly 24-hours per day.  The alarms can only be reset and cleared after the leak detectors sense less than 1-ppm of gas.  The alarms are tested by District Operators twice each month.  Additionally, the District\u00bfs Communications Shop inspects, tests and calibrates the chlorine alarm system on a monthly schedule.  \n\nES 5.0\tEMERGENCY RESPONSE\n\nThe Coachella Valley Water District recognizes that emergency planning and emergency response are an integral component of risk management.

The Chlorine Response Team can be dispatched to the Plant during the staffed hours if the Plant Staff are unable to respond to the leak with a three person crew.\n\nWhen control receives a gas leak alarm after hours, the Control Operator will call out the Chlorine Response Team and the Sanitation Standby Operator.  Upon arrival at the scene, both will wait at the entrance gate for the other to arrive and will enter the Plant together.\n\nResponse Teams\nEmergency response and any work with chlorine connections requires a minimum of three employees to be present.  ALL Plant Operators are trained in Emergency Response.  The crew of employees trained in response to chlorine leaks at the District\u00bfs domestic well sites have been trained to respond to chlorine leaks at WRP No. 9 as well.  After hours this two-person crew responds with the standby operator to unmanned Plants or to other Plants that may need assistance.  There are always three employees on call with pagers ready to respond to chlorine emergencies.  The on call crew is rotated weekly.\n\nTraining\nChlorine response personnel are scheduled to be trained quarterly in the use of emergency repair kits, the use of personal protective equipment (PPE), and District Emergency Response Procedures.  Furthermore, chlorine emergency response personnel are trained annually in the safe storage and handling of chlorine and in CPR/First Aid.  The District also has a \u00bfcut-out\u00bf one-ton container and a 150-pound cylinder that are used to simulate emergency releases and to practice emergency response/repairs and supply isolation procedures.\n\nResponse to Minor Leaks\nTwo employees will respond with Self-Contained Breathing Apparatuses (SCBAs), Chlorine \u00bfB\u00bf Repair Kits, gloves and a bottle of 26 Baume Ammonia.

Using the ammonia, they will locate the chlorine leak.  Once the leak is located and confirmed to be a system leak and not a vessel tank, the gas supply valve on the container can be shut off by turning the valve clockwise one full turn.  When this has been done, the Third Crew Member will let Control know whether repairs have been made or if further assistance is needed.\n\nResponse to Major Leaks\nThe District\u00bfs response to Major Leaks is similar to its response for Minor Leaks, except that the Response Team will wear fully encapsulated suits if a severe gas leak has occurred or if the Response Team finds a vessel/tank leak.  The Third Crew Member will notify Control to send Police and Fire Department Personnel to the scene to secure and evacuate the surrounding area, as necessary.  The District\u00bfs standby personnel and Training/Safety Specialist will be called as well.\n\nES 6.0\tPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nA detailed hazard and operability study (i.e., hazards analysis) was performed in May 2004 and covered ALL operations involving chlorine.
