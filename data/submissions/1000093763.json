      "SummaryText": "BRD One, LLC (BRD) operates a renewable natural gas plant (RNG).  The facility treats biogas from a landfill and removes impurities (primarily nitrogen and carbon dioxide).  The final product, renewable natural gas (RNG) is delivered and sold to the local gas utility via a private, underground pipeline. The maximum operating pressure in any part of the system is 125 psi. This site normally operates un-manned. The only regulated substance is methane. Methane is present only in process tanks and piping, with an average residence time of approximately 60 minutes.  \n\nThe company does not have any employees.  Only contractors are used to operate the equipment.\n\n\n\nThe process control system provides control of the system which allows for unattended operation.  All systems can be controlled remotely for monitoring status and alarms.  Through a secure Internet web site, BRD, the equipment vendor, and other service providers may view the status of the plant's operation including gas quality, flow, etc.  Operational logs, past production and event documentation will be archived. The Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) also supports the plant in real-time monitoring and support from its headquarters and also can remotely support on-site O&M. A flare is used to burn landfill gas in the event the system must be shut down for maintenance or repairs for extended periods longer than three consecutive days.\n\n\n\nThe process equipment is located at a closed landfill, away from public roads and neighborhoods and is not visible to the public.\n\n\n\nMethane is our sales product, so there is a financial incentive as well as a safety incentive to prevent releases.Compressors, valves and fittings are regularly inspected for leaks.  When discovered, they are fixed promptly. Methane is lighter than air.  The compressed gases in our equipment do not contain oxygen, and therefore cannot support combustion. If there was an event where methane is ignited, it is most likely it would be a flame from "

Industry standards are to shut off the fuel and let the flame burn itself out.\n\n\n\nThere have been no accidents in the last five years, nor since the facility began operation.\n\n\n\nThe facility has an emergency action plan, as required by 29 CFR 1910.38.  Contractors are instructed they are not to attempt any fires.\n\n\n\n"
