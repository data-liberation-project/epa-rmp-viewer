Holly Pump Station safely, reducing to the greatest extent possible any hazards associated with the chlorine system and reducing any subsequent risk to the surrounding community, personnel, and environment.  Safe operation depends on proper storage of chlorine, proper handling of the chlorination system, and inherent safety features in the design of the chlorination system.  Safety in storage and handling is achieved through the use of safe handling procedures and training of personnel.\n\nThe policy includes working with the surrounding community and local emergency response agencies to promote a spirit of cooperation and teamwork, to orchestrate an effective contingency plan in the unikely event of a process incident occurring at the Mt. Holly Pump Station.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for notifying the El Dorado Fire Department.\n\nStationary Sources and Regulated Substance Handled\n\nPrimary Activities\n\nWater Treatment.\n\nUse of Regulated Substances\n\nChlorine is used primarily as a disinfectant.  Other possible uses of chlorine are for odor control and to assist in the settling of biosolids in the clarification process.\n\nQuantities Handled or Stored\n\nChlorine\nTotal Amount Stored: 3 one-ton containers, equivalent to 6,000 pounds.\n\nWorst -Case Release Scenario\n\nChlorine\n* WRS:  Failure of one liquid chlorine container resulting in a release of 2,000 pounds of chlorine gas in 10 minutes.  Passive mitigation is considered because the containers are stored in an enclosed space.  The release rate of 110 lbs/min is modeled using RMP Comp.  \n\n* Distance to Endpoint:  Under the worst-case weather conditions prescribed by the RMP Rule, the distance to a toxic endpoint of .0087 mg/L (or 3ppm) is .9 miles, beyond which there will be enough dispersion that a hazard to the public will no longer exist.\n\n* Population Exposed:  It is estimated, based on the averaged USCB population den"

For a release duration of 20 minutes, the calculated release rate is 53.8 lbs/min.  The release rate calculation is based on a tank pressure of 7.93 atm and a tank temperature of 77 degrees F with a passive mitigation of 45 percent because of the tanks are in an enclose space.  \n\nDistance to Endpoint: Under realistic weather conditions of 3.0 m/s wind speed and a wind stability class of \"D\", chlorine would travel .1 miles.\n\nPopulation Exposed: It is estimated, based on the USCB population density for the City of El Dorado, that 10 persons would be affected within the ARS toxic endpoint circle.\n\nEnvironmental Receptors: There are no environmental receptors within the ARS toxic endpoint circle.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe El Dorado Water Utilities Mt. Holly Pump Station is in compliance with RMP Rule, 40 CFR 68.  The facility has conducted a comprehensive review of all system and of administrative, technical, and operating and maintenance procedures, in addition to the other required program elements of the RMP Rule.  A hazard review was conducted at this facility using a \"What If\" analysis.\n\nFive-year Accident History \n\nThe El Dorado Water Utilities Mt. Holly Pump Station has never had a release of chlorine resulting in offsite injury or dispersion, or in onsite injury.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe El Dorado Water Utilities Mt. Holly Pump Station has an Emergency Procedures Plan, which coordinates response efforts with the El Dorado Fire Department's HAZMAT team, the police department, and the hospital.  Response activities also have been discussed wi"

Holly Pump Station has the necessary equipment and the operating and training procedures required for the safe operation of the chlorination system.  The following recommendations for improving the safety of the chlorination process were made:\n\n1. Change the set point for the chlorine detection and alarm system for 3 ppm.\n2. Provide a copy of the updated emergency response procedures for chlorine to the El Dorado Fire Department."
