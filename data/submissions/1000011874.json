The program includes engineering, education, and enforcement provisions for hazard communication, spill prevention and response, hazardous waste, universal waste and waste oil management, waste water and storm water management.\n\n2. Emergency Response Program: ConAgra Foods facility has developed an OSHA hazardous substance emergency response program called HAZWOPER. The HAZWOPER document contains detailed procedures for: 1) pre-emergency planning and coordination; 2) personnel roles and lines of authority; 3) training; 4) communication; 5) emergency recognition and prevention; 6) safe distances and places of refuge; 7) site security and control; 8) emergency alerting and response; 9) ammonia decontamination; 10) emergency medical treatment and first aid; 11) critique of response and follow-up; 12) personal protective and emergency equipment; and 13) medical surveillance.  ConAgra Foods emergency response plan (HAZWOPER) is a detailed document which discusses the role of employees and management in an emergency situation.  All emergency response personnel undergo training and records of this training are maintained and updated on site.  The plan outlines specific procedures for evacuations, incident alarms and alerting.  Depending upon a given situation, the Fire Department will be called to provide back-up emergency responders and equipment.  The Fire Department will be called for all fire related emergencies.  The incident commander has ultimate control of implementation of the emergency response plan.\n\n3. Stationary Source and Regulated Substance: ConAgra Foods is a meat processing plant located on an approximate 10 acre site. The main building houses a processing plant used for mixing, cooking, conveying, freezing, and packaging. The processes meat products require refrigeration for processing and storage."

      "SummaryText": " Anhydrous ammonia is the primary refrigerant used. The system contains approximately 39,000 pounds of ammonia.\n\n4. Worst Case and Alternative Release Scenarios: RMP*Comp was used to calculate the worst case and alternative release scenarios.\n\n5. Five Year Accident History: One accident occurred on 6/9/2009.  A natural gas explosion at the facility caused 4 deaths, 63 injuries and $50.0 MM in property damage.  The effects of the explosion also included the release of 10,544 lbs. of anhydrous ammonia to the air and water."
