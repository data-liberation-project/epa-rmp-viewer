Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nAll water plant operating employees are to be trained on the proper handling of Chlorine tanks and feed systems, and emergency response contact policies in a timely fashion following their employment at the facility, and will receive refresher training on an annual basis thereafter.\n\nAn outside agency (Connersville Fire Department) is to be notified in the event of a potential or actual release of Chlorine outside the facility. The Fire Department will be responsible for any necessary notifications of the public and/or trained and equipped hazardous materials responders.\n\n\n2.  Stationary source and regulated substance(s)\n\nThe Connersville Utilities owns and operates a water treatment plant in Connersville, Indiana.  It uses Chlorine stored in 2,000-pound cylinder tanks.  \n\nChlorine gas is drawn from the tanks using a low-pressure water induction system for injection a various points in the water treatment system.\n\nNo more than three (2) 2,000-pound tanks are on-hand at any time, for a maximum total quantity of 4,000 pounds of Chlorine.\n\n\n3. Worst Case Scenario\n\nThe worst case scenario is the rupture of one cylinder tank containing 2,000 pounds of Chlorine.\n\nThe contents of the cylinder tank would be released as Chlorine gas at a rate of 200 pounds per minute over a period of ten (10 minutes).  The total quantity released would be 2,000 pounds.\n\nThe distance to toxic endpoint is calculated at .9 miles using RMP Comp as the modeling calculation tool.\n\n\n\n4. Alternative Case Scenario\n\nA portion of the contents of the cylinder tank would be released as Chlorine gas at a rate of 2 pounds per minute over a period of 30 minutes.  The total quantity released would be 60 pounds.\n\nThe distance to toxic endpoint is calculated at .1 miles using RMP Comp as the modeling calculation tool.\n\n5. General Accidental Release Prevention "

      "SummaryText": "Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe accidental release prevention program is based upon a combination of management practices and low pressure vacuum feeders specifically designed for Chlorine gas.\n\n\n\n6. Five-Year Accident History\n\nThe Connersville Utilities Water Treatment Plant has had no accidental releases of Chlorine gas in the past five (5) years.\n\n\n\n7. Emergency Response Program\n\nThe Connersville Utilities Treatment Plant is not required to have an emergency response program since response activities will be handled by public responders.  However, emergency issues have been coordinated with the Connersville Fire Department and the Fayette County, Indiana Office of Emergency Management. \n\n\n8. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nConnersville Utilities will continue to emphasize safety and employee training."
