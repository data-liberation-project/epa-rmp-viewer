Sections 68.1-68.220, Accidental Release Prevention Provisions.\n\n40 CFR Part 68 requires stationary sources with listed substances present in a quantity greater than the corresponding threshold quantity to develop and implement a risk management program that includes a hazard assessment, a prevention program, and an emergency response program.  The risk management program is to be described in an RMP that is registered with USEPA, submitted to state and local agencies, and made available to the public.  At the Harwood's Mill facility, chlorine, which is a listed substance, is stored in a quantity greater than its threshold quantity of 2,500 pounds (lb).\n\nThis RMP was prepared in accordance with 40 CFR Part 68, Subpart G, 68.150-68.190.  In accordance with 40 CFR Part 68.10(d)(2), since accidental releases of chlorine result in off-site impacts and chlorine storage operations are subject to the Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, Prevention Program 3 requirements apply to this facility.\n\nThe Harwood's Mill facility uses chlorine in its water treatment process for disinfection and destruction of disease-producing organisms that may be present in the water.  Chlorine is stored at the Harwood's Mill facility as a liquid under pressure in one ton steel cylinders.  These cylinders are stored inside of a building.   The liquid chlorine is transferred from the cylinders to a chlorine evaporator.  Upon vaporization, the chlorine is then sent to the chlorinators which control the chlorine dosage to the specific applications.  The Harwood's Mill facility's maximum intended inventory of chlorine is 40 cylinders.\n\nThe Harwood's Mill facility's accidental release prevent"

      "SummaryText": "ion and emergency response procedures are based on the goal of storing and handling this substance in a manner that prevents exposure to employees and the nearby community.  It is the facility's policy to adhere to applicable state and federal regulations.\n\nIn accordance with 40 CFR 68.25(a)(2), the Harwood's Mill facility is required to analyze and report in  the RMP one worst-case release scenario that is estimated to create the greatest distance in any direction to an endpoint for chlorine.  In accordance with 40 CFR 68.25(b)(1) and 68.25(c)(1), the basis for the worst-case release scenario is defined as the release of the greatest amount held in a single vessel.  For the Harwood's Mill facility, the single largest chlorine storage vessel is a one ton cylinder.  Since chlorine exists as a gas at ambient conditions, it is assumed that the entire contents of one cylinder, approximately 2,000 lb, would be released as a gas over a 10-minute period.  The worst-case release scenario results in a distance of 0.9 mi to the toxic endpoint for chlorine.\n\nIn accordance with 40 CFR 68.28(a), the Harwood's Mill facility is required to evaluate at least one alternative release scenario for chlorine.  The alternative release scenario is defined as a leak in a valve of the transfer line leaving the evaporator.  This type of leak would last for a duration of approximately 3-4 minutes before it was recognized by facility personnel and mitigated.  This type of release results in a choke flow of chlorine leaving the valve.  The alternative release scenario results in a distance of 0.1 mi to the toxic endpoint for chlorine.\n\nThe Harwood's Mill facility, as part of its accidental release prevention program, requires both current and newly hired operators and maintenance personnel to complete and pass the facility's Personnel Qualification Standards (PQS).  The PQS consists of training in the following subjects: operating phase, operating limits, safety and health considerations, and s"

The local fire department and local emergency planning commission are included in this plan.\n\nThe Harwood's Mill facility conducted a review of the process hazards analysis in March 1999.  As a result of this PHA, the following changes are expected to be implemented at the facility by December 1999: installation of a chlorine scrubber"
