Gulf Coast Fractionators (herein also referred to as \"the Facility\") receives raw product by pipeline, extracting, treating, and storing natural gas products.  The Facility handles and stores flammable mixtures of Methane, Ethane, Propane, Isobutane, Butane, Isopentane, and Pentane. \n\n\n\nThis Risk Management Program (RMP) covers the Natural Gas Liquid Extraction Process at the Facility. This document complies with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Accidental Release Prevention Provisions (40 CFR Part 68) and includes by reference the Process Safety Management Program elements in 29 CFR Part 1910.119. The process is classified as Program Level 3 under the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation.  \n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES:\n\n\n\nThe primary function of the Facility is to act as a natural gas liquid processing facility.  By virtue of the flammable effects associated with natural gas, it is necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling flammable mixture of Methane, Ethane, Propane, Isobutane, Butane, Isopentane, and Pentane to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to employee health, and to minimize the threat and impact to nearby members of the community.  Phillips 66 - Gulf Coast Fractionators is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety and health.  Safety at the Facility depends upon the manner in which natural gas is handled as well as the various safety devices incorporated into the design of the process.  Furthermore, comprehensive training is provided to employees and contractors, which reinforces the safety policies and procedures of the Facility.\n\n\n\nIn addition to the presence of appropriate controls to prevent or minimize possible releases of Flammable Mixtures, if a release does occur, an emergency response plan is in place for the Facility and response activitie"

The maximum amount of Flammable Mixture that can be stored at this facility is approximately 5,100,000 pounds. \n\n\n\nThe Facility receives raw product of the Flammable Mixture by pipeline. The Facility operates two fractionation trains which extract hydrocarbon liquids from the raw natural gas streams. The Facility operation includes inlet metering, compression, ethane treating, butane and gasoline treating, fractionation, and product storage. Products are transported from the facility via pipeline. \n\n\n\nTHE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND THE SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS:\n\n\n\nThe Facility complies with 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA and with all applicable State codes and regulations. The Facility's covered process complies with 29 CFR Part 1910.119 (Process Safety Management for Highly Hazardous Chemicals). The Facility conducts regular Process Hazard Analyses (PHA) for the process to identify potential hazards as well as controls, systems, and recommendations to mitigate those hazards. Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner. The Facility maintains Operating Procedures and Process Safety Information that describes the chemical hazards associated with regulated substances at the Facility. The Facility also has processes in place for Training, Compliance Audits, Incident Investigations, Management Of Change (MOC), Employee Participation, Hot Work Permitting, and Contractor Safety Performance in order to ensure continual commitment to safety.

This coordination includes periodic meetings involving local emergency response officials who are participating in the Mutual Aid Mont Belvieu System (MAMB). The Facility has around the clock communications capabilities with Mont Belvieu Police who monitor the MAMB radio net on a 24-hour basis. Local authorities may also be notified directly through the 911 emergency telephone system ore the Mont Belvieu Annunciator System. This provides a method of notifying the public in the event of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident. The Facility has a written Emergency Response Program in the event of an accidental release which includes emergency health care and steps to inform the public.  A plan is in place to inform employees what to do in case of a release, fire, medical emergency, etc., and to notify emergency responders when there is a need for a response. \n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\n\n\n\nThe Facility is constantly re-evaluating the current safety systems through the use of prevention programs such as Management of Change and the Process Hazard Analysis program. As a result of these programs, and other safety and risk reduction initiatives, improvements to the safety of the workers and the surrounding community continue to occur.
