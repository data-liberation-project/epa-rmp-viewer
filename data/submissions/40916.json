      "SummaryText": "A.  Description of Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nVitafoam Incorporated is a flexible polyurethane foam manufacturing facility located in High Point, North Carolina.  As a result of the manufacturing process, the following regulated chemicals are present at the facility in quantities that exceed the threshold quantities specified by EPA regulations: toluene diisocyanate (TDI) (10,000 pounds).  The facility has one covered process that requires the facility meet Program 2 requirements of the Risk Management Program (RMP) regulations.  \n\nTDI is delivered to the facility via railcars and offloaded into storage tanks.  In the process, TDI is used in the production of polyurethane foam. The facility manufactures polyurethane foam by the vigorous mechanical mixing of polyols with TDI along with water, catalyst and surfactants.  The resultant polymeric network is expanded with carbon dioxide which is formed in the reaction between the water and TDI.\n \nB. Accidental Release Prevention & Emergency Response Policies of Vitafoam\n\nVitafoam is committed to protecting facility personnel, the public and the environment from any workplace and accidental release hazards.  Appropriate responses to releases of TDI are documented in the Risk Management Program document.  Safety, environmental protection and risk management programs are fully implemented and coordinated with community emergency responders for emergency planning and response efforts.\n\nC. Release Scenario Discussion\n\nIn accordance with the requirements of the RMP regulations each owner or operator of a stationary source is required to perform the following offsite consequence analyses.\n\u00bfOne worst-case release scenario to represent all regulated toxic substances held in excess of the threshold quantity.  A worst-case scenario was conducted TDI.\n\u00bfOne alternative release scenario for each regulated toxic substance held in excess of the threshold quantity.  An alternative scenario was calculated for TDI."
