The corporation\u00bfs environmental management system has been registered to the ISO 14001 standard, and the Kodak Park (KP) site is also registered under the ISO 14001 Environmental Management System standard.  The registration involves regularly scheduled extensive audits of policies and procedures by an independent registrar.\n\nKP\u00bfs RMP Program is modeled after its OSHA Process Safety Management Program that has been in existence for a number of years.  The site\u00bfs Emergency Response policies are primarily contained in the Kodak Fire Department and HSE procedures which also contains its policies on emergency planning, risk analysis and communications.\n\nThe KP site Health, Safety & Environment policy states that the site is committed to health, safety and environmental excellence through compliance with regulations and corporate initiatives, prevention of pollution and continual improvement of health, safety & environmental performance.\n\nStationary Source & Regulated Substances\n\nStationary Source\n\nThe stationary source involved is the chemical and photoprocessing solution manufacturing facilities located at the KP site of the Eastman Kodak Company. The Kodak Park plant site is located on more than 1,000 acres, and stretches nearly 4 miles in length through the City of Rochester and the Town of Greece in New York State.  \n\nRegulated Substances\n\nPreviously this source had 2 regulated processes; 1 has been eliminated, so currently the KP site has 1 material that requires the submission of an RMP.  It is vinylidene chloride, located at Building 119 (B-119) in the middle section of KP.  This location is situated in the City of Rochester.\n\nVinyl"

      "SummaryText": "idene Chloride Storage Tank - Kodak Park Building 119\n\nThe vinylidene chloride storage and delivery system was installed in May, 1994.  It is located at B-119 and operated by Kodak\u00bfs Imaging Chemicals Division.  B-119 manufactures specialty polymers and organic chemicals via batch processes for the photographic film and paper business.\n\nVinylidene chloride is received at the B-119 courtyard unloading station in tank trailers containing 4000 gallons per delivery.  Three to four deliveries are received annually.  The courtyard is surrounded on the east, west, and south by B-119.  The unloading station is a concrete pad sloped to a drain which is connected to a 9200 gallon underground tank designed to capture more than the entire contents of the tank trailer delivery in the event of a spill or release.  The unloading station is equipped with a sprinkler system and alarm activation buttons for use in the event of an emergency.  The alarm system was upgraded in 1998.\n\nThe vinylidene chloride is delivered to and stored in a 6,700 gallon double walled stainless steel underground storage tank which is surrounded by a containment tank equipped with a vapor detector.  The vinylidene chloride is unloaded to the tank by gravity via pressure-rated hoses.  The unloading system involves a closed system where the displaced gasses from the storage tank are returned to the trailer.  The tank is equipped with a pressure relief valve set at 35 psi and a rupture disk set at 30 psi.  The process is a manual operation with operator attendance mandatory during the entire unloading.  The system\u00bfs status is monitored by a computer control system located in a small shed adjacent to the unloading station.\n\nWorst Case Scenario\n\nThe worst case scenario could occur if the tank trailer fails during unloading and the entire 4000 gallons spills onto the concrete unloading pad.  The entire 4000 gallons would be contained within the containment pad.  Approximately 1,850 pounds would vaporize over a 10"

There would be no off-site consequences as a result of this scenario.\n\nAlternate Release Scenario\n\nThe alternate release scenario would occur if the unloading hose ruptures and the valve is manually closed by the system operator (required to be in attendance during the unloading operation) after a 1 minute release.  At a 50 gallon per minute flow rate this would result in 50 gallons or 503 pounds released.  A pool fire could result with the endpoint for a radiant heat level of 5 kw/m2 for 40 seconds being less than 25 feet.  There would be no off-site consequences for this scenario.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThis storage and delivery system is also covered under the Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA) 1910.119 Process Safety Management regulation and is in compliance with all elements of that regulation.  Process Hazard Analyses (PHAs) have been conducted to determine potential hazards and many safeguards are in place to prevent the occurrence of a catastrophic release.  The system is also covered by the New York State Chemical Bulk Storage regulations.  Required design standards, daily, monthly and annual inspections and continuous leak detection are only a few of the requirements that are followed to be in compliance with this regulation.\n\nThe delivery of raw material has been identified in both the Worst Case Scenario and Alternate or \u00bfMore Likely To Occur\u00bf WCS.  Because of the infrequency of these deliveries (3-4 times annually) the risk of a release has been lowered. \n\nThe tank has been engineered to strict American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) codes.  The tank and operation adheres to our supplier\u00bfs (Dow Chemical) Monomer Safe Handling Guides.  An inhibitor is added and a nitrogen blanket is always present to prevent unwanted polymerization.\n\nA"

The program follows the Analytical Methods Training System (AMTS) protocols.  In addition to the operational training received, emergency training is also provided.  All employees are trained to report spills or leaks to supervision and to call internal 911 for emergency assistance from the Kodak Fire Department (KFD).  Immediate response is provided by the KFD including a trained HAZMAT team.  Reviews are attended and conducted by management and operations personnel to determine the root cause of incidents and corrective actions necessary to prevent a recurrence.\n\nDetailed operating procedures are written and followed to insure correct handling of this material and proper operation of the equipment.  Regular Health, Safety and Environment (HSE) Reviews of procedures are conducted and updates are made in the case of any equipment or procedural changes.  Operators are trained to carefully follow the written procedures.\n\nA strict Management of Change process is in place to prevent any unapproved changes from being made.  All equipment changes are brought to a committee for design, HSE and management review prior to implementation.  Both the HSE Review and Management of Change processes are implemented by departmental policies.\n\nEquipment maintenance is an essential component of the facility\u00bfs Mechanical Integrity Program.  In the Imaging Chemicals Division, a computer-based system maintained by the Maintenance and Engineering Department, contains the maintenance procedures and the regular Preventative Maintenance (PM) program and is the backbone of the Mechanical Integrity Program.

The Fire Department maintains at least 6 major pieces of mobile fire suppression and support apparatus and currently has a staff of approximately 50 personnel.  The Fire Department responds to all fires, explosions, major gas or chemical leaks and all other life threatening situations at the Kodak Park site.\n\nThe Fire Department provides fire suppression/emergency response capability in addition to maintaining related fire fighting equipment and performing supervisory checks of fire protection systems (valves, high points, etc.).\n\nIt also performs inspection/testing functions, along with development, administration and implementation of departmental training.  Departmental training is conducted at least once each month on various topics such as the use of SCBA, selection and use of appropriate personal protective equipment, selection and use of special equipment, building familiarization tours to acquaint firefighters with processes and hazards inherent to various areas of the site, hazard communication, radiation safety, and other similar/related topics.\n\nFire fighting equipment at each fire house receives a daily check for operational readiness.  A more in-depth inspection of equipment is conducted on a weekly basis.\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no incidents within the last five years.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThere are no planned changes at this time.  Potential changes that are identified during HSE Reviews or PHA\u00bfs are implemented when they are shown to provide significant improvements to worker or community safety."
