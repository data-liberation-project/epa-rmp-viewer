This commitment is reflected in the safety and environmental programs that are implemented at the facility.  For example, written procedures have been created for operating the ammonia refrigeration system.  Only trained operators / refrigeration contractor are permitted to perform system operations.  World Class Distribution has also developed a robust maintenance program to ensure the equipment is in good operating condition.  All of these programs are geared towards the prevention of an accidental release at the facility.  In addition, these programs incorporate emergency procedures to mitigate the effects of a release if it does occur.  At such an event, emergency coordinators will assess the situation and notify outside responding agencies as necessary.\r\n\r\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\r\n\r\nWorld Class Distribution is located at 343 S. Lena Rd. in San Bernardino, California.  Ammonia is used in the facility's refrigeration system to provide cooling for the storage and distribution of grocery products.  The system uses a maximum of 25,000 pounds of ammonia.  A description of how the process operates is presented below:  \r\n\r\nThe refrigeration cycle begins with the transfer of high pressure liquid ammonia from the High Pressure Receiver to the Accumulator / Flash Economizer (ACC1) and to the Dock and Temp Evaporators. The High Pressure Receiver also sends liquid ammonia to the Compressors for liquid injection oil cooling.  \r\n\r\nAt the Accumulator / Flash Economizer, the temperature of the liquid is lowered by the medium temperature suction prior to being fed to the rest of the system.  The subcooled liquid is then fed to the -10 Low Temp Recirculator (LTR2). Low temp recirculated liquid is then pumped to -30 Low Temp Recirculator (LTR1) and the Freezer and Turkey Evaporators. The -30 Low"

The resulting 'wet suction' (liquid/vapor mix) is sent to the following vessels. \r\n\u00bf\tDock Evaporators &#8594; Accumulator / Flash Economizer (ACC1)\r\n\u00bf\tTemp Evaporators &#8594; Accumulator (ACC2)\r\n\u00bf\tFreezer & Turkey Evaporators &#8594; -10 Low Temp Recirculator (LTR2)\r\n\u00bf\tIce Cream Evaporators &#8594; -30 Low Temp Recirculator (LTR1)\r\n\r\nThese vessels are designed to prevent liquid ammonia from reaching the compressors based upon the temperature and application.  Excess liquid in the -30 Low Temp Recirculator drains to the associated Liquid Transfer Vessel.  Hot gas from the Compressors is used to push the liquid ammonia from the Liquid Transfer Vessel to the High Pressure Receiver.\r\n\r\nSuction is pulled from the vessels by the Compressors. Compressor C1 pulls ultra low temp suction from the -30 Low Temp Recirculator. Compressors C2-C4 pull low temp suction from the -10 Low Temp Recirculator. Compressors C1-C4 also receive medium temp suction (economizer suction) from the Accumulator / Flash Economizer for increased efficiency. Compressor C5 is a swing compressor and can pull suction from any one of the 4 vessels. Compressor C6 pulls medium temp suction from the Accumulator / Flash Economizer. Compressors C7-C8 pull high temp suction from the Accumulator. The Compressors increase the pressure of the ammonia vapor through the discharge port of the machine. The Compressors send high-pressure discharge vapor to the Underfloor Heat Exchanger and Evaporative Condensers.  The high-pressure discharge is also routed to the Liquid Transfer Vessel (to pressurize the vessel and facilitate liquid transfer) and to the evaporators (air units AU1-AU45) for hot gas defrost.  The Compressors receive liquid ammonia from the High Pressure Receiver for liquid injection oil cooling."

The resulting medium temp suction is sent to the Accumulator / Flash Economizer.\r\n\r\nAt the Condensers, air (fans) and water (pumps) are used to condense the compressor discharge into high pressure liquid, which then drains back to the High Pressure Receiver to begin the refrigeration cycle again.\r\n\r\nAn auto purger is provided to remove non-condensables from the high side of the system.  All relief valves are tied to a common header and relieve to the Ammonia Diffusion Tank.\r\n\r\nWorld Class Distribution operates the refrigeration system at the facility 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Operations and preventative maintenance is conducted by the refrigeration contractor.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\r\n\r\nWorld Class Distribution has developed an accidental release prevention program for compliance with the OES CalARP regulations.  The program includes but is not limited to the following elements:\r\n\r\n\u00bf\tSafety information regarding the chemical hazards, and operating and technical specifications for the equipment;\r\n\u00bf\tWritten procedures for operating and maintaining the processes;\r\n\u00bf\tTraining for personnel involved with system operations and maintenance;\r\n\u00bf\tInvestigating releases and near misses and implementing measures to prevent recurrence; and\r\n\u00bf\tAudit procedures for ensuring that the programs are being implemented in accordance to the regulations. \r\n\r\nIn addition, engineering controls have been implemented to reduce the chance of an accidental release to the environment.  These are comprised of equipment monitoring systems and safety cutouts to shut off the equipment when operating parameters exceed safe operating limits.  Relief valves on pressurized ammonia vessels prevent equipment rupture in the event of overpressurization.  Regular inspections and tests are performed to ensure these controls are in good working order.\r\n\r\nFiv"

In addition, there have been no incidents at the facility in the last five years that resulted in a release of more than the Federal Reportable Quantity (100 pounds).\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\n\r\nWorld Class Distribution has developed an Emergency Action Plan (EAP) for the purpose of protecting employees and the surrounding community.  The EAP covers procedures for: 1) evacuating and accounting for visitors and employees, 2) dealing with an ammonia release and other foreseeable emergencies that could occur onsite, 3) notifying external agencies and emergency response personnel, and 4) administering first aid measures for ammonia exposure.  Employees are informed of the elements of the EAP.  In the event of an ammonia release, employees will evacuate or shelter-in-place, depending on the nature of the release, and the facility will contact the refrigeration contractor (C&L Refrigeration, (800) 901-4822) and the fire department (San Bernardino County Fire Department, (909) 829-4441) for assistance as necessary.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nA Process Hazard Analysis and a Seismic Assessment have been performed on the ammonia refrigeration system, and these studies have resulted in action items to improve safety at the facility.  The recommendations mainly consist of formalizing procedures, implementing practices consistent with industry standards, and performing inspections and tests to maintain the integrity of the equipment.
