If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the Valley Park Fire Protection District Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.\n\nA description of our facility and the regulated substances handled:  This facility is an insecticide manufacturer for use by commercial applicators.  We use a number of different propellants in our aerosol insecticide can products.  We have one 12,000 gallon isobutane/propane mixture  tank (A-46), one 12,000 gallon demethyl ether tank (DME), three 2,000 gallon propane  tanks (A-108), and one 2,000 gallon difluouroethane tank (Dymel 152A).  The two 12,000 gallon tanks are located in aboveground bunkers. \n\nThe worst-case and alternative release scenarios: A worst-case analysis was done for each flammable propellant above the threshold.  The propellant with the greatest offsite consequence radius was chosen for the worst-case scenario which in this case was the 12,000 gallon isobutane/propane tank (A-46).  Originally, the A-108 propane was stored in this tank, but a change in operations led to switching the A-108 into the 2,000 gallon tanks and the A-46 into the 12,000 gallon tank.  This changed the worst-case distance to endpoint and the RMP Level 3 program had to be updated.  The failure of the 12,000 gallon isobutane/propane tank when filled to the greatest amount allowed (88% at 60 degrees F), results in a vapor cloud explosion.  The resulting distance to the endpoint extends offsite, and public receptors are within the distance to the endpoint.  Our alternative release scenario is a break in a 2-inch diameter pipe from the 12,000 gallon isobutane/propane tank, leading to a 10-minute release and explosion of some of the re"

We have discussed this policy with the fire department and they are aware of their responsibility.     \n\nPlanned changes to improve safety: A water deluge system was installed over the vertical propellant tanks in 2000.  The gas detection system in the gashouses has been replaced with better equipment.\n\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY FOR PROGRAM  1 WAREHOUSE PROCESS\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at our facility: This facility complies with NFPA-58 requirements for LP-Gas storage, and it is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.
