The HHC has been classified as a Program 3 because public receptors have been identified within a calculated radius of exposure.  The Plant is manned 24 hours a day/seven days a week by Operation Personnel who receive extensive Environmental, Health & Safety Training.  Over pressure and high level alarms are in place with shutdown controls for abnormal conditions.  System volumes and pressures are monitored through a Distributed Control System (DCS) with an operator stationed at the Control Room for monitoring of systems and alarms.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nThe HHC started operations on August 10, 2013 and has experienced NO known reportable process accidents in the past 5 years.  \r\n\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\n\r\nWilliam Field Service Group LLC maintains a written emergency response plan that includes the HHC, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The plan consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  A Fire Water System that includes directional monitors has been installed wit"

Bottoms from the De-Butanizer are recovered as Natural Gasoline and are routed to a 60,000 BBL floating roof tank located outside the process area.  Propane, butane, natural gasoline and condensate are all routed to a Rail Loading Facility for transport.  A Truck Loading Rack is also available for propane loading. Other major equipment at the facility includes: (2) Hot Oil Heaters (i.e. one for the Fractionation units and one for the Condensate unit) that provides a heat medium which is used for recovering the various products in the Fractionation Process;  a propane refrigeration system to support cooling of Refrigerated Storage Tanks; a main process flare for all (3) fractionation trains; a LPG flare in refrigerated storage to provide for pressure control of refrigerated storage tanks; and a Rail Loading combustor to flare vapors from the gasoline and condensate rail car loading process.\r\n\r\nUn-stabilized Condensate is also received via truck and offloaded from the Condensate unloading terminal to an un-stabilized 30,000 BBL storage tank.  The tank and offloading vapor is routed to the Condensate Truck Loading Combustor (i.e. Flare). The condensate stabilizer removes NGLs which are dried through a molecular sieve and injected into the fractionation inlet for further processing. The bottoms product of the stabilizer (i.e. stabilized condensate) is cooled and stored in a 60,000 BBL floating roof tank for removal by truck, rail, or pipeline (i.e. Corner Stone Pipeline).\r\n\r\nAs a result of these operations, several EPA regulated flammable substances are processed, recovered, and stored at the facility.  The RMP regulated substances at the Harrison  Hub  Complex facility are ethane, propane, isobutane,  butane,  pentane,  and  isopentane. The flammable substance inventory quantity provided in Section 1.17 of the RMP is a conservative estimate of the amount of regulated flammable substance that is present in the facility at any given time"

The commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\r\n\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nThe primary purpose of the Harrison Hub Complex (HHC) is to fractionate natural gas liquids (NGLs) into marketable components including ethane, propane, butane, and natural gasoline.  The NGLs are delivered to the HHC through an inlet Surge Vessel and then processed through one of (3) fractionation trains which include a De-Ethanizer Tower, De-Propanizer Tower and De-Butanizer Tower. Overheads from the De-Ethanizer consist primarily of ethane and are pumped into an ethane pipeline that transports the ethane to a main product pipeline that is operated by a 3rd party.  The bottoms from the De-Ethanizer are routed to the De-Propanizer.  Overheads from the De-Propanizer consist primarily of propane and are pumped into either one of (18) 90,000 gallon horizontal storage vessels, (1) 30,000 BBL Sphere, or (2) 200,000 BBL Refrigerated Storage Tanks that are located outside the processing area.  Propane is also transported via a pipeline that delivers the propane to a product pipeline that is operated by a 3rd party.  Bottoms from the De-Propanizer are routed to the De-Butanizer and associated process equipment.  Overheads from the De-Butanizer consist mainly of mixed butanes and are pumped into either (2) 90,000 gallon horizontal storage vessels, a 50,000 BBL Butane Sphere, or (2) 125,000"
