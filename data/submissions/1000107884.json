It has coordinated with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and nearby emergency responders. R152a is not required to be included in the community emergency response plan because it is not a regulated toxic substance. NIPG Shelbyville has also developed and implemented its own Emergency Action Plan for this facility. The Emergency Action Plan includes actions to be taken in response to accidental releases of regulated substances as well as procedures for informing the public and local response agencies of a chemical release. The last emergency response notification exercise was conducted on October 18, 2023.\n\n1.6\tPlanned Changes to Improve Safety (\u00a768.155(f))\nSome action items have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program.
