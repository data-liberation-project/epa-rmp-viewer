Iatan Station maintains one substance, anhydrous ammonia, on site in amounts exceeding the Risk Management Program (RMP) threshold quantities. \r\n\r\nAnhydrous ammonia will be used at the Iatan Station as an air pollution control additive, to reduce the nitrogen oxide (Nox) emissions to the atmosphere from the Unit #1 and #2 boilers with selective catalytic reduction (SCR) devices. \r\n\r\nPlant Description\r\n\r\nThe Iatan Station is located North of the city of Weston, Missouri at 20250 State Route 45 N.  The facility is situated east of the Missouri River.  The property is in a river valley with large hills to the South and East.\r\n\r\nAmmonia System Description\r\n\r\nThe ammonia storage tanks are designed to be filled by a tanker truck at a dedicated loading station.  For the Nox control systems, ammonia vapors will be drawn from the tanks, regulated for pressure, mixed with air, and injected into the boiler flue within the ammonia injection grid.  In combination with the catalyst in the selective catalytic reduction units, nitrogen oxides will be reacted and emissions of the pollutant will be reduced.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Assessment (PHA)\r\n\r\nProcess hazard assessments were performed using 'What If' type analysis for the Unit #1 and #2 ammonia system.  These analysis' utilize a brainstorming approach, in which a team of people familiar with the process asks questions about possible undesirable events.  The What If analysis results in a listing of undesirable events with their consequences, safeguards, and recommendations for risk reduction.  Comments and recommendations are summarized in the Process Hazard Assessment section of the Risk Management Program.\r\n\r\nPrevention System\r\n\r\nThe Iatan Station will have operation, maintenance and inspection procedures for the anhydrous ammonia system. There will be Operation and Maintenance manuals for each major piece of equipment, and personnel will"
