Iatan Station maintains one substance, anhydrous ammonia, on site in amounts exceeding the Risk Management Program (RMP) threshold quantities. \n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammonia will be used at the Iatan Station as an air pollution control additive, to reduce the nitrogen oxide (Nox) emissions to the atmosphere from the Unit #1 and #2 boilers with selective catalytic reduction (SCR) devices. \n\n\n\nPlant Description\n\n\n\nThe Iatan Station is located North of the city of Weston, Missouri at 20250 State Route 45 N.  The facility is situated east of the Missouri River.  The property is in a river valley with large hills to the South and East.\n\n\n\nAmmonia System Description\n\n\n\nThe ammonia storage tanks are designed to be filled by a tanker truck at a dedicated loading station.  For the Nox control systems, ammonia vapors will be drawn from the tanks, regulated for pressure, mixed with air, and injected into the boiler flue within the ammonia injection grid.  In combination with the catalyst in the selective catalytic reduction units, nitrogen oxides will be reacted and emissions of the pollutant will be reduced.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Assessment (PHA)\n\n\n\nProcess hazard assessments were performed using 'What If' type analysis for the Unit #1 and #2 ammonia system.  These analysis' utilize a brainstorming approach, in which a team of people familiar with the process asks questions about possible undesirable events.  The What If analysis results in a listing of undesirable events with their consequences, safeguards, and recommendations for risk reduction.  Comments and recommendations are summarized in the Process Hazard Assessment section of the Risk Management Program.\n\n\n\nPrevention System\n\n\n\nThe Iatan Station will have operation, maintenance and inspection procedures for the anhydrous ammonia system. There will be Operation and Maintenance manuals for each major piece of equipment, and personnel will"

      "SummaryText": " receive training before being allowed to work on the systems.\n\n\n\nThe ammonia systems will be visually inspected on a periodic basis.  Standard operating procedures (SOPs) for startup, shutdown, normal operation and emergency operation of the ammonia storage systems will be in place when operation begins. The SOPs will be written and posted in appropriate areas.  Personnel will be trained annually on safety concerns and general operation procedures as well as emergency procedures. \n\n\n\nAmmonia sensors and alarms are in place to detect an ammonia release.  A fogging system to mitigate the impact of a release is in place. \n\n\n\nEmergency Response Plan\n\n\n\nEvergy, Inc. will respond to ammonia-related emergencies by notifying the Platte County Dispatch and by evacuating its personnel, when needed.\n\n  \n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThe Iatan Station has had no ammonia releases in the past five years which need to be reported in the five year accident history."
