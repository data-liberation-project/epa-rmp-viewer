This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If such a release does occur, our employees are trained to follow the Emergency Action Plan and to evacuate the facility as necessary. We are also coordinated with the City of Tulare Fire Department and the Tulare County Environmental Health which provides additional emergency response expertise.\r\n\r\nFACILITY INFORMATION & REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nThe Saputo Cheese USA Inc. - Paige facility is located at 800 East Paige Avenue, Tulare, CA 93274.

Due to our release prevention policies, no incidents, as defined by the RMP rule, have occurred in the past five years.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\n\r\nSaputo Cheese USA Inc. - Paige developed an Emergency Action Plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials as well as other emergency events that might occur at the plant. The purpose of Saputo's Emergency Action Plan is to ensure employees know and understand what to do in the event of an emergency in order to minimize injuries and property damage. The plan includes various aspects of an emergency including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, and notification of local emergency response agencies. Specific employees are trained and certified as medical responders. All employees are trained in evacuation, hazard communication, and chemical safety. In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect pertinent changes.\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nSeveral developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program. Recommendations resulting from the PHA, compliance audits and mechanical integrity inspections will be addressed in a timely manner. In addition, regular interaction with Saputo Corporate - Department of Environmental Affairs, Health & Safety and Risk Group will improve compliance and overall plant safety."
