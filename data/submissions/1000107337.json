These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring. All reports are retained for a minimum period of 5 years.\n\nThe five-year accident history [40 CFR 68.155(d)]:\n\nThe West Point facility has had zero RMP reportable incidents in the previous five years..\n\nThe emergency response program [40 CFR 68.155(e)]:\n\nAs a non-responding site, Hyundai Transys has developed a written Emergency Action Plan (EAP) that includes activation of the local emergency notification system and calling 911 from a safe location and directing an evacuation. Should the scope of any incident exceed the capability of Hyundai Transys staff, the employee discovering an emergency shall follow the protocol provided in the EAP to notify facility personnel, isolate the covered process if safe to do so, evacuate the facility and perform headcount at the designated muster point, and contact emergency responders. Note that there are no facility processes that would require continued operation during an emergency.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety [40 CFR 68.155(f)]:\n\nHyundai Transys is working to address the recommendations identified in the most recent compliance audit and just completed their hazard review. Hyundai Transys is committed to improving their safety systems and prioritizes these recommendations accordingly. \n\nHyundai Transys has completed this report to provide the public with information about our activities at this facility.  We believe that the many controls instituted to maintain a safe operation, and our commitment to continuous improvement that an incident affecting our employees or the surrounding area is unlikely to occur."

Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nWritten Operating Procedures [40 CFR Part 68.52]\nTo ensure safe operations, Hyundai Transys maintains written operating procedures. These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations and normal shutdown. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nEmployee Training [40 CFR Part 68.54]\nHyundai Transys has a training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating our processes are competent in the applicable operating procedures. Refresher training is provided at least every three years and more frequently as needed.\n\nMaintenance [40 CFR Part 68.56]\nHyundai Transys carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations. Inspected process equipment include pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, pressure relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls, and pumps. Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices. Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed. Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nCompliance Audits [40 CFR Part 68.58]\nHyundai Transys conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the US EPA RMP regulations are being implemented. These audits are conducted at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation [40 CFR Part 68.60]\nHyundai Transys promptly investigates any incident that has resulted"

This commitment is demonstrated by our accidental release prevention program that encompasses design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training. Engineering controls are in place to prevent possible releases of the regulated substance. The West Point, GA facility is a non-responding facility for releases of the RMP-listed chemicals, so the site utilizes an Emergency Action Plan.\nKevin McSpadden can also be contacted via his cell phone at 256-706-2130 in case of any emergency at the West Point facility.\n\nThe stationary source and regulated substances handled [40 CFR 68.155(b)]:\n\nHyundai Transys\u0092s West Point, GA facility stores and processes toluene-2,4-diisocyanate (TDI) in quantities greater than the RMP threshold quantity of 10,000 lbs. There are no other RMP applicable chemicals onsite. The worst case scenario does impact public receptors; however, TDI is not an applicable chemical under OSHA\u0092s PSM Standard. Thus, the TDI process is considered a program level 2.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps [40 CFR 68.155(c)]:\n\nHyundai Transys has a program in place to comply with the provisions of the accidental release prevention regulations under 40 CFR Part 68. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the existing release prevention program.\n\nSafety Information [40 CFR Part 68.48]\nHyundai Transys maintains a record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nHazard Review [40 CFR Part 68.50]\nProcess analyses ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently. The methodology used to carry out these analyses is What-if/Checklist."
