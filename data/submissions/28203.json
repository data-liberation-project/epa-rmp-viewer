      "SummaryText": "ABC Compounding Co., Inc. has only one process that would fall under the requirements of the RMP. We store on site approximately 6000 lbs. Of Hydrofluoric Acid in 55 gallon drum continers. These drums are identified with large red labels and  stored on a safety pallet designed to hold 55 gallons of material. These pallets are different than all other at the facility, employees are trainned that this material is to be given special consideration. The material is is stored and received inside the main warehouse. Once received it never travels outside the warehouse, therefore, any outside release is highly unlikey. The regulated substance is stored on the concrete floor in the cener of the main warehouse. The warehouse is approximately 40,600 square feet. Daily inspections are made to insure that the drums are being stored properly on the safety pallets. A typical batch will usually call for no more than 1 pallet (4 drums) of material. This minimizes the risk of transporting a large quanity of material. The material is transported on the safety pallet from the middle of the warehouse to the manufacturing platform by a forklift, this is a distance of approxiamtely 70 yards. The material never leaves the confine of the main warehouse. The material is raised by forklift onto the mezzanine level floor, approxiately 14 ft. high. The material is pumped and/or poured directly from the drum to the mixing kettle. Empty drums are stored in a drum storage area outside the plant to be sent off for reclamation. Any spill or release of product would be contained in the main warehouse. Visual signs of a spill or leak, vapor cloud, acid smell are known to all plant employees that work in the main warehouse. Employees are trained in spill countermeasure procedures, emergency response and other hazardous products on a continual basis. Training for hazardous materials, spill prevention, and process safety management are condusted annually.\n\nWorst Case Scenario\nThe worst case scenario for"

      "SummaryText": " this toxic liquid is the total quantity of the largest vessel. Hydrofluoric Acid is received and stored in 55 gallon drums. The worst case scenario is calculated for that amount being released. The worst case would be to spill that amount in the main warehouse. This could occur when the material is recived and transported to the storage rack or when the material is transported to the manufacturing platform. At all times the drums are stored and transported on the safety pallets designed to hold 55 gallon of material. Immediate meaasures would be taken if the material was released. Personnel are trained to observe for any signs of release and spill countermeasure plans. No outside impact is expected. \n\nAlternative Release Scenario\n\nAn alternative release could be a rarger release thatn a single container worst case scenario. A catastrophic releas of a pllet of material 220 gallons (2000 lbs.) inside the main warehouse would constitutesould constitute such a release.  This could occur during transport to the manufacturing platform when perhaps all four (4) of the 55 gallon drums perhaps feel from a height of 14 ft. and burst upon impact with the concrete floor below.  Immediate remediation measures sould then be taken. No outside impact is expected."
