      "SummaryText": "The City of Leesburg owns and operates the Leesburg Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP), located at 608 North Canal Street in Leesburg, Florida.  Like the majority of municipal wastewater treatment plants in the United States, gaseous chlorine is used at the Leesburg WWTP as a disinfectant to destroy pathogenic organisms in the treated water.  The popularity of chlorine as a water disinfectant is mainly due to its effectiveness and ability to provide a measurable residual.\n\nThe same properties that make chlorine valuable as a disinfectant also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling chlorine as a safeguard to our workers, our community, and the environment.  Chlorine is notably irritating to the eyes, nose, throat, and lungs.  More serious human health effects could result from much higher chlorine exposure, such as intense coughing, chest pains, and in extreme cases, death.\n\nThe City's commitment at the Leesburg WWTP is to store, handle, and use chlorine in a manner that achieves the needed benefits of disinfection while minimizing both onsite and offsite risks.  This is accomplished by designing a safe process, maintaining the process in optimum working condition, operating safely through documented procedures and extensive training, and arranging for an emergency response capability to minimize the consequences of a chlorine release, should a process accident ever occur.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nIt is the City's policy to adhere to all applicable Federal, State of Florida, and local rules and regulations.  This specifically includes compliance with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) rules for chlorine accidental release prevention and emergency response.\n\nThe primary measures for accidental chlorine release prevention are contained in the document entitled Process Safety Management / Risk Management Program for the Leesburg Water Treatm"

      "SummaryText": "yee assigned to the process with continuing operator training thereafter, with an emphasis on safe chlorine handling and emergency response.\n\n* Mechanical integrity: The integrity and reliability of the process is maintained by implementing preventive maintenance and routine inspection and testing procedures.\n\n* Incident Investigation: The City investigates within 48 hours any accident or near misses that could have resulted in a chlorine release, in order to develop measures to prevent a recurrence.\n\nThe above elements are only part of Leesburg WWTP's aggressive safety program.  In addition to the Program 3 prevention program elements, the City has developed related OSHA safety programs such as hot work and confined space.  These OSHA safety programs apply to both City and contractor employees.\n\nFive-year Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidents involving chlorine at the Leesburg WWTP in the past five years.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe emergency response plan covers all aspects of emergency response including escape procedures and routes, procedures for post-evacuation employee accounting, notification procedures, rescue and medical duties, and response procedures for spills or leaks.  If a major chlorine leak were to occur, the emergency plan requires immediate notification of the regional hazardous materials response teams for assistance, including orderly evacuation or sheltering-in-place of the surrounding community."

      "SummaryText": "ent Plant.  This process safety management (PSM) document was prepared in conformance with the EPA risk management rules, as well as industry-specific guidelines and best management practices relevant to release prevention.  Leesburg's Director of Environmental Services has the responsibility for ensuring that this program is implemented in the workplace as written.\n\nThe Leesburg WWTP emergency response plan relies on a team of offsite mutual-aid groups such as fire and rescue services.  The emergency response plans at Leesburg WWTP are based on the Incident Command system, where onsite responders work in coordination with local hazardous materials response teams to implement the City and regional response plans.  Leesburg WWTP's personnel receive hazard awareness training to understand how to recognize emergencies and to initiate the Incident Command system.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nChlorine is received by the facility by truck and is stored in one-ton chlorine cylinders fabricated to Department of Transportation (DOT) specifications.  Upon arrival at the site, all chlorine cylinders are inspected and if there is any doubt about the integrity of the cylinder, it is promptly refused.  Once accepted, the cylinders are stored and chained down inside a storage area for protection against radiant heat.  Two cylinders are connected to the disinfection process: one is in-use, and one is as standby.  The standby cylinders will be switched over when the in-use cylinders become empty, ensuring continuous disinfection.  The maximum intended chlorine inventory at Leesburg WWTP is 14000 pounds of chlorine stored in the building.\n\nThe Worst-Case and Alternative Chlorine Release Scenarios\n\nAs part of Leesburg WTP's emergency prevention and response efforts, a hazard assessment was conducted in compliance with EPA requirements contained in 40 CFR 68, Subpart B.  The hazard assessment included the development of worst-case and alternative release scenari"

      "SummaryText": "os.\n\nEPA defines a worst-case release as a scenario involving the greatest amount held in a single vessel or pipe.  In Leesburg WWTP's case, this involves the release of the entire contents of a one-ton chlorine cylinder.  The release is assumed to occur over a 10-minute period.  Appling the worst-case parameters to the worst-case situation results in a distance to chlorine endpoint (defined as 0.0087 milligrams per liter) of 1.3 miles.\n\nEPA defines an alternative release as a scenario more likely than the worst-case, but that nevertheless results in an impact offsite (unless no such release is possible).  Passive and active mitigation measures (chlorine detection, operator response, etc.) are considered in this scenario.  The scenario involved the release of chlorine gas through a failure of a lead washer on the gas cylinder connection.  Response time (leak detection to leak closure) is conservatively assumed to occur in 45 minutes.  This scenario results in a distance to chlorine endpoint of less than 0.1 mile.\n\nThe distance to endpoint calculations were performed using EPA's RMP*Comp model.  The RMP*Comp model was developed specifically for compliance with the accidental release prevention requirement for predicting the travel distance of an accidental release.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe City's PSM document contains 13 essential release prevention elements.  Some of the key accidental release prevention elements of the PSM program are as follows:\n\n* Process hazard analysis: This analysis was performed for each step in the chlorine process, to identify potential process failure scenarios and the appropriate prevention or response measures.  The process hazard analysis will be updated every 5 years.\n\n* Operating procedure review: The review was conducted to ensure that operators are given clear, written instructions for safely operating the chlorine process.\n\n* Training programs: Training is given to each emplo"
