LCRA has reviewed its obligations under the USEPA's Risk Management Program Rule (RMP Rule, Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act).  In response to these requirements, LCRA notes that there are two obligations incumbent on the operations at it's facility.\n1. ?112(r) ? Purpose and General Duty Clause ? The essence of the general duty clause is that an \nowner/operator that stores and uses hazardous chemicals in any quantity has a fundamental \nobligation to ensure safe operation and to have plans in place in the event of an accident to \nappropriately manage the situation.  LCRA takes this obligation very seriously and intends to be not \nonly a good neighbor but also a leader in community safety and emergency preparedness.\n2. Risk Management Plan ? LCRA operates a water treatment facility that stores and uses chlorine \nin excess of thresholds specified in the RMP Rule.  Even prior to the promulgation of the RMP rule, \nLCRA management has been very aware of the potential hazards posed by storage and use of \nchlorine. LCRA has established programs to prevent any accidental releases and training for \nemergency response in the event of a release. These programs are documented and described in \nthe Risk Management Plan. \nLCRA has implemented safety precautions to prevent and mitigate any chlorine release.  A new chemical storage building was constructed and put into service in April 2006.  This building is blast-proof  and provides a leak-tight atmosphere in case of chlorine release.  A fixed media dry scrubber is located within this building and is capable of treating a release from a one-ton chlorine cylinder with no discharge to the atmosphere.  The air in the chlorine storage room is continually monitored electronically for chlorine gas and a release of 3 ppm automatically starts the exhaust fan to the scrubber.  A monitor in the scrubber stack m"

If the chlorine level I nthe stack reaches 5 ppm, the stack is automatically closed and the chlorine remains in the building.\nLCRA has extensively coordinated with local emergency responders including the Hudson Bend Fire \nDepartment and the Local Emergency Planning Committee.\nLCRA management is committed to:\n- Preventing accidents;\n- Training our employees in correct response procedures in the event of an accident;\n- Providing leadership to the community with respect to emergency preparedness;\n- Addressing any citizen concerns by fully explaining potential hazards associated with facility \noperations and all steps being taken to prevent and mitigate accidents, and \n- Being a good corporate citizen of Travis County\nWith these objectives in mind, this Risk Management Plan provides information about our \nmanagement of the risks associated with the chlorine water treatment process, but more importantly, \nwe stress our commitment to ensuring a safe operation for our employees, our visitors and our \ncommunity."
