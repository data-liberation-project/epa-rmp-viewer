The training, qualifications, and safety awareness of our operations, maintenance, and management personnel are a key element in reducing and mitigating accidents.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nSince November 2003 to the present, there have been no accidents or releases of regulated substances from covered processes that meet specific EPA criteria for the Five-Year Accident History.  Such \u00bfRMP accidents\u00bf would involve serious accidents with either on-site deaths, injuries, or significant damage; or known, off-site deaths, injuries, property damage, or environmental damage.  DFA \u00bf Keller\u00bfs Creamery realizes that the community may also be interested in smaller releases of regulated chemicals that do not meet such criteria.  We have been diligent in reporting releases of hazardous materials and are internally investigating and correcting the causes of such releases.\n\nAmmonia Systems\n\nAn investigation into the facility\u00bfs accident history showed that there have been no releases of anhydrous ammonia that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 100 pounds over the past five years.  In addition, there have been no injuries resulting from an ammonia release.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nDFA \u00bf Keller\u00bfs Creamery is a \u00bfnon-responding\u00bf facility.  However, several employees have had official training for a 24-hr and 8-hr ammonia release emergency response, operating a respirator, etc.  Their role is to immediately call 911, Plant Manager and Maintenance Supervisor while waiting for Fire Department and appropriate responders to arrive at the scene.

This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:  \n\n- save lives;\n- minimize and avoid injuries;\n- protect the environment; and\n- minimize property damage.\n\nThe Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures, which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year. This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the RMP regulations.  \n\nDFA \u00bf Keller\u00bfs Creamery personnel circulate throughout the plant, taking note of unusual conditions in any portion of the system.  In the event that an ammonia leak is discovered, the person nearest to the leak will alert any personnel in the immediate area who are unaware of the danger, and the Maintenance Manager and Safety Representative (Supervisor).  The Supervisor will determine what procedures and personnel are necessary to remedy the problem. Emergency agencies will also be notified as necessary as outlined in the Emergency Action Plan.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nDFA \u00bf Keller\u00bfs Creamery facility is located at 1015 East Broadway in Winnsboro, Texas. The area immediately surrounding the facility is rural with farmland and residential areas.\n\nAmmonia System\n\nThe primary business of DFA \u00bf Keller\u00bfs Creamery is the production and processing of butter.  In order to conduct operations, the facility currently uses a maximum of 25,073 pounds of ammonia in its ammonia refrigeration system.  The refrigeration system, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment (compressors, evaporative condensers, pressure receiver, chiller, and suction accumulator, and Surface Scrapper), cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, hig"

Typical operating conditions range from approximately 10 psig on the low pressure side of the system to 160 psig on the high side.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nA prevention program is in place to minimize the risk of hazardous chemical releases in accordance with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard and the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP).  This prevention program covers the process that handles ammonia above the threshold quantity of either PSM or RMP rules.\n\nThe prevention program provides a structured approach to preventing accidents.  Some of the specific activities in the prevention program include:\n\n\u00bf Process safety information is provided to all applicable employees upon hire and is accessible at all times.\n\u00bf In depth process hazard analysis are completed every five years by qualified personnel using techniques approved under the PSM standard.\n\u00bf Written operating procedures (kept up to date) are used for training and guiding the work of operators.\n\u00bf Training is provided to all employees upon hire, and refresher training is given at least every three years or upon request.\n\u00bf Operators, mechanics, and contractor personnel are qualified, trained in the general hazards in the facility, and informed of any temporary situations affecting safety.\n\u00bf Pre-startup safety reviews are conducted to insure that conditions for safe operation have been satisfied prior to starting new or modified equipment.\n\u00bf A program is in place to maintain the mechanical integrity of the process, which includes written procedures, training requirements, and equipment deficiency requests for employees, work orders, scheduled maintenance, and documentation.\n\u00bf A hot work permit system assures that work is done safely and properly.\n\u00bf A management of change system is in place to ensure"
