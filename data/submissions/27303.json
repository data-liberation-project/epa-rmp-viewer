      "SummaryText": "The Arizona Chemical, Dover, Ohio facility has developed into a versatile multi-product facility, through improved technology that has allowed the plant to diversify with products used in making consumer goods that affect our everyday lives.  The Dover plant produces key ingredients in a wide variety of applications such as lubricants and greases, candles, plastics, tires, soaps, cosmetic bath oils, shaving creams, skin creams, printing inks, and adhesives.   Arizona Chemical supplies materials to companies such as Chevron, Noxell, 3M, Avon, Goodyear, DuPont, IBM, Texaco, Exxon, Kingsford, and Monsanto.\n\nArizona Chemical has two chemicals that meet the 112(r) rule toxic chemicals threshold quantities (TQs); the chemicals are anhydrous ammonia (\"NH3\") and ethylenediamine (\"EDA\").  The TQ for NH3 is 10,000 lbs, while the TQ for EDA is 20,000 lbs.  The NH3 is used in the solvent-separation plant portion of the facility as a refrigerant in the process.  The EDA is used in the polyamide process portion of the facility as a reactant in the process.\n\nArizona Chemical is committed to handling all extremely hazardous substances safely to prevent their \naccidental release and to minimize the consequences of any such release. \n\nManagement System\n\n     Arizona Chemical has established a management system to oversee the implementation of its Risk \n     Management Program responsibilities.  The management system is designed to help ensure that each \n     element of the program is fully and effectively completed.  A qualified professional engineer has been \n     assigned overall responsibility for the development, implementation, and integration of the program \n     elements.  Responsibility for implementing individual requirements of Arizona Chemical's program have \n     been delegated to competent individuals. Record-keeping responsibilities are also included in the \n     management system.\n \nOffsite Consequence Analysis (OCA) Requirements\n    \n     The Hazard Assessment portion"

From the release\n     scenarios, facilities are then to determine offsite impacts using specified offsite consequence analysis\n     (OCA) parameters for worst-case releases and more realistic parameters for alternative releases.  \n\n     Release Scenarios:\n\n          Arizona Chemical prepared worst-case release scenario analyses and alternative release scenario \n          analyses for both NH3 and EDA, based on requirements given in the 112(r) rule.\n\n          Worst-Case Release Scenarios:\n\n          For NH3, we assumed a potential rupture of the NH3 tank and subsequent release of 10,000 pounds \n          of  NH3 as a gas in 10 minutes.\n\n          For EDA, we assumed the potential collapse of the storage tank and release of all 80,000 pounds of \n          slowly evaporating EDA into the containment dike, but one-third of its contents overflows the dike.     \n          The OCA for EDA was found to be less than NH3; therefore, based on the requirements of the \n          112(r) rule, the OCA for NH3 has been presented as the worst-case release.  \n\n          Alternative Release Scenarios:\n\n          For NH3, we assumed a release of 960 pounds over 36 minutes from a potential line break between \n          the inside NH3 liquid receiver and the main valve in the NH3 compressor building.\n\n          For EDA, we assumed a 2,160 pound spill released over 2 minutes from a potential line separation\n          from a coupling during a tank-truck unloading to the EDA tank.  Again, we assumed that the EDA    \n          would evaporate slowly.\n\nAir-Impact Methods Inputs and Results\n\n     The OCA of each chemical release was analyzed separately using appropriate air dispersion analysis \n     and modeling techniques.
