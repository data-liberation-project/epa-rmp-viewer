The facility is operated by the City of Phoenix, Water Services Division (WSD).  The facility contains a covered process subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management Standard (PSM), 29 CFR 1910.119, and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program Rule (RMP), 40 CFR 68. \n\n\n\nThe covered process contains chlorine (CAS# 7782-50-5), which is injected into the reservoir water for disinfection; the chlorine system is designed to provide continuous chlorine residual for disinfection. Chlorine storage and supply (chlorine feed system) are located within a dedicated building designed to seal and contain a chlorine release. The chlorine disinfection system is supplied by a one-ton chlorine container located within a containment vessel in the chlorine building. \n\n\n\nThe chlorine building contains up to 5,200 pounds of chlorine (containers in storage and in-use). The chlorine feed system consists of 1 one-ton container (tonner) \"on-line\" and 1 tonner in storage. The tonner is equipped with a motorized control valve and the chlorine feed system can be shut down from outside of the chlorine building in an emergency. The facility also has 150-pound chlorine cylinders in storage.\n\n\n\nThe chlorine building is an enclosed building designed to contain a worst-case chlorine gas release and the building is connected to an emergency scrubber that is automatically activated upon chlorine gas leak detection (or manually operated). The emergency scrubber capacity is 1 ton.  Chlorine gas detection systems within the building activate local alarm strobes and horns, and activate the emergency scrubber for the chlorine building. The emergency scrubber and ventilation system will shut off upon detection of chlorine at the scrubber discharge at 5.0 ppm.  The ch"

      "SummaryText": "lorine building is a secured zone within a secured site, and all access doors to the chlorine building are secured with access controls. A two-person rule applies for entry into the chlorine building.\n\n\n\nThe owner/operator of the facility has implemented an Integrated Contingency Plan (ICP) to prevent an accidental release and mitigate the consequences of a chlorine release if it were to occur. The ICP follows the fourteen elements of the PSM standard and the RMP elements. The process hazard analysis (PHA) of the covered process was revalidated in January 2019 and the PSM/RMP program was most recently audited in April 2017; both of these activities were led by a qualified third-party PSM consultant and recommendations resulting from those activities are actively managed by the facility with oversight from the Water Services Division Environmental Services Department.\n\n\n\nThe facility is considered a normally unoccupied remote facility. System alarms are received at a remote facility through a Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) control system. \n\n\n\nThe owner/operator of the facility has implemented an Emergency Response Plan, and personnel who respond to chlorine emergencies are trained accordingly; regular chlorine drills are conducted at the facility.  In the event of a chlorine emergency, an alarm on the chlorine gas detection system will automatically notify and dispatch the Fire Department. \n\n"
