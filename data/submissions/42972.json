We produce products for several diverse industries including paper manufacturing, pigment mining, textile sizing, paint manufacturing, water treatment and agricultural pest control. \n\nThe Washougal, Washington facility manufactures products for paper, water treatment and agricultural markets. The portion of the plant covered by Risk Management, makes two dithiocarbamate products that are sold to other chemical companies for use in agricultural pest control and for use in wastewater treatment.  The Washougal facility is 15 years old, and  the Organics Unit producing these dithiocarbamates is about 8 years old. \n\nThe Organics Unit uses three raw materials that are covered under Risk Management:  carbon disulfide, methylamine and dimethylamine. EPA lists carbon disulfide as a Toxic; the two anhydrous amines are listed as flammables. \n\nCarbon disulfide:\n\tClear, colorless liquid with a garlic-like odor\n\tFlammable in liquid and vapor form\n\tDirect contact to skin and eyes will cause irritation. \n\tLiquid contact to eyes can result in severe pain. \n\tInhalation of fumes can cause nausea, vomiting and headaches.\n\tProlonged exposure to high concentrations may be fatal\n\nMethylamine\n\tClear, colorless, flammable gas with a fishy odor. \n\tSlightly heavier than air\n\tContact with the eyes can result in severe pain and irritation. \n\tContact with the skin can cause burns or blistering.\n\tInhalation of fumes can cause nausea, vomiting and headaches.\n\tProlonged exposure to high concentrations may be fatal\n\nDimethylamine\n\tClear, colorless, flammable gas with a fishy or ammonia odor\n\tSlightly heavier than air\n\tExposure can be irritating to the eyes and throat\n\tLiquid contact with the eyes can result in severe pain and corneal injury. \n\tContact with th"

At the Washougal plant, safety is each employees responsibility.  Safety is stressed ahead of production and employees are encouraged to take the extra steps and time necessary to ensure safe production and maintenance activities.  The main thrust of the safety program at washougal is the accident prevention program.  The accident prevention program addresses issues such as employee training, personnel protective equipment, plant safety audits, and life-critical procedures.  The plant has a safety committee made up of a cross-section of employees.  The safety committee meets monthly to address immediate safety concerns as well as to assess the overall safety program.  Each employee work crew conducts a weekly safety meeting.  Each employee participates in Behaviorial Based Safety, which is stressed throughout the company as well as Washougal.  \n\nThe Washougal plant works closely with South West Clean Air Agency (SWCAA) to minimize emmissions and ensure protection of the environment.  The Organics plant is a closed system.  All process vents are scrubbed at over 99% efficiency with recovered chemicals reused in the process.  The process is leak-checked quarterly.  The scrubber efficiencies are checked every five years. \n\n\nAccident history:\n\nThe washougal plant has not experienced any accidents in the last 5 years.\n\n\nAccident Prevention Program:\n\nThe following lines of defense are in place at the Washougal Plant and are designed to prevent accidents, to safeguard employees, the community and environment.  The site follows PSM regulations in all areas of the plant.\n\nProcess Design:  Best engineering practices are used to assure systems operate as intended.  Materials of constr"

The following outlines the standard response to an incident on site:\n   \n   O  Preliminary assessment.\n   O  Alarm to shelter in place or evacuate to rally point is announced.\n   O  Incident reported to 911\n   O  Headcount and begin recordkeeping\n   O  Establish command center and assign support responsibilities\n   O  Neighbor Notifications (if needed)\n   O  Detailed assessment and response to incident.

Severala drills are conducted annually.  Contract responders are the main responders for major incidents.  Training is extended to include these local fire and emergency services groups. Through these training exercises, we are developing partnerships. These partnerships allow us to gain confidence in each other's knowledge and abilities to deal appropriately with incidents. These shared roles in incident response are intended to assure the public, and ourselves, that we can and will react properly and promptly.
