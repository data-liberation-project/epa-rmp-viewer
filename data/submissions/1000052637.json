(ONEOK) is committed to managing all operations in a manner that protects the environment and the health and safety of employees, customers, contractors and the public while fully complying with applicable laws and regulations.  ONEOK's management philosophy goals are achieved through the implementation of the Environmental Health and Safety Management Systems, by the personal commitments of employees and contractors, and by open communication with employees, customers, neighbors, and regulators. \n\n\n\nThis submission to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency updates the Mont Belvieu NGL Fractionation Facility Risk Management Program (RMP) to include the underground storage facility adjacent to the fractionation complex.  This update was determined to be necessary after a regulatory review and analysis of the operational relationship between the storage facility and the fractionators.  The purpose of this Risk Management Plan is to provide information about operations at the facility, programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, emergency response plans in the event of an accidental release, the five-year accident history of the facility, and planned changes to improve safety at the facility.  \n\n\n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nThe Mont Belvieu Fractionation Facility receives raw feed via piping from the co-located ONEOK underground storage facility.  The raw feed is then fractionated into five purity products. These products are ethane, propane, isobutane, normal butane and natural gasoline.  The E/P Splitter receives EP Mix and splits it into purity ethane and propane.  The products are returned to the storage facility via plant piping and stored until they are delivered via pipeline to third party customers.  Ethane, propane, isobutane and normal buta"

      "SummaryText": "ne as well as three flammable mixtures, natural gasoline, raw feed, and, EP Mix, are the flammable substances regulated under the Risk Management Program (RMP) that are present at the fractionation facility.  In addition to these substances, ethylene is also stored at the underground storage facility and is now included in the threshold quantities reported in this RMP.  All threshold quantities reported in the RMP are now updated to include the amounts of each of these regulated substances stored at the underground storage facility.  No toxic chemicals are stored at the facility in amounts greater than threshold quantity.  The facility is classified as Program Level 3 under the regulation. \n\n\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs in place at the facility are part of the high standards striven for by ONEOK.  These high standards include:\n\n-    Operating in compliance with required environmental permits and regulations.\n\n-    Operating and maintaining assets in such a manner that unintentional releases are minimized.\n\n-    Operating and maintaining assets in such a manner that the small releases associated with normal operation and maintenance will be minimized to the extent possible.\n\n-    Correcting non-compliance found by regular audits of the facility.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevention Program\n\n\n\nThe facility will operate under the strict guidelines of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Program.  Ongoing analysis of the potential hazards of the process, detailed training of employees and emphasis on safety will help to avoid any serious accidents in the future.  Part of this program also involves identifying and taking steps to avoid potential accidental chemical releases.  A few examples of the prevention features implemented at this facility include:\n\n\n\n-    Minimized the possibility that combustion of hydrocarbon vapors would be interrupted by ha"

The Director for Plant Operations, or his designee, is responsible for coordinating the emergency actions.  A specific Emergency Response Plan for the facility is in place and that plan has been communicated to local officials.  The Emergency Response Program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nCompliance with the RMP Prevention Program, coupled with the Environmental Health and Safety Management Systems, forms the framework for continuous safety improvement.
