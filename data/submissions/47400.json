It is also the policy of the Collier County Water Department to work with surrounding community and local emergency response agencies, and promote a spirit of cooperation and teamwork to provide an effective contingency plan in the event that a process incident occurs at the North County Regional Water Treatment Plant (NCRWTP).    The first responder to any incident at the NCRWTP is the Golden Gate Fire Department (GGFD).  The GGFD works in close relation with the NCRWTP being involved in annual reviews of the RMP documentation and frequent training sessions on site for the GGFD personnel.\n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled:\n\nThe primary activity at the NCRWTP is a municipal water treatment plant.  Chlorine is the only 40 CFR 68 regulated substance at plant.  Chlorine is used primarily as a disinfectant.  The maximum amount of chlorine on site at this facility is 24 tons.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps:\n\nCollier County is in compliance with 40 CFR 68. The County has conducted a comprehensive review of the chlorine system, as well as, administrative, technical, operating, and maintenance procedures.  In addition, all program elements have been reviewed by the County?s internal safety auditors (Risk Management Department) and found to be in compliance.\n\n\n\nThe County has both passive mitigation, an enclosed building and active mitigation, an emergency scrubber, to minimize the consequences of an accidental release.  The Risk Management Program addresses actions to minimize the lik"

The ERP for the NCRWTP specifically is attached to the RMP document as Attachment A to Chapter 9.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\nAs part of the Process Hazard Analysis that was conducted in 1999 a number of safety improvements were contemplated, the following provides a list of the items identified and steps taken to resolve each item:\n\n\n\nTo be completed by August 1999\n\nTo minimize the potential for product delivery trucks from damaging the buildings, equipment and roadway, improvements to the roadway must be made.  This work is current in progress.\n\nOutcome:  Bumpers were installed in December of 1999 and the loading area was widened in early 2000.  This issue is closed.\n\n\n\nChlorine containers must be rotated in the trunnions to properly align the valves prior to connection.  The wrench currently used is not adequate and procurement of this specialized wrench is recommended.\n\nOutcome:  Wrench was obtained in 1999 and one is kept on hand at all times. This issue is closed.\n\n\n\nThe wrenches used to connect/disconnect chlorine containers are the proper Chlorine Institute approved wrenches; however, they are old and worn.  Replacement wrenches should be purchased, and spare wrenches kept in stock.\n\nOutcome:  Wrenches were obtained in August of 1999 and spares are on the shelf as of this review.  This issue is closed.\n\n\n\nRequest Standard Operating Procedures for truck unloading and certification that the chlorine meets AWWA specifications from the chlorine supplier.  Inform plan pers"

Vendor requested to provide updates at minimum annually.  The Purchasing Department has been provided additional requirements in the bid specifications in order to ensure compliance with AWWA specifications. This issue is closed.\n\n\n\nDue to the chemical nature of chlorine, any work performed in the chlorine areas that involves heat or sparks should be closely monitored.  Hot work permitting should be implemented.\n\nOutcome:  Hot Work Permits have been initiated. This form is part of the Risk Management Plan.  Refresher training is conducted periodically regarding this policy. This issue is closed.\n\n\n\nThere is a danger that visitors or other untrained individuals may enter chlorine areas, which is a potential risk.  Signs should be posted in the chlorine storage areas to designate it as a restricted area.\n\nOutcome:  Signage has been updated and improved to state only authorized personnel in this area and additional cameras have been put in the area to monitor for unauthorized personnel in the area.  All work was completed in 2004. This issue is closed.\n\n\n\nProper use and maintenance of respirators is critical. A program for employees that wear respirators should include medical exams, fit testing and training.  Purchase spare parts for respirators.\n\nOutcome:  This is an on-going item.  As new team members are hired the Human Resources Department as part of the initial fitness for duty physical incorporates the respirator physicals.  After that annual check-ups are completed by the Occupational Nurse on staff with Collier County. Spare parts are kept on hand for all respirators both onsite and in the Department?s central warehouse. This issue is closed.\n\n\n\nDevelop an emergency evacuation plan for plant personnel.

The Plan is provided to new team members as part of their new hire orientation. This issue is closed.\n\n\n\nThe monorail used to move chlorine containers has a potential of sticking in place.  The monorail should be lubricated with material that is compatible with chlorine use. \n\nOutcome:  The Water Department has a semi-annual maintenance contract with an outside vendor that requires this to be completed.  A report is provided to the Department and kept on file documenting that it has been completed. This issue is closed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo be completed by October 1999\n\nThere is a potential danger that the door to the building could shut while off-loading chlorine containers.  This could lead to dropping the container, causing possible injury to the employee, or otherwise compromising the integrity of the container. A door security system should be installed.\n\nOutcome: The door security should be installed and the potential for the door to close has been eliminated.  The work was completed in 2005. This issue is closed.\n\n\n\nTo be completed by November 1999\n\nThe existing vacuum regulators are old and require constant maintenance.  It is recommended that the regulators at this facility be replaced by November 1999 or earlier.\n\nOutcome:  The recommended work was completed in 1999 and as noted above a semi-annual contract is in place to ensure proper inspection and maintenance of the equipment is an ongoing effort. This issue is closed.\n\n\n\nA preventative maintenance and replacement plan should be developed and implemented for the vacuum regulators. Plugs should be utilized to prevent moisture and dirt from entering the vacuum regulators when they are stored or immediately after servicing.\n\nOutcome:  The recommended preventative maintenance plan has been implemented since 1999 and continues.

This issue is closed.\n\n\n\nAn annual preventative maintenance program for the entire chlorine system should be prepared and implemented. The preventative maintenance program should include the following equipment:  Valves on the solution line; injector check valve; pressure gauges on water or chlorine solution line; flexible tubing from chlorine container to header; pvc piping and replace all gaskets and washers when servicing chlorinator.\n\nOutcome:  The recommended preventative maintenance plan has been implemented since 1999 and continues.  There is a semi-annual maintenance contract for the work to be completed; in addition an automated maintenance software package is utilized to track the necessary replacements ? AllMax. This issue is closed.\n\n\n\nThere are currently many false alarms regarding chlorine releases, which lead to a tendency to disregard the alarms as likely to be false. An evaluation of the system and an established plan should be implemented by November 1999.\n\nOutcome:  The system has been evaluated and the facility?s process software was upgraded in 2005 which eliminated this problem.  This issue is closed.  \n\n\n\n\n\nThe chlorine detectors and alarm system should be placed on an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) to eliminate false alarms due to power outages.\n\nOutcome:  The chlorine detectors and alarm system are on the facility uninterruptible power supply (UPS).

Additionally, there is an automated maintenance tracking system and this is an item plugged into that system.  This issue is closed.\n\n\n\nTo be completed by January 2000\n\nHigh speed vertical lifting of chlorine containers is not part of standard operations, however, it is available and there is a risk of accidental use. The high speed vertical setting on the monorail mounted hoist should be disconnected, if possible.\n\nOutcome:  This recommendation was discussed with the monorail manufacture who states that there is no hazard, as the high speed setting factors in the chlorine component and therefore does not move at rate to cause a problem.  Further the disconnecting of this one component of the system was not recommended and would have voided any warranty on the monorail system. This issue is closed.\n\n\n\nThere is a potential of a caustic gas release in an unsafe manner from the exhaust stack. This is due to an inadequate rain cap.  The rain cap should be modified or replaced.\n\nOutcome: The rain cap has been reviewed by the Public Utilities Engineering Department, plant personnel, the equipment manufacturer and supplier. The existing original equipment is appropriate for this application. This issue is closed. \n\n\n\nThe current location of the header vacuum gauge and valves is a trip hazard. The header should be moved to a safer location to avoid potential falls, which could result in leakage at a valve.  \n\nOutcome:  Potential modifications are being reviewed. This issue remains open.\n\n\n\nComplete modifications of the chlorine system alarms to minimize false alarms.\n\nOutcome:  The software upgrade completed in 2005 resulted in the resolution of this matter.

No further modifications were needed to be performed.  This issue is closed.\n\n\n\nSeveral non-chlorine lines in the chlorine room are painted the same color as the chlorine lines. Labeling and piping colors should be modified to be consistent with County or other recognized standards.\n\nOutcome:  All piping within the area was repainted in 2004 to come into compliance with AWWA Standards.   This issue is closed.\n\n\n\nThere is a potential for a motorized switch over system to fail during transfer of chlorine containers in the scales. The motorized switch over system should be replaced with a pressure operated system switch over system or the system should be manually operated.\n\nOutcome:  In 2000, a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) was formulated to address this issue.  The SOP is now part of the updated Risk Management Plan.  This issue is closed.\n\n\n\nTo be completed by October 2000\n\nThe monorail system used to off-load chlorine containers requires that the containers eventually be rolled to their destination. The monorail system should be modified to allow off-loading of chlorine containers without rolling or implement a system that does not require rolling.\n\nOutcome: The vendor who now supplies chlorine utilizes a cherry-picker to off load the cylinders thus this issues does not come into play.

The alarm should initiate start of the scrubber and notify plant personnel after the event. \n\nOutcome:  A review of the system in 2001, found the existing system was constructed in accordance with approved plans. Periodic regulatory agency inspections indicate the system is operating as intended. This issue is closed.\n\n\n\nContinued effort to reduce false alarms should include the elimination of gas releases to the atmosphere at the chlorine application point below the degasifers, which potentially trip the alarm system.\n\nOutcome:  To date, facility efforts to reduce false alarms have been successful. Some minor venting of gas at the clear well application point is unavoidable.  This issue is closed.\n\n\n\nInstall cable securing system for all ton containers. Securing the containers will provide additional anchoring during hurricane or other severe weather events.\n\nOutcome:  In 2004, additional anchoring has been installed and is utilized in preparation for major weather events.
