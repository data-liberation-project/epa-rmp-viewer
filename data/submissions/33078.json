GPRI provides response training to its personnel, designates an emergency response coordinator to oversee response activities, and coordinates response efforts with the local fire department.

(GPRI), a wholly owned subsidiary of Georgia-Pacific Corporation, owns and operates a formaldehyde manufacturing facility in Healing Springs, NC.  The facility is located on NC Highway 8.  The facility consists of a plant that manufactures formaldehyde, which was constructed in 1971. Overall, the facility employs 12 full-time employees.\n\nGPRI is committed to operating the Healing Springs, North Carolina plant in a manner that is safe for its workers, the public, and the environment.  As part of this commitment, GPRI  has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility.  One component of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the Healing Springs Plant and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency\u00bfs (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMP Plan) describing the risk management program at the Healing Springs Plant. This document is intended to satisfy the RMP Plan requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at the Healing Springs Plant.\n\nThe risk management program at the Healing Springs Plant consists of the following three elements:\n\n\u00b7 a hazard assessment to help understand (a) the potential offsite consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and (b) accidents that have occurred during the last five years associated with the use of substances regulated by the RMP rule (regulated substances).\n \n\u00b7 a prevention program to help maintain and safely operate the processes containing more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance (covered processes).\n \n\u00b7 an emergency response program to help respond to accidental releases of regulated substances from covered processes\n\nInformation furth"

In fact, the Healing Springs Plant has a comprehensive safety program in place establishing many levels of safeguards against release of a hazardous substance and injuries and damage from a release of a hazardous substance.\n\nGPRI limits the use of hazardous substances.  Before using a hazardous substance at the Healing Springs Plant, less hazardous alternatives are considered. When a hazardous substance is used at the Healing Springs Plant, GPRI considers the potential for this substance to adversely affect plant workers, the public, and the environment and takes steps to prevent any such effects.\n\nGPRI prevents releases of the hazardous substances used at the facility.  When a hazardous substance is used at the Healing Springs Plant, the equipment is carefully designed, built and operated to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release. Industry and government standards are closely adhered to in the design, construction, and operation of the equipment. \n\nGPRI limits damage from a release, if such a release occurs.  GPRI trains its workers to respond to an accidental release, reducing the consequences of a release if it occurs.  In addition, GPRI works with the Healing Springs fire department and with the local emergency planning committee (LEPC) to help prevent injuries and/or environmental damage if a release does occur.\n\nThe safety program at the Healing Springs Plant consists of a number of elements, only some of which are required by the RMP rule. This RMP Plan is primarily intended to describe those parts of the safety program at the Healing Springs Plant that are required by the RMP rule.\n\n1.1 Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nGPRI is committed"

The operating procedures are used both to help in operating the plant\u00bfs processes and as a training guide.\n\n1.4.1.4 Training\nThe Healing Springs Plant trains its workers to safely and effectively perform their assigned tasks.  The training program includes both initial and refresher training that covers (1) a general overview of the process, (2) the properties and hazards of the substances in the process, and (3) a detailed review of the process operating procedures and safe work practices.  Oral reviews and written tests are used to verify that an employee understands the training material before the employee can resume work in the process.

The results of the audit are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate enhancements to the prevention program are implemented.\n\n1.4.1.9 Incident Investigation\nThe Healing Springs Plant investigates all incidents that could reasonably have resulted in a serious injury to personnel, the public, or the environment so that similar accidents can be prevented in the future.  The plant trains employees to identify and report any incident requiring investigation.  An investigation team is assembled, and the investigation is initiated within 48 hours of the incident.
