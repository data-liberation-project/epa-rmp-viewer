It is necessary to observe certain safety precautions to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and state rules and regulations.  Safety depends on the manner in which we handle these substances, the safety devices inherent in the design of the facility, the safe handling procedures that we use, and the training of our personnel.\n\nWe at Martin are strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, we are completely coordinated with Mutual Aid Mont Belvieu which provides highly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of a release. \n\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Specific Prevention Steps\n\nMartin complies with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)?s Process Safety Management (PSM) rules, EPA?s Chemical Accident Prevention Risk Management Plan (RMP) rules, and with all applicable state codes and regulations.  Our facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements under 40 CFR 68.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary sour"

The methodology used to carry out these analyses is a ?What if? checklist.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at least once every five years.  Any findings related to the hazard review are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our processes, Martin maintains written operation procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the process.\n\nTraining\n\nMartin has a comprehensive training program to ensure employees are competent in the operations and procedures associated with the processes. \n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nMartin carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls, and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\n\nWritten procedures are in place at Martin to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures.

      "SummaryText": " personnel, or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\n\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at Martin.  The reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating, and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operations.\n\nCompliance Audit\n\nMartin conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  These audits are carried out at least every three years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nMartin promptly investigates any incident that resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of regulated substances.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All investigation reports are retained for a minimum of five years.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nIt is our belief at Martin that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Our company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.\n\nContractors\n\nOccasionally, Martin hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance or construction activities.  We have a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related to the contractor?s work and the process.  Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release occur.\n\nFive-year Accident History\n\nThe facility has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last five years.

The emergency action plan includes appropriate mechanisms for notifying emergency responders when there is a need for response.  The facility is listed in the community emergency response plan.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
