Mark Wolverton was the interim Site Manager May 4 - June 21 and had replaced Timothy Schuster.  Within this executive summary BASF Agricultural Solutions was replaced with BASF Corporation.  No other sections have been changed.\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\r\n\r\nThe BASF Corporation Muskegon Site has release prevention and emergency response procedures in place in order to prevent and reduce the potential for releases from the Muskegon Site. Written procedures are maintained and are followed by BASF Corporation Muskegon personnel and contactors that perform work in our processes. The BASF Corporation Muskegon Emergency Response & Contingency Plan is readily available and includes the immediate and follow-up reporting to federal, state, and local authorities, including the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), the Michigan Department of Environment Quality (MDEQ), the state and local emergency planning committees (LEPC's), local fire and police departments, and other interested parties.\r\n \r\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\r\n\r\nThe BASF Corporation Muskegon Site is located 2 miles north of Muskegon, MI.

Using this approach, the process design, process technology, operational and maintenance activities and procedures, non-routine activities and procedures, emergency preparedness plans and procedures, training programs, and other elements which impact the process are all considered in the evaluation. The various lines of defense that have been incorporated into the design and operation of the unit process to prevent or mitigate the release of hazardous chemicals are evaluated and strengthened as needed to assure their effectiveness at each level. Ultimately, the major objective of process safety management of hazardous chemicals is to prevent unwanted releases of hazardous chemicals which could expose our employees and others to serious hazards.  Elements in the accident prevention program include programs such as: Management of Change, Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) Mechanical Integrity, Incident Investigation, Compliance Audits and Permits to Work for BASF employees and contractors.  A number of processes at our facility are subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29CFR 1910.119. The facility is also subject to the Spill Prevention, Control, and Countermeasure Plan(SPCC) under 40 CFR 112, the RCRA Preparedness and Prevention regulations and Contingency Plan and Emergency Procedures under Subpart C and D of 40 CFR 264, and EPCRA Section 302 notification requirements. In addition, the facility is also subject to the Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standard (CFATS) under 6 CFR 27.\r\n\r\nIn regard to specific chemicals and processes regulated under RMP, the processes subject to the RMP regulation are also subject to OSHA process safety management (PSM) regulation.  OSHA's PSM regulation is intended to prevent potential releases inside the plant and the RMP program is meant to help control or prevent releases which may affect off-site human health or the environment.\r\n\r\nAccidental releases f"

The processes are periodically evaluated to assess the risk of the operations by current standards and to make improvements where necessary. \r\n\r\nIn addition to skilled operators, the processes are controlled by computerized control systems which monitor and record conditions within the processes and make adjustments accordingly.  In addition to the control systems, several of the processes are equipped with redundant computer safety systems which act to correct or shutdown the processes if certain parameters are exceeded and other process are equipped with direct shutdown controls to achieve similar protection.  All of the processes covered by RMP utilize scrubbers to reduce emissions from the process to minimize releases to the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nMaintenance of equipment containing hazardous substances is also a key element in preventing accidental releases. In addition, any changes made to the processes are carefully reviewed prior to implementation to ensure that safety and environmental risks are recognized and addressed.  These changes are managed under the site's Management of Change procedure (MOC).  Finally, while many steps have been taken to prevent accidental releases, in the event of a release, it is investigated to determine the root causes and a corrective action plan is developed and implemented to prevent re-occurrence.\r\n\r\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nThe BASF Corporation Muskegon Site has zero accidental releases from RMP covered processes (Glufosinate Ammonium - anhydrous ammonia) that meet the RMP reporting criteria during the last five years. \r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe BASF Corporation Muskegon site relies on local first responders (i.e.: local fire department and HazMat Team) for assistance.

The site has a site-wide notification system in place in the event of an emergency.\r\n\r\nCHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nThere are operating and mechanical changes that continuously occur to improve site.  BASF Corporation Muskegon Site uses a Task, Incident Management, and Action Plan (TIMA) corrective action database to document incidents and follow-up actions. A SAP Maintenance PM program is used to document and track maintenance on equipment in all processes.  The process to determine applicability to EPA's RMP and OSHA's PSM rules has been improved to ensure all requirements are met.  The BASF Muskegon site is regulated under CFATS and is in full compliance with security plan submittal requirements. Security upgrades have been made in accordance with the Site Security Plan and additional upgrades are constantly being evaluated. The site has replaced the site wide fire alarm system in recent years; this alarm system provides highly-reliable, front-line notification in the event of fire, spill, or other emergencies. There are several new upgrades to different areas with state of the art protection.  A facility siting study to account for the impacts of toxic releases and explosion overpressure on structures has been completed. Additional high integrity safeguards using enhanced inerting and grounding systems are installed and are constantly being evaluated to prevent flammable vapor explosions. Safety Instrumented Systems (SIS) have been installed, ensuring very high reliability process control system safeguards. Finally, the site has completed a software replacement and upgrade of the Distributed Control System (DCS) used in the RMP related production plants.\r\n\r\nThe site team has developed a standard 5-year PHA cycle to better organize and manage the complexity of the process and its associated risks.
