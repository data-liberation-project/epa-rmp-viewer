The Facility Policy\n\n\n\nThe owners, management, and employees of Brandt Agronomic Services LLC are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Raymond Fire Dept., Montgomery County LEPC or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n\n\n2.    Stationary Sources and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers, farm chemicals and related agricultural products, for sale to the farmer.\n\n\n\nThe maximum quantity of Anhydrous Ammonia stored would be 30000 gallons (or 140196 lbs.) in our fixed storage tank and our nurse tanks stored on site plus the product stored in our nurse tanks\n\n3.    The Worst-Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario.\n\n\n\nWorse-Case:  \n\n\n\nAlternative Case:  \n\n\n\n4.    The Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nThis facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National Standards, Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".\n\n\n\n5.    The Five-year Accident History\n\n\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of Anhydrous Ammonia (from our fixed sources) in the past five years that: have caused deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at this facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damages. \n\n\n\n\n\n6.    The Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\nThis facility has a current Emergency Action Plan ( in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38) in place "

We train our staff on the elements found in our emergency action plan and have invited the fire department to visit our facility in order to provide them with a working knowledge of our plant's layout and our storage facility. This facility has provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\n\n\n7.    Planned Changes to Improve Safety.\n\n\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time. Additional training for maintenance staff, the addition of barriers and implementation of new regulations from IDOA will improve the safety at this facility. We have added new riser, pump, ESV's and remote shut-off "
