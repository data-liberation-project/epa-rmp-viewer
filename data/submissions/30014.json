This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the Chlorine process at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of chlorine. If, inforeseeably, such a release does occur, we are completely coordinated with the Rock Island Fire Department, which provides trained response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n2.The Stationary Source and Regulated Substance Handled.\nWe have 1 regulated substanceat our facility which is CHLORINE.  The maximum inventory of chlorine is 14,000 lbs.\n3. The Worst Case Scenario and Alternative Release Scenario including administrative controls and mitigation measures.\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the look-up tables and equations provided by the EPA in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance. The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios:\n\nToxic Worst Case Analysis-\n    The Worst case scenario involves a catastrophic release of chlorine from a cylinder broken or damaged outside the containment building while unloading. This scenario involves the release of 2000 lbs ( 1 cylinder ) of chlorine in a gaseous form over 10 minutes. The release rate ( lbs/min) is calculated to be 200. A distance to endpoint of 5.4 miles is obtained, which affects a residential population of 159,814 within this distance.\n\nToxic Alternative Case Analysis-\n    The Alternative Case scenario involves the catastrophic release of chlorine form a cylinder while inside the containment building due to a damaged pipe or fitting. This scenario involves the release of 2000 lbs ( 1 cylinder) of chl"

The General Accidental Release Prevention Program\n   Our facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68. A number of processes at out facility are subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29CFR1910.119. Our facility is also subjext to EPCRA Section 302 notification requrements.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n   The Rock Island Water Treatment Plant maintains a record of safety information\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts a \"what-if\" analysis by a team familiar with the process, every 5 years. Any findings are implemented and Operating Procedures are modified as needed.\nOpearting Procedures\n   Our facility maintains detailed operating procedures.The information is periodically reviewed and is readily accessible to plant personnel. \nTraining\n   The Rock Island Water Plant has a comprehensive training program in place. New employees receive basic classroom traing followed by on-the-job training. Refresher training is provide at least every 3 years.\nMechanical Integrity\n   The Water Treatment Plant has a highly documented Preventive Maintenance program. Equipment deficiencies are indentified and corrected in a safe and timely manner. \nManagement of Change\n   Written procedures are in place at the Rock Island Water Treatment Plant to manage change in process chemicals. Technology, equipment, and procedures.\nPre Start-up Reviews-\n   Pre Start-up safety reviews related to new processes and /or modifications are conducted as needed.\nCompliance Audits\n   Plant personnel conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.

Employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning preventions issues and to make recommendations for improvements.\nContractors\n   When contractors are hired, pre contruction meetings are conducted to discuss issues such as safety. Contractors are informed of emergency response procedures for chlorine.\n5. 5 Year Accident History\n   there have been no accidental releases of chlorine during the past 5 year period.\n6. Emergency Response Plan\n   Facility is included in the written Community ER Plan. The local agency coordinating ER plan is the Rock Island Fire Department ( 309-732-2800).\n7.
