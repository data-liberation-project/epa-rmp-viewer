      "SummaryText": "H. Krevit & Co., Inc is a manufacturer of sodium hypochlorite, commonly known as chlorine bleach.  The hazard of this process is that we purchase and use chlorine in 90 ton railcars.  Chlorine has been used industrially for over 150 years, and the railcar equipment used for transport and storage has been continually improved since 1909.  Our policy is to follow all Federal and State safety requirements, and to go above and beyond by participating with Connecticut OSHA's voluntary inspections process, and observing Chlorine Institute safe operating standards.   We have active mitigation systems in place, redenundant shut-offs, site security, and our equipment is maintained and replaced as necessary to keep it in good operating condition.  Training in safety, emergency shut-down, and emergency response procedures are conducted regularly.  We have the equipment and training to shutdown manually or automatically, even during a release.  Our process was designed and installed by a fabricator that has installed similar systems at over 100 locations worldwide.  Information from \"near-misses\" at these facilities is shared among the facilities for continuous process improvement, coordinated through the fabricator.  This same fabricator sells us parts and periodically performs contract maintenance.  In summary, the process is well understood, with an excellent safety history."
