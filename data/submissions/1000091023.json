In addition to other state and local codes applicable to our facility and process. We have undertaken this process to deal with the risks involved with the storage, handling, and use of Anhydrous Ammonia in our facility.\n\n\n\nOur goal is to promote overall worker, public, and plant safety. Black Gold Farms facility is located at 2801 S Marsh Ave. Yorktown, IN. Black Gold Farms is a production facility that produces potato seedlings for potato farmers.  The facility includes but is not limited to shipping and receiving docks, raw materials warehousing, finished goods refrigerated storage, miscellaneous utilities, an ammonia refrigeration system that is in the compressor room. \n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nBlack Gold Farms is in the process of implementing numerous policies and procedures to enable our facility to prevent the occurrence and minimize the consequences of significant releases of Anhydrous Ammonia as well as other hazardous substances, fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents. Overall, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, and illnesses and avoid property damage.  Our safety programs prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices, which govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment. These rules are communicated to and accepted by all employees at our facility.\n\nBlack Gold Farms Process Safety Management / Risk Management Program has been developed and implemented and is continuously reviewed and updated for effectiveness.
