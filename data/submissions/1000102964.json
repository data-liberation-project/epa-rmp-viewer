The EAP procedures apply to all personnel working at the Tungsten facility or monitoring the facility from the McGinness Hills central control room. The EAP has been submitted to the local fire department and LEPC for review and their concurrence when changes are made to the plan. Annual meetings are planned to coordinate potential response activities by Ormat personnel and the local fire department. \n\nImplementation, Control and Compliance: The Plant Manager has overall responsibility for the development and implementation of the Emergency Action Plan. The Emergency Action Plan is reviewed annually to verify regulatory compliance and accuracy with both OSHA Regulations on Emergency Plans 29CFR1910.38 and CAPP's Emergency Response Programs, NAC 459.9544. The Emergency Response Program is also periodically reviewed and updated and employees notified of any changes in conformance with 40 CFR 68.95. The EAP may also be reviewed, as part of any Incident Investigations or when deemed required during Management of Change. Current copies of the Emergency Action Plan will be located in the Tungsten Control Building and in the McGinness Hills Control Room.\n\nEvacuation of Personnel: In the event of an emergency determined to be butane system-related and\nevacuation is deemed necessary, the control room operator or other designated personnel will sound the\nplant evacuation alarm.\n\nFirst Aid: All personnel have been trained in adult CPR and basic first aid procedures.\n\nControl Room Operator: Upon notification from the site that an emergency has occurred, the Control Room Operator verifies that appropriate response activities have been initiated and emergency response teams have been called. The Control Room Operator assumes initial communications with site personnel during emergency situations until relieved"

Additionally, each pressure relief valve is installed immediately above a rupture disk designed to fail at the relief pressure of its corresponding relief valve. Individual relief valve locations are equipped with telltale gauges in between the relief valve and its rupture disk to allow easy identification of leaking or blown rupture disks. \n\nVentilation System Design: All components of the n-butane transfer and storage systems and the OEC units are located outdoors.\n\nSafety Systems: Beyond the pressure relief systems, the OEC units have extensive fire protection, gas and flame detection, and alarm systems.  These protective systems, in conjunction with the administrative control system, ensure the focus is upon fire prevention.\n\nThe fire detection systems include gas monitors which continuously monitor the area surrounding the OECs, and multi-spectrum infrared flame detectors throughout the plant. The facility has a fire water system installed in a continuous loop around the generating units and within reach of the n-butane storage tanks and major process equipment. The fire water systems consist of fire monitor/hydrant units which are supplied from a single diesel-driven fire pump that draws from a 285,000 gallon fire water tank (nominal capacity).  Operators are trained in the proper use of the installed fire protection equipment, and the training information is appropriately documented by the facility operator.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nA Process Hazardous Analysis (PHA) including Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) study, an external events\nanalysis, and a human factors analysis has been performed for each process.  The recommendations from each PHA were integrated into the facility and facility operations. Each PHA will be updated and revalidated at least every 5 years to ensure the study is consistent for the life of the butane processes.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\nThe Tungsten facility is new and has no accident his"

Refresher training for all personnel shall be conducted annually at a minimum.\n\nSafety Training: Some equipment at the Tungsten facility poses potential fire, explosion, and electrical hazards that could cause serious personal injuries and costly property damage if safety procedures are not followed correctly. Safety training, conducted monthly and required of all employees, identifies the different hazards to be found on the sites. These subjects include Emergency Action Plan (EAP), motive fluid hazards, fire prevention and hot work, lock out and tag out procedures, hazard communication, confined space, hearing conservation, personal protective equipment, accident, injury and incident reporting. Safety training is supplemented by the use of the Standard Safety Procedures.\n\nOEC Units: The OEC units are controlled and monitored by their own dedicated Programmable Logic\nController (PLC). The PLC receives all discrete (logic) and analog signals from the input devices (e.g. switches and measuring sensors), processes the signals according to pre-loaded Ormat software, and then outputs logic and analog command signals to local and field devices. All parameters needed for proper operation of the OEC units, such as pressure, temperature, voltage, current, power, speed, etc. are measured by the proper measuring instruments. Deviation from the operating parameters will immediately be detected by the PLC and the PLC will initiate correction or automatic shutdown of the related OEC unit. Under normal circumstances, no releases or other dangerous situations are expected to result from these automatic actions. Appropriate manual override is provided.\n\nRelief system design: Relief valves are located on the n-butane storage tanks and on the OEC vaporizers and condensers. Each pressure"

These safe work practices apply to both employees and contractors.\n\nMaintenance Procedures: A Mechanical Integrity Program (MIP) has been initiated at the Tungsten\nfacility. The MIP adopted a maintenance concept for periodic preventative and corrective maintenance of the OEC systems. The preventative maintenance tasks include visual inspection, lubrication of rotating parts, system cleaning, replacing liquids and filters, and periodic tests to verify that the system is in proper operating condition. Preventative maintenance tasks and procedures are scheduled to be undertaken over a series of maintenance intervals.\n\nAlarm system maintenance is determined using a combination of regulatory requirements, manufacturer's recommendations, plant operating experience and best practices. The Standard Maintenance Procedures (SMP's) will identify system maintenance procedures, frequencies and recommended spare parts.\n\nTraining: Initial training for personnel is given before that employee is allowed to either handle n-butane, operate a process, or work in the facility's process area or on process equipment.  The emergency action plan is coordinated with Emergency Services Personnel and a tour of the site, gas and fire detection system operations, and familiarization with the motive fluid characteristics is provided.\n\nRefresher training is conducted on an annual basis, at a minimum, and when review of the chemicals or\nprocess reveals a need for additional training.  Initial and refresher training, associated with the Risk Management Program, is documented and maintained per the requirements of the Training Program.

During the initial startup phase, the facility is staffed full time, but will eventually be operated remotely from the McGinness Hills Geothermal Power Plant Control Room, which is central to all NVE-operated facilities.  During remote operation, three full time employees will be dedicated to provide routine field monitoring and preventative maintenance on the day shift.  Other plant staff includes management and electrical consisting of 5 people.\n\nRegulated Substance Handled\nTungsten utilizes n-butane (CAS # 106-97-8) as the motive fluid in both OEC units. In addition to the inventory present in the OEC, the facility has three n-butane storage tanks.  Each tank has a nominal capacity of 49,000 gallons each (maximum fill capacity of 44,100 gallons).  The tanks are typically operated near empty, leaving room to fully evacuate the content of the OEC during major plant maintenance activity.  \n\nThe maximum total projected amount of n-butane to be stored within the Tungsten process is 965441 pounds (reflects the inventory in the operational OECs and one storage tank containing two, full truck-loads of n-butane which is approximately 18,000 gallons).  The use of n-butane in a process in a quantity greater than 10,000 lbs. requires compliance with PSM (29CFR1910.119), RMP (40CFR68) and CAPP (Nevada Administrative Code 459.952 to 459.95528).  \n\nWorst Case Scenario: Worst case scenario assessment has been made and potential off-site consequence\nanalysis (OCA) was undertaken. However, in conformance with Office of Emergency Management guidance, the OCA for worst-case and/or alternative release scenario(s) has not been included in this Executive Summary because of security concerns.\n\nSafe Work Practices: Safe work practices have been developed and implemented to provide for the control of hazards during work activities such as lock out/tag-out, confined space entry, opening process equipment or piping, and control"
