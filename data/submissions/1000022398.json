      "SummaryText": "The Muralo Company, Inc. facility is  a 10.7 acre facility located in a partially industrialized and partially residential are of Bayonne, NJ.  The facility blends and distributes several types of paints (latex and oil-based) and paint products for sale to consumers.The facility handles vinyl acetate in the production of a vinyl acrylic copolymer that is used in the production of latex paints.  Vinyl acetate is regulated under the US Environmental Protection Agency's (USEPA) Accidental Release Prevention Program as well as the NJ Toxic Catastrophe Prevention Act (TCPA).  These regulations require the development of a Program Level 2 Risk Management Program (RMP).\n\nVinyl acetate is received in a tank truck and transferred into a double-walled underground storage tank.  Mateiral is pumped to blend tanks for preparation of the batch.  Blended material is pumped to reaction vessels for the batch process.\n\nThe facility has not experienced any significant accidents associated with handling vinyl acetate in the last 45 years.  A significant accident would be one causing some type of off-site impact or on-site injuries or significant property damage. There are no accident/incident or chemical spill last 10 + years.\n\nMuralo has developed written programs and procedures designed to ensure the safe hanlding of vinyl acetate, including written standard operating procedures, a maintenance program, process hazard reviews, operator training, incident investigation procedures, a compliance audit program, and a management system.\n\nIn addition to the administrative programs described above, Muralo has included several safety features into the facility design.  For example, the vinyl acetate storage tank is equipped with a high level alarm to warn the operators if the tank exceeds prescribed levels.   The tank is also equipped with a separate high-high level interlock which will automatically close the fill valve to stop the transfer on high level.  Similarly, blend tanks are equipped"

      "SummaryText": " with a high level shutoff switch that will automatically stop a transfer pump if the blend tank level exceeds the prescribed levels.  The reaction vessels are equipped with dual cooling water supply systems to ensure back-up supply if necessary.\n\nMuralo has an excellent relationship with the Bayonne City Fire Department in the event they are needed to respond to an emergency.  The Fire Department conducts a site visit at least once each year.  Muralo also participates in municipal and county emergency response drills on a regular basis.\n\nOn-going efforts to improve safety include annual emergency response drills and exercises, PHA revalidations as required, operator training and refrehser training, and equipment maintenance.  There have been no equipment changes affecting safety in the past ten-years or other planned changes to improve safety."
