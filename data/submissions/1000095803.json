While these incidents can cause localized areas of detectable odor, they seldom lead to a release of a reportable quantity or cause an off-site impact.\r\n\r\nThere were no releases of ammonia at the facility in the last five years (2016 - 2021) that resulted in employee injury, death, or property damage on site, or death, injury, evacuation, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage, off site.\r\n\r\nThe site has documented a number of incidental releases, all less that 5 lbs. ammonia lost, over the past five years. The site consistently uses the Incident Investigation element's templates to document these types of small releases.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\n\r\nCedar Grove Warehousing has implemented a detailed written Emergency Action Plan (EAP). The EAP is intended to address all emergencies at the facility, in addition to incidents related to a release of ammonia. The EAP includes awareness and response training for employees, coordination with the local emergency responders, and evacuation of the facility. The plan details reporting procedures for all emergencies; identifies specific key individuals, their 24-hour telephone numbers, and their responsibilities; and presents procedures for providing emergency medical treatment.\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nCedar Grove Warehousing has invested deeply in their RMP/PSM & safety programs.

The objective of the investigation is to correct deficiencies in such a way as to prevent recurrence.\r\n- Contractors that are hired to work on, or adjacent, to the refrigeration system are pre-qualified based upon their knowledge of ammonia refrigeration, understanding of applicable codes and standards, and their demonstrated ability to work safely.\r\n- Prior to the performance of any hot work (i.e., spark or flame producing operations such as welding, cutting, brazing, grinding), management must approve the work by executing a written hot work authorization permit to verify that precautions to prevent fire have been implemented.\r\n- Periodic formal walk-throughs occur to find unusual or increasing vibration, incipient leaks, or other indications of potential upsets or failures that could lead to a release.\r\n- Replacement of all SRVs is scheduled every five years.\r\n- Numerous safety components, including SRVs, safety interlocks, and remotely-activated shutoff valves, are installed on the refrigeration system.\r\n- Periodic inspection and calibration is performed on liquid level sensors, temperature and pressure instruments, switches, and shut down devices that have safety implications.\r\n- Equipment inspections are performed per IIAR-6 tasks and frequencies (Inspection, Testing, & Maintenance (ITM))for major powered equipment, including compressors, pumps and large fans, bearings, couplings, shaft seals, mountings, etc., for vibration or incipient mechani"

To help minimize the probability and severity of an ammonia release, a prevention program has been implemented based on OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard. The key components of the prevention program are summarized below:\r\n\r\n- The development, documentation, and operator availability of critical process safety information regarding the hazards of ammonia, the design basis of the system, and the equipment. This information is used to fully understand and safely operate the ammonia refrigeration system.\r\n- The development of an employee participation program. This program assures that employees who utilize the ammonia system and are most knowledgeable about it are able to easily, effectively, and regularly recommend changes or improvements to enhance safety.\r\n- The performance of a formal Process Hazard Analysis (PHA), using the What-if technique. A team with expertise in engineering, operations, maintenance, and safety, evaluated the refrigeration system in depth and developed recommendations to improve the safety and operability of the system. The PHA addressed:\r\n(1) process hazards; (2) previous incidents; (3) engineering and administrative controls applicable to the hazards; (4) the consequences of control failure; (5) facility sitting; (6) human factors; and (7) a qualitative evaluation of possible safety and health effects of control system failures.

      "SummaryText": "Cedar Grove Warehousing, Plymouth Location\r\n\r\nCedar Grove Warehousing operates a refrigerated warehouse located in Plymouth, Wisconsin. The facility uses an ammonia refrigeration system to cool rooms where food products are stored. The facility is subject to the USEPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) under the Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions of 40 CFR 68 because its refrigeration system contains more than the threshold quantity (10,000 pounds) of anhydrous ammonia (CAS Number 7664-41-7) listed in the RMP regulations.\r\n\r\nSYSTEM DESCRIPTION\r\n\r\nAnhydrous ammonia (NH3) is the oldest and most common refrigerant in general industrial use throughout the world. Anhydrous ammonia is a gas under ambient conditions but serves as a refrigerant in liquid form through pressurization. Although exposure to ammonia is irritating and potentially toxic in large doses, personnel exposure to more than a small leak is rare because ammonia operates within a closed system of vessels, piping, and equipment. In addition, ammonia has a potent and well-known odor that can be easily detected by smell at well below toxic levels.\r\n\r\nAmmonia is used at the Cedar Grove Warehousing facility in a closed-loop system that contains approximately 17,000 pounds of ammonia in various physical states (gas, liquid, and saturated vapor). Components of the system include compressors, condensers, a high-pressure receiver, recirculators, pumps, chillers, and various cooling units. The largest vessel at the facility is the high-pressure receiver that operates at approximately 135 psig and has the capacity to store the entire inventory of ammonia in the system. \r\n\r\nThe anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system is equipped with various safety components including safety relief valves (SRVs), safety interlocks, and ammonia sensors. SRVs protect the high-pressure receiver, recirculators, chillers, condensers, and compressors from over-pressurization. Safety interlocks include high and low ammonia pressure and hig"
