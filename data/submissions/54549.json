      "SummaryText": "1.0  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n1.1 ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICY SUMMARY\n\nThe United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) has established a regulatory program to prevent accidental release of certain regulated substances that may potentially affect public health and the environment.  The rule (40 CFR Part 68) requires that thousands of facilities across the United States in various industries develop a Risk Management Plan (RMP).  The RMP incorporates various required elements into a program designed to prevent accidental releases of regulated substances and establish emergency response preparedness in the event of an accidental release of such regulated substances.  RMPs must be submitted to the USEPA by the owner or operator of any facility that has a process containing more than a threshold quantity of any regulated substances that is covered under the RMP rule.  Pursuant to the RMP rule, Covanta Montgomery, Inc. has submitted this RMP for anhydrous ammonia.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is a commonly used chemical with various applications in industry and agriculture.  By volume, anhydrous ammonia is the fourth largest industrial chemical produced, over 80% of which goes to agricultural fertilizers.  Some other common uses for anhydrous ammonia include:  air pollution control system reagent, food production and processing, textile and chemical manufacturing, refrigeration (such as refrigerated warehouses), and metal treating.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is used at the Montgomery County Resource Recovery Facility (MCRRF or the Facility) exclusively as a reagent in the facility's nitrogen oxide (NOx) control system.  The NOx control system is an important part of the Facility's air pollution control equipment that reduces nitrogen oxides to within permitted limits.  Nitrogen oxides are pollutants that contribute to acid rain and photochemical smog.  Nitrogen oxide (NO) is a colorless gas produced during high temperature combustion.  In ambient air,"

      "SummaryText": "nitrogen oxide is oxidized to nitrogen dioxide (NO2).  Nitrogen dioxide reacts with water in ambient air to form nitric acid, which contributes to the formation of acid rain; and nitrogen oxides also contribute to the formation of photochemical smog by reacting with sunlight to form ozone (O3) in the atmosphere.  The Facility's NOx control system reduces nitrogen oxides by the injection of anhydrous ammonia into the furnace section of the boilers.  In the boilers, a reaction takes place between the anhydrous ammonia, nitrogen oxide, and oxygen.  The resulting products of this reaction are the major components in the air we breathe, nitrogen gas (N2), oxygen, and water.  A significant environmental benefit is achieved through the use of anyhydrous ammonia in the operation of the NOx control system.\n\nCovanta operates the MCRRF located in Dickerson, Maryland in a manner that is protective of the health and safety of Covanta employees, contractor employees, the public, and the environment.  In addition, Covanta is committed to operating the Facility in full compliance with applicable Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) requirements, federal regulatory requirements, and applicable state and/or local requirements.\n\nCovanta previously developed an OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Program for anhydrous ammonia.  The OSHA PSM rule guides employees in the preventive maintenance, safe management, and operation of processes that use regulated substances, and aims to protect employees from accidental releases of these materials onsite.  The USEPA's RMP regulation builds and expands upon the OSHA PSM program by requiring facilities to evaluate offsite impacts to public and environmental receptors, in the event of an accidental release.  Key elements of the OSHA PSM program have been incorporated into the USEPA RMP regulation.\n\nAs part of the USEPA RMP effort, Covanta updated the PSM program for anhydrous ammonia and the associated Process Hazard Analysis (PHA"
