Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies.\n\n\nThe Lincoln Electric System (LES) is a municipally-owned and operated electric utility with sole service responsibility in and around Lincoln, Nebraska   As a publicly owned utility, we operate and maintain all of the equipment in our system in a manner representing prudent utility practices and in conformance with our customer/owner's expectations. We strive for excellence in the operations of our facilities, and for full compliance with all local, state, and federal laws and regulations.\n\nMeeting environmental requirements is part of our policies and we are complying with federal Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions (40 CFR Part 68) and the Risk Management Program defined in it.  We are committed to the accidental release prevention program.  \n\nLES has a thorough detailed Emergency Response Plan designated specifically for an ammonia release for the Rokeby Station.  The plan has been reviewed with response organizations and others.  \n\n\n2. The stationery source and regulated substances handled.\n\nThe LES Rokeby Station, owned and operated by LES, provides emergency, peaking and base load electric power generation. There are two gas turbines located on the 160-acre site. A third gas turbine will be added in 2000. To augment power output at the LES Rokeby Station during high summer air temperatures, a cooling system is used to lower turbine inlet air temperatures.  The cooling system uses ammonia refrigeration to make ice that is stored in two separate concrete tanks, with capacities of 1.1 million gallons and 3 million gallons respectively. The cooling system consists of Ice System #1, which was commercial in 1991, and Ice System #2, which was commercial in 1999.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration cooling system contains a total of approximately 29,300 pounds of anhydrous ammonia (Ice System #1 and Ice System #2 combined), a"

      "SummaryText": "nd this is the maximum plant inventory.  This ammonia quantity requires that Rokeby Station develop a Risk Management Program and Plan.  Rokeby Station is covered by Program 2 requirements.\n\n3. The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario.\n\nThe worst case scenario is the loss of 3,250 pounds of ammonia representing a failure of the refrigeration system Receiver Tank on Ice System #1.  A water deluge response by the facility could reduce the release significantly.  Modeling shows that the worst-case scenario would have off-site endpoints and reach nearby public receptors.  The alternative scenario will have little off-site impact.\n\n4. The general accidental release program and the specific prevention steps.\n\nLES intends to comply fully with Risk Management Program requirements as outlined in Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions. \n\nSpecific prevention steps include following Risk Management Program elements in areas such as expanding training and documentation.  Each area of the recently completed Risk Management Program includes recommendations.  LES will follow-up on recommendations in a timely manner.\n\n5. Five-year accident history.\n\nRokeby Station lost an estimated 1500 pounds of ammonia over the winter shutdown of Ice System #1from late October 1994 until discovery of the loss on May 10, 1995.  The source was identified as a threaded piping fitting on an ice maker high above the top of the ice tank.\n\nThe ammonia loss caused no problems on- or off-site.  It was undetected until discovered by an employee working on the ice maker downwind.  This type of leak is an improbable one and is not considered a negative indicator of LES Rokeby Station ability to control hazards on the site.\n\n6. The emergency response program.\n\nLES has a thorough detailed Emergency Response Plan designated specifically for an ammonia release for Rokeby Station"
