Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nHuntsman is committed to providing a safe, healthy and environmentally conscious work place for its employees and neighbors. Huntsman Ethyleneamines maintains a Process Safety Management (PSM) program that implements a series of steps to prevent potential hazards associated with the process and assures a well-trained work force. Site specific procedures and manuals are used to assure consistent implementation and enforcement of accidental release and prevention programs. \n\n\n\n2. Regulated Substances\n\nHuntsman Ethyleneamines is located within the boundaries of the DOW Chemical Company Freeport Plant A facility. Huntsman Ethyleneamines produces various Ethyleneamines which are sold to other companies for processing to a final consumer product. There are three (3) regulated substances at the Huntsman Ethyleneamines facility. All three are on the toxic substances list:\n\nEthylenediamine (EDA) - Final product\n\nAmmonia (anhydrous) - Raw material.  \n\nAmmonia (aqueous) - Raw material\n\n\n\n3. General Accident Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps \n\nFollowing is a brief summary of the elements that Huntsman Ethyleneamines has implemented to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements outlined by EPA as well as with the Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard.  \n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nHuntsman Ethyleneamines maintains a compilation of current and accurate written safety information to identify and understand the hazards of the process. This includes information pertaining to:\n\n\n\nHazards of regulated substances: For each regulated substance, there is a Safety Data Sheet (SDS) that discusses the physical properties of the chemicals, exposure hazards, the required personal protective equipment and the appropriate first aid and emergency treatment for exposure.\n\n\n\nThe technology of the process:  Includes a discussion"

The PHAs also address consequences of failure of engineering and administrative controls, facility or stationary source siting, human factors and a qualitative evaluation of a range of possible safety and health effects of failure of controls. Huntsman Ethyleneamines utilizes the HAZOP methodology, a recognized and generally accepted method, for identifying and evaluating hazards in the process, and completes Human Factors and Facility Siting checklists during the PHA team meetings. Huntsman Ethyleneamines assigns employees to the HAZOP team who are knowledgeable in the HAZOP methodology and the specific process. The HAZOP team develops recommendations to reduce the potential hazards, which, if approved, are implemented within a reasonable period of time. Huntsman Ethyleneamines conducts PHA and LOPA Revalidations every 5-years, meeting the requirements of the PSM and RMP Standards.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nHuntsman Ethyleneamines maintains written operating procedures that were developed in consultation with operators to provide clear instructions for safely conducting activities associated with a covered process.

The training emphasizes safety and health hazards, emergency operations, and safe work practices. All operators receive periodic refresher training.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nHuntsman Ethyleneamines has developed a program for maintaining the operating components of the process (including pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown system controls) through the risk based mechanical integrity program. The program is comprised of well-trained personnel who follow maintenance, testing and inspection programs that ensure proper function of process equipment.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change (MOC)\n\nHuntsman Ethyleneamines has established and implemented a written procedure to manage changes to process chemicals, personnel, technology, equipment, procedures, and any changes to the facility that affect a covered process. The procedure assures that, prior to any change, the following issues are considered: the technical basis for the proposed change, its impact on safety and health, any modifications to operating procedures, the necessary time period for the change, and any authorization requirements. Employees involved in operating a process, as well as maintenance and contract employees whose job will be affected, are informed of and trained in the change.

A PSSR is also conducted after equipment has been shut down for a significant overhaul, internal inspection, or if it has been down for greater than one month.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audit\n\nHuntsman Ethyleneamines performs audits of its compliance with the provisions of its Process Safety Management program. Teams comprised of employees, with appropriate knowledge of audit techniques, process safety and operating experience, conduct audits every three years to verify that the procedures and practices developed are adequate and being followed. The findings of the audit team are reviewed and appropriate corrective actions are implemented and tracked until resolved.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nHuntsman Ethyleneamines investigates any incidents that resulted in, or could reasonably have resulted in, a release of covered chemicals. To perform the investigation, Huntsman Ethyleneamines assembles an incident investigation team consisting of persons with the appropriate knowledge and experience to thoroughly investigate and analyze the incident. A report is prepared at the conclusion of the incident investigation that addresses the incident, the factors that contributed to it, and recommendations resulting from the incident investigation. Huntsman Ethyleneamines has established a system to promptly address and resolve the incident report findings and recommendations and to document their resolution.
