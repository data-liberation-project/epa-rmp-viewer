Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify potential hazard controls in place to manage these hazards, and recommend additional controls, as appropriate.\r\n\r\nThe Buckeye CO2  Plant uses hazard and operability studies (HAZOP's), which are conducted using a team of employees who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates potential hazard of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures.\r\n\r\nThe PHA team findings are shared with the affected personnel. Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team. The approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\r\n\r\nThe Buckeye CO2  Plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating. The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained. The stationary source has been divided into different sections for PHA execution.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\n\r\nThe Buckeye CO2 Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) Initial startup, (2) normal startup, (3) normal operations, (4) temporary operations, (5) consequences of deviation (6) normal shutdown, and (7) emergency shutdown.

The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes. In addition, the Buckeye CO2 Plant maintains information on how to respond to upper or lower limit exceedances for specific process or equipment parameters. This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\n\r\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Buckeye CO2 Plant has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process. New employees receive basic training in process operations if they are not already familiar with such operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with an experienced operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years, or more frequently upon request. All of this training is documented for each operator via documentation kept at the facility and in CMS (Competency Management System).\r\n \r\nContractors\r\n\r\nThe Buckeye CO2 Plant uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.

Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA)team. Employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's accident prevention program. Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that addresses each accident prevention program element. \r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\n\r\nThe Buckeye CO2  Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. \r\n\r\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response exposure treatment considerations, is provided in Safety Data Sheets (SDSs). For specific process areas, the facility has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in the Operating Procedures. The facility maintains the process within these limits by using process controls and monitoring instruments, trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\r\n\r\nThe facility also maintains files that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.

In addition, the Buckeye CO2 Plant evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor. \r\n\r\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSR)\r\n\r\nThe Buckeye CO2 Plant conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information. The purpose of the PSSR is to see that safety features, procedures, personnel and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service. This review provides one additional check that construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready. A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\n\r\nThe Buckeye CO2 Plant has established practices and procedures to maintain process equipment, pressure vessels, piping systems, relief systems, controls, pumps and compressors in a safe operating condition.

If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service. This may require that a management of change team review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary.\r\n\r\nAn integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance.

The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to facility management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation teams findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete.

Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency duties. The Emergency Action Plan is updated when necessary, based on modifications made to processes or other Buckeye CO2 Plant facilities. \r\n\r\nThe overall emergency response program for the Buckeye CO2 Plant has been coordinated with local emergency responders at the Lovington Fire Department. The Buckeye CO2 Plant has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate emergency response organizations (e.g., Lovington Fire Department).

This commitment is demonstrated by our efforts in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will evaluate the situation, take actions within the capabilities of the facility, and/or notify the necessary outside agencies\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nThe Buckeye CO2 Plant, located at 40 Texas Camp Road in Lovington, New Mexico, operates a variety of units to extract Natural Gas Liquids (NGLs) from casing head natural gas. The boundaries of the stationary source are defined by the external fence surrounding the facility. \r\n\r\nNGL is a flammable liquid that is stored under pressure and is composed of propane, iso-butane, normal butane, iso-pentane and normal pentane which are regulated flammable hydrocarbons. In order to achieve the low temperatures necessary to extract NGLs from the natural gas, refrigerant grade propane is used at the stationary source. Casing head Natural Gas processed at the facility contains carbon dioxide (CO2) and the regulated flammable hydrocarbons methane and ethane. H2S is also present in the inlet gas but at concentrations below 1 %.\r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Buckeye CO2  Plant.
