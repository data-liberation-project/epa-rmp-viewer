      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY - RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN (Plan)\n\nThe E&J Gallo Winery is located at 600 Yosemite Blvd. in Modesto, California.  The facility receives bulk shipments of wine and distilled spirits by tanker truck, and rail tank car, stores the product in tanks and oak barrels for aging, and performs processing and bottling of consumer wine products.\n\nThe facility operates anhydrous ammonia refrigeration systems to provide product cooling.  Refrigeration systems have storage vessels (receivers) sized to contain all the liquid ammonia in the system, with additional capacity for thermal expansion. \n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is a closed loop heat transfer system.  Ammonia moves through the system due to pressure differences produced by the compressors.  A brief description of the ammonia refrigeration cycle follows:\n\n1. The receiver vessel stores liquid ammonia under pressure.  High pressure liquid ammonia flows from the receiver through liquid lines to the expansion valve, which partitions the pressure and temperature.  Liquid ammonia at reduced pressure and temperature is then piped into the chiller shell.  \n\n2. Product is circulated through sealed stainless steel tubing within the chiller shell.  Heat from the warm product transfers through the tubing walls to the cooler refrigerant, causing liquid refrigerant to boil off as low pressure vapor.  The rate of vaporization, and thereby the cooling of product, is determined by the amount of pressure in the chiller as controlled by a back pressure regulator, and suction from the compressors.\n\n3. The compressors draw the low pressure vapor from the chiller, compress it into high pressure vapor, and discharge to the evaporative condenser (cooling tower).\n\n4. In the evaporative condenser, ammonia vapor flows through tubing which is sprayed with water and located within fan driven air flow to promote cooling.  The ammonia vapor transfers heat through the tubing walls to the cooling water.  The ammonia condenses back to "

In the event of a reportable chemical release, notifications will be made to the appropriate agencies including the Stanislaus County Environmental Resources Department,  the Consolidated Fire Department,  the City of Modesto Operations & Maintenance Department Environmental Services Division, the State Office of Emergency Services, and the Federal National Response Center.  \n\nGallo security officers, management and members of the in-house emergency response team would respond to the site, and work with public emergency response personnel in mitigating the problem.\n\nMANAGEMENT OF CHANGE\nThe Management of Change procedure will require evaluation of new construction and modifications to existing ammonia systems to determine the likelihood of an effect on ammonia safety.  Changes expected to have a significant safety effect on quantity, systems, or procedures will be referred to the appropriate Risk Management Program team for further study.  \n\nCOMPLIANCE AUDITS\nE&J Gallo Winery performed a Risk Management Program compliance audit in June 2004.  Compliance audits will be performed every three years.  The specific items in the Plan will be re-examined, and compliance documented in a report of findings.  The audit will be conducted by at least one person knowledgeable in the processes identified in the Plan (see Gallo RMP Management Team organizational chart).\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nA Hazard and Operability Study (HAZOPS) of the ammonia systems was performed during 2004.  The study team was composed of engineering,  refrigeration maintenance, safety, and management personnel from E&J Gallo Winery.  As a result of the study, numerous improvements were made to existing systems, and included in major renewal and upgrade projects."
