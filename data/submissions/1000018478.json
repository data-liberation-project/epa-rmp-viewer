If an emergency were to occur, it is the facility's policy to notify the Lehigh County LEPC as well as the Lower Macungie Fire Department and Emergency Management Agency, as necessary.  Medical emergencies will require notification of the Lehigh County LEPC, Macungie Ambulance Corps and Lehigh Valley Hospital.  This facility does not maintain a trained fire brigade but does employ a hazardous materials response team and trained incipient stage fire response on-site to respond to small or the initial stages of an emergency.  Mr. Alan Jones (Supervisor Field Operations) is the Facility emergency contact and the Administrator of this RMP.  All site personnel are trained in the hazards of this process along with the contiguous butane railcar storage as identified in the employee participation plan.\n\nThe Macungie Terminal 2BE is a refined petroleum product distributor and wholesaler including propane operations and temporary storage of butane (liquefied under pressure) for use at the adjacent Buckeye Partners, LP facility.  The Risk Management Program (RMP) covers the propane distribution system only, including the associated piping and six (6) 60,000 gallon storage tanks, up to (24 total) 30,000 gallon butane and propane railcars (butane storage for an adjacent facility may occur on the Macungie Terminal 2BE rail spur).\n\nThis facility's worst case scenario is the failure of one of the blending system's six (6) 60,000 gallon storage tanks when filled to the greatest amount allowed (88% at 60 degrees Fahrenheit) resulting in a vapor cloud explosion. The facility's alternate release scenario is a BLEVE of one 60,000 gallon propane vessel.\n\nThe Macungie T"

This system is designed, constructed and maintained in accordance with NFPA #58 and the manufacturer's (Superior Energy Systems, LTD.) instructions.  Process Hazard Analyses (What If/Checklist), compliance Audits, and subsequent updates have been completed.\n\nTo date, this facility has never had an accident involving this liquefied petroleum gas system which has resulted in deaths, injuries or property/environmental damage, evacuations or shelterings in-place.\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving the Macungie Terminal 2BE propane distribution system, it is the policy of the facility to initially contact the Lehigh County LEPC and the Lower Macungie Fire Department and request their assistance.  The facility currently has no trained fire brigade but does employ a hazardous materials response team and trained incipient fire response group.  The facility emergency response plans are coordinated by the fire department and the Lehigh County LEPC along with the Lower Macungie Emergency Management Agency."
