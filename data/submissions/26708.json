This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.   However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.  We also work closely with our public emergency responders\nproviding them with training and equipment so that  they can respond safety and efficiently to emergencies that might occur at our facility. The plant uses fractionation to process wellhead gas into marketable natural gas and natural gas liquids (NGL).  As a result of this operation, several EPA regulated flammable substances are processed, recovered, and stored at the facility (e.g., methane, ethane).  The plant does not use or store any regulated toxic substances above the EPA set threshold levels.\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances \n\nThe Emigrant Trail Gas Plant, located 46 miles west of Rock Springs, WY off I-80, operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products (e.g., natural gas, propane, butane, condensate) from oil and gas wells.  The Emigrant Trail Gas Plant handles methane, ethane, propane and butane which are regulated flammables. It processes approximately 72 million cubic feet a day of raw natural gas and natural gas liquids.  The Emigrant Trail Gas Plant does not use, process or store a reportable quantity of toxic regulated substances.\n\nHazard Assessment Results\n\nThe Wor"

The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this WCS is 0.54 miles.  No passive mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating this WCS.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nWithin the past five years the processes have had no accidental release that caused offsite impacts provided in the risk management program rule (40 CFR 68.10(b)(1)).\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program/Chemical-Specific\nPrevention Steps\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Emigrant\nTrail Gas Plant.  Because processes at the Emigrant Trail Gas Plant that are regulated\nby the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation are also subject to the OSHA\nProcess Safety Management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the\nOSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the\naccident prevention program.\n\nEmployee Participation \n\nThe Emigrant Trail Gas Plant provides for and encourages employees to participate in\nall facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of\nemployee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and\nchemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA)\nteam.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the Emigrant Trail\nGas Plant accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved\nin the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan\nthat is maintained at the Emigrant Trail Gas Plant and addresses each accident\nprevention program element.  In addition, The Emigrant Trail Gas Plant has a number\nof initiatives under way that address process safety and employee safety issues. \nThese initiatives include a safety c"

These documents address chemical\nproperties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific\nchemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Specific\nemployees within the Emigrant Trail Gas Plant are assigned responsibility for\nmaintaining up-to-date process safety information.  This information is readily available\nas part of the written employee participation plan to help employees locate any\nnecessary process safety information.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency\nresponse/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets. \nThis information specifically addresses known corrosion concerns and any known\nhazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For specific process\nareas, the Emigrant Trail Gas Plant has documented safety-related limits for specific\nprocess parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition).  The Emigrant Trail Gas\nPlant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls\nand monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument\nsystems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\nThe Emigrant Trail Gas Plant also maintains numerous technical documents that\nprovide information about the design and construction of process equipment.

Within\nthis program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure\nthat adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe Emigrant Trail Gas Plant primarily uses the What If / Checklist (DP-10) analysis\ntechnique to perform these evaluations.  This analysis is recognized as one of the most\nsystematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted\nusing a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as\nengineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as\nwell as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for\nadditional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such\nmeasures are necessary.\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for\nresolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based\non a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that\npotential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All\napproved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are\ncompleted.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually\ndeviate significantly from the original design safety features, the Emigrant Trail Gas\nPlant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic\nreviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency\nuntil the process is no longer operating.

The procedures\nare maintained current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes\nmade through the management of change process.\n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Emigrant Trail Gas\nPlant has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in\noperating a process.  New employees receive initial training in Emigrant Trail Gas Plant\noperations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a\nsenior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.

In combination, these\nactivities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.\n\nMaintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety\nand health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response\nplans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their\njob in a safe manner.  Written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a\nconsistent manner and provide a basis for training.  Inspections and tests are\nperformed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended, and to verify that\nequipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness).  If a deficiency is\nidentified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into\nservice (if possible), or a group of experts will review the use of the equipment and\ndetermine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\n\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance.  The\nEmigrant Trail Gas Plant incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment\npurchases and repairs.  This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its\nintended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are\nmade.  Pre-startup safety reviews are also used to support the quality assurance\nprogram.\n\nSafe Work Practices\n\nThe Emigrant Trail Gas Plant has long-standing safe work practices in place to help\nensure worker and process safety.  Examples of these include (1) control of the\nentry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure\nisolation of energy sources for equipment that is being worked on, (3) a procedure for\nsafe removal of hazardous materials before process piping or equipment is opened, (4)\na "
