      "SummaryText": "INTRODUCTION\n\nThe Jefferson Street Water Treatment Plant (WTP) falls under this regulation because of the onsite storage of chlorine.  The amount of chlorine stored exceeds the threshold limit specified by the USEPA, thereby making the facility subject to compliance with the regulation.  The Jefferson Street WTP personnel have complied with the USEPA Risk Management Program rule and have completed a RMP that contains the following required information:\n\n- A management system (40 CFR Part 68 Subpart A);\n\n- A hazard assessment that establishes the worst-case and alternative release scenarios and their impacts on the population and the environment (40 CFR Part 68 Subpart B);\n\n- A prevention program that includes safety information, a hazard review, operating procedures, training, maintenance, compliance audits, and incident investigations (40 CFR Part 68 Subpart C); and\n\n- An emergency response plan (40 CFR Part 68 Subpart E).\n\n\n\nThe following subsections discuss details of the plan that has been implemented at the Jefferson Street WTP.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe Jefferson Street WTP has an excellent record in preventing and minimizing releases of chlorine.  The emergency response policies at this facility ensure that there will be emergency response coverage 24 hours per day, 7 days per week.  Adequate provisions have been implemented to coordinate response activities with outside agencies, such as the Laredo Fire Department HAZMAT team, in the event of an emergency.   In the event of a release, plant staff will contact the Laredo Fire Department.\n\n\n\nREGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe Jefferson Street WTP uses chlorine in the water treatment process.  \n\n\n\nWORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nThe worst-case release scenario would involve emptying an entire ton of chlorine over a 10-minute period, creating a release rate of 200 pounds of chlorine per minute.  The USAEPA approved software RMP*Comp was used to formulate the worst-case release scen"

      "SummaryText": "ario included in the RMP with EPA approved parameters.\n\n\n\nALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nThe alternative release scenario would involve a pipe leak. Due to active and passive mitigation systems in use, it is not expected the distance to toxic endpoint of the chlorine released would extend beyond the limits of the plant.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe Jefferson Street WTP carries out consistent operation and maintenance of its chlorine equipment, utilizing only fully trained personnel.  The management ensures consistent operation by using disciplinary measures for operational deviations.\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe accident history for the Jefferson Street WTP was reviewed for the period from January 2010 through January 2015.  During this period of time, no accidental releases of chlorine occurred.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nManagement of this facility has developed an Emergency Response Program in which plant employees will be trained in the initial response to a release.  The plant is staffed 24 hours per day, 7 days per week.  Plant operators are required to make rounds for inspection and monitoring of the plant processes at least once every two hours.  Once a leak is detected, the Laredo Fire Department HAZMAT Team will be contacted.  \n\n\n\nIn addition to providing emergency responders and equipment, the Laredo Fire Department HAZMAT Team will assume Incident Command upon arrival at the plant.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe Jefferson WTP's current chlorination system has been in operation since 2009.  Due to the fact that it was designed and constructed with best engineering practices in mind and the fact that personnel have been carefully and consistently trained in its proper usage and maintenance, it has been established that the best course of action is to continue to provide in-depth training regarding all aspects of its safe operation.\n\n"
