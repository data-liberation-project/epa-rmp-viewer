Crestwood management philosophy goals are achieved through the implementation of the environmental, health and safety management systems, by the personal commitments of employees and contractors, and by open communication with employees, customers, neighbors, and regulators.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this Risk Management Plan (RMPlan) is to provide information about operations at the terminal, programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, emergency response plans in the event an accidental release should occur, the five-year accident history of the terminal, and planned changes to improve safety at the terminal.\r\n\r\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\r\n\r\nThe Heath Springs Rail Terminal is owned and operated by Crestwood Services LLC. At the terminal, propane is received via pipeline and stored in pressure tanks. Propane is loaded into transport trucks or railcars from the above ground tanks. Propane is the only substance regulated under the Risk Management Program (RMP) that is present at the Heath Springs Rail Terminal in amounts above threshold quantity. The terminal is classified as Program Level 3 under the regulation.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs in place at the terminal are part of the high standards striven for by Crestwood. These high standards include:\r\n\u00bf\tOperating in compliance with required environmental permits and regulations.\r\n\u00bf\tOperating and maintaining the assets in such a manner that unintentional releases are minimized.\r\n\u00bf\tOperating and maintaining assets in such a manner that the small releases associated with normal operation and maintenance will be minimized to"

Analysis of the potential hazards of the process, training of employees, and emphasis on safety has helped avoid any serious chemical release accidents. Part of this program has also involved identifying and taking steps to avoid potential accidental chemical releases.\r\n\r\nFive-Year Accident History\r\n\r\nNo incident resulting in onsite injuries, death or property damage or offsite impacts from a propane release has occurred at the Heath Springs Rail Terminal.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\n\r\nThe terminal has developed an emergency response plan, which is coordinated with local emergency response groups such as the Heath Springs Fire Department. Also involved in emergency response for the terminal would be the County Sheriff's Office, South Carolina State Policy, County Emergency Services and the South Carolina Department of Environmental Quality. The terminal operator is responsible for coordinating the notifications required to initiate an emergency response. The Emergency Response Plan provides the essential planning for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nCompliance with the RMP Prevention Program coupled with the environmental, health and safety management systems, forms the framework for continuous safety improvement.
