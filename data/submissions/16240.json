Our facilities have written emergency preparedness plans that are updated regularly.  \n\nAshland facilities typically host open houses every 3 to 5 years as an opportunity for neighbors to learn about our commitment to safety.  Ashland makes an effort to support our communities through sponsorship of local activities and participation in many local organizations.\n\nA description of your facility and the regulated substances handled:  \n\nThis facility provides high purity chemicals to the semi-conductor industry.  The regulated process involves storage, blending, repackaging and shipment of the covered substances.  The regulated substances are hydrochloric acid (37 wt.%), ethylenediamine, and ammonium hydroxide (29 wt.%).  \n\nFor more information, visit our web site at www.ashspec.com or contact the Plant Manager.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario:\n\nThe USEPA RMP regulations require the worst-case release scenario to assume that the entire contents of the largest vessel of a regulated substance in a process is released.  Based on our analysis using USEPA-approved methods, the worst-case release scenarios could potentially affect off-site receptors.  \n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-spec"
