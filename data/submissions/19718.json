Facility Policy.\n\n     The owners, management, and employees of Iowa Double Circle (Olds) are committed to the\n      prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia and propane.  If an accidental\n      release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other\n      authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the people and the environment.\n\n2.    Facility Information.\n\n       The primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for the sale to farmers.\n        Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for both direct application and for\n        blending into mixed-grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients.  The maximum quantity stored\n        would be 204,000 pounds of ammonia and 56,600 pounds of propane.\n\n3.      Worst-Case Scenario and Alternate Release Scenario\n\n          a.     The worst-case scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank\n                   released as gas over a period of 10 minutes.\n\n                   Anhydrous Ammonia- The maximum quantity released would be 76,500 pounds, which\n                   represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by\n                   design standards.  The distance to the end point (point of dispersion to 200 parts per\n                   million, or ppm) is 2.1 miles.\n\n                   Propane- The maximum quanitity released would be 56,000 pounds.  The distance to the\n                   end point (point of 1 psi overpressure) is 0.3 miles.\n\n          b.      The alternate release scenario, based on the five-year accident history (or the most\n                   likely potential incident), is as follows:\n\n                   Anhydrous Ammonia- The alternate release scenario is a release from "

The\n                   maximum quanitity released would be 26,600 pounds.  The distance to the\n                   endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.6 miles.\n\n                   Propane- The alternate release scenario is a release from hose rupture caused by a\n                   pull-away and assumes a 25-foot length of 4-inch transfer hose.  The active\n                   mitigation devices re assumed to function as designed, limiting the release to the\n                   contents of the hose.  The maximum quantity released would be 69 pounds.  The\n                   distance to the end point (point of 1 psi overpressure) is 0.03 miles, or 175 feet.\n\n4.       Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n          The facility has been reviewed for general compliance with the provisions of \"Safety\n          Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published\n          by The American National Standards Institute, Inc. (ANSI), and the standards of the U.S.\n          Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and\n          Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".  The ANSI Standard has been adopted by reference by\n          Iowa Administrative Code Part 21-Chapter 43-Rule 43.6(200)-Standard for the storage\n          and handling of anhydrous ammonia.  The applicable standard for propane is NFPA-58.\n          The OSHA standard is referenced in the Registration Form Section 8.3.b.\n\n5.       Five-Year Accident History\n\n          There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia or propane in the past five\n          years that: have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility,\n          nor to our knowledge, have resulted in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, shelteri"

Planned Changes to Improve Safety.\n\n          Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are\n          preformed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific\n          safety recommendations regarding storage or use of anhydrous ammonia and propane for\n          implementation at this time."
