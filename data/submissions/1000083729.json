Accidental Release Prevention Policies\r\n\r\nWilbur-Ellis Company, Colusa has developed a risk management program \r\n(updated April 2013) and an emergency response plan(updated August 2013) to address the requirements of 40 CFR 68 of the Clean Air Act. Wilbur-Ellis Company, Colusa is diligent in the handling of all chemicals and is dedicated to the safety of its employees and the neighboring community. Wilbur-Ellis Company, Colusa staff is trained and utilize equipment to monitor the facility and provide safeguards, while effectively and safely storing and distributing anhydrous and aqueous ammonia. \r\n\r\nWilbur-Ellis Company, Colusa has a long standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the Anhydrous Ammonia Storage System and the Aqueous Ammonia Storage System. Wilbur-Ellis Company, Colusa policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. \r\n\r\n2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nThe Wilbur-Ellis Company, Colusa is located at 7254 Farinon Rd., Colusa, California in the county of Colusa. The primary activity at the Facility is the storage, and sale of fertilizers, in addition to, the sale of pre-packaged agricultural chemicals to farmers.\r\n\r\nAnhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient. Anhydrous ammonia is received by truck and stored in one 15000 gallon storage tank (bullet) at the site. The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia handled in this process is 100,320 pounds.\r\n\r\nAqua ammonia (24% of ammonia by weight) is stored in one 20,000-gallon above ground tanks at the site. The total quantity of ammonia present in the aqua ammonia, based on 24% active ingredient by weight, is 36,192 pounds. \r\n\r\n3. Hazard Assessment Summary/Offsite Conseque"

Please refer to the Hazard Assessment report for the results of this analysis. \r\n\r\n-Risk Considerations\r\n\r\nAmmonia is a toxic inhalation hazard; and thus, the use of anhydrous and aqueous ammonia has inherent potential risks to potentially reach sensitive populations within the community. The facility's identified potential risks for an ammonia release from its process are included in the off-site consequence analysis, Hazard Assessment, and Process Hazard Analysis (PHA). Facility RMP elements and other safety programs are structured to minimize the potential of a release from the identified risks.\r\n\r\n   -The history of the Wilbur-Ellis Company, Colusa (i.e., no CalARP-applicable anhydrous or aqueous ammonia releases) reflects the adequacy of the design and diligence of the plant staff in safely storing and distributing anhydrous and aqueous ammonia. \r\n\r\n4. Accidental Release Prevention Program \r\n\r\nAs part of the implementation of this Risk Management Program, key Prevention Program elements were documented and implemented by Wilbur-Ellis Company, Colusa to manage process safety issues associated with the use of anhydrous and aqueous ammonia. In addition, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are currently utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed.\r\nThe facility's maximum intended inventory of anhydrous ammonia is 100,320 lb.  Therefore, the covered process has over the 10,000 lb threshold quantity for EPA RMP and Cal/OSHA PSM.  The 500 lb state threshold for the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program is also exceeded.  As a result, the anhydrous ammonia covered process is subject to CalARP Program Level 3 and EPA RMP Program Level 3. \r\n\r\nThe Anhydrous Ammonia Prevention Program 3 elements include:\r\n\r\n   -Process Safety Information\r\n   -Process Hazard Ana"

See EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM below.\r\n\r\nThe facility's maximum storage of ammonia in the aqueous solution is 36,192 lb.  Therefore, it is over the 20,000 lbs threshold (20% or greater concentration) for EPA RMP and the 500 lbs (all concentrations) state threshold for California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program.  Wilbur-Ellis Company, Colusa is not subject to Cal/OSHA PSM or Program 3 requirement due to the fact that the concentration of aqueous ammonia managed at the Facility is 24% and the Cal/OSHA PSM threshold quantity of aqueous ammonia is only for concentrations greater than 44%. For the reasons mentioned above, the Aqueous Ammonia Storage Tank is subject to CalARP Program Level 2 and EPA RMP Program Level 2.\r\n\r\nThe Aqueous Ammonia Prevention Program 2 elements include:\r\n\r\n   -Safety Information\r\n   -Hazard Review\r\n   -Operating Procedures\r\n   -Training\r\n   -Maintenance\r\n   -Compliance Audits\r\n   -Incident Investigation\r\n\r\n5. Five-Year Accident History\r\n\r\nThere have been no EPA-applicable releases of ammonia at Wilbur-Ellis Company, Colusa in the past five years.\r\n\r\n6. Emergency Response Program\r\n\r\nWilbur-Ellis Company, Colusa is not a First Responder.  Employees are trained to evacuate and call 911 in case of an emergency.  Wilbur-Ellis Company, Colusa will coordinate with local Fire Department and First Responders. Wilbur-Ellis Company, Colusa has filed a Business Emergency Plan to help coordinate with local responders.\r\nAn Emergency Action Plan (EAP) that meets the requirements of the CCR Title 8 \u00a73220 is in place.\r\n\r\n7.
