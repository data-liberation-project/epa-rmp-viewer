The resources invested in the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances demonstrate this commitment.  The BWRPWA Water \nTreatment Plant implements reasonable controls, such as training of personnel and the safe design, installation, operation and maintenance of our \nprocesses.  Our policy is to make every effort to prevent the release of hazardous substances but in the event of a release, our trained personnel and \nlocal emergency response agencies will respond to control and contain the release in a manner that will be safe for workers and will help prevent \ninjuries to the public or the environment.\n\n\n2.0    Description of The BWRPWA Water Treatment Plant and Regulated Substances\n\nThe BWRPWA Water Treatment Plant is located near Rogers, Arkansas.  The BWRPWA Water Treatment Plant handles one substance regulated by the Risk \nManagement Plan Rule (RMP Rule) in quantities above the Threshold Quantity.  This substance is:\n\n* Chlorine - stored in 1 ton cylinders and used for disinfection of the water prior to distribution.\n\n3.0    Hazard Assessment\n \nThe RMP Rule requires The BWRPWA Water Treatment Plant to perform a Hazard Assessment of the regulated substances stored and used in the covered \nprocesses at the facility.  This Hazard Assessment includes an offsite consequence analysis for the following scenarios:\n \n* One worst-case and one alternative release scenario for the toxic substance chlorine for the chlorination process unit at the facility.\n\nThe BWRPWA Water Treatment Plant completed a Hazard Assessment for the covered processes and the results have been appropriately communicated to the \nlocal emergency respon"

The Hazard Assessment has been recently updated to reflect changes in population.\n\n\n4.0    Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe RMP Rule requires that a prevention program be established for The BWRPWA Water Treatment Plant chlorination processes.  The following details the \nprevention program elements at The BWRPWA Water Treatment Plant that apply to these processes.\n\n4.1    Safety Information\n\nThe BWRPWA  maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to help ensure safe operation of The BWRPWA Water Treatment Plant processes.  Material safety data sheets (MSDSs) document the physical and chemical properties of hazardous substances handled at The BWRPWA Water \nTreatment Plant, including the chlorine in the covered process.  The engineering design documents include the operating parameters, the design basis and \nconfiguration of the equipment in each covered process, and references to applicable codes and standards.\n\n\n4.2    Hazard Review\n\nThe BWRPWA Water Treatment Plant performs and periodically updates hazard reviews of the covered processes to help identify and control process hazards.  \nChecklists are used to guide the hazard review.  These checklists include items to help ensure The BWRPWA Water Treatment Plant operates and maintains \nthe equipment in a manner consistent with the applicable design specifications, codes, standards, and regulations.\n\n4.3    Operating Procedures\n\nThe BWRPWA Water Treatment Plant develops and maintains operating procedures to define how tasks related to process operations should be performed.  The \noperating procedures are used to:\n\n1. train employees and contractors, and\n2. serve as reference guides for appropriate actions to take during both normal and abnormal process conditions.\n\n4.4    Training\n\nThe BWRPWA Water Treatment Plant trains personnel in the operating procedures to help ensure safe and effective performance of their assigned tasks.

The BWRPWA Water Treatment Plant maintenance program includes:\n\n1. procedures to safely guide workers in their maintenance tasks,\n2. worker training in the maintenance procedures, and\n3. inspection and testing program to help identify equipment deterioration and damage before equipment fails.\n\n4.6    Compliance Audits\n\nThe BWRPWA Water Treatment Plant performs periodic (at least every three years) audits of covered processes to verify the processes are operating in \ncompliance with the requirements of the RMP Rule.  A compliance audit report is prepared after each audit, and any deficiencies noted by the audit are \ncorrected in a timely manner.\n\n\n4.7    Incident Investigations\n\nThe BWRPWA Water Treatment Plant investigates all incidents that could reasonably have resulted in a serious injury to personnel, the public, or the environment.  The BWRPWA Water Treatment Plant trains employees to identify and report any and all incidents requiring investigation.  An investigation \nteam is assembled and the investigation is initiated within 48 hours of the incident.  The results of the investigation are documented, recommendations \nare resolved, and appropriate process enhancements are implemented.\n\n4.8    Chemical-specific Prevention Steps - Chlorine\n\nIndustry standards are followed at The BWRPWA Water Treatment Plant to help ensure safe handling of chlorine and sulfur dioxide.  The vendor supplies \nchlorine via a Department of Transportation (DOT) approved truck and in DOT approved 1 ton cylinders.
