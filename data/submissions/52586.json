Acetylene is stored on site in quantities that exceed the Threshold Quantity for Acetylene. (Defined in Part 68.130 of the EPA Risk Management Program Rule)\n\nThe facility stores cylinders of Chlorine for redistribution. This product is stored in quantities that exceed the Threshold Quantities. (Defined in Part 68.130 of the EPA Risk Management Program Rule)\n\nThe facility does store Propane for the purposes of retail sale. This is exempt from the rule.\n\nThe Worst Case release scenario for the Acetylene process did not affect the public. There are no public receptors within the distance to the end point from a worst case release scenario.\n\nNo accidents with specific off-site consequences have occurred in the past 5 years.\n\nThe Acetylene manufacturing plant is EPA RMP Program level 1.\n\nThe Worst Case Release scenario for the Chlorine storage did affect the public. There are public receptors within the distance to the end point from a worst case release scenario.\n\nThe Chlorine Storage is in excess of OSHA PSM Threshold Quantity and is therefore a Program Level 3 process.\n\nIn the event of any emergency accidental release involving acetylene or Chlorine it is Airgas East?s policy to immediately notify the Bladensburg Fire Department who would respond to the emergency. The Airgas East Emergency Response Team would also be notified. All employees have access to the emergency action plan and Emergency action training is conducted annually.\n\nAirgas East is in the process of implementing an Inventory Control program that will limit the maximum quantity of Chlorine stored in Bladensburg."
