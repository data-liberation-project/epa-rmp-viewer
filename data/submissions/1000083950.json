Facility Policy: The management and employees of this facility are committed to the prevention of any\r\naccidental releases of anhydrous ammonia through the use of proper equipment, regular inspections,\r\nmaintenance and training of all persons that work with anhydrous ammonia. Should an accidental release\r\noccur, this facility has worked with the local fire department and local emergency planning committee so\r\nthey can plan for response to a release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the\r\nenvironment.\r\n2. Facility Information: The primary activity at this facility is the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia for sale to farmers. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application to the soilas a crop production nutrient.\r\n3. Worst-Case Scenario/Alternative-Case Scenario: This facility has developed a worst-case and alternative case scenario however it has been withheld from this Executive Summary as security-sensitive information as\r\nrequested by EPA.\r\n4. Accidental Release Program: This facility complies with the various rules and regulations governing the\r\nstorage and handling of anhydrous ammonia including ANSI K61.1, OSHA 29 CFR 1910.111 and regulations\r\nadministered by our state agency. Training is provided on safe anhydrous ammonia operations for\r\nemployees.\r\n5. Five-year Accident History: There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia for the\r\ncovered process at this facility in the past five years.\r\n6. Emergency Response Program: This facility has a written emergency plan in accordance with OSHA\r\nStandards 29 CFR 1910.38 and 1910.120. The Emergency Plan for this facility includes specific instructions for employees regarding the response procedures to an emergency. Response procedures may differ by product\r\ndepending on the qualifications of the personnel and equipment available onsite.
