      "SummaryText": "January, 2009 Update of Original RMP Plan\n\nThe original RMP for US BioEnergy Woodbury, LLC is being updated to reflect several changes: (1) VeraSun Energy purchased US BioEnergy in 2008 and the plant is now known as VeraSun Woodbury, LLC.; (2) changes in management personnel; (3) minor revisions to the worst and alternative case release scenarios; (4) updated prevention program data; and (5) updated emergency response information.\n\nVeraSun Woodbury, LLC ethanol plant is located near Woodbury, Barry County, Michigan.\n\nThe VeraSun Woodbury, LLC plant started operation in 2006.  The facility operates 24 hours per day, 7 days per week for the purpose of manufacturing fuel grade ethanol from corn. The regulated substances under the RMP program are: (1) Anhydrous Ammonia; and (2) Denaturant (also known as natural gasoline), a flammable mixture, that contains butane, iso-pentane and pentane which are specific flammable chemicals regulated by RMP.  \n\nWorst and Alternative-Case Release Modeling\n\nUsing the EPA RMP*Comp program, the radius of impact from a worst-case release of ammonia would be about 5.6 miles. The worst-case scenario assumes that the entire contents of the Ammonia tank are released in 10 minutes as required by the RMP worst case model.  Homes, schools and other public receptors are located within this 5.6 mile radius.  Approximately 10,438 residents could be affected by the toxic worst-case release, based on the published Barry County population density (106 persons/square mile).\n\nThe alternative-case release of ammonia assumes that about 100 pounds per minute of ammonia are released through a pressure relief valve for 10 minutes.  Using the EPA RMP*Comp program, the radius of this release would be about 0.2 miles.  An estimated 13 residents could be affected by the toxic alternative-case release.\n\nUsing the EPA RMP*Comp program, the radius of impact from a worst-case release of the denaturant, a flammable mixture, would be 0.4 miles.  The worst-case scenario"

      "SummaryText": " assumes that the entire contents of the Denaturant tank are released and that the RMP specified flammable components form a vapor cloud that explodes. An estimated 53 residents could be affected by the flammable worst-case release.\n\nThe alternative-case flammable release assumes that 10% of the Denaturant?s tank contents are released and that the RMP specified flammable components form a vapor cloud that explodes.  The radius of impact for this scenario is 0.20 miles and an estimated 13 residents could be affected by the flammable alternative-case release.\n\nAccidental History\n\nThe facility has not had an RMP reportable incident involving either of the two covered processes since startup of the facility in 2006.\n\nPrevention Program\n\nVeraSun Woodbury, LLC is commited to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated in the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel as well as considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility.  VeraSun Woodbury, LLC's will continue to stive to implement controls to prevent foreseeable releases of RMP regulated substances.  \n\nThe facility qualifies as a Level 3 Prevention Program and must comply with OSHA PSM and EPA RMP program requirements. Therefore, a formal PSM has been implemented in addition to several safety and environmental programs.  \n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nVeraSun Woodbury, LLC has recently completed and submitted a comprehensive Integrated Contingency Plan to the EPA.  This plan includes emergency response plans such as evacuation, fire and spill response, an SPCC and a Michigan PIPP.  The facility also has a SWPPP.  \n\nIn 2008, most VeraSun Woodbury, LLC employees were trained in emergency response at the Haz-Mat Industrial Technician level. Facility Managers also attended a class on Incident Command. The facility has purchased additional response equipment and has provided emergency response plans and MSDS to the local community Fire Dep"
