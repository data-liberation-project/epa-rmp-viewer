      "SummaryText": "Neville Chemical Company and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nNeville Chemical Company is a world leader in the production of petroleum based hydrocarbon resins.  Our products are used in every day consumer applications such as printing inks, dyes, adhesives, mastics, pressure sensitive adhesive strips, and rubber and tire products.  As part of our production process, Neville Chemical Company uses a variety of petroleum based resin forming feedstock oils that are blended and charged to the production units.  The production of petroleum based hydrocarbon resin requires Neville Chemical Company to use materials/chemicals that are regulated by the various agencies.  Some examples include ammonia (refrigerant and corrosion inhibitor), hydrochloric acid (pH adjustment of wastewaters), propane (vehicle fuel), piperylene (a feedstock which contains 1,3-pentadiene), and boron trifluoride gas (catalyst).  Of these regulated materials, boron trifluoride is the only material subject to release determination.\n\nAccidential Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nNeville Chemical Company is committed to safe plant operations.  The prevention of fires, explosions, and chemical releases is given precedence over operating productivity.  Management follows sound engineering practice in the design and construction of process facilities.  Facilities are operated and maintained in accordance with established codes, standards and practices.  Facilities are reviewed periodically in order to minimize risks.  Personnel responsible for operating and maintaining process facilities are trained to carry out their assignments safely and efficiently.  Finally, incidents, including near misses are reviewed and corrective action will be taken.\n\nWorst-Case Scenario and Alternate Release Scenario\n\nNeville Chemical Company has developed Policies and Procedures that specifically address safe management, proper maintenance, routine inspection, training, and release response/preparation with"

      "SummaryText": "regards to boron trifluoride.\n\nThough believed highly unlikely, Neville Chemical Company has used U.S. EPA guidance to determine the worst-case scenario as a release of 1,800 pounds within 10 minutes causing an impact radius of 2.4 miles to an endpoint based on 10 ppmv concentration.  The endpoint determination is based on conservative assumptions that include using a surface roughness of 0.5 m, halfway between full urban (1 m) and rural (0.2 m).  In addition, none of Neville Chemical Company's existing controls or active mitigation devices are considered.\n\nThe alternate release scenario is also based on the same conservative assumption for surface roughness; however, active mitigation devices and process controls are considered.  The alternate release scenario is determined as 470 pounds of boron trifluoride being released in five minutes causing an impact radius of 0.45 miles to the estimated endpoint conenctation of 10 ppmv.\n\nNeville Chemical Company used the Automated Resource for Chemical Hazard Incident Evaluation (ARCHIE) and SLAB models for both determinations.  These models are public domain as obtained from the U.S. EPA.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention\n\nNeville Chemical Company has several Plans and Progams in-place for the prevention, control and mitigation of accidential releases.  Specifically, the Preparedness, Prevention, and Contingency (PPC) Plan, the Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasure (SPCC) Plan, Allegheny County Hazardous Materials Off-Site Response Plan, the Marine Transportation-Related Facility Response Plan (MTFRP), the Facility Response Plan (FRP) and the Emergency Response Management Plan (ERMP).  Neville Chemical Company is also required to comply with OSHA's Process Safety Management.\n\nThe Five Year Accident History\n\nNeville Chemical Company has not had any reportable releases of boron trifluoride within the previous five years, June 1994 to June 1999.\n\nThe Emergency Response Progr"

      "SummaryText": "am\n\nNeville Chemical Company's emergency response program is an integration of efforts between facility personnel of various departments, emergency response personnel (i.e., fire departments, HAZMAT, police, etc.) and off-site contractors.  Neville Chemical Company stages simulation drills/exercises at our facility, which include necessary off-site personnel, to logistically coordinate responsibilities and provide on-site familiarity with our procedures.  These drills/exercises also allow Neville Chemical Company to identify the capabilities and experiences of off-site personnel.\n\nIn addition to the simulation drills/exercises, Neville Chemical Company will also perform tabletop exercises, that on-occasion, include off-site personnel.\n\nIn close collaboration with our off-site boron trifluoride vendor, Neville Chemical Company reviews operating methods and procedures to identify necessary improvements and perform aduits of the system.\n\nNeville Chemical Company also provides additional training of its personnel designed to familiarize facility personnel with their duties and responsibilities in accordance with established policies and programs.\n\nNeville Chemical Company has several methods of providing internal notification to its employees.  These systems include alarms, loudspeakers, and two-way radio communication devices.  The regional municipal agencies or emergency radio/television broadcasts can provide public notification.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nNeville Chemical Company will continue to identify equipment and techniques for improving process safety.  Currently, Neville Chemical Company believes that our existing programs, policies, and operating procedures ensure acceptable operation and maintenance of the equipment to minimize the impact to off-site receptors in the event of a release situation."
