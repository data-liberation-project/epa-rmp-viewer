Halfway Farm Chemical & Grain Company has always worked hard to meet and exceed regulations relating to sroring and transferring ammonia.\n        Records show that in our forty-four years of business we have never had any accidents or release with off-site consequences. We place safety first. We train employees anually on safety features, which include: Water on site, replace hoses and valves as specified with locks, pressure relief valves to prevent overpressuring and rupturing of tanks, and excess flow valves to prevent major release in the event of a hose rupture or break. In addition, we have coordinated with local fire department to respond to emergencies.\n        We have assested the worse case release scenario defined by the EPA COMP, this scenario involves a vapor cloud release of the entire content of the 11,500 gallon storage tank. The information reflects a distance of four miles from our facility. It is highly unlikely that a scenario such as this would ever occur.\n\n       The most likely would be an event of a hose break caused from a pull away or hose rupture. This case scenario would reflect a release that would affect up to .5 miles. In this case it would not impact any schools, hospitals or parks in any distance or scenario."
