There are Chlorine detection equipment located in both the chlorine storage area as well as in the chlorine feed room.  This equipment sounds an alarm when ever chlorine is detected.

Also a part of our safety procedures, the plant has on hand emergency repair equipment in case of a leak in a storage vessel as well as  Self-contained-breathing equipment.  All plant operators as well as others who work at the site have been trained in the proper use of all safety equipment.\n\nIn the past five (5) years there have been no releases of chlorine from this facility.\n\nThe Barbourville Water Treatment Plant is covered under Knox County's Disaster plan.  The Barbourville Utility Commission as well as the City of Barbourville cooperate fully with the county's DES coordinator in preparing and updating the disaster plan.\n\nSafety training is conducted on a monthly basis, all related employees must attend these meetings."
