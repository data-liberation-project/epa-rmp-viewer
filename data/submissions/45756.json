      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\n1.    Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at TEPPCO Providence Terminal are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety. This commitment is demonstrated the design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. If such a release does occur, our response activities are coordinated with Rhode Island Hazardous Material Planning District 5.\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility?s primary activity is the storage and handling of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). We have two (2) regulated substances present at our facility. These substances are propane and ethyl mercaptan (ethanethiol). Propane is received by marine vessels, stored on-site and loaded to trucks for distribution in the Providence and surround areas. Ethyl mercaptan is used to odorize the propane for safety purposes.\n\nBoth compounds are classified as ?flammable? under 40 CFR Part 68. No compounds classified as ?toxic? are stored or used at the facility in amounts above their threshold quantities.\n\nThe maximum inventory of propane that is expected to be present in this facility at any one time is 70,812,000 lbs. The maximum inventory of ethyl mercaptan that is expected to be present in the facility at any one time is 17,300 lbs.\n\n3.    The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario. To perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the look-up tables and equations provided by the EP in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance. The following paragraphs provided details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 3 flammable substances "

It is assumed that the entire quantity is released as a vapor, which funds an ignition source, with 10 permit of the released quantity participating in a vapor cloud explosion. Under worst case weather conditions, the calculated distance of 3.34 miles is obtained corresponding to an endpoint of 1 psi overpressure.\n\nThe alternative release scenario submitted for Program 3 flammable substances involves a release from Storage and Transfer. The release is assumed to result in a Vapor Cloud Explosion. The scenario involves the release if 342 lbs of propane over a ten-second period. This scenario is based on the rupture of a 2-inch truck loading line and assumes that active measures (hydrocarbon detectors and automatic shut-off devices) half the flow of propane within then (10) seconds. Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the flammable endpoint of 1 psi overpressure is 0.056 miles.\n\n4.    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps. \nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at out stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nTEPPCO maintains a record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all applicable processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently. The HAZOP methodology is used to carry out these analyses. The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of note than five (5) years. Any "

These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and startup after a turnaround. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nTEPPCO has a training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes. Refresher training is provided at least every three (3) years, and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nTEPPCO carries out maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations. Process equipment examined by these checks include, among others: pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls, pumps, valves, gas detectors, flame detectors, and temperature and pressure switches. Maintenance operations are carried out by quality personnel with previous training in maintenance practices. Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed. Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at TEPPCO to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures. Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee who job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\nPre-Startup Reviews\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at TEPPCO. These reviews are cond"

These audits have been carried out atleast every three (3) years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits have been undertaken and will continue to be undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\nTEPPCO investigates any incident that results in, or could reasonably result in, a catastrophic release of a regulated substance. These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring. All reports are retained for a minimum of five (5) years.\n\nEmployee Participation\nTEPPCO truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort. Company employees are encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements. In addition, our employees have an access to all information created as part of the facility?s implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses in particular.\n\nContractors\nOn occasion, our company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance construction activities. Prior to selecting a contractor, an evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out. TEPPCO has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related the contractor?s work and the processes. Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\n\n5.

Emergency Response Plan\nTEPPCO maintains a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials. The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notifications or local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced. In addition, the emergency response plan is updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.\n\n7.    Planned Changes to Improve Safety\nSeveral developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program. Some of the major steps we have taken or will plan to take to improve safety at our facility are:\n\n-    installation of a camera surveillance system\n-    installation of an employee alarm system\n-    replacement of a PLC (programmable logic controller)\n-    installation of an emergency shutoff device for the truck rack (completed)\n-    connection of additional pressure safety devices to the flare system"
