The NAICS code for the Sinclair Wyoming Refinery is 32411 and must meet the requirements of RMP Program Level 3.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Risk Management Plan (RMP) rule defines a process as \"Any activity involving a regulated substance, including any use, storage, manufacturing, handling, or on-site movement, of such substances, or combination of these activities.  For the purposes of this definition, any group of vessels that are interconnected, or separate vessels that are located such that a regulated substance could be involved in a potential release, shall be considered a single process.\" (Re: 40 CFR 68.3)\n\n\n\nPer the RMP definition, the Sinclair Wyoming Refinery has the following RMP regulated flammables in its processes:\n\nPentane\n\nButane\n\nIsobutane\n\nPropane\n\nEthane\n\nMethane\n\nThe Sinclair Wyoming Refinery also has the following regulated toxins in its processes:\n\nHydrogen Sulfide (H2S)\n\nChlorine (Cl2)\n\nSulfur Dioxide (SO2)\n\nOf the above substances, only pentane, butane, and propane meet the RMP threshold quantity level for flammables.

The maximum quantity of C4 Mixture onsite at any time is estimated to be 26,000,000 pounds.  This estimate is based upon the total storage capacity of C4 Mixture with an allowance for piping and material in process.\n\n\n\nPropane: This represents propane in storage.  The maximum quantity of propane onsite at any time is estimated to be 1,000,000 pounds.  This estimate is based upon the total storage capacity of propane with an allowance for piping and material in process.  \n\n\n\nChlorine: Chlorine is used for Refinery water treatment at the River Pump Station only.  Chlorine is fed to this process from 2000-pound bullet tanks.  The maximum quantity of chlorine onsite at any one time is estimated to be 8,000 pounds.  Sinclair removed the chlorine systems within the refinery and replaced it with a non-hazardous treatment system.  This reduced our maximum quantity of chlorine onsite from 36,000 pounds to 8,000 pounds.\n\n\n\nThe Sinclair Wyoming Refinery has multiple processes, which contain H2S and SO2.  The maximum quantity of H2S and SO2 onsite does not exceed 10,000 pounds and 5,000 pounds, respectively.  Therefore, these compounds do not meet RMP threshold levels.  However, we do have prevention and safety programs in place for all H2S-handling units as part of our Process Safety Management Program. \n\n\n\n5-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThe Sinclair Wyoming Refinery has not had any RMP-defined accidents.  While releases have been documented, none have been of threshold substances, nor have these releases had offsite consequences.  After each release, we investigate what happened, recorded the recommendations, and made changes to our processes, procedures, or safety system to mitigate and eliminate future problems.\n\n\n\nAccident Release Prevention Program and Chemica"

Copies of the information that is used daily is located in the unit operations buildings for quick access.\n\n\n\nExamples of employee participation include participating in the HAZOP analysis of each unit, updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information for their unit area, and being trained on any changes to operational or mechanical information that may affect them.  Employees are also participants on our teams that address both process and worker safety.

A table summarizing the reference documents and their location is readily available as part of the file in the Technical Manager's office in the main building.  Duplicate copies of critical information are included onsite in each control room.\n\n\n\nChemical specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS's).

For specific process areas, the Sinclair Wyoming Refinery had documented safety-related limits for specific parameters (e.g. temperature, pressure, level, and flow) used in monitoring and controlling operations.  The Sinclair Wyoming Refinery ensures that the process is maintained within these parameters using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel and protective instrument systems.\n\n\n\nThe Sinclair Wyoming Refinery also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of the equipment.

Each process unit is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage those hazards.\n\n\n\nThe Sinclair Wyoming Refinery uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP is a very systematic and thorough evaluation of potential hazards in the process unit.  The Sinclair Wyoming Refinery conducts a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) with a team formed of knowledgeable, trained personnel from safety, maintenance, operations, environmental, engineering, and plant management.  The team evaluates potential process hazards and identifies accident prevention and mitigation measures to ensure safe operating and maintenance of units.  The team makes recommendations about systems, procedures, or practices to put in place to ensure to hazards are managed and mitigated.  \n\n\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local management for review and resolution.  Implementation of systems, procedures, and practices are based on a determination of risk with the items.  All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are complete.  The PSM Coordinator's office includes all information about the HAZOP analysis, team members, recommendations, and resolutions.\n\n\n\nTo ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the Sinclair Wyoming Refinery updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.
