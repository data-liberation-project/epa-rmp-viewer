For this reason, our flammable worst case scenario could involve the catastrophic rupture of any one of four butane storage spheres containing inventories of 1.5 to 9.5 million lbs of butane.  \n\nEPA's Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA) Guidance was utilized to predict the release consequences.  The OCA guidance is formatted in Look-up tables that predict the distance to a 1 psig explosion overpressure after the instantaneous vaporization and ignition of the entire liquid inventory of the sphere.  This instantaneous vaporization of these large liquid quantities of butane make these scenarios highly improbable.  The release occurs during the worst possible weather conditions (low wind speed, low humidity).  As absolute worst case releases, these events would have offsite consequences, reaching a 1 psig explosion overpressure at significant distances.

A management system assigns PSM responsibilities to specific individuals.  The fourteen elements of the PSM program listed below constitute the framework by which process safety and accident prevention are managed in the refinery.  \n\n\nPSM Prevention Program Elements \n\n\u0015 Process Safety Information\nA Process Safety Information (PSI) manual is produced for each PSM-covered process and is made available to all personnel involved with or affected by that process.  The manual lists the hazards of the chemicals used or produced by the process and provides information on the technology and equipment in the unit.\n\n\u0015 Process Hazards Analysis \nProcess Hazards Analyses (PHA's) are performed by experienced employee teams for each process covered by PSM.  These comprehensive studies are used to identify and assess hazards in the design or operation of the process units.  Additional controls are recommended for any unmitigated hazards that are identified.  Results of the PHA's are documented in manuals that are maintained onsite for the life of the processes.  The manuals are duplicated and made available to personnel.\n\n\u0015 Operating Procedures\nWritten operating procedures are developed and implemented for all refinery processes.  The procedures, written by experienced operating personnel and reviewed by a technical committee, provide clear step-by-step instructions on the safe and environmentally sound operation of each process unit.  Procedures exist for operating duties during normal modes of operation as well as for emergency response and shutdown scenarios.   \n\n\u0015 Training\nThe Training Department provides classroom and on-the-"

Written, verbal and hands-on testing is performed to validate that training requirements have been met.\n\n\u0015 Mechanical Integrity\nThe mechanical integrity of PSM equipment is routinely monitored, inspected and tested to make sure that the potential for spills and releases is minimized.  The Mechanical Integrity Department employs both industry and company standards to evaluate equipment condition.  PSM equipment is also maintained according to written maintenance procedures by a trained maintenance staff.   \n\n\u0015 Management of Change\nWritten procedures have been established and implemented to manage changes to process chemicals, technology, equipment, procedures or facilities that affect a covered process.  The Management of Change procedure provides guidance, designates responsibilities and establishes steps to implement the program.  Results of the Management of Change process are documented, maintained and made available to all personnel.         \n\n\u0015 Pre-startup Safety Review\nPre-startup Safety Reviews are performed by experienced teams in order to confirm that new or modified process facilities are safe to operate.  The unit's construction specifications, emergency plans, and employee training and procedure requirements are reviewed and documented before placing the unit in operation.\n\n\u0015 Compliance Audits\nA formal evaluation and certification of the PSM system is conducted at least every three years by a Corporate audit team.

The most recent accident occurred on March 13, 1997, to an Operator who was cleaning a filter in a non-acid flush system.  A small amount of HF was entrained in the system and upon release burned the Operator on the neck and arm.  The second accident occurred on December 15, 1996, while a mechanic was opening a flange on a plugged line.  A small quantity of  HF unexpectedly drained out and burned the mechanic on the knee.  Another accident occurred on October 06, 1996.  During Turnaround maintenance activities, a temporary plug blew out of a leaking exchanger that was pressured up with nitrogen.  The nitrogen was entrained with some HF left in the vessel after the cleaning procedure.  A mechanic standing in front of the plug was  burned on the neck by the released acid vapors.  The final accident occurred on October 14, 1995, to an Operator who was checking the pH of a condensate (water) vessel.
