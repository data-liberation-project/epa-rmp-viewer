To accomplish this the chlorine ton cylinders, pipe lines, fittings, and injectors are maintained according to good engineering and maintenance practices, DOT regulations and using only parts, equipment and procedures that conform to Chlorine Institute's specifications.  Our operating and maintenance employees utilizing the chlorine system are trained annually in the requirements of chlorine safety.\n\nDescription of Industrial Wastewater Treatment Plant operation\nThe City of Port St. Joe operates an industrial wastewater treatment that received the effluent from two industrial facilities in the Port St. Joe area.  This IWTP receives and treats the domestic sewers from the Port St. Joe area. There is a requirement in the NPDES permit that requires that all domestic sewage entering the treatment plant be disinfected. To accomplish this the IWTP injects chlorine gas into the raw domestic sewage before it is combined with the industrial effluents.\n\nDescription of chlorine system\nThe chlorine system consists of ton cylinders connected through an injector into the force main feeding the chlorine contact system. The chlorinated waste water flows into a contact chamber to obtain the required contact time for proper disinfection.\nChlorine feed rate is based on the need to maintain a residual chlorine concentration in the domestic wastewater. Chlorine is withdrawn from the cylinder by vacuum through Wallace & Tiernan V-75 Chlorinator and no external vaporizer is used in the process. \n\nRMP requirements at the facility\nA review of all the materials used at the IWTP has determined that chlorine is the only substance at or above a threshold quantity of an"

The quantity of chlorine is enough to have a worst-case release scenario offsite impact thus a Program 2 level RMP has been developed.\n\nWorst-case release scenario\nThe maximum quantity of chlorine that will be in the largest container on site at any one time will be 2,000 pounds. This is a single one ton cylinder. The maximum quantity of chlorine that will be released in a worst-case scenario is 2,000 pounds at a release rate of 200 pounds per minute. A worst-case release of any one cylinder will not cause an effect on the other cylinders. This will result in a distance to the endpoint is 3.0 miles using the Model Aloha 5.2.1\n\nAdministrative controls\nThere are no administrative controls on chlorine inventory in use at the facility.\n\nPassive controls\nThere are no passive control measures in place at the facility.\n\nAlternative release scenario\nA cylinder is in service with a regulator in place. The regulator is hit causing the regulator to break off. This will result in a leak equal to the maximum withdrawal rate from the cylinder. Release quantity of chlorine will be 23.4 pounds or 0.39 pounds / minute and last for 60 minutes. The distance to the endpoint using the model ALOHA 5.2.1 is 125 yards. Under all conditions of alternative release scenarios there will be no offsite impact from the chlorine system.  \n\nFive-year accidental release history\nThere have been no RMP releases of chlorine within the five years of 1994 to date.  \n \nAccidental release prevention program\nAn OSHA PSM program is not required for this facility for chlorine. Our operators are trained in chlorine safety and correct operating procedures. The operators conduct inspection rounds of the WWTP, including the chlorine system, to insure the WWTP is operating correctly.  Any concerns, including safety of the chlorine process, are reported to the maintenance department so corrections can be made.\nOur maintenance employees are trained in chlorine safety and how to complete the"

Each employee working with chlorine has the training and experience needed to approach a leak, determine its cause and take corrective actions. Any event involving a release of chlorine is investigated and a root cause determined.    \n\nEmergency response program\nThis facility's employees will respond to an emergency release scenario of chlorine which could have an off site consequence. The Gulf County Emergency Management Agency and the City of Port St. Joe Fire Department has been informed of the storage of chlorine and have a copy of this Risk management Plan.\n\nThe Gulf County Emergence Management Agency and the City of Port St. Fire Department was given the opportunity to inspect the site and make recommendations for inclusion in this Risk Management Program development. Their recommendations are included in the documentation.\n\nPlanned improvements to improve safety."
