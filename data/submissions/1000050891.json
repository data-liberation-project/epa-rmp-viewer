No environmental receptors were identified within the impacted area. There is a printing company (with 97 employees) and a distribution warehouse (with 2 employees) within the impact distance and several other small businesses.  There are several vacant lots within the potential blast area. \r\n\r\nAlternative Scenario - Failure or break in the propane piping leading to a 10-minute release and explosion.  The contents of the lines are released according to Table 3 and approximately 18,951 pounds are released.  The resulting vapor cloud travels to a ignition point.  The distance to the endpoint for the alternative scenario is less than .2 miles. This release scenario has the possibility of extending beyond the site boundary.  There is a printing company (with 97 employees), two other small businesses, and 2 distribution warehouse (with 2 employees) within the impact distance.\r\n\r\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Specific Prevention Steps:\r\n\r\nThe plant complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule.  The plant was designed and constructed according to NFPA-58. The plant also complies with the OSHA PSM standards. \r\n\r\nFive-Year Accident History:\r\n\r\nThe plant has never had an accidental release of propane.\r\n\r\nThe Emergency Response Program:\r\n\r\nGemini Aerosols is included in a written community emergency response plan. Gemini Aerosols has a written emergency response plan that has been coordinated with the local fire department and the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  Representatives from the local Fire Department and LEPC visited the plant on an annual basis. \r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\r\n\r\nGemini Aerosols will continue to comply with the EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and OSHA's PSM Standard."

Propane is a flammable gas under ambient conditions. The release of propane to the atmosphere results in a vapor cloud that could easily ignite and explode.  It is Gemini Aerosols policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State rules and regulations to reduce the threat of exposure to its employees as well as members of the surrounding community.  \r\n\r\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled:\r\n\r\nThe facility is an aerosol packaging facility.  Several different paint and paint related products are packaged for shipment. In addition, some specialty products such as liquid grease and silk plant cleaners are also packaged for shipment. Propane and N-Butane are used as propellants for the packaging of aerosol products. \r\n \r\nThe regulated substances stored and used at the facility is propane. The maximum amount of propane that is stored at the facility is 51,388 pounds in the largest tank and 13,369 pounds in the smaller one or a maximum of 59,000 pounds for both tanks combined at any given time. \r\n\r\nThe Worst-Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario:\r\n\r\nWorst-Case Scenario - Failure of a storage tank when filled to the greatest allowable amount of propane would result in the release of 51,388 pounds of propane.  Gemini Aerosols complies with NFPA code and further limits tank filling to 80% capacity.  The worst-case scenario assumes that the entire contents are released, a vapor cloud forms, and the vapor reaches an ignition source resulting in an explosion. EPA's RMP Comp software version 1.07 was used to perform Consequence Analysis to determine the distance to the flammable endpoint. The distance to the endp"
