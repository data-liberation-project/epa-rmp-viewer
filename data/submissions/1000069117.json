(Sunoco) Houston Tankfarm located in Hickory, Pennsylvania receives product from the MarkWest Houston Fractionation Facility and serves as a storage facility for the Mariner East II Pipeline (MEII). The Houston Tankfarm receives propane and butane from the MarkWest Facility via two dedicated pipelines, stores the product in two pressurized spheres, and discharges into the Houston Injection pipeline offsite.\n\n\n\nTwo requirements of this section specifically apply to operations at the Houston Facility:\n\n\n\n1.  Purpose and General Duty Clause - The essence of the general duty clause is that an owner/operator that stores and uses hazardous chemicals in any quantity has a fundamental obligation to ensure a safe operation and to have plans in place in the event of an accident to appropriately manage the situation. Sunoco is committed to ensuring the safe operation of the Houston Tankfarm, as well as all of its other operations, to ensure a safe workplace for our employees and a safe location for our neighbors in the community. Sunoco, therefore, has procedures in place to prevent accidents and is committed to emergency preparedness both for our facility and community-wide by coordinating with the Mt. Pleasant Volunteer Fire Company and the Washington County Emergency Management Agency.\n\n\n\n2.  Risk Management Plan - The primary function of the Houston Tankfarm is to act as a liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) storage facility.  Due to the flammable effects associated with propane and butane, it is necessary to observe certain safety precautions to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to employee health, and to minimize the threat and impact to nearby members of the community.  Sunoco Pipeline's Houston Tankfarm is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety and health.  Safety at the facility depends on the manner in which LPG is handled as well as the various safety devices incorporated into the design of the pro"

      "SummaryText": "cess.  Furthermore, comprehensive training is provided to employees and contractors which reinforces the safety policies and procedures of the facility. Programs have been established to help prevent any accidental releases and to train personnel for emergency response in the event of a release. \n\n\n\nFor planning purposes, Sunoco has considered the impact of worst case and alternative release scenarios.  The probability of the worst case catastrophic event evaluated in this report is extremely remote. The worst case scenario is far less probable than natural catastrophes such as tornadoes and floods that could produce much more severe and extensive damage and injury. A consideration of the release has been incorporated into Sunoco's notification and emergency response planning.  Sunoco also considered the impact of an alternative (more likely) loss of containment. \n\n\n\nSunoco has implemented safety precautions and procedures designed to prevent and mitigate catastrophic releases. Sunoco has active operating, maintenance, training and inspection procedures. Sunoco provides annual emergency response training to its employees. Sunoco's management is committed to the following:\n\n\n\n- Preventing accidents;\n\n- Training our employees in correct response procedures in the event of an accident;\n\n- Participating in community emergency preparedness;\n\n- Addressing any citizen concerns by fully explaining potential hazards associated with Sunoco operations and all steps being taken to prevent and mitigate accidents; and\n\n- Being a good corporate citizen in Washington County.\n\n\n\nWith these objectives in mind, the Risk Management Plan has been developed to provide information about our management of the risks associated with the LPG storage process. Most importantly, we stress our commitment to ensuring a safe operation for our employees, our visitors and our community.\n\n"
