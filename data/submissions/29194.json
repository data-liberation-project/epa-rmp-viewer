Facility Policy.\nThe owners, management and employees of Shipman Elevator Co. are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, macoupin county ESDA, and / or other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the people and the environment.\n\n2.Facility Information.\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  Anydrous ammonia is recieved, stored and distributed for direct application AS A NUTRIENT for crop production. The maximum quantity stored would be 1,100,000 pounds in storage tanks and nurse tanks.\n\n3.Worst-Case Scenario and Alternate Release Scenario\n\na.  The worst -case scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as gas over a period of 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 130,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the LARGEST storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards and administrative controls.  The distance to the end point (point of dispersion to 200 parts per million, or ppm) is 1.12 miles.\n\nb.  The alternate release scenario, a 3 inch transfer hose is used as an alternate release scenario followed by release of ammonia for 2 minutes before an automatic excess flow shut-down valve/valves intervenes or remote manual shut-off is closed and stops the flow of ammonia.  The maximum quantity released would be 28,000 pounds.  The distance to the end point (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .80 miles.  (The most likely potential incident, would be a release from a brake in a 1-inch transfer hose scenario followed by release of ammonia for 2 minutes before an automatic excess flow shut/down valve/ valves intervenes or remote manuall shut-off is closed and stops the flow of ammonia. The maximum quantity release"

The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .31 miles.  \n\n4.Accidental  Release Prevention Program\n\nThe facility is in compliance with the U. S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia,\"  and the State of Illinois fertilizer law, Sub part A, Anhydrous Ammonia.  The OSH standard is referenced in the RMP registration form, see Section 8.3 (b).\n\n5.  Five Year Accident History.\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past 5 years that have caused any deaths, injuries or significant property damage at the facility: nor to our knowledge, has THERE BEEN ANY ACCIDENTAL RELEASES resulting in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, property damage or environmental damage.\n\n6.  Emergency Action Report.\n\nThe facility has:\n\na.  A written action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38\n\nb.  Provided state and local authorities with the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA);\n\nc.  If a large release of anhydrous ammonia takes place at the facilty, the required response action is to evacuate the area of the spill and call 911 and all applicable emergency response numbers.\n\n    1. Within 15 minutes of determining the amount of the release would be over 100 pounds, the emergency coordinatior will notify the National Emergency Response Center at 800-424-8802.\n\n    2. Immediately (within one hour) after determining the amount or release would be over 100 pounds, the Emergency Coordinatora will notify the Illinois Enviromental Management Agency at 800-782-7860 (in state) \nor 217-782-7860 (out of state)"
