      "SummaryText": "Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n     At the Three Mile facility of Monte Vista Cooperative, there are railcars containing anhydrous ammonia parked at the rail-siding on a seasonal basis.  Anhydrous Ammonia is considered a regulated toxic substance by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  The properties that make anhydrous ammonia a valuable fertilizer source also makes it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling it.  It is the policy of the Cooperative and its employees to adhere to all of the Federal and state rules and regulations, so as to prevent unnecessary human exposure and to reduce the threat to the community.  Safety depends upon the competent training of our personnel, the manner in which we handle anhydrous amonia and the safety devices inherent in the design of the railcars and the process equipment.\n     \nThe stationary source and regulated substance handled:\n     The primary purpose of this facility is to react anhydrous ammonia to produce 10-34-0 fertilizer for distribution to our customers as a nitrogen/phosphorous source, with it's primary use being for crop land fertilization.  Anhydrous ammonia is periodically stored in railroad tank cars at our rail-siding where it is reacted by cooperative employees as needed on an annual basis to produce 10-34-0 which is then sold to cooperative customers.      \n     The facility has the necessary equipment to safely unload railcars and produce 10-34-0.  Access to the rail cars, portable reactor controls and hoses is restricted to authorized employees and management personnel.  The only regulated substance handled at the siding is anhydrous ammonia.  The maximum amount that would be stored at the siding on a seasonal basis is 293,250 gallons or 1,715,515 pounds.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program:\n     This facility is aware of and complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule, with OSHA's requirements and with other applicable Fe"

      "SummaryText": "deral and state codes, standards and regulations.  The cooperative does not own, nor does it have any say in the design, construction or maintenance of the tank cars used to transport the anhydrous ammonia.  All corrective and routine maintenance and responsibility for the cars lies with the railroad, while the responsibility for the process equipment is that of the Cooperative.   Employees who handle anhydrous ammonia in the reactor process receive training to meet Federal and state requirements to handle hazardous materials along with additional training using indrustry training programs and schools.\n\nFive-year accident history:\n     This site has not experienced a reportable accidental release of anhydrous ammonia in the five years pior to the date of submitting this report.\n\nThe emergency response program:\n     This facility relies on the local emergency response unit and does not have its own emergency response program.  However, employees are familiar with the North American Emergency Response Guidebook, and the local fire department is familiar with the plant.  \n\nPlanned changes to improve safety:\nThis facility utilizes state and federal standards as guidelines for the safe handling of all chemicals on site.  At this time there are no further plans to modify or change the facility."
