This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n *  A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulation\n *  A summary of results from our assessment of the potential offsite consequences from accidental chemical releases\n *  An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\n *  A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule\n *  An overview of our emergency response program\n *  An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment\n *  The certifications that EPA's RMP rule requires us to provide\n *  The detailed information (called data elements) about our risk management program\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe only process covered by the RMP is located in our water treatment process, where chlorine is present in quantities above threshold levels.  Chlorine is a toxic chemical which the EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release.  \n\nOur accidental release prevention programs and our contingency planning efforts help us effectively manage the hazards that are posed to our employees, the public, and the environment by our use of these chemicals.\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEM"

Our company and our employees are committed to the standard that these management systems set for the way we do business, and we have specific accountabilities and controls to ensure that we are meeting our own high standards for accident prevention. \n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nRecords for all significant accidental chemical releases that occur at our facility are maintained on site.  Each incident of this type is formally investigated to identify and correct the root cause of the event.
