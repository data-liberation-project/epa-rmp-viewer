      "SummaryText": "Gackle Grain Coop is a farmer owned grain cooperative located in northern Logan County, North Dakota.  We deal in agricultural commodities and agricultrual inputs including anhydrous ammonia.  Gackle Grain Coop has never had an accidental release of anhyrous ammonia and it is our intention to continue to handle this substance in a safe and environmentally friendly manner. Gackle Grain Coop has extensive safety training, inspection, and maintenance programs in place.  We are constantly looking for ways to improve our transfer and storage process.  Improvements in methods or equipment are implemented as they become available.  Gackle Grain Coop has planned for and has coordinated with local emergency responders to respond to any accidental release which we foresee could happen at our facility from a simple hose break to the release of the entire contents of our largest storage tank.   Gackle Grain Coop wants to ensure the public that the use of anhyrous ammonia is safe.  We spend time, money and resources each year to insure that this substance is handled in the safest possible manner."
