Multiple feed points are provided to give flexibility in achieving disinfection goals. Disinfection is achieved by withdrawing gaseous chlorine from 1-ton cylinders, and feeding through chlorinators (with integral vacuum regulators), an automatic switchover assembly, rotameters, and injectors.\n\nNormally, two cylinders resting on the scale feed the system through one of two pipe manifolds. Up to four cylinders can feed simultaneously through the two manifolds. Typically, an additional two cylinders are stored at the facility. An underhung bridge crane is used for handling cylinders. The chlorine hoist and trolley has a two-ton capacity.\n\nFeed equipment consists of chlorinators with integral vacuum regulators to meter the gas under vacuum and injectors to create the vacuum and mix the gas with water for transport and application. The system is under vacuum from the ejector to the vacuum regulator at each ton cylinder. From the vacuum regulator to the ton cylinder, the system is pressurized. Pressurized chlorine piping is minimal, however.\n\nTwo chlorine leak detectors are provided in the chlorine storage room and one in the chlorination room. In addition to the alarm annunciator and rotating beacons, warning lights are installed near each entry to the chlorination room and the chlorine storage room.\n\nChemicals Subject To EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Program:\n\nVWD uses chlorine at the Meadowlark Water Reclamation Facility in quantities large enough to trigger the Accidental Release Prevention Program. Chlorine is transported to the facility by truck, stored onsite in one-ton cylinders, and used for water disinfection. Typically four 1-ton chlorine cylinders are in use, and two 1-ton cylinders are stored at the facility.\n\nAccidental Re"

EPA requires facilities to model the distance that a plume of released gas would travel before it dispersed to an ambient concentration equal to the Toxic Endpoint Concentration. The Toxic Endpoint Concentrations for various compounds were specified by EPA, and are generally concentrations that would cause no physical harm but could interfere with people's ability to leave the area. The Toxic Endpoint Concentration for chlorine is 3 ppm. \n\nVWD conducted a process hazard analysis (PHA), which included an evaluation of potential chlorine release scenarios. In accordance with EPA's rule, two general types of hypothetical accidental release scenarios were developed:\n\n7 The Administrative Worst-Case Release that arbitrarily assumes the entire contents of the largest container of chemical is released to the atmosphere in 10 minutes. VWD is unaware of any conceivable event that could actually cause such a catastrophic release at the facility.\n\n7 Alternate Release Scenario, which is a release that the PHA team concluded has a realistic (but small) chance of actually occurring at the facility. \n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario for Chlorine :\n\nAnhydrous liquid chlorine (chlorine gas that is stored as a liquid under pressure at ambient temperature) is imported to the site by truck and stored in a one-ton cylinder for use in the disinfection process. The Administrative Worst-Case Release Scenario assumes that the entire ton of chlorine is emitted as a gas cloud in 10 minutes, during a period of exceptionally calm winds and stagnant atmospheric conditions (1.5 meter/second wind speed and F stability) that would result in minimal dispersion of the gas cloud.

Nevertheless, the RMP rule dictates that the Worst-Case Scenario assumes the release of one-ton of gaseous chlorine. \n\nThe formulas in EPA's RMP guidance for wastewater treatment plants were used to estimate the downwind impacts for the one-ton chlorine release. The formulas for chlorine apply to water treatment plants as well as wastewater treatment plants. Urban surface roughness conditions were used to account for buildings and trees in the vicinity of the facility. The model indicated that the gas chlorine cloud would travel 1.3 miles before it dispersed to the 3 ppm Toxic Endpoint Concentration.\n\nThe estimated residential population within a radius of 1.3 miles from the facility is 3,800 people.\n\nAlternate Release Scenario for Chlorine :\n\nThe following hypothetical accident was selected as the Alternate Release Scenario: the valve on the pressure side of the vacuum regulator fails, resulting in the release of chlorine through a 1/2-inch hole. The release is either observed or detected by the chlorine leak sensor. A repair kit (B-kit) is available, and the leak is repaired within 20 minutes. The release is partially contained by the building, resulting in a reduction to 55 percent of the calculated unconfined release rate.\n\nUsing EPA guidance, the calculated gaseous chlorine release rate is 21 lb/min. This calculated release rate is conservative because according to the Handbook of Chlorination, for a one-ton cylinder at 68 0F, a chlorine withdrawal rate in excess of 0.28 lb/min (400 lb/day) will lead to a cooling of the system and potential freezing of the cylinder. Most of the released chlorine will freeze in a pool beneath the leak, and then be released at a much lower rate to the atmosphere. However, for the purpose of this evaluation, the calculated release rate of 21 lb/min was used.\n\nThe formula in EPA's RMP"
