Facility accidental release and emergency response policy.\n\n The management and employees of Southern FS, Inc. are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other quthorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.  The stationary source and the regulated substances handled.\n\nThe primary activity at the facility, which is located at Route 146 and Route 3 Junction,  Wolf Lake, IL   is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient. The storage and handling system consists of 1 storage tank (30,000 gallons), loading risers. Associated plumbing and nurse tanks.  Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.\n\nThe maximum quanity of anhydrous ammonia that can be stored would be 320,000 pounds. This includes anhydrous ammonia that could be stored in nurse tanks\n\n3.  The accidental release prevention program.\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.  This facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonis, K-61.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc. as adopted by state regulation and the standards of the U S Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".  Compliance with these regulations and on-going training of our employees make up our accident release prevention.\n\n4.  Five year accident history. \n\n     There have been no accidential releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\n     - have caused any deaths"
