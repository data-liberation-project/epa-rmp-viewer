CHLORINE IS FED IN SOLUTION WITH A W&T V-800 MODEL CHLORINATOR WITH A W&T V-100 CHLORINATOR ON STANDBY IN THE EVENT OF THE MAIN CHLORINATOR FAILURE. AN ADJUSTABLE ROTOMETER IS USED TO SPLIT THE SOLUTION BY PERCENTAGE TO EITHER THE INFLUENT FEED PIT OR THE CHEMICAL FEED CHABBER. DOSAGE IS DETERMINED IN THE TREATMENT LABORATORY AND THE FEDE RATE IS SET AT THE CHLORINATOR WHICH IS PACED BY A 4 TO 20 MILLIAMP SIGNAL FROM A ROTORK FLOW METER AT THE HEAD O THE TREATMENT PLANT.PRE AND POST CHLORINE RESIDUALS ARE MONITORED BY A W&T ANALYZER AND CHART RECORDS.THESE ARE EQUIPED WITH ALARM SET POINTS TO ALERT OPERATORS 24 HOURS A DAY IF RESIDUALS SHOULD VARY OUT OF SET POINT RANGE. THE CHLORINE SYSTEM IS A VACUUM SYSTEM DESIGNED TO SHUT OFF IN THE EVENT OF A MALFUNCTION. THE CHLORINE IS LOCATED IN AN ISOLATED ROOM EQUIPPED WITH A VENTILATION FAN AND A W&T LEAK DETECTOR WIRED TO THE TREATMENT PLANTS ALARM SYSTEM. A CHLORINE CYLINDER REPAIR KIT AND THREE SELF-CONTAINED BREATHING APPARATUS ARE AVAILABLE AT THYE PLANT. SPECIAL EMPHASIS AND TRAINING ON CHLORINE SAFTEY HAS BEEN GIVEN TO ALL THE EMPLOYEES WORKING AT THE WATER PLANT. NOTE: IF A CHLORINE LEAK SHOULD OCCUR, THE COUNTY 911 SYSTEM WOULD NOTIFY THE LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENTS AND PLANT PERSONNEL.",
