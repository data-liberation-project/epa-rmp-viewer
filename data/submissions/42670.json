Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\nThe Utilities Commission, City of New Smyrna Beach Water & Wastewater Department is committed to employee, public and environmental safety. This comprehensive accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices. This prevention policy addresses areas such as:\n* Design of new facilities or modifications of existing processes.\n* Installation of new process equipment.\n* Continued review and improvement of standard operating procedures.\n* Continued review and improvement of maintenance procedures.\n* Employee training associated with facilities/operational disciplines.\nIt is The Utilities Commission's policy to implement appropriate safety measures to prevent accidental releases of regulated substances.\n\n2. Regulated Substances Handled:\nThe Utilities Commission uses Chlorine in processes at the Water Treatment Plant. The current maximum inventory is six (6), one ton cylinders for a total of 12,000 lbs. \n\n3. Accidental Release Prevention Program:\nThe Utilities Commission, City of New Smyrna Beach Water & Wastewater Department's prevention program includes the following elements:\n* High Level of training of operational staff.\n* City Fire Department designated as first response team.\n* Preventative maintenance program.\n* The use of state-of-the-art processes and safety equipment.\n* Use of accurate and effective operating procedures, written with operational staff participation.\n* Incident Investigation program.\n* Full time Safety Officer.\n* City Fire Department & Utilities Commission employee joint training sessions.\n* On site availability of a one ton container, emergency repair \"B\" Kit.\n* Self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) used by the operational staff during hazardous gas supply connection/disconnection emergencies.\n* Awareness of the hazards and toxic properties of each hazardous gas used at this faci"

Five-Year Release History:\nNo accidental releases of hazardous gases have occurred at any of the New Smyrna Beach Utilities Commission's facilities in the past five years.\n\n5. Emergency Response Program:\nThe Utilities Commission, City of New Smyrna Beach has an emergency response program, which has been coordinated and reviewed by the City of New Smyrna Beach Fire Department. This program includes an emergency response decision and notification plan designating them as the first responder for any chemical releases or other emergencies at the Water Treatment Plant. Routine joint training scenarios have been held on-site with plant and fire rescue personnel simulating release scenarios and other related chemical emergencies.\n\n6. Planned Changes to Improve Safety:\nSeveral changes have resulted from the development and implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program. Most of these concerns were discovered while performing the process hazard assessment review and included:\n* Improved signage practices.\n* Installation of wind direction indicators at the plant entrance and storage locations.\n* Updating of maintenance/operation standard operating procedures.\n* Safe storage of hazardous gas containers.\n* Reduction of hazardous gas inventories.\n* Continued training on hazardous gas equipment and procedures."
