Outside agencies such as fire departments, local emergency planning committees, and state environmental agencies are notified according to regulatory reporting requirements at a minimum, and as necessary to provide or assist with emergency response.  In addition, representatives of the Honeywell Delaware Plant meet regularly with an established local Community Advisory Panel to inform the public about relevant activities at the plant, including accidental releases.\n\nThe Emergency Response Plan is coordinated with the local emergency planning committees, and information in the plan is readily available to the local emergency response officials for the purpose of developing and implementing the community emergency response plans.  Offsite community response activities are implemented in accordance with the community emergency response plans as developed by the local emergency planning committees.  Representatives from the Honeywell Delaware Plant meet regularly with the local emergency planning committees to review procedures, training requirements, equipment needs, and to conduct emergency response exercises.\n\nAs part of the site emergency response program, the Honeywell Delaware Plant maintains a professionally trained Emergency Response Team and emergency response equipment.  The Emergency Response Team conducts drills and training exercises on a regular basis to reinforce emergency response procedures and the use of emergency response equipment.  Several members of the Emergency Response Team are also members of the local fire department and have established a means of direct radio contact with the fire department in case of emergency.  The emergency response equipment, including spill supplies, fire protection equipment, personal protective equipment, and alarm systems, is inspected and tested regularly"

Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nWhen changes at the Honeywell Delaware Plant are planned to improve safety for the Boron trifluoride process, Fluosulfonic process, Silanes process, Performance Intermediate process, or BF3 Complexes process, the first step in implementing the changes is to obtain approval through the management of change process.  A description of the most recent change to improve safety for each of the covered processes approved via the Management of Change form is provided below.\n\nThe most recent Management of Change to improve safety for the Boron Trifluoride process was approved on January 30, 2004.  The change involves installing railings for the fluosulfonic railcar and ISO hookup.  The railings will serve as fall protection to reduce the risk of injuries to workers and to improve safety.\n\nThe most recent Management of Change to improve safety for the Silanes process was approved on January 6, 2004.  The change involves installing logic on the process control computer system that will allow the operator to turn off an agitator if temperature of the vessel is too high.  This change will allow heat to dissipate, preventing the over-pressurization of vessel U-5/17.\n\nThe most recent Management of Change to improve safety for the Performance Intermediates process was approved on January 13, 2004.  The change involves replacing a plug valve with an automatic ball valve.  The new valve will be air-actuated, eliminating the need to operate the valve by hand at a hard to reach location.  This change will make a common task safer.\n\nThe most recent Management of Change to improve safety for the BF3 Complexes process was approved on February 5, 2004.  It involves changing the tempered water setpoint from 50 F to 80 F to prevent solids formation at the tank wall.  Prevention of solid formation will provide a safer operation and eliminate the need to use steam lines to make the product flow"
