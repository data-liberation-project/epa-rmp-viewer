One overall planning philosophy that is included promotes a safe working environment.  An example of implementing this philosophy is when the Safety and Training Department reviews accident reports, investigates specific situations, and makes recommendations to correct safety problems. More specifically, this safety philosophy is exemplified in an accidental release prevention policy utilizing an approach that combines management strategies with technological controls and operating procedures.  Management strategies include minimizing the amount and types of hazardous chemicals used/stored at the facility. Operating procedures include hazard awareness training, and having an emergency response plan to address accidental releases from the facility.  Technological controls include automated safety valves and vacuum operation of chlorine injection systems.      \n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nMPW is a municipal water, electric and communications utility.  The utility serves the city of Muscatine, Iowa (population 23,000) and certain adjacent surrounding areas.  A regulated substance addressed by this plan is used at a drinking water treatment facility. The chemical included in the Risk Management Plan is chlorine (Cl2), which is used to treat drinking water.  The facility is a single building that houses control equipment and process chemicals and equipment. Water Production Operators visit the facility during normal working hours on a daily basis.  The building is equipped with a chlorine leak detection system that alarms in the utility System Control Center that is staffed 24 hours per day, 365 days per year in an Administrative/Operations Complex. This complex is at a different location than the fac"

      "SummaryText": "ility.  When an alarm is activated, the System Control Operator contacts the appropriate personnel to investigate the cause of the alarm and address any problem(s).  The detection system also activates a warning light at the treatment building.  Security is maintained by locking the building whenever it is unoccupied.  Chlorine is delivered in cylinders by truck and stored as a liquid under pressure, but is removed from and used in the vapor or gaseous state.\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n       \nThe MPW general accidental release prevention program incorporates the following elements:\n   A? Comprehensive training for personnel including practical exercises.\n   A? Utilization of experienced Water Production Operators to operate drinking water treatment facilities.\n   A? A computerized maintenance management system to schedule and document preventive maintenance.\n   A? Use of Management and Operator developed effective and safety oriented operating procedures.\n   A? Compliance audit review of equipment and procedures.\n\nChemical specific release prevention steps consist of implementing procedures and utilizing equipment.  For example, it is less stressful for the operator to wear an SCBA and use the buddy system whenever making cylinder connections.  Equipment precautions include release detectors and chemical injection systems that operate under a vacuum.\n\n\nFive-year Accident History\n\nNo accidental release of chlorine has occurred from the facility during the past five years.\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe utility has a chemical specific emergency response plan for chlorine.  This plan establishes procedures, assigns responsibilities, identifies assembly areas, addresses shelter/evacuation of the general public, explains arrangements for medical treatment, lists outside assistance sources, contains a utility equipment list, and specifies training requirements.  The utility and City of Muscatine have entered "

Response planning has been coordinated with the MFD (all firefighters are hazmat trained), and a member of the Local Emergency Response Planning Committee (LEPC).\n                                                                                                                                                                        \n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSeveral activities during past years have already enhanced the safety of using this chemical.  Some activities eliminated old chlorination equipment, established equipment preventative maintenance routines (PM's) and instituted routine inspections.  \n\nPreventive maintenance routines for equipment are initiated through a computerized maintenance management system.  Equipment includes SCBA's, shower/eyewash stations, and chlorination system tubing and valves.\n\nDuring weekly inspections chlorine sensor operation is verified and alarms are checked.  Building ventilating fan operation is also confirmed.  \n\nA facility audit and inspection program was instituted as an effort to continually seek improvements that can be made in operating procedures, safety equipment, process equipment, etc.  Representatives from the Water Utility, Safety Department, Generation Station Laboratory, and Environmental Department will continue to conduct these reviews.\n"
