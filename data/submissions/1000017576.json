              "Description": "The Tip H. Allen Water Treatment Plant (WTP) is a municipal facility owned by the Canton Municipal Utilities (City of Canton).  This facility falls under the NAICS Code 22131.  The last review and/or update of the safety information was completed on December 10, 2010.  We are subject to the handling codes of the National Fire Protection Association for compressed gas cylinder storage, Amercian National Standards Institute, and American Society of Mechanical Engineers.  These standards along with applicable (though not required) OSHA Standards have been implemented through written manuals.  Even though this is a municipal facility, and is not governed by OSHA, Tip H. Allen WTP has decided to use Process Safety Management as the prevention program (level 3).  To prevent/limit releases, this facility operates the chlorine feed system on an automatic vacuum feed system, manual shutoff valves, and delayed manual fan operation to control/limit the release to offsite receptors.  The vacuum feed regulators are cylinder mounted; therefore, the system will shut off the chlorine feed from the cylinders if there is a feed line leak anywhere from the chlorine tank valve to the injector.  Employees at the water treatment plant conduct maintenance checks on all systems involved with the chlorine on a daily basis.  These checks involve checking chlorine cylinder weights, inspecting cylinders, feed lines, etc.  Employees at the WTP practice safe handling of chlorine, and follow manufacturer's recommendation for operational and maintenance procedures.  All employees who work on or with the chlorine system are trained in the maintenance and operating procedures at this facility when they are hired, and throughout their employment.  The operating and training procedures were last reviewed and/or updated on October 28, 2010.  The employees at the Tip H. Allen WTP are trained by on-th-job training, and are tested by observation and demonstration.  The last review of maintenance procedures was October 28, 2010.  There have been no accidents or releases in the past five years.  The last hazard review was conducted on December 10, 2010 by use of a fault tree analysis. Updating SCBA equipment and updating documentation forms were noted as needs at that time.  The Prevention Program for this facility is required to be a Level 2; however, a Level 3 PSM Prevention Program has been added for implementation to allow for a more effective release prevention program.",

Allen Water Treatment Plant (WTP) we handle chlorine which is considered hazardous by EPA, OSHA, etc.  The same properties that make chlorine valuable as a water treatment chemical, also make it necessary to observe certain precautions in handling chlorine.  Overall, the prevention of unnecessary human exposures, reducing the threat to our own personal health as well as our co-workers, and reducing the threat to nearby members of the community is the main goal of incorporating this Risk Management Plan (RMP) into our daily operations.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle and use chlorine, combined with the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility, with the safe handling procedures that we utilize, along with the training of our personnel.\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is to treat the water supply by utilizing chemicals such as chlorine.  Chlorine is received in individual 1-ton cylinders, and stored until needed.  Chlorine is fed into the water system by automatic vacuum operated feeders.  The vacuum system will help prevent the continual operation of the chlorine feed from the cylinder if there is an increase or decrease in pressure on the feed lines (if a feed line is cut or split).  Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel, and authorized contractors.  The maximum amount of chlorine at this plant is 4,000 pounds.\n\nOur employees conduct proper cylinder change-out procedures when cylinders are changed out.  These procedures are based on the Manufacturer's recommendations.  Employees also review operating procedures and maintenance tasks daily, or as needed per manufacturer's recommendations.  The prevention program for this facility is a Level 2.  Lockout/tagout procedures are used to help prevent an accidental release of chlorine.  When maintenance is conducted on the chlo"

Any change in maintenance procedures is reviewed and approved by the same operator.  All operators at this facility are knowledgeable in the proper start-up and shut-down procedures for the water treatment operations.  All components of the chlorination system are visually inspected at least daily.\n\nOur emergency response (action) plan was developed with the assistance of Environmental Data Services, Inc., Earth Consulting Group, Inc., Harcross Chemical Chlorine Response Team, the Canton Fire Department, and the Madison County Emergency Management Agency.  If a chlorine release occurs at the 225 Hargon St. Location, the public announcement system will be used to notify plant personnel of a release.  Safety Director, Ms. Sandy Sinclair, will get personnel organized for an emergency action, and if necessary, response and evacuation.  On-duty personnel have SCBA equipment that they will use to enter the confined space (due to toxic atmosphere) and determine the extent of release.  They can perform an emergency action by manual shutdown of the chlorine cylinder valve.  If the release cannot be controlled by the manual valve shutdown, then evacuation procedures will then be followed.  A head count will be made of employees and the Harcross Chemical Chlorine Response Team (Hazmat Responders), Madison County Emergency Management Agency, the Madison County Sheriff's Office, and the Canton Police Department of the relase.  Personnel at the 225 Hargon Street location, the Harcross Chlorine Response Team, the Canton Fire Department, and Madison County Emergency Management Agency will help organize the Emergency Response activities, and will start the evacuation of the affected population.

      "SummaryText": "in the chlorine room until notification to the 911 system is made, and evacuation activities begin.  This will not prevent chlorine from releasing, but will allow for some time to respond.  \n\nActive mitigation of a release will consist of manual shutoffs, automatic vacuum feed chlorine system shut-down, and water deluge using fire protection water hoses.  Alternative passive mitigation would consist of continued release into the enclosed space of the chlorine building pending emergency response.  It is assumed that the contents of the cylinder would be released as vapor, as there is no activity involving the liquid port on the chlorine cylinder.  The area surrounding the facility is generally rural and consists of relatively flat ground with sparse vegetation.\n\nThere have been no accidents of accidental releases of chlorine from this facility in the past 5 years.  The automatic vacuum feed system helps prevent/limit potential releases of chlorine that could escape during operational periods.  Operators of the chlorination system are required to check instruments, cylinders, feed lines, etc. on a daily basis to aid in the prevention of accidental releases.  Even though this is a Level 2 Prevention Program, Canton Municipal Utilities utilizes a Level 3 Process Safety Management Program to further empha their efforts in preventing accidental releases of chlorine.\n\n"
