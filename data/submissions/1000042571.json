The Barron facility is subject to the US EPA's Risk Management Program (EPA 40 CFR Part 68) Accidental Chemical Release Regulation because the refrigeration system contains more than the threshold quantity (10,000 lbs.) of anhydrous ammonia.\n\n\n\nProcess Description\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system at the facility is a two-stage system consisting of a high pressure side and a low pressure side.  The low side is intended to quickly freeze product, while the high side is intended to refrigerate the product and processing areas.  Equipment and piping carry the necessary gas and liquid throughout the system. \n\nThe ammonia system is protected by the specific safety systems including safety relief valves, engine room ventilation, safety interlocks and sensors.  Our Refrigeration Operators perform walk through inspections and a scheduled preventative maintenance program is in place for all equipment, piping and valves in the ammonia system.\n\n\n\nRelease Scenarios\n\nThe PSM Team has carefully considered the potential for accidental releases of ammonia by using the worst case and alternative case scenarios.  The worst case scenario is the failure of the ammonia receiver tank, and the release of 31,000 lbs. for a duration of ten minutes.  In worst-case weather conditions the ammonia could travel 1.5 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public.  The alternative case scenario developed is a 4000 pound release of liquid ammonia in the engine room caused by operator error, opening a liquid ammonia valve while attempting to drain oil from a screw compressor.   In this scenario the ammonia could travel 0.1 miles until it disperses enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public.  \n\n\n\nPrevention Program\n\nThe Process Safety Management Program (OSHA 1910.11"

Through the PSM Programs written procedures, operator training, employee awareness training, contractor programs, management of change, and Process Hazard Analysis, our team of engineering, operations, maintenance and safety personnel are dedicated to ensuring the safety of people, property and the environment.\n\n\n\nAccident History\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of ammonia at this facility that have resulted in deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nOur facility has an Emergency Response Program for handling emergencies.  The ERP includes coordination with the local fire department, the local emergency response commission, and emergency medical technicians.  We have a trained Emergency Response team that is equipped to respond to emergency situations at the facility included ammonia releases.\n\n\n\nOur Commitment\n\nJennie-O Turkey Store continues to review and update our PSM Program, provide on-going training to our refrigeration operators and awareness training to all employees and contractors to ensure the safe operations of our refrigeration system.\n\n"
