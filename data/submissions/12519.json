      "SummaryText": "Northampton Generating Company, L.P. (\"NGC\"), is operated and managed by PG&E Generating, the competitive electric generation business of San Francisco-based PG&E Corporation.  PG&E Generating operates the Northampton facility in strict accordance with stringent policies and protocols designed to protect the health and safety of our employees and neighbors, as well as the environment. Every employee shares responsibility for safety and environmental performance at the plant.  This message is communicated through ongoing training programs designed to raise awareness and build necessary on-the-job skills. Performance in these areas is regularly evaluated through audits, assessments and other mechanisms, with the goal of measuring progress and identifying areas for continued improvement.\n\nAs is the case for many facilities, NGC's participation in the RMP program is triggered by the use of only one substance (ammonia) on-site in quantities that exceed a threshold amount.  At this and other PG&E Generating facilities, ammonia is a key ingredient in the facilities' air pollution control systems.  In both the design and operation of our plants, among the most important priorities is the minimization of air emissions, including nitrogen oxides (NOx). Nitrogen oxides are a primary contributor to smog.  The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and state regulators have identified NOx emissions reductions as one of the most important keys to achieving national air quality improvement goals.  In order to help achieve this objective, the Northampton facility employs advanced emissions control technology that uses ammonia to reduce nitrogen oxides emissions. This technology enables the plant to achieve NOx emission rates that are among the lowest for any facility of its kind.\n\nNorthampton Generating Company, L.P., is pleased to share the information in this document.  As the operators of this facility, PG&E Generating takes seriously its commitment to accident prevention and effe"

This plan demonstrates that the company has the programs in place both to minimize the possibility of a release and to respond to one in the unlikely event that it occurs.  Importantly, even under the worst-case scenario, the impact of an accidental ammonia release on-site would be contained within the boundaries of the facility, posing no risk to our neighbors beyond the fence.  Within the fence, the risks to our employees are minimized through ongoing skills and awareness training."
