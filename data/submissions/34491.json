Executive Summary\n\nThe Marathon Ashland Petroleum LLC, Michigan Refining Division (MRD) is committed to operating in a manner that is safe for employees, contractors, the public and the environment.  It is MRD?s policy to conduct its operations in accordance with the highest standards of environmental stewardship, employee and contractor safety and community responsibility.   As part of this policy, MRD has established systems to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility.  One part of these systems is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at MRD and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency?s (EPA?s) rule 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements:  Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMPlan) describing the risk management program at MRD.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMP Plan executive summary requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at MRD.\n\n1.1    Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nMRD has a long-standing commitment to the safety of the public, its employees and contractors and to the preservation of the environment.  One primary element of this commitment is the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances in and around the refinery.  MRD utilizes engineering controls, inspection programs, and detailed procedures to reduce the probability of an accidental release.  \n\nIn the event of a release, the MRD has a well trained emergency response team to contain, mitigate, monitor, and stop the release.  The emergency response team is fully trained for fire fighting, medical emergencies, hazardous material releases and spills and for ambient air monitoring.  MRD evaluates each situ"

In conjunction with the Wayne County and Detroit local emergency planning committees (LEPCs), the refinery has the ability to notify the local community through media broadcasting systems.\n\n \nThe Michigan Refining Division Manager has overall responsibility for the development and implementation of the risk management program for EPA-regulated processes at MRD.  However, the specific responsibilities for certain aspects of that program have been delegated to other personnel who report either directly, or through other management personnel, to the Division Manager.  Those relationships are depicted on the division organization chart.  Specific responsibility for the implementation of the division process safety management (PSM) and accident prevention program has been delegated to the Division?s Environmental and Safety Manager.  Similarly, responsibility for the RMP hazard assessment and risk management plan has been delegated to the Division?s PSM Coordinator.  The division?s emergency response program, including compliance with the RMP aspects of that effort, is the responsibility of the Division Environmental and Safety Manager.  In keeping with our policy that safe operation is part of everyone?s job, many other division personnel are also involved in RMP activities on an ongoing basis.\n\n1.2    MAP Regulated Substances\n\nMRD is a petroleum refinery and petroleum products facility located principally in Detroit, Michigan with a tank farm in Melvindale, Michigan and a marine terminal in Dearborn, Michigan.  MRD uses crude petroleum as its primary feed material and makes a variety of petroleum-based products, including gasoline, diesel fuel, and liquefied petroleum gases such as propane and butane.

In total, MRD has 13 process units that are covered by the RMP rule because of their flammable process materials.  These units are listed in the RMP data included with this summary (Section 1.17 of the RMP Data Elements).\n\nMRD has no toxic substance regulated by the RMP rule in sufficient quantity to be covered by the RMP rule.\n\n1.3    Offsite Consequence Analysis\n\nMRD performed an offsite consequence analysis to estimate the potential for an accidental release of a regulated substance that could affect the public or the environment.  The offsite consequence analysis consisted of evaluating both worst-case scenarios and alternative release scenarios.  MRD does not expect a worst-case release scenario to ever occur.  An alternative release scenario represents a release that might occur during the lifetime of a facility like the refinery. Alternative release scenarios can be used to help the LEPC improve the community emergency response plan.  We have submitted release scenario analyses to EPA and have shared that information with the LEPC and other organizations involved in emergency response activities. \n\n \n1.4    Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at MRD. Because processes at the refinery that are regulated by the EPA RMP regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) process safety management (PSM) standard, and because the OSHA PSM requirements are very similar to the EPA RMP requirements for refineries, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements.  The PSM program at this facility has been extended by the refinery, where necessary, to satisfy EPA?s Program Level 3 accident prevention program requirements.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nMRD encourages employees to p"

Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team, incident investigation, and compliance audit teams.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the refinery?s accident prevention program. Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the refinery. \n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe refinery keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Specific departments within the refinery are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information. \n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).  This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For specific process areas, the refinery has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in the operation manuals for each process unit. The refinery ensures that the process is maintained within these limits by using process controls and monitoring instruments, operating procedures, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\n \nMRD also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.

Within this program, each existing covered process and future processes are systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage those hazards.\n\nThe refinery primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques available.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as recommends accident prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nThe PHA team recommendations are forwarded to local management for resolution.  All approved safety improvements being implemented in response to PHA team recommendations are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each recommendation is documented and retained by the Environmental and Safety Department.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the refinery periodically updates and revalidates its process hazard analyses of affected units. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The"

The results and recommendations from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the recommendations is documented and retained.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n \nMRD maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  Procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate. Procedures are maintained current by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made to the process.  In addition, the refinery operating procedures provide guidance on how to respond to events that result in exceeding safe operating limits for specific process or equipment parameters. The written operating procedures are readily available to operators in the process units and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, MRD has a training program for all employees involved in operating a process. New employees receive basic training in refinery operations and specific training on the process they will operate.  After a new operator demonstrates through tests and skills demonstration adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.

All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nContractors\n\nMRD uses contractors to supplement its work force during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the refinery has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform MAP personnel of any hazards that they find during their work. This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, (4) safe work practices, and (5) a work permit process (i.e., for hot work, confined space, etc.) prior to their beginning work. In addition, the refinery evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.  Refinery personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to insure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n \nPre-startup Safety Reviews\n\nMRD conducts a pre-startup safety review for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information (not required for replacement in kind).  The purpose of the review is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.

The basic aspects of this program include:  (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures. In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process equipment.\n\nMaintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their job in a safe manner. Written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training. Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended, and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels).  If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or a management of change team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\n\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance. MAP incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs.  This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n \nSafe Work Practices\n\nMRD has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.

These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\nManagement of Change\n\nMRD has a comprehensive system to manage changes to processes.  This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard information, process technology information, and equipment information, as well as procedures are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided with any necessary training on the change.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nMRD promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team, which may include contractors, documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to refinery management for resolution.

The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings.  Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidations.\n \nCompliance Audits\n\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the refinery periodically conducts audits to confirm the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented. Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years.  These audits may be led by a third party contractor with assistance by refinery employees as required.  The findings are forwarded to refinery management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team?s findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.\n\n1.5    Chemical-specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe processes at the refinery have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation. The accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all EPA RMP-covered processes at the refinery.  Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios of flammable substances caused by equipment failures or human errors.\n\nIn addition to the accident prevention program activities, the refinery has safety features on many units to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of a release.

On December 16, 1999 at approximately 1435 hrs an electrical trip occurred while attempting testing of the Y2K contingency generators.  The trip interrupted electrical power to the entire refinery and caused all operating units to go down. Approximately 20 minutes following the initial power interruption, two tubes failed in the SR Platformer charge heater (14H1) resulting in a fire both inside and outside the firebox.  The primary fire lasted approximately 5 minutes until the unit depressured.  No injuries occurred as a result of the incident.\n2.    On August 14th, 2003, the Detroit Refinery experienced a total loss of electrical power for over twenty-four hours. Immediately after the loss of power, all the refinery process units shutdown. Several hours after the loss of power, there was a vapor release from the FCCU into the CO boiler followed by a series explosions and damage to the boiler. The Melvindale and Detroit Fire Departments called for an evacuation of local residences, as a result of the vapor release and explosions. The f"

The purpose of the ERP is to protect personnel and to minimize the impact on the refinery and surrounding areas in the event of an emergency situation.  The plan consists of procedures for responding to such emergencies as fires, explosions, hazardous gas or liquid releases, natural disasters, medical incidents and bomb threats.  The plan addresses all aspects of emergency response including responsibilities of the Emergency Response Team, coordination of clean-up activities, timely notification of authorities, maintenance of proper documentation, and guidelines for compliance with applicable government regulations.  Furthermore, the refinery has procedures that address proper use, maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment.  All employees receive annual safety training to instruct them in proper emergency response procedures.  The Emergency Response Team participates in additional training sessions so that they can safely handle potential emergency situations.\n \nThe overall ERP for the refinery is coordinated with the Wayne County LEPC, Detroit LEPC, and local community fire and police departments.  These organizations form part of MRD?s Incident Command System (ICS), which permits all involved parties to work together safely and effectively in order to bring a favorable outcome to an emergency situation. \n\nIn order to keep the plan up to date, the emergency response procedures are reviewed at least every three years by the emergency preparedness subcommittee which includes both "
