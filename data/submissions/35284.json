      "SummaryText": "A Risk Management Plan (RMP) was developed for the use and storage of anhydrous ammonia in the refrigeration system at the Well's Dairy Le Mars Milk Plant in Le Mars, Iowa.  The RMP program meets and addresses the requirements of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 68 (40 CFR 68).  This Executive Summary briefly describes the following elements:\n\nThe stationary source and regulated substance\nThe five year accident history\nThe employee awareness and responder traing programs\nThe accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention efforts\nThe emergency response plan and its integration with local emergency response plans\nThe progams to continually improve safety and reduce the risk of accidental releases\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is used as a refrigerant for the Le Mars Milk Plant's refrigeration system.  Liquid is circulated as needed to the air units and shell and tube chillers, where heat is absorbed and removed from the medium being cooled.  The anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system is a closed loop industrial refrigeration system.  The ammonia is not used or mixed in any manner with other chemical processes.\n\nThere is no data for the five year accident history due to the fact that there have been no reportable accidental releases from this facilty in the last five years.\n\nChemical awareness training is provided for all employees at the facility.  For those employees that are designated to responded to emergencies, intensive training, testing and certification are completed on an accelerated schedule.  These employees are trained in the use of proper personal protective equipment, incident command, and spill control as well as other emergency responder topics.  Periodic skill demonstration drills are conducted on a periodic basis.\n\nThe accidential release prevention program level 3 is implemented through the process safety management program in place at the facility.  Process specific training is provided to all maintenance and operator/"

      "SummaryText": "mechanic personnel to ensure that the system's mechanical integrity is maintained for the life of the process.  Administrative controls are in place to manage process and equipment changes so that training and accident prevention programs can be modified accordingly  The various facets of the process safety management program and RMP progarm are being linked through documentation and communication.\n\nEmergency response plans for various personnel and chemical emergencies are being integrated into a single Integrated Contingency Plan (ICP).  The ICP will consolidate training, resource management, and data tracking for a wide range of accidents that may occur at this facility as well as streamline the management of accident response efforts and define the lines authority to manage response to incidents.  Training is provided to on-site emergency responders as well as the local fire department personnel that may be asked to assist in the case of an accident.  Company representatives periodically attend the Iowa Region 4 Emergency Planning Committee meetings to interact with committee members and other area industries.\n\nWells' Dairy, Inc. addresses and incorporates recommendations resulting from action items developed from process hazard analysis, offsite consequence, incident investigation, and program audit findings.  Continuous improvement of the program will allow Wells' Dairy to respond effectively to prevent or minimize any potential exposing of employees, the surrounding public, and/or the environment to a release of ammonia."
