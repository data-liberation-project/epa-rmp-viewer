While\nanhydrous ammonia is recognized to have dangerous characteristics, we have chosen a contractor\nto handle the product that is an expert in managing this product.  Our community may be subject to some\nexposure under a total catastrophic release, but the danger is mitigated by the amount of time that the\nproduct is on-site.  For twenty-eight years, we, as well as the contractor have proven anhydrous ammonia\ncan be stored and transferred safely.  The community has not been subjected to any exposure as a results\nof a release of ammonia vapor.  The contractor's equipment is well maintained and equiped with all \nstandard safety devices the ammonia industry requires.   While we do not anticipate a release, we have\nan emergency action plan filed with the local emergency planning committee, the local fire department,\nand the local Sheriff's Department.  We maintain an open dialogue with the LEPC and fire department and\nencourage them to attend a training seminar at our business, which they have done, so they are\nfamilliar with the process.  Our employees, along with the contractor, the community LEPC, local law\nenforcement, local fire department are in position to reduce the threat of anhydrous ammonia reaching\nthe community or residential neighbors.  We are committed to protect the general public from the risks\nassociated with the anhydrous ammonia  industry and to assure the public and our employees that\nsafety is foremost at Gore  Feed & Fertilizer in Comanche, TX.\n\n2.  Primary Activity\n\nGore Feed & Fertilizer is an agriculture business.  We supply agriculture products to other dealers and\nlocal farmers who produce food and farm products for families in the United States and our local \ndairies.\n\n3.
