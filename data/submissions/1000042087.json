The LADWP also has procedures in place that are triggered to update safety information if there is a major change that makes existing information inaccurate.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis \r\nIn 1996, a detailed hazard review was conducted for the chlorination system equipment and procedures.  The hazard review was further reviewed in April 1999.  In March 2004 a hazard review was again performed for the whole chlorination system. The 2004 hazard review/PHA for the facility was further reviewed in February 2009. The 2009 hazard review/PHA was again reviewed on January 31, 2014 and will be updated again within a five-year period or whenever there will be a major change in the process.  A list of recommended actions was developed in January 2014 to further improve the chlorine safety and staff is currently evaluating these recommendations.  Staff will document the completion of the recommended actions.\r\nA seismic walkthrough was completed on May 8, 2014 based on the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) Region 1 guidance document, and recommendations are being evaluated for implementation.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\nThe LADWP has prepared written operating procedures for Rowena Chlorination Station that provide clear instructions or steps for safely conducting activities relating to chlorination process. They are consistent with the chlorine safety information.   Written operating procedures included in the facility's Operation and Maintenance (O&M) Manual are as follows:\r\n\u00bf\tDelivery of Chlorine.\r\n\u00bf\tContainer Connections.\r\n\u00bf\tInitial Startup Procedure.\r\n\u00bf\tNormal Operation.\r\n\u00bf\tNormal Shutdown.\r\n\u00bf\tTemporary Operations.\r\n\u00bf\tEmergency Operations.\r\n\u00bf\tEmergency Shutdown.\r\n\u00bf\tStartup Following Emergency Shutdown.\r\n\r\nTraining \r\n\tThe LADWP ensures that each employee operating or maintaining the chlorination process, and each employee newly assigned to this process, is trained and tested for competency in the operating pro"

      "SummaryText": "Chlorine is the most commonly used substance for disinfecting drinking water.  The addition of chlorine or chlorine compounds to water is called chlorination.  Chlorination is considered to be the most important process for preventing the spread of waterborne disease in drinking water.  The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP) also uses chlorine for drinking water disinfection purposes to protect public health per state and federal water quality standards.  Storing and handling large quantities of chlorine can create hazardous situations. The LADWP takes safety obligations in storing and using chlorine as seriously as it takes in providing safe drinking water.  The LADWP Rowena Chlorination Station chlorine handling process is subject to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program and Plan and also to the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program requirements.  The facilities subject to the EPA and CalARP regulations are required to prepare and update Risk Management Plans (RMPs).  The RMP is to include policies and procedures followed to safely operate the facility and the actions, which will be taken by the facility in an event of an emergency.  The LADWP prepared and submitted RMPs for the Rowena Chlorination Station in June 1999, June 2004, and June 2009.  This RMP is the five-year update of the June 2009 RMP.  The LADWP prepared Program Level 2 RMPs in 1999 and 2004 because Rowena Chlorination Station is not subject to Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations.  However, in the excess of caution, the LADWP decided to prepare a Program Level 3 RMP in 2009.  Thus, this 2014 update of the 2009 RMP demonstrates compliance with the Program Level 3 requirements. \r\n\r\nThe following information is specifically required in the RMP Update Executive Summary: \r\n\r\n\u00bf\tAccidental release prevention and emergency response policies.\r\n\u00bf\tGeneral facility and regulated substances information.\r\n\u00bf\tSummary of the accidental rele"

The hot work procedures require the issuance of a hot work permit whenever it is conducted on or near the chlorination process and other areas deemed appropriate as described in these procedures.  Fire prevention and protection systems are in place before a hot work permit is issued. The permit indicates the dates the work is authorized for, the location, and specific operational requirements, and it is kept on file in the administrative office. \r\n\r\nThe LADWP Management of Change procedures include steps required to be taken by plant personnel before implementing changes to chlorination equipment, procedures, raw materials, and processing conditions.  Training, process safety information, operating procedures, and maintenance procedures are updated according to the changes made.\r\n\r\nInternal Compliance Audits\r\nThe LADWP has been certifying every three years (or earlier) that compliance with Program 2 Prevention Program requirements is met and that procedures and practices developed are adequate and being followed. Starting June 2009, the LADWP certified compliance with Program 3 Prevention Program requirements. The two most recent audit reports and a list of the recommendations are retained in the LADWP's files.\r\nThe compliance audit consists of separating the RMP program elements or sections, and auditing each element to determine compliance and effectiveness.  For each internal audit, the audit team completes a Compliance Audit Certification Page and a Compliance Audit Checklist.  The Compliance Audit Certification Page provid"

The Compliance Audit Checklist details the requirements of each RMP element and contains questions that may assist with the auditing process. The audit checklist for each element consists of the following three sections:\r\n\r\n\u00bf\tRecords Review: A review of the RMP written Prevention Program.\r\n\u00bf\tOnsite Conditions: The audit team reviews the program elements based on observation of the plant conditions and safety practices.\r\n\u00bf\tInterviews:  The program elements are evaluated by interviewing personnel from appropriate functions including operations, maintenance, management, and contractors.\r\nTeam members record RMP program deficiencies identified during the audit on the checklist.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation\r\nThe LADWP incident investigation procedures describe incident reporting, investigation, and investigation reporting steps to be followed by plant personnel. The incident investigation is started promptly but no later than 48 hours after the event.  The LADWP promptly addresses and resolves all recommendations and implements the recommendations in a timely manner to prevent an incident recurrence.  All incident investigation reports are retained in the LADWP's file for at least a period of five years from the date the reports are completed.\r\n\r\nFive-year Accident History Summary\r\nNo chlorine releases that could have caused safety or health hazard (deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage evacuations, or sheltering in place) occurred at the Rowena Chlorination Station during the last five years.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program Summary\r\nThe LADWP is a first responder, its employees respond to chlorine accidental releases.

Based on the 2009 PHA, a few equipment and procedural changes were recommended. All the above recommendations have been evaluated and implemented by the LADWP, including the installation and operation of a dry media chlorine mini-scrubber. Additionally, four recommendations to further improve chlorine safety were identified in January 2014, when the PHA was reviewed for the fa"

There is a maximum of four one-ton containers at the chlorination station. Three containers can be attached to the chlorine header for discharging chlorine gas.  A fourth container can be stored onsite but is not connected to the system. The one-ton container is the largest vessel (container) on line. The maximum quantity of chlorine present at the Rowena Chlorination Station at any given time exceeds the listed threshold quantities in the EPA and CalARP regulations.  It also exceeds the listed threshold quantities in the federal and California Occupational Safety and Health Administration (CalOSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Standards. However, the facility is normally unoccupied and water treatment operators visit the facility daily and respond to any trouble alarms which may occur.  Thus, the LADWP Rowena Chlorination Station is not subject to the federal or the California OSHA PSM regulations.\r\n\r\nThere is a maximum of four chlorine one-ton containers at the chlorination station. Three ton containers rest on load cell scales, which allows the operators to monitor the chlorine weight remaining in the container, and the fourth is stored as a spare and is not connected to the process.  Chlorine gas is withdrawn from the ton container through a vacuum regulating valve, which is installed directly on the container angle valve.  Chlorine gas is pulled under vacuum from the vacuum regulating valve through plastic tubing and the chlorine header lines to one of the three chlorinators provided at the chlorination station. In case of rupture of the plastic tubing connecting the container to the header lines, air would be drawn in rather than chlorine being released, and the vacuum regulator would shut down the chlorine supply at the container angle valve, operating as a shut-off valve. From the chlorinator, the gas is pulled by vacuum to injectors l"

The solution is piped through diffusers into the tank inlet or outlet pipeline, into the pump station suction pipeline, or into the pond circulation line.\r\n\r\nControl of the chlorination process for the tank inlet or outlet pipelines is by residual and flow control.  The pond chlorination system is controlled by ORP (residual) control and the pump station chlorination control by flow proportional feed pacing.  Chlorine residual analyzers continuously monitor and record the treated water residual for the tank inlet and outlet, pump station discharge lines, and the pond.\r\n\r\nChlorine leak detectors are provided inside the chlorine building, which alarm locally as well as at the LADWP's Los Angeles Aqueduct Filtration Plant (LAAFP) Control Room at Sylmar.\r\n\r\nA dry media chlorine mini-scrubber unit (MS) has been installed at the Rowena Chlorination Station.  The MS is an emergency chlorine scrubber intended to protect personnel working in the building or immediate area from a chlorine gas release from the pressure safety relief valve installed on the piping between the vacuum regulator and the chlorinator.  Mini-scrubber can neutralize up to 25 lbs of chlorine, and the media manufacturer specifies chlorine removal to less than 5 parts per billion. The mini-scrubber is activated automatically at a chlorine concentration of 1 ppm.\r\n\r\nIn the event power is lost at the chlorine facilities, an alarm will alert the LAAFP control room.  Chlorine flow will continue unaffected, with no safety consequences.\r\nThe facility is normally unoccupied; water treatment operators visit the facility daily.  A response team coordinated from LADWP Los Angeles Aqueduct Filtration Plant (LAAFP) responds to any trouble alarms which may occur.  Access to the facility is through gates, which are kept locked all the time.\r\nSummary o"
