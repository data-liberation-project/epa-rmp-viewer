      "SummaryText": "Chlorine is the most commonly used substance for disinfecting drinking water.  The addition of chlorine or chlorine compounds to water is called chlorination.  Chlorination is considered to be the most important process for preventing the spread of waterborne disease in drinking water.  The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP) also uses chlorine for drinking water disinfection purposes to protect public health per state and federal water quality standards.  Storing and handling large quantities of chlorine can create hazardous situations. The LADWP takes safety obligations in storing and using chlorine as seriously as it takes in providing safe drinking water.  The LADWP Rowena Chlorination Station chlorine handling process is subject to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program and Plan and also to the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program requirements.  The facilities subject to the EPA and CalARP regulations are required to prepare and update Risk Management Plans (RMPs).  The RMP is to include policies and procedures followed to safely operate the facility and the actions, which will be taken by the facility in an event of an emergency.  The LADWP prepared and submitted RMPs for the Rowena Chlorination Station in June 1999, June 2004, and June 2009.  This RMP is the five-year update of the June 2009 RMP.  The LADWP prepared Program Level 2 RMPs in 1999 and 2004 because Rowena Chlorination Station is not subject to Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations.  However, in the excess of caution, the LADWP decided to prepare a Program Level 3 RMP in 2009.  Thus, this 2014 update of the 2009 RMP demonstrates compliance with the Program Level 3 requirements. \n\n\n\nThe following information is specifically required in the RMP Update Executive Summary: \n\n\n\n?

All applicable requirements of the State of California and EPA's Prevention Program are adhered to, including key elements such as training, systems management, and emergency response procedures.  \n\n\n\nThe LADWP emergency response policy involves the preparation of emergency response plans for hazardous materials which are tailored to each facility and to the emergency response services available in the community, and is in compliance with the EPA and CalARP Program Emergency Response Program Requirements.  The LADWP has prepared an Emergency Response Plan for the Rowena Chlorination Station to facilitate coordination and emergency planning with offsite response officials and facilities in the event of an emergency.  The Emergency Response Plan has been coordinated with the local response agency (City of Los Angeles Fire Department).  The Rowena Chlorination Station has an excellent record in preventing accidents from occurring.\n\n\n\nGeneral Facility and Regulated Substance Information\n\nThe Rowena Chlorination Station is located at 2947 Hyperion Avenue in Los Angeles, California.  This facility can feed into four chlorination points; into the pipeline exiting the tank, into the pipeline entering the tank, into the Rowena Pump Station suction pipeline, and into the pond circulation pipeline. The station has a building which houses four chlorinators, chlorine in ton containers, load cells, associated process piping, and instr"

There is a maximum of four one-ton containers at the chlorination station. Three containers can be attached to the chlorine header for discharging chlorine gas.  A fourth container can be stored onsite but is not connected to the system. The one-ton container is the largest vessel (container) on line. The maximum quantity of chlorine present at the Rowena Chlorination Station at any given time exceeds the listed threshold quantities in the EPA and CalARP regulations.  It also exceeds the listed threshold quantities in the federal and California Occupational Safety and Health Administration (CalOSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Standards. However, the facility is normally unoccupied and water treatment operators visit the facility daily and respond to any trouble alarms which may occur.  Thus, the LADWP Rowena Chlorination Station is not subject to the federal or the California OSHA PSM regulations.\n\n\n\nThere is a maximum of four chlorine one-ton containers at the chlorination station. Three ton containers rest on load cell scales, which allows the operators to monitor the chlorine weight remaining in the container, and the fourth is stored as a spare and is not connected to the process.  Chlorine gas is withdrawn from the ton container through a vacuum regulating valve, which is installed directly on the container angle valve.  Chlorine gas is pulled under vacuum from the vacuum regulating valve through plastic tubing and the chlorine header lines to one of the three chlorinators provided at the chlorination station. In case of rupture of the plastic tubing connecting the container to the header lines, air would be drawn in rather than chlorine being released, and the vacuum regulator would shut down the chlorine supply at the container angle valve, operating as a shut-off valve. From the chlorinator, the gas is pulled by vacuum to injectors l"

The solution is piped through diffusers into the tank inlet or outlet pipeline, into the pump station suction pipeline, or into the pond circulation line.\n\n\n\nControl of the chlorination process for the tank inlet or outlet pipelines is by residual and flow control.  The pond chlorination system is controlled by ORP (residual) control and the pump station chlorination control by flow proportional feed pacing.  Chlorine residual analyzers continuously monitor and record the treated water residual for the tank inlet and outlet, pump station discharge lines, and the pond.\n\n\n\nChlorine leak detectors are provided inside the chlorine building, which alarm locally as well as at the LADWP's Los Angeles Aqueduct Filtration Plant (LAAFP) Control Room at Sylmar.\n\n\n\nA dry media chlorine \"mini-scrubber\" unit (MS) has been installed at the Rowena Chlorination Station.  The MS is an emergency chlorine scrubber intended to protect personnel working in the building or immediate area from a chlorine gas release from the pressure safety relief valve installed on the piping between the vacuum regulator and the chlorinator.  Mini-scrubber can neutralize up to 25 lbs of chlorine, and the media manufacturer specifies chlorine removal to less than 5 parts per billion. The mini-scrubber is activated automatically at a chlorine concentration of 1 ppm.\n\n\n\nIn the event power is lost at the chlorine facilities, an alarm will alert the LAAFP control room.  Chlorine flow will continue unaffected, with no safety consequences.\n\nThe facility is normally unoccupied; water treatment operators visit the facility daily.

At modified facilities, MOC requirements have been met.\n\n?    Training of each operating and maintenance employee involved in the process is complete.\n\n\n\nThese procedures ensure that no new and/or significantly modified process will startup and no regulated substances will be introduced into such a process before the pre-startup safety review.  This constitutes a final check that the process and equipment are ready to go and that the recommendations of the PHA have been implemented or adequately addressed.  This will ensure that the design and construction of a new or modified process is safely executed and that the facility is prepared to operate it.\n\n \n\nMechanical integrity procedures for the plant ensure that written maintenance procedures are implemented and documented, including training of maintenance personnel.\n\n\n\nMaintenance \n\nThe LADWP operates a maintenance program, MAXIMO Program that generates a work order for performing the preventive maintenance routine, which occurs after a designated time past the closing of the previous work order for that particular maintenance activity.  Description of the work to be performed is included with the printed work order.  The water treatment supervisors are responsible for the maintenance of the chlorination system. \n\n \n\nIn addition, the written maintenance procedure is provided in the O&M Manual as follows: Preventive maintenance schedules are provided which summarize inspection, test, and maintenance schedules on a daily, weekly, bi-monthly, monthly, biannual, and annual, every 2 to 10 years, and on as-needed basis.  These procedures allow the operator to rapidly review what maintenance is necessary.  The schedules are supplemental to the log sheets onsite and provide a summary and quick reference to manufacturer's O&M manuals.  A maintenance log book is prov"

The hot work procedures require the issuance of a hot work permit whenever it is conducted on or near the chlorination process and other areas deemed appropriate as described in these procedures.  Fire prevention and protection systems are in place before a hot work permit is issued. The permit indicates the dates the work is authorized for, the location, and specific operational requirements, and it is kept on file in the administrative office. \n\n\n\nThe LADWP Management of Change procedures include steps required to be taken by plant personnel before implementing changes to chlorination equipment, procedures, raw materials, and processing conditions.  Training, process safety information, operating procedures, and maintenance procedures are updated according to the changes made.\n\n\n\nInternal Compliance Audits\n\nThe LADWP has been certifying every three years (or earlier) that compliance with Program 2 Prevention Program requirements is met and that procedures and practices developed are adequate and being followed. Starting June 2009, the LADWP certified compliance with Program 3 Prevention Program requirements. The two most recent audit reports and a list of the recommendations are retained in the LADWP's files.\n\nThe compliance audit consists of separating the RMP program elements or sections, and auditing each element to determine compliance and effectiveness.
