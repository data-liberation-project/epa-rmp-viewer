Rinchem has developed an emergency response program to minimize the effects of accidental releases of Ammonium Hydroxide (Ammonia anhydrous), Chlorine or Arsine to employees (vapordispersion modeling demonstrates no impact public receptors). Rinchem management has opted to respond to releases of these chemicals by containing the spill when it can be safely done and using contracted services for spill cleanup.\r\nThe Colorado Springs Warehouse Emergency Response Program consists of:\r\nEmergency Action Plan and Hazardous Waste Contingency Plan\r\nChemical Exposure and Chemical Spill Cleanup Procedure\r\nEmergency Evacuation Plan\r\nThe Emergency Response Program outlines the instructions and required information in order to respond to fire, chemical spills, natural disasters and other emergencies that may arise. The emergency response planand documents are reviewed at least annually and revised as necessary to reflect changes that may occur to content and structure of the plan."

Worst-Case Release Scenario\r\nWell-documented offsite consequence analyses are essential to adequate communication of potential hazards at the Rinchem Colorado Springs, CO Warehouse. Rinchem conducted an offsite consequence analysis,using the EPA's Areal Location of Hazardous Atmospheres (ALOHA),RMPcomp in conjunction with the rules specified in 40 CFR 68.25 to estimate the offsite consequence of a Worst-Case Scenario (WCS) from our warehousing process. The WCS associated with toxic substances in the Colorado Springs, CO warehouse is a catastrophic failure of the single largest container resulting in a release of the total contents, 55 gallons of Ammonium Hydroxide (Ammonia anhydrous), 100lbs of Chlorine and 585g of Arsine (each shown separately). The passive mitigation measures taken into account for this scenario are the limited quantity of any of the three chemicals that can be released due to container and the handling of containers within the building.\r\n1.4. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\nRinchem management realizes that implementation of appropriate administrative and technological safeguards ensure the safety of the workers and the continued safety of public receptors. Those recommendations that are planned for implementation will be discussed in Planned Changes to Improve Safety. The safeguards shown in Table A-1 include both administrative and technological safeguards that prevent, detect, or mitigate releases of chlorine.\r\n1.5. The Five Year Accident History\r\nThere has never been a reportable accident involving Ammonium Hydroxide (Ammonia anhydrous), Chlorine or Arsine or any other chemical at the Rinchem Company Inc, Colorado Springs, CO Warehouse.\r\n1.6.
