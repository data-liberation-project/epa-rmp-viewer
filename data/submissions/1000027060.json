The Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at the Rinchem Company Inc., Colorado Springs, CO Facility\n\nRinchem Company, Inc. (Rinchem) is committed to being a responsible member of the community in which it operates by giving top priority to operating in a safe and environmentally sound manner. Policy dictates that Rinchem personnel continuously identify methods to reduce the risk of handling hazardous materials and to reduce the risk to the community and environment through implementation of new technology and\n\nprocedures. This commitment to safe and environmentally sound operations is documented in the Team Member Handbook, and the mission statement, which are available to all employees. The Safety and Health policy states:\n\nSAFETY FIRST is more than a slogan at Rinchem...it is a way of life. Rinchem Company, Inc., is committed to providing a safe working environment for its staff members, its customers and the public, and maintains that \"NO JOB IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF OUR STAFF MEMBERS, OUR COMMUNITIES, AND THE ENVIRONMENT\".\n\nWe recognize that the responsibilities for safety and health are shared:\n\nManagement, in particular the Director of Quality, ES&H, accepts the responsibility for leadership of the safety and health program, for its effectiveness and improvement, and for providing the safeguards required to ensure safe conditions.\n\nManagers and supervisors are responsible for ensuring processes are documented which reinforce safety as well as the use of engineering controls as the preferred method of promoting safety and eliminating unsafe conditions.\n\nStaff members are responsible for cooperation with all aspects of the safety and health program including compliance with all rules, documented procedures, and regulations and for continuously practicing safety while performing their duties.\n\nStaff members are responsible for stopping activities that may lead to injuries to themselves or"

However, safety requires the participation of everyone...only you can make safety a reality. Be alert for conditions which appear unsafe. Report unsafe conditions immediately. Report any accident, \"near miss\", exposure, incident, spill or release.\n\n1.2. A Description of the Colorado Springs, CO Facility and Regulated Substances Handled\n\n1.2.1. Description of the Colorado Springs, CO Facility\n\nThe Colorado Springs, CO facility is located at 3835 Wabash St., Colorado Springs, CO 80906. The facility provides transportation and public warehousing services for manufacturers, distributors and end users of prepackaged specialty chemicals. Warehousing activities include shipping, receiving and storage of chemicals as specified by customer requirements. The chemicals stored at the Colorado Springs, CO Warehouse include chemicals containing toxic hazards. Ammonium Hydroxide (Ammonia anhydrous), Chlorine and Arsine, are the only RMP regulated substances handled at the site.\n\n1.2.2. Description of the Warehousing and Storage Processes\n\nRinchem receives Ammonium Hydroxide (Ammonia anhydrous), Chlorine and Arsine by truck as shipped from the manufacturer or distributor. It is unloaded from the truck using a forklift and staged for inspection. After the material passes quality and safety inspection, it is placed into the hazard specific storage area until it is shipped to the end user. The storage location of each material is tracked in an electronic inventory management system.\n\nAfter an order is received, Rinchem ships "

After the material passes inspection, it is loaded on to a truck for shipment using a forklift.\n\n1.3. Worst-Case Release Scenario\n\nWell-documented offsite consequence analyses are essential to adequate communication of potential hazards at the Rinchem Colorado Springs, CO Warehouse. Rinchem conducted an offsite consequence analysis,using the EPA's Areal Location of Hazardous Atmospheres (ALOHA),RMPcomp in conjunction with the rules specified in 40 CFR 68.25 to estimate the offsite consequence of a Worst-Case Scenario (WCS) from our warehousing process. The WCS associated with toxic substances in the Colorado Springs, CO warehouse is a catastrophic failure of the single largest container resulting in a release of the total contents, 55 gallons of Ammonium Hydroxide (Ammonia anhydrous), 100lbs of Chlorine and 585g of Arsine (each shown separately). The passive mitigation measures taken into account for this scenario are the limited quantity of any of the three chemicals that can be released due to container and the handling of containers within the building.\n\n1.4. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nRinchem management realizes that implementation of appropriate administrative and technological safeguards ensure the safety of the workers and the continued safety of public receptors. Those recommendations that are planned for implementation will be discussed in \"Planned Changes to Improve Safety\". The safeguards shown in Table A-1 include both administrative and technological safeguards that prevent, detect, or mitigate releases of chlorine.\n\n1.5. The Five Year Accident History\n\nThere has never been a reportable accident involving Ammonium Hydroxide (Ammonia anhydrous), Chlorine or Arsine or any other chemical at the Rinchem Company Inc, Colorado Springs, CO Warehouse.\n\n1.6.

Rinchem has developed an emergency response program to minimize the effects of accidental releases of Ammonium Hydroxide (Ammonia anhydrous), Chlorine or Arsine to employees (vapordispersion modeling demonstrates no impact public receptors). Rinchem management has opted to respond to releases of these chemicals by containing the spill when it can be safely done and using contracted services for spill cleanup.\n\nThe Colorado Springs Warehouse Emergency Response Program consists of:\n\nEmergency Action Plan and Hazardous Waste Contingency Plan\n\nChemical Exposure and Chemical Spill Cleanup Procedure\n\nEmergency Evacuation Plan\n\nThe Emergency Response Program outlines the instructions and required information in order to respond to fire, chemical spills, natural disasters and other emergencies that may arise. The emergency response planand documents are reviewed at least annually and revised as necessary to reflect changes that may occur to content and structure of the plan.\n\n"
