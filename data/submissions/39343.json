The RMP established three levels of requirements for the program.  Programs 1 and 2 are for facilities that pose less risk to the environment and therefore have reduced compliance requirements.  Program 1 is designed for \"no impact\" facilities and has the fewest requirements, while Program 3 is the most stringent of the three levels.\n\nThe program level for each facility is determined by:\n       Use of regulated substances in threshold quantity\n       Impact of an off-site public receptor (e.g., residence, school, park)\n       North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code\n       Five-year accident history\n       OHSA PSM (29 CFR 1910.119) applicability. \n\nDelta Terminal Services (Jefferson) is regulated under Program 3 requirements under 40 CFR 68.10 because:\n       The facility stores monoisopropylamine (MIPA) and dimethylamine (DMA) in excess of the threshold quanitites.\n       A release from this facility could impact an offsite public Receptor (residence).\n       It is subject to the OSHA PSM rule.\n\n40 CFR Part 68 Subpart G applies to an owner or operator of a stationary source that has more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance in a process, as determined under 40 CFR 68.115, Delta Terminal Services (Jefferson) stores more than the threshold quantity of monoisopropylamine (5,000 lbs.) and dimethylamine (10,000 lbs).  \n\nTherefore, Delta Terminal Services (Jefferson) is required to submit a Risk Management Plan (RMP).  Delta Terminal Services (Jefferson) receives railcar and tank truck shipments of these two chemicals, the largest of which can store approximately 103,459 lbs of MIPA 121,451 lbs of the DMA mixture at any one time.\n\nDelta Terminal Services is committed to oper"

Employees involved in operating the monoisopropylamine and dimethylamine activities are thoroughly trained to identify and understand the hazards posed by this the transfer process.  Process safety and emergency response materials are kept on site and periodically reviewed.  Materials include information pertaining to the hazards of monoisopropylamine and dimethylamine, process technology, process equipment, and emergency response procedures.\n \nThe facility is required to complete one worst-case release scenario per hazardous substance handled [68.165(a)(2)] to determine program applicability.  Delta Terminal Services has chosen to use the U.K. HSE TNT Equivalency Method  to determine the distance to an overpressure to determine offsite impacts.\n\nThe facility maintains written process safety information to enable employees involved in handling monoisopropylamine and dimethylamine to identify and understand the hazards posed by this process. Written information includes physical properties, health risks associated, and material safety data sheets."
