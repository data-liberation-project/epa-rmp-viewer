Inkster Terminal in Taylor Michigan, hereafter referred to as the Inkster Terminal, we are committed to providing a safe work environment for employees and to being a responsible corporate citizen. We believe that excellent performance in the areas of health, environment, safety and security goes hand-in-hand with operational excellence and financial success.   In fulfilling this commitment, we will comply with regulatory requirements and provide and maintain a safe working environment using acceptable and proven business practices. All Sunoco Logistics employees will strive to identify and eliminate hazards which could result in injury and illness, damage to the environment, property damage, and security losses.\n\n\n\nThe Inkster Terminal is operated and maintained in a manner that protects the environment, as well as the health and safety of our employees, contractors and the community in which we operate.  We promote health, safety, and the environment through programs of awareness, compliance, prevention and protection.  These programs include a combination of accidental release prevention and emergency response planning.  This summary provides a brief overview of the risk management activities that we have designed and implemented.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nThe primary function of the Inkster Terminal is to receive, store and transfer liquid petroleum gas (LPG), specifically Butanes.  LPG's are stored in 8 underground caverns ranging in  from ~100,000 to 150,000 bbls each and in two 60,000 gallon pressure vessels for a total storage capacity of approximately 950,000 bbls.  LPG enters and leaves the facility through Department of Transportation (DOT) Part 195 Regulated underground pipelines and through truck loading and unloading stations.   \n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAMS\n\n\n\nOur acci"

The covered process is regulated by the EPA Risk Management Program regulation 40 CFR Part 68, and the OSHA Process Safety Management standard 29 CFR 1910.119. The following accident prevention programs are in place at the Inkster Terminal:\n\n\n\n1)    Employee Participation\n\n2)    Process Safety Information\n\n3)    Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) with Risk Assessments\n\n4)    Standard Operating Procedures\n\n5)    EHS Operator Training\n\n6)    Contractors \n\n7)    Pre-startup Safety Review\n\n8)    Mechanical Integrity with Preventive Maintenance\n\n9)    Work Permits\n\n10)    Management of Change\n\n11)    EHS Accident or Potential Catastrophic Event Investigation\n\n12)    Emergency Response\n\n13)    Compliance Audits\n\n14)    Trade Secrets\n\n \n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\n\n\n\nOffsite consequence analysis was performed to estimate the potential for an unexpected release of Butane that could affect the public or the environment. The offsite consequence analysis consisted of evaluating both worst-case scenarios and alternative case release scenarios.  Sunoco Logistics has submitted these release scenarios to the United States Environmental Protection Agency.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThe Inkster Terminal has not had an incident in the last five years involving LPG or that caused or had the potential to cause injury, death, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place scenarios.  No further issues have been observed in this system.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM \n\n\n\nThe Inkster Terminal maintains compliance with local, state and federal regulations including OSHA CFR 1910.120, Oil Pollution Act of 1990 and SARA Title III. The programs are reviewed and updated on an annual basis, or more often if required.  Our Emergency Response Plan provides the essential planning and training for protecting emplo"
