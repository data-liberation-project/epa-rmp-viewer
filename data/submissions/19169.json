Qualified personnel carry out maintenance operations with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\nRFAAP utilizes a computer-based management of change (MOC) system.  MOC procedures and reviews can be accessed through any plant computer that has network access.  The system is designed to solicit review and approval from the appropriate personnel prior to implementation.  Each MOC document whether it is to perform a process or procedural change contains at a minimum the following information:\n\n7 The technical basis for the proposed change\n7 Impact of the change to safety and health\n7 Modifications to operating procedures\n7 Necessary time period for the change\n7 Authorization requirements for the proposed change\n\nIf the MOC system results in a major change to one of the covered processes the RMP will be updated and resubmitted as appropriate.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nThe Plant Process Control Board (PPCB) at RFAAP conducts pre-start up reviews before the process is allowed to operate.  Representatives from Safety, Hazards, Environmental, and Operations attend the pre-startup evaluation to determine if there are any problems that must be addressed prior to the process being allowed to start.  If there are deficiencies identified by the PPCB, the process must correct the deficiencies before the process may start up.\n\nCompliance Audits\nRadford Army Ammunition Plant conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.

The objective of the incident investigation is to obtain the necessary information to prevent the incident/accident from occurring again. Radford Army Ammunition Plant promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation\nRadford Army Ammunition Plant truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  RFAAP requires that operators participate in investigations, PHAs, etc.  Since the operators work with the equipment daily, it has been determined that they are an excellent resource.  Also, all reports generated regarding any operation are available to any operator at RFAAP.\n\nContractors\nAll contractors prior to performing any work are required to read, and certify that they understand and will abide by the rules identified in the Safety Rules for Contractors and Subcontractors.  The booklet was written by Alliant Techsystems and updated in August 1998 and describes general safety procedures such as ladder use and facility specific procedures such as what to do when encountering a vehicle that is transporting propellants or explosives.  A copy of this booklet is given to each individual performing contract or subcontract work on plant.

The worst-case scenario considered for this process involves the release of 30,000 lb. of a flammable substance, namely Ethyl ether.  It is assumed that the entire quantity is released as a vapor, which finds an ignition source, with 10 percent of the released quantity participating in a vapor cloud detonation. Under worst-case weather conditions, the maximum distance to the flammable endpoint is less than that to the nearest public receptor.\n\nAlternate Release Scenarios\n\nThe EPA requires that at least one alternate release scenario be identified and analyzed for each covered process subject to the requirements of Programs 2 or 3.  RFAAP has developed and evaluated alternate release scenarios for the three processes subject to the requirements of Program 3.\n\nEPA's General Guidance for Risk Management Programs states that alternate release scenarios are developed to represent a more realistic release and atmospheric conditions.  However, the same conservative, protective endpoints are used.  For each alternate release scenario the neutral meteorological conditions used in estimating the distance to endpoint was a wind speed of 3 meters per second and an atmospheric stability class of D.  To evaluate the alternate release scenarios, we have used the DEGADIS 2.1 air dispersion model.\n\nThe alternative release scenario from the Manufactured Acid Storage Area involves the release of 524,000 lb. of strong Nitric acid into a dike, which is drained into the waste acid treatment system by operators within 30 minutes of the release.

Under neutral weather conditions, modeling determined that the maximum distance to the endpoint is less than the distance to the nearest public receptor.\n\n\nThe Accidental Release Prevention Program\nRFAAP takes all the necessary steps to comply with the requirements of the accidental release prevention program set out under 40 CFR part 68.  A number of processes at the facility are subject to the OSHA process safety management (PSM) standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.  RFAAP is also subject to EPCRA Section 302 notification requirements.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nRFAAP maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nRFAAP conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with each process are identified and controlled.  RFAAP uses several methodologies to complete process hazards assessments (PHA).  The PHAs conducted for the covered processes at RFAAP were performed using either a What If analysis or Fault Tree Analysis.  These studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a minimum of every five years.

An excellent feature that is included in each operating procedure gives the operator the right to refuse to start-up any process at the facility if he does not feel that it is safe.  Procedures are written to provide clear instructions for the operation of all processes at RFAAP including processes subject to the requirements of 40 CFR 68.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nEach employee involved in the operation of any process is trained using the procedures described in Section 14.  All training includes an emphasis on the specific safety and health hazards associated with equipment and chemicals, emergency operations, and safe work practices.  Each operator receives initial training, which involves the reading of the procedure and a walk through of the process operations with the procedure in hand.  Competence in the procedures is determined based on observation by the operator's supervisor.  Every time the procedure is changed each operator must be retrained using the same methods as described for initial training.  If there are no changes to the procedure, each operator is re-trained in the procedure annually.  For each employee at RFAAP a record is kept of that employee's required training, the dates of the last training, and when the employee's refresher training is required.  All training records are maintained in the individual operating areas.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nRadford Army Ammunition Plant carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.

Distances greater than about 10 kilometers are particularly uncertain. EPA intends the estimated distances to provide a basis for a discussion among the regulated community, emergency responders, and the public, rather than a basis for any specific actions. \n\nRFAAP has followed EPA's regulatory requirements and their published guidance in developing our worst-case release scenarios.  \n\nWorst-Case Release Scenarios\n\nRFAAP evaluated a total of seven worst-case release scenarios.  Worst-case release scenarios represent highly unlikely events occurring during the worst meteorological conditions, which are a wind speed of 1.5 meters per second and an atmospheric stability class of F.

As a conservative assumption, 10 percent of the flammable vapor in the cloud is assumed to participate in the explosion.  To evaluate the worst-case scenarios, we have used the equations provided by the EPA in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance as well as the DEGADIS 2.1 air dispersion model and EPA's RMP*Comp(TM). The following provide details of the chosen worst-case release scenarios.  \n\nThe worst-case release scenario from the Ammonia Oxidation Plant involves a catastrophic release of 143,400 pounds of ammonia in a gaseous form over 10 minutes.  Passive mitigation controls such as dikes are taken into account for the evaluation of this scenario.

      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Radford Army Ammunition Plant (RFAAP) are committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  In the unlikely event that such a release does occur, our highly trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  We are also completely coordinated with the Montgomery County Local Emergency Response Committee that provides additional emergency response expertise. RFAAP has been in operation since 1941.  During that 58-year period, there have been no releases that are either in the alternate or the worst-case category described in this plan.\n\nThe Regulated Substances and Applicability\nRFAAP has more than the threshold planning quantity of four regulated substances and is therefore subject to the requirements of 40 CFR 68.  The RFAAP primary activities are Chemical and Propellant Manufacturing (NAICS Codes 325188 - Basic Inorganic Chemical Manufacturing and 32592 - Explosives Manufacturing.).  The four substances stored at RFAAP that are subject to the provisions of 40 CFR 68 are Nitric acid (CAS No. 7697-37-2), Ethyl ether (60-29-7), Ammonia (7664-41-7) and Oleum (8014-95-7).  Table 1 summarizes RFAAP's listed substances, processes, stored quantities and Part 68 applicability status.\n\nTable 1   RFAAP Covered Processes\nArea                                            Regulated Substance   Maximum Quantity Stored    Part 68 Applicability\nAmmonia Oxidation Plant            Ammonia                        570,000 lbs.

      "SummaryText": "s, and will comply with the requirements.\nFive-year Accident History\nRadford Army Ammunition Plant has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases.  Due to the excellent facilities and administrative controls, in the last five years, RFAAP has not had an accidental release that resulted in on site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage or offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.  In fact, in the 58 years that Hercules Incorporated and Alliant have operated the RFAAP, there has never been a release equal to the seven worst-case or the three alternate release scenarios evaluated in this plan.\n\nEmergency Response Plan\nRFAAP maintains two primary plans, the first is the RFAAP Hazardous Material Emergency Response Plan which was developed to provide a plan for responding to a hazardous material release that cannot be controlled by area standard operating procedures.  The plan complements the disaster control plan by giving specific direction to the response and control of hazardous material releases.  The plan addresses all substances regulated by 40 CFR 68 as well as other potentially hazardous chemicals.\n\nThe second is the Disaster Control Plan which was developed to ensure that RFAAP is prepared to effect immediate disaster control recovery operations at the installation level in order to ensure the performance of essential functions and responsibilities in times of natural disaster, civil disturbances, and enemy attack.  Accordingly, planning and organization detailed in the plan are aimed at effecting recovery from the most devastating possibility, but flexible enough to permit its adaptation to recovery from any disaster of lesser magnitude."
