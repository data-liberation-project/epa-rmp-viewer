      "SummaryText": "Chlorine and sulfur dioxide are the two most commonly used substances for treating\nwastewater.  The Yucaipa Valley Water District's Henry N. Wochholz Wastewater \nTreatment Plant (HNWWTP) also uses chlorine (for chlorination) and sulfur dioxide (for \ndechlorination) for treating wastewater to provide safe water discharges to the environment.  \nStoring and handling large quantities of chlorine and sulfur dioxide can create hazardous \nsituations.  Yucaipa HNWWTP takes safety obligations in storing and using chlorine and \nsulfur dioxide as seriously as it takes in providing the environment safe disinfected water.  \nYucaipa HNWWTP's chlorine and sulfur dioxide handling processes are subject to the U.S. \nEnvironmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program and Plan and also to the \nCalifornia Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program.  These Programs require a \nsummary in the Risk Management Plan (RMP) of policies and procedures followed to safely \noperate the facility and the actions which will be taken by the facility in an event of an \nemergency.

County Line Road, in Yucaipa, \nCalifornia.  The HNWWTP has operated since 1986.  The design treatment capacity of the \nplant has increased in stages from the original 3.0 million gallons of wastewater per day \n(mgd) to current capacity of 4.5 mgd.  The wastewater treated at the Plant originates mainly \nfrom approximately 27,000 domestic and industrial users in the communities of Yucaipa, \nCalimesa, San Bernardino and Riverside Counties. Wastewater treatment utilizes the \nactivated sludge process with post-chlorination and dechlorination to yield a tertiary effluent \nfor purposes of re-use and/or discharge.\n      \n      Anhydrous chlorine used for chlorination is delivered to the facility in one-ton \ncontainers and stored inside the chlorine storage room. Anhydrous sulfur dioxide used for \ndechlorination is also delivered to the facility in one-ton sulfur dioxide containers and stored \ninside the sulfur dioxide storage room.\n      \n      The purpose of the chlorination system is to prevent the spread of water"
