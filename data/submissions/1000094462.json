Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\nWe at Solvay USA, Inc. are strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances, and ensure the safety of employees and neighbors.\r\n\r\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\r\nThe Long Beach, California facility's primary activity is the manufacture of surfactants and specialty chemicals.  These products are used in Oilfield Production and are primarily comprised of chemical surfactants that are used as emulsifiers, non-emulsifiers, water droppers, polishers, oil driers, oil brighteners, wetting agents, wax control, water treaters, sediment and sludge control, desalination, paraffin control, H2S scavengers, corrosion inhibitors, and foamers.  The facility also has the capability to make polyols that can be used in the HPC market. \r\n\r\nThe site has three hazardous substances which are above the threshold quantities in a process; thus, these substances are regulated under the CalARP and EPA RMP regulations.  These are Ethylene Oxide, Propylene Oxide, and Epichlorohydrin.\r\nEpichlorohydrin is used for production of Episulfonate Solution, an intermediate used to produce a cocoamidopropyl hydroxysultaine that is used in gas lift applications.  Ethylene Oxide and Propylene Oxide are used to produce alcohols, polyols, diepoxides, alkylphenol alkoxylates, amine alkoxylates, COE's, NPE's, sorbitol alkoxylates, glycerin alkoxylates, TMP alkoxylates, and pentaerythritol alkoxylates.  \r\n\r\n3.

Long Beach facility in accordance with the accidental release prevention requirements of the California Code of Regulation (CCR) Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5 (California Accidental Release and Prevention Program) and 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  The following briefly describe the elements of the release prevention programs that are in place at the facility.\r\n\r\n4. Process Safety Information\r\nSolvay USA, Inc. maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associated with all processes.\r\n\r\n5. Process Hazard Analysis\r\nThe facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure the hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled.  The methodology currently being utilized to carry out these analyses are combined HAZOP and Layers of Protection Analysis.  The analyses are performed by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering, process, and equipment operations.  The safety studies are revalidated at least every five years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  \r\n\r\n6. Operating Procedures\r\nThe facility maintains written procedures which address safety specific to the operating equipment and product manufacturing processes.  These procedures are controlled to ensure that the current version is readily available to operators involved in the processes.  The procedures address various modes of operation, such as normal operations, startup, shutdown, and emergency shutdown.  The procedures are reviewed and updated at a minimum, annually.  \r\n\r\n7. Training\r\nThe facility has a training program in place to ensure that employees operating processes are competent in the procedures associated with the manufacturing processes and equipment for which the employees are responsible.  Refresher training is provided periodically.  Training on safe handling,"

Mechanical Integrity / Preventive Maintenance Program\r\nThe facility has a formal documented Mechanical Integrity / Preventive Maintenance Program.  Regularly scheduled maintenance checks ensure reliability of process equipment.  Process equipment covered by the program includes: pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief systems, emergency shutdown systems, process controls, pumps, and interlocks.  Qualified contractors complete some periodic inspections and tests.  Other inspections and tests are carried out by qualified plant personnel with training in maintenance practices.  Plant personnel are provided specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by inspections and test are corrected in a timely manner.\r\n\r\n9. Management of Change\r\nWritten procedures are in place at the facility to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures.  The most recent revision of the management of change procedure was issued in February 2020.  Process operators, maintenance personnel, and any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions or process equipment are promptly made aware of and provided training to address the modifications.\r\n\r\n10. Pre-startup Safety Reviews\r\nPre-startup safety reviews related to new processes, modifications in established processes, and return-to-service after maintenance work are conducted as a regular practice at the Long Beach facility.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating procedures, maintenance procedures, and emergency response procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to returning the equipment to operation.\r\n\r\n11. Compliance Audits\r\nSolvay USA, Inc. conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the regulations are properly implemented at the Long Beach facility.

Incident Investigation\r\nThe facility investigates incidents that have resulted in, or could feasibly result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are completed to identify the root causes that lead to the incident as well as any corrective actions that should be completed to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future.  All reports are maintained for a minimum of 5 years.\r\n\r\n13. Employee Participation\r\nAt the Long Beach facility, Process Safety Management and accidental release prevention are a team effort.  Plant personnel are strongly encouraged to express their views and concerns related to all aspects of Personal Safety, Process Safety, Accident Prevention, and other general issues.  Plant personnel are strongly encouraged to recommend improvements and solutions to any concerns that they may have regarding these items.  Employees have access to all information created as a part of the facility's implementation of the EPA RMP and CalARP rules, including the process hazard analyses.\r\n\r\n14. Contractors\r\nThe facility utilizes contractors on a regular basis to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.  A safety performance evaluation of each contractor is conducted prior to selection for work on the site.  Contractors are notified and informed of known potential hazards related to the work they will be performing and the processes in their work area.  Contractors are informed of emergency response procedures in the event that there is an accidental release or a regulated substance.\r\n\r\n15. Five-year Accident History\r\nThe Long Beach facility has a record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years.
