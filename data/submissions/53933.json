Old Town Fuel and Fiber's Policies on Accidental Release Prevention\n\nOld Town Fuel and Fiber's basic commitment to responsible stewardship of the environment, protection of the community, protection of employee health, and assurance of product safety extends to the processes covered by the EPA Risk Management Plan (RMP) requirements. The Old Town Fuel and Fiber Mill has developed management systems in compliance with various applicable regulations to prevent the release of regulated substances especially in locations that may cause detrimental effects to employees, the community, or the environment. This is accomplished through a systematic evaluation of process design, process technology, operational procedures, maintenance activities, non-routine procedures, emergency preparedness, training, and several other factors.\n\nOld Town Fuel and Fiber has a commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\nOld Town Fuel and Fiber plans to meet or surpass all regulatory requirements. In the attempt to accomplish this goal, the management systems at Old Town have been developed in such a way that the hazards are identified, understood, and controlled to prevent accidents. The RMP regulated chemical is chlorine dioxide.\n\nOld Town Fuel and Fiber has developed a management system to oversee the implementation of the Risk Management Program in accordance with the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68, Subpart G. The management system is summarized below.\n\nB.    Risk Management Plan - Management Organization\n\nThe Mill Manager has the overall responsibility for ensu"

Mill Description\nOld Town Fuel and Fiber purchased the Old Town Mill from Red Shield Environmental, LLC in November of 2008 after Red Shield shut down operations in May of that year.  Old Town Fuel and Fiber manufactures kraft market pulp at the facility commensing in March of 2009.  The mill is located on the Penobscot River in Old Town, Maine.\n\nThe facility produces northern hardwood pulp. Pulp is produced on one Kamyr continuous digesters. The pulp from the digester is piped to the bleach plant. The bleaching operations use chlorine dioxide, sodium hydroxide, hydrogen peroxide and oxygen. Emissions from the chlorine dioxide stages of the bleach plant are collected and scrubbed with white liquor in a packed tower scrubber. Chlorine dioxide is generated on-site and stored as a dilute aqueous solution. The emissions from this process are"

      "SummaryText": " also controlled by a packed tower scrubber.\n\n2.    Regulated Substances and Process\nOld Town Fuel and Fiber operates a process that has more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance: chlorine dioxide generation and storage. This process stores chlorine dioxide solution in a 190,000 gallon storage tank at typical concentrations of 10.5 grams per liter. The maximum concentration (before interlocks) is 11.5 grams per liter. A full storage tank at this concentration is equivalent to 18,235 lbs of chlorine dioxide.\n\nSince the resulting toxic endpoint distance predicted for the \"worst-case\" release of chlorine dioxide potentially encompasses public receptors, and the bleaching process is subject to OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, this process is subject to Program 3 requirements.\n\n\n\n\nD.    Accidental Release Prevention Program Steps at the Old Town Mill\n\nOld Town Fuel and Fiber has developed and implemented an accidental release prevention program to continuously comply with OSHA's 29 CFR 1910.119, Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals and EPA's 40 CFR Part 68 subpart D, Accidental Release Prevention provisions in the Risk Management Program. The prevention program thus developed and implemented consists of the twelve elements listed below.\n\n1.    Process safety information\nOld Town Fuel and Fiber maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to help ensure the safe operation of the process. The documents address (1) the hazards of the chemicals used in the process, (2) the technology data of the process and (3) the design basis and configurations of the equipment used in the process. The facility ensures that this process safety information is maintained, accurate, and available to all employees, and the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). All of the information and documentation for the RMP Prevention Program is maintained at the facility.\n\nMaterial safety data sheets (MSDS) document the physical and chemical proper"

The facility periodically reviews contractors' training documents and work performance to ensure that safe practices are followed.\n\nOld Town Fuel and Fiber concurs with US EPA's assessment that, \"Prevention of accidental releases requires a holistic approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices\". Therefore, Old Town Mill's prevention program is designed to provide for ongoing management of highly hazardous substances. It is not a list of \"once and done\" actions. Rather it provides a means for assuring safe operations throughout the life of the facility. To this end, Old Town Fuel and Fiber utilizes modern computer managing techniques in coordination with plant-wide awareness to ensure continued fulfillment of prevention requirements.\n\nE.    5-Year Accident History\n\n1.

Emergency Response Program\n\nOld Town Fuel and Fiber Old Town Mill maintains a comprehensive written emergency response program to protect plant workers, the general public and the environment. The program includes plans and procedures for responding to a wide range of events, caused either naturally or accidentally, which have the potential to result in a release of a regulated substance. Old Town Fuel and Fiber emergency response program utilizes the Incident Command System (ICS) which parallels the National Interagency ICS. This is an \"all risk\" system developed for on-scene management of any emergency event. The functional design of the ICS minimizes the impact of personnel changes upon the emergency plan. Periodic emergency drills are conducted within the plant to maintain preparedness and to identify areas for improvement. The emergency response program is updated when necessary, based on modifications made to the plant processes or facilities. In addition, the plant has an emergency preparedness program that addresses maintenance, inspection and testing of response equipment as well as instructions and training that govern use of this equipment.\n\nThe overall emergency response program is coordinated with the LEPC. This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives. Old Town Mill has around-the-clock communications with the LEPC to ensure notification of the public in event of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating a quick response.\n\nG.

This change has resulted in the complete phase out of elemental chlorine from the mill. The use of chlorine dioxide greatly reduces the risks of any potential off-site impacts associated with an accidental release, while also reducing the quantity of organically bound halide effluents produced in the bleaching process. The elimination of elemental chlorine in the bleaching process has reduced the worst-case distance to toxic endpoint. Old Town Fuel and Fiber believes that the conversion to an elemental chlorine-free bleaching process reduces potential risks to its employees, the local communities, and the environment.\n\nH.    Hazard Assessment\n\nThe hazard assessment evaluates the off site consequences of accidental releases on public and environmental receptors. Pubic receptors are off site residences, institutions (such as schools and hospitals), commercial, and office buildings, parks, or recreational areas inhabited or occupied by the public at any time where members of the public could be exposed to toxic concentrations, radiant heat, or overpressure, as a result of an accidental release. Environmental receptors are natural areas such as national or state parks, forests, or monuments; officially designated wildlife sanctuaries, preserves, refuges, or areas; and federal wilderness areas, that could be exposed at any time to toxic concentrations, radiant heat, or overpressure greater than or equal to the endpoints in the risk management program rule, as a result of an accidental release.\n\nThis section describes the worst-case and alternate scenario consequence analyses. These analyses comprise the hazard assessment.\n\nI.    Worst-Case Release Scenario Analysis for a Toxic Substance Release\n\nThe worst-case release scenario for a toxic substance at Old Town Fuel and Fiber is a hypothetical release of the entire contents of a storage tank containing 190,000 gall"

In accordance with the definition of worst case for toxic gases under RMP regulations, the entire 18,235 lbs of chlorine dioxide, in solution, were assumed to be released over a ten minute period. Based on the structural integrity of the tank and interconnected piping, Old Town Fuel and Fiber considers such an event to have an extremely small probability of occurrence and, thus, not of practical interest in terms of risk management and emergency response planning. Therefore, such a scenario is included in the Risk Management Plan for administrative completeness.\n\nChlorine dioxide has a molecular weight that is substantially greater than that of ambient air. For this reason, a concentrated plume resulting from a large accidental release would display dense-gas behavior. That is, the near-field dispersion would be controlled by gravitational \"slumping\" caused by the density difference. EPA's 1996 RMP Off-site Consequence Analysis Guidance (OCAG) lists a number of refined dense-gas dispersion models that are available for off-site hazard assessment applications for risk management programs. Among these models is the Dense Gas Dispersion (DEGADIS) Model (Version 2.1). DEGADIS, developed by the U.S Coast Guard and the Gas Research Institute to simulate dispersion of dense-gas releases, is the only dense-gas model included in U.S. EPA's Guideline on Air Quality Models (40 CFR Parts 51 and 52, Appendix B). DEGADIS has therefore been used to model the chlorine dioxide worst-case release.\n\nThe modeling was conducted using the prescribed weather conditions of 1.5 meters per second wind speed and F stability. These low dispersion conditions are common at night with fair skies. No passive mitigation measures were considered for this hypothetical release.\n                    \nThe toxic endpoint for chlorine dioxide is set by regulation to 1 ppm (0.0028 mg/L). This is equal to the Immediately Dangerous to Life or Health (IDLH) level of 10 ppm, divided by a safe"

The IDLH, developed by the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) is intended to protect healthy workers from irreversible health effects or escape-impairing symptoms for exposures of up to 30 minutes.\n\nUnder Section 68.22 (e), the RMP rule identifies \"surface roughness\" as a parameter to be specified in the hazard assessment. The surface roughness affects the amount of dispersion that occurs within a released plume and influences the distance to toxic endpoint. The surface roughness used in determining the distance to toxic endpoint should be characteristic of the transport path of the plume from the release point to the endpoint distance. 'Urban' surface roughness indicates areas where there are many obstacles, such as industrial buildings or trees. 'Rural' indicates that there are few buildings or forests and that the terrain is generally flat and unobstructed.\n\nIn the immediate vicinity of Old Town Fuel and Fiber, the aerodynamic surface roughness is clearly 'urban' in nature, whereas at greater distances, the surface roughness is more 'rural', especially along the Penobscot River. In order to report the most conservative 'distance to toxic endpoint' estimates in the Risk Management Plan, Old Town Fuel and Fiber has elected to include only the modeling results obtained assuming 'rural' surface conditions. This is reflected in the use of a low 10 cm surface roughness in DEGADIS.\n\nThe modeling indicated a maximum distance of 9.3 miles to chlorine dioxide's toxic endpoint of 1 ppm (0.0028 mgIL). Figure 1 illustrates the hypothetical 9.3-mile radius. The worst-case impact zone encompasses a resident population of approximately 32,500, based on the 2000 Federal Census (Census 2000 TIGER/Line Data). The potential worst-case hazard zone includes schools, public recreation areas, environmental receptors (Sunkhaze Refuge) and industrial/commercial areas.\n\nJ.

The chlorine dioxide pipeline is supported by a pipe bridge, which is approximately 250 feet long. Normal solution strength is about 10.5 grams per liter.\n\nThis alternate-scenario is the rupture of the 6-inch diameter chlorine dioxide pipeline on the pipe bridge inside the bleach plant. It is assumed that the approximately 250 feet of pipe would drain before the flow could be shutdown. This would release 32.21bs of C1O2.\n\nAlternative dispersion modeling was conducted using the U.S. EPA's RMP*CompTM (Version 1.07) software. In accordance with the RMP rule, alternative releases are modeled under typical (rather than worst-case) dispersion conditions. The EPA OCAG default dispersion conditions are neutral atmosphere, with dispersion neither enhanced nor limited (D stability and 3 m/sec wind speed). No mitigation of the release was considered. Because the surface roughness in the immediate vicinity of Old Town Fuel and Fiber is urban in nature, an urban surface roughness value was utilized in the alternative release modeling.\n\nThe estimated distance to toxic endpoint is 0.2 miles. A graphical representation of this scenario is shown in Figure 2. The alternative impact zone encompasses an estimated residential population of approximately 52 persons, based on the 2000 Federal Census (Census 2000 TIGER/Line Data).
