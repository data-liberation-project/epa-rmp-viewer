The Old Town Fuel and Fiber Mill has developed management systems in compliance with various applicable regulations to prevent the release of regulated substances especially in locations that may cause detrimental effects to employees, the community, or the environment. This is accomplished through a systematic evaluation of process design, process technology, operational procedures, maintenance activities, non-routine procedures, emergency preparedness, training, and several other factors.\n\nOld Town Fuel and Fiber has a commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\nOld Town Fuel and Fiber plans to meet or surpass all regulatory requirements. In the attempt to accomplish this goal, the management systems at Old Town have been developed in such a way that the hazards are identified, understood, and controlled to prevent accidents. The RMP regulated chemical is chlorine dioxide.\n\nOld Town Fuel and Fiber has developed a management system to oversee the implementation of the Risk Management Program in accordance with the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68, Subpart G. The management system is summarized below.\n\nB.\tRisk Management Plan - Management Organization\n\nThe Mill Manager has the overall responsibility for ensu"

The maximum concentration (before interlocks) is 11.5 grams per liter. A full storage tank at this concentration is equivalent to 18,235 lbs of chlorine dioxide.\n\nSince the resulting toxic endpoint distance predicted for the worst-case release of chlorine dioxide potentially encompasses public receptors, and the bleaching process is subject to OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, this process is subject to Program 3 requirements.\n\n\n\n\nD.\tAccidental Release Prevention Program Steps at the Old Town Mill\n\nOld Town Fuel and Fiber has developed and implemented an accidental release prevention program to continuously comply with OSHA's 29 CFR 1910.119, Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals and EPA's 40 CFR Part 68 subpart D, Accidental Release Prevention provisions in the Risk Management Program.

This change has resulted in the complete phase out of elemental chlorine from the mill. The use of chlorine dioxide greatly reduces the risks of any potential off-site impacts associated with an accidental release, while also reducing the quantity of organically bound halide effluents produced in the bleaching process. The elimination of elemental chlorine in the bleaching process has reduced the worst-case distance to toxic endpoint. Old Town Fuel and Fiber believes that the conversion to an elemental chlorine-free bleaching process reduces potential risks to its employees, the local communities, and the environment.\n\nH.\tHazard Assessment\n\nThe hazard assessment evaluates the off site consequences of accidental releases on public and environmental receptors. Pubic receptors are off site residences, institutions (such as schools and hospitals), commercial, and office buildings, parks, or recreational areas inhabited or occupied by the public at any time where members of the public could be exposed to toxic concentrations, radiant heat, or overpressure, as a result of an accidental release. Environmental receptors are natural areas such as national or state parks, forests, or monuments; officially designated wildlife sanctuaries, preserves, refuges, or areas; and federal wilderness areas, that could be exposed at any time to toxic concentrations, radiant heat, or overpressure greater than or equal to the endpoints in the risk management program rule, as a result of an accidental release.\n\nThis section describes the worst-case and alternate scenario consequence analyses.

It is assumed that the approximately 250 feet of pipe would drain before the flow could be shutdown. This would release 32.21bs of C1O2.\n\nAlternative dispersion modeling was conducted using the U.S. EPA's RMP*CompTM (Version 1.07) software. In accordance with the RMP rule, alternative releases are modeled under typical (rather than worst-case) dispersion conditions. The EPA OCAG default dispersion conditions are neutral atmosphere, with dispersion neither enhanced nor limited (D stability and 3 m/sec wind speed). No mitigation of the release was considered. Because the surface roughness in the immediate vicinity of Old Town Fuel and Fiber is urban in nature, an urban surface roughness value was utilized in the alternative release modeling.\n\nThe estimated distance to toxic endpoint is 0.2 miles.

The program includes plans and procedures for responding to a wide range of events, caused either naturally or accidentally, which have the potential to result in a release of a regulated substance. Old Town Fuel and Fiber emergency response program utilizes the Incident Command System (ICS) which parallels the National Interagency ICS. This is an all risk system developed for on-scene management of any emergency event. The functional design of the ICS minimizes the impact of personnel changes upon the emergency plan. Periodic emergency drills are conducted within the plant to maintain preparedness and to identify areas for improvement. The emergency response program is updated when necessary, based on modifications made to the plant processes or facilities. In addition, the plant has an emergency preparedness program that addresses maintenance, inspection and testing of response equipment as well as instructions and training that govern use of this equipment.\n\nThe overall emergency response program is coordinated with the LEPC. This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives.

In accordance with the definition of worst case for toxic gases under RMP regulations, the entire 18,235 lbs of chlorine dioxide, in solution, were assumed to be released over a ten minute period. Based on the structural integrity of the tank and interconnected piping, Old Town Fuel and Fiber considers such an event to have an extremely small probability of occurrence and, thus, not of practical interest in terms of risk management and emergency response planning. Therefore, such a scenario is included in the Risk Management Plan for administrative completeness.\n\nChlorine dioxide has a molecular weight that is substantially greater than that of ambient air. For this reason, a concentrated plume resulting from a large accidental release would display dense-gas behavior. That is, the near-field dispersion would be controlled by gravitational slumping caused by the density difference. EPA's 1996 RMP Off-site Consequence Analysis Guidance (OCAG) lists a number of refined dense-gas dispersion models that are available for off-site hazard assessment applications for risk management programs. Among these models is the Dense Gas Dispersion (DEGADIS) Model (Version 2.1). DEGADIS, developed by the U.S Coast Guard and the Gas Research Institute to simulate dispersion of dense-gas releases, is the only dense-gas model included in U.S. EPA's Guideline on Air Quality Models (40 CFR Parts 51 and 52, Appendix B). DEGADIS has therefore been used to model the chlorine dioxide worst-case release.\n\nThe modeling was conducted using the prescribed weather conditions of 1.5 meters per second wind speed and F stability. These low dispersion conditions are common at night with fair skies. No passive mitigation measures were considered for this hypothetical release.\n\t\t\t\t\t\nThe toxic endpoint for chlorine dioxide is set by regulation to 1 ppm (0.0028 mg/L).

The IDLH, developed by the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) is intended to protect healthy workers from irreversible health effects or escape-impairing symptoms for exposures of up to 30 minutes.\n\nUnder Section 68.22 (e), the RMP rule identifies surface roughness as a parameter to be specified in the hazard assessment. The surface roughness affects the amount of dispersion that occurs within a released plume and influences the distance to toxic endpoint. The surface roughness used in determining the distance to toxic endpoint should be characteristic of the transport path of the plume from the release point to the endpoint distance. 'Urban' surface roughness indicates areas where there are many obstacles, such as industrial buildings or trees. 'Rural' indicates that there are few buildings or forests and that the terrain is generally flat and unobstructed.\n\nIn the immediate vicinity of Old Town Fuel and Fiber, the aerodynamic surface roughness is clearly 'urban' in nature, whereas at greater distances, the surface roughness is more 'rural', especially along the Penobscot River. In order to report the most conservative 'distance to toxic endpoint' estimates in the Risk Management Plan, Old Town Fuel and Fiber has elected to include only the modeling results obtained assuming 'rural' surface conditions. This is reflected in the use of a low 10 cm surface roughness in DEGADIS.\n\nThe modeling indicated a maximum distance of 9.3 miles to chlorine dioxide's toxic endpoint of 1 ppm (0.0028 mgIL). Figure 1 illustrates the hypothetical 9.3-mile radius.
