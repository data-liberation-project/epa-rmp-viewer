      "SummaryText": "I. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nL'Oreal, USA (L'Oreal) is making a commitment to worker and public safety, and to the environment.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of the facility.  L'Oreal's policy is to implement reasonable measures to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. Well-defined safety programs are applied to activities involving hazardous chemicals including storage, handling, on-site movement of chemicals, or any combination of these activities.\n\nII. Description of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe L'Oreal Facility located in Walton, Kentucky, is a warehouse used for the distribution of hair care products.  The facility currently receives and stores aerosol cans containing compressed gases and liquids.  The aerosol cans contain a flammable mixture.  The flammable mixtures are found mainly as propellants in small quantities (6- to 12-ounce aerosol cans intended for use as household or salon products).  The facility does not have any regulated toxic substances.  \n\nIII. General Accident Release Prevention Program & Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe L'Oreal Facility will continue to address the RMP release prevention program with the following elements. \n- Safety Information: The L'Oreal Facility keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to ensure safe operation of the process.  These documents address hazards of the aerosols at the facility, process technology and process equipment.\n- Hazard Review:  Within this program, the process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n- Operating Procedures: The L'Oreal Facility uses skilled personnel that have appropriate training to assure the work they are doing is completed correctly and in a manner that"

The Facility maintains the following safety equipment: spill kits, fire extinguishers, non-sparking EE-rated fork truck forks, smoke and heat alarms, fire protection system including in-rack sprinkler system, Lower Explosive Limit (LEL) monitoring/alarm system, separate aerosol storage room with fire door(s), and ventilation system.\n- Training: The L'Oreal Facility has an effective emergency response training program for employees, which includes chemical spill response measures.  The facility also has a comprehensive fork truck driver training program to minimize driver error.   \n-Incident Investigation:  The L'Oreal Facility has an Incident Investigation procedure in place, to be used as needed.\n\nIV. Five-year Accident History\n\nThe L'Oreal Facility has an excellent record of accident prevention over the past five years. There have been no accidental releases of regulated substances in the past five years.\n\nV. Emergency Response Information\n\nThe L'Oreal Facility has developed and implemented written emergency response procedures to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment. The plan consists of elements such as: communication procedures for responding to a chemical spill; response to a fire, severe weather response, security emergency, or medical emergency.  The emergency response program is updated, when necessary, based on factors such as modifications made to the site or change in the communication procedures.\n\nVI. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe L'Oreal Facility will continue to improve employee training resources, safety information and"

Certification pursuant to 40 CFR 68.12(b)(4)\n\nBased on the criteria in 40 CFR 68.10, the distance to the specified endpoint for the worst-case accidental release scenario for the following process is less than the distance to the nearest public receptor: Aerosol Storage Room. Within the past five years, the process has had no accidental release that caused offsite impacts provided in the risk management program rule (40 CFR 68.10(b)(1)). No additional measures are necessary to prevent offsite impacts from accidental releases. In the event of fire, explosion, or a release of a regulated substance from the process, entry within the distance to the specified endpoints may pose a danger to public emergency responders. Therefore, public emergency responders should not enter this area except as arranged with the emergency contact indicated in the RMP. The undersigned certifies that, to the best of my knowledge, information, and belief, formed after reasonable inquiry, the information submitted is true, accurate, and complete."
