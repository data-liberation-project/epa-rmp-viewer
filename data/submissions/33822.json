Both compounds are amino acids used in pork and poultry animal feed and in pet foods to improve the nutritional content of the livestock feed or the pet food.  The amino acids are manufactured using an industrial fermentation process.  The amino acids are extracted, purified, and packaged for distribution throughout North America.  Some product is exported to foreign countries.  \n\nAnhydrous ammonia, which is covered under the EPA Risk Management Plan, is used at the Ajinomoto Heartland facility.  Ammonia is used for pH control in the fermentation process and in the extraction process.  \n\nThe Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at Our Facility\n    Ajinomoto Heartland LLC is committed  protecting our employees, the public, and the environment from the risks associated with the use of hazardous industrial chemicals, including anhydrous ammonia.  \n\n    We have taken steps to ensure that anhydrous ammonia is handled safely at our facility.  Mechanical systems are inspected and tested to ensure safety and proper operations.  Our employees are trained in the safe handling of ammonia.  Approximately 75% of our employees have been trained to the HazMat Technician level, which allows quick response to any chemical release situation that may develop.  \n\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n    Regarding anhydrous ammonia, Ajinomoto Heartland LLC is regulated under OSHA?a Process Safety Management (PSM) Program and EPA?s Risk Management Plan (RMP).  Under these programs, we have developed and implemented procedures and we have installed equipment to help minimize the risk of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.
