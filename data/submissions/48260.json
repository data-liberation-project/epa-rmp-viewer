      "SummaryText": "Associated Electric's New Madrid Power Plant, consisting of 2 coal fired 600-MW electric generation units, has installed 2 selective catalytic reduction (SCR) units to reduce NOx emissions.  These systems require approximately 3600 pounds of anhydrous ammonia per hour each; 7200 pounds per hour for the facility.  On-site storage of anhydrous ammonia will not exceed 1,360,000 pounds stored in 4 tanks.\n\nThe RMP relies on the facility PSM program for the anhydrous ammonia system.  The PSM program includes employee training in operations, maintenance and emergency response procedures.  The facility maintains an on-site Emergency Response Team (ERT) which is trained and refreshed annually to the Haz-Mat Technician Level.  The facility is also involved with the Bootheel LEPC.  The on-site ERT is trained and equipped to be able to repond in Level A chemical haz-mat suits with SCBA for emergency response to anhydrous ammonia releases.\n\nThe worst case scenario analysis involves the failure of a single tank and emptying its contents in 10 minutes.  The radius of concern is 9.7 miles.  The alternate case scenario analysis involves the failure of a transfer hose (truck drives away without uncoupling the hose).  Release is instantaneous and the radius of concern is 0.4 miles.\n\nNew Madrid Power Plant is in compliance with the PSM and RMP programs.  Prevention and emergency response procedures are in place to prevent or mitigate the potential for anhydrous ammonia releases.  Passive and active mitigation systems are in place as well.  Employees are involved in the HAZOP analysis process.\n\nIn the 5 years previous to the submission of this RMP there have been no accidental release events that resulted in death, injury, evacuation, sheltering in place, or property or environmental damage either on- or off-site at the New Madrid Power Plant."
