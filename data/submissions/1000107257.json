OSI recently conducted an audit of their Process Safety Management Program / Risk Management Plan and has dutifully implemented the recommendations from that audit. Continuous improvement in safety is an important goal for OSI. In addition to the facility EAP, the plant is included in a community emergency response plan developed by the Jefferson County Local Emergency Planning Committee. \n\nXI.\tManagement Program\nOSI has developed a management system to oversee the implementation of the risk management program elements.  This includes assigning a qualified person (or position) to have overall responsibility for the development, implementation, and integration of the risk management program elements.  If any portion of the program is delegated to others, the names or positions of those individuals are to be documented and the lines of authority defined through an organization chart or similar document.  Jeff Egler, Maintenance Supervisor, is responsible for overall implementation of the Risk Management Program, and has been designated as an emergency contact."

Although the incident resulted in equipment damage, an ammonia release did not occur. Therefore, the OSI facility has not had an accidental anhydrous ammonia release, which resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage onsite, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage in the last five years.\n\nVIII.\tEmergency Action Plan\nOSI has developed an emergency action plan to ensure that in the event of an emergency the facility personnel are aware of the appropriate actions to take and authorities to contact in order to mitigate the effects of a release.  \n\nOSI has communicated and trained facility employees on proper evacuation procedures and has interacted with the Ft. Atkinson Fire Department.  \n\nOSI has coordinated their emergency action plan with the Jefferson County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and the Ft. Atkinson Fire Department.  This coordination effort includes providing each aforementioned agency with a copy of our emergency action plan, providing each with a site diagram and hazardous material information.\n\nAlthough OSI does not have an onsite hazardous materials response team, selected individuals have received HAZWOPER training through classroom instruction, on-the-job training, and drills.
