The only highly hazardous chemical stored or otherwise used in sufficient quantity to\r\nrequire reporting under 40CFR68 is anhydrous ammonia, CAS #7664-41.7. The chemical is used in\r\na closed circuit mechanical refrigeration process.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of anhydrous ammonia in the process requires that Land O'Lakes - Carlisle have an OSHA\r\nProcess Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals: this PSM program creates all of the\r\naccidental release prevention policies for this facility.\r\n\r\nFacility employees will not respond to accidental releases of ammonia at this facility: the Cumberland County Emergency Management response plans have included this Land O'Lakes facility. Appropriate mechanisms are in place to notify these authorities when there is a need for response: facility employees will call 911 and the emergency operators will notify the county hazardous materials response teams.\r\n\r\nThe worst-case release scenario for this facility is the release of a completely-filled High Pressure\r\nReceiver whose contents would be expelled in 10 minutes during an idle system event, which is\r\nextremely rare. The alternative release scenario is the inadvertent over pressurization event causing a relief valve to vent. For the alternative, more-likely scenario, planned mitigation measures include administrative controls that include the strict regulation of process operations. For the worst-case scenario, administrative controls include the strict regulation of process operations which might require the complete idling of the process. The High Pressure Receiver is located in a remote indoor area, with restricted access, in an automatically fire sprinklered room. Only trained refrigeration operator employees and contractor employees are allowed access to the refrigeration machinery room, for the purposes of conducting inspections, tests and maintenance.\r\n\r\nThere have be"
