      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Response Policy \n \nThe Conoco Billings Refinery has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n \nDescription - Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n \nThe Conoco Billings Refinery, located at 401 South 23rd Street, Billings, Montana is owned and operated by Conoco Inc. The refinery operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products (for example, propane, butane, gasoline products, jet fuels, and coke) from raw crude oil. The refinery has several regulated flammables, such as propane and butane. In addition, the refinery processes hydrocarbons using Hydrofluoric Acid (HF), a regulated substance.\n\nDescription - Worst-Case Scenario (WCS) and Alternative Release Scenarios (ARSs)\n \nToxic WCS\n\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with a toxic substances at our refinery is a catastrophic failure in the HF Alkylation process, resulting in a release of 130,000 lbs. of HF acid, released as a gas over a 10-minute period. Although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credits for administrative controls or passive mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating this scenario. The maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 20 parts per million (ppm) (0.018 milligrams per liter) for this WCS is 14 miles.\n\nToxic ARS\n\nThe alternative release scenario (ARS) for HF is a 1-inch seal leak from an acid circulation pump. In this scenario, a release takes place, releasing 960 lbs. of HF acid as a gas over a 10-minute period. The 10-minute "

      "SummaryText": "release duration is the approximate time necessary to depressurize the process into our emergency dump drum and thus stop the release. No other mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating this scenario. The maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 20-ppm (0.018 milligrams per liter) for this ARS is 0.4 miles.\n\nFlammable WCS\n\nThe WCS associated with flammable substances is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) involving the full inventory of 7,600,000 lbs.of butane from our largest storage tank. Administrative controls in place to limit the storage inventory in the tank are not considered; therefore, the full tank inventory is assumed to release, completely vaporize, and ignite, resulting in a VCE. The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this WCS is 1.6 miles. Although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for passive mitigation measures was taken into account for this release scenario.\n\nFlammable ARS\n\nThe ARS for flammable substances at the refinery is a VCE resulting from the release of propane from a propane storage tank (105,000 lbs). The release is expected to be isolated by the operators within 10 minutes (active mitigation). The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this event is 0.3 miles. This event was selected as being a practical scenario for use in emergency planning and response. \n\nFive-Year Accident History \n\nThe Conoco Billings Refinery has an excellent record of accident prevention over the past 5 years. The frequency of all-accidental releases and injuries to our employees has decreased during this period. We investigate every incident thoroughly to determine ways to prevent similar incidents from occurring and keep records of all incidents that occur at our facility. No incidents have occurred that have resulted in off-site impact during this time. The following is a brief summary of the one on-site accident involving the release of a regulated substance.\n\nOn March 30, 1999"
