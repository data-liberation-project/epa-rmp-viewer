      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY - OKLAHOMA STATE UNIVERSITY WATER TREATMENT PLANT RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Oklahoma State University Water Treatment Plant is located on the west side of both the campus and the City of Stillwater.  The plant is near the intersection of Pioneer Street and Virginia Street, 4/10 of a mile north of Oklahoma Highway 51.  The plant furnishes drinking water for the University and is capable of augmenting the needs of the City of Stillwater.   \n\n\n\nAt the OSU Water Plant, the disinfection process uses liquefied chlorine gas in one-ton containers.  Each container holds 2000 pounds of chlorine.  The plant normally has four containers in stock. Of these, two or three of the containers will be full and at least one container will be empty or almost empty.  The OSU Water Plant, like most larger water plants, uses liquefied chlorine gas because it is the most chemically stable form of chlorine to use.  The OSU plant may use from 25-100 pounds of chlorine gas each day of operation.  The use of ton containers allows the maximum time between container changes and the minimum potential for hazard in a leak.  Traditionally, the most dangerous part of chlorine operation occurs during container changes. Because of this, plant regulations allow only the plant Superintendent or the Chief Operator to oversee the replacement of containers.  If either of these people are not available, the containers will not get exchanged until those supervisors become available.  (The system is designed to permit waiting several days before the empty containers must be replaced)  A minimum of two people are required to perform the task, which is performed under strict guidelines. Our strict procedures are the main reasons that there has not been a reportable incident at the OSU plant. There are also chlorine detection alarms, automatic shutoff systems, and other safety devices to provide protection.\n\n\n\n"
