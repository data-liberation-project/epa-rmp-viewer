The safety and health of our employees is our number one priority at the plant. Followed closely by the health and safety of our neighbors and the protection of the environment.\n\nTo minimize any risk to people and environment Channel follows state and federal guidelines in the storage and handling of these chemicals. Channel spill prevention policies include plant inspections every working shift,  securing valves on storage vessels, and continual visual monitoring during the transfer of all chemicals. The company also maintains written emergency response plans in the event that there is a spill or accidental release. The plan includes procedures for notification of the local fire authority and notification of any potentially affected neighbors.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n \nTHE FACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\nChannel Chemical Corporation is located in the Bernard Bayou Industrial Park in Harrison County, Mississippi. The company is located on an 11-acre parcel of land stretching between Seaway Road and Bernard Bayou. Approximately 3 acres of Channel's land is leased out to a gasoline distribution facility.\n\n Channel Chemical is a toll manufacturer - which means it manufactures products for its customers, but produces no products of its own. The majority of the 25 different chemical products manufactured at the facility are for the oil field and soluble metals industries. In the process of producing these chemi"

      "SummaryText": "cal products the company receives and ships a variety of chemicals in both 55-gallon drums and tank truck loads.\n\nHowever, Channel handles only one chemical that is considered hazardous according to the List of Regulated Toxic Substances of 40CFR part 68.130. This chemical is Formaldehyde Solution. The facility receives a tank truck of Formaldehyde Solution (5,000 gallons) an average of twice a month. Channel stores a maximum of 6,000 gallons of Formaldehyde Solution on site. This is usually split between two different storage tanks which are located in a outside diked tank farm.\n\nFormaldehyde Solution is used in several products that Channel manufactures. It is pumped through pipes from the storage tanks to a flow meter in the reactor area. From the meter to the reactor the formaldehyde solution flows through chemical hoses to a designated reactor. Access to the site is restricted to authorized personnel.\n\n\n\n\nWORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND ALTERNATIVE REALEASE SCENARIO.\nWorst-Case Scenario: Failure of Channel's large formaldehyde solution storage tank when it is full would release 5,000 gallons (or 45,600 pounds) of formaldehyde solution. The storage tank is at its fullest level immediately after being filled from a delivery of a tank truck of formaldehyde solution.\n\nIn a complete failure of the storage vessel the entire contents of the tank would empty out into a 40x50-foot concrete dike which would limit the surface area of a pool and thus reduce the release rate of the formaldehyde solution vapors.\n\nThe distance to the endpoint (using the RMP*Comp Model) is 0.20 miles.\n\nAlternative Scenario:  A hose failure during the receiving of a tank truck load of formaldehyde solution.  Based on a normal responsive action of the Channel employee and truck driver unloading of the tank truck, approximately 25 gallons of formaldehyde solution would escape from the hose before emergency valve on the truck could be activated to stop the flow from the truck.

In addition, operators are well versed in the proper handling and monitoring of Formaldehyde Solution whenever it is used in a manufacturing process.
