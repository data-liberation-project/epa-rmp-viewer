              "Description": "The project consists of an inlet compression, cryogenic gas processing train, and pipeline liquid stabilization designed for a capacity of 4,000 BPD of liquids from the plant?s inlet Slug Catchers.  The cryogenic train has a nameplate capacity of 200 MMSCFD.  The facility is designed for expansion to add a 300 MMSCFD cryogenic processing train and either a 32,000 BPD DeEthanizer or a second 300 MMscfd cryogenic processing train.\n\nThe plant design includes three slug catchers, pipeline liquid stabilization, inlet compression, cryogenic processing with molecular sieve and refrigeration compression packages, and residue gas compression.\n\nInlet gas flows from the 24? rich system and is separated from pipeline liquids in the slug catchers.  Gas from the slug catchers is compressed to plant processing pressure via inlet compression.  Liquids from the slug catchers are processed in a stabilizer to remove any entrained methane and ethane and then combined with the NGL liquid product from the cryo unit to be transported via pipeline. Liquids from the facility?s process drains are collected in a closed drain system and stored in a pressurized storage tank for truck loading. Vapors from the closed drain system are routed to the flare.\n\nCompressed inlet gas flows to the cryo unit for further processing.  Inlet gas from the rich system is dehydrated to 5-7 lb/MMSCF water content prior to entering the facility.  The molecular sieve is designed to process gas with less than 57 lb/MMSCF water content.  Residue gas from residue compression is metered and routed to the lean system where it blends with Utica sales gas. NGL is sent to the NGL header and transported via pipeline.  Liquid drop-out is routed to the closed drain system.\n\nPlant utility systems include methanol injection for the cryogenic processing train, fuel gas, hot oil, flare header, combustor, and instrument air systems.\n\nThe facility has been designed in a manner that will minimize the potential for accidental releases from regulated substances.\n\n",

Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n\nIt is XCL's policy to adhere to all Federal and State rules and regulations.  The Clearfork Processing Facility has established a commitment to worker and public safety as well as the environment. This commitment is demonstrated by the release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at the facility. It is XCL's policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. If a release does occur, regular personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release. Also, XCL has coordinated response activities with the Marshall County EMA and local Fire and Rescue Departments.\n\n\n\nB.    The stationary source and regulated substances handled:\n\nThe Clearfork Processing Facility is a new cryogenic gas processing plant located in rural Marshall County, West Virginia, near Glen Easton, West Virginia.  The products handled are flammable mixtures that meet the criteria for the National Fire Protection Association's (NFPA) 4 rating and are handled in quantities that exceed EPA's threshold of 10,000 pounds.  \n\n\n\nC.    The Worst-Case Release Scenarios and the Alternative Release Scenarios\n\n\n\na.    Worst Case Scenario:\n\nSince Clearfork does not have any toxic regulated substances above the threshold quantity, the worst case scenario was only carried out for the uncontrolled release of the largest inventory of flammable mixtures  (CAS 00-11-11), which was more than 10,000 pounds of a mixture of flammable substances that meet criteria for the NFPA-4 rating.  To carry out this analysis, it was assumed that none of the protective barriers in the facility worked.\n\nEPA assumes the worst-case scenario to be a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) and the RMP submittal mus"

      "SummaryText": "t include this information.  For Clearfork, it was assumed that the single pressure vessel with the largest amount of flammable mixture (Demethanizer Surge Tank V-1422) had a catastrophic failure resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  ALOHA (Version 5.4.7), an EPA-sponsored software tool, was used to calculate the distances to 1 psi of overpressure endpoint.  As described in the EPA Risk Management Program Guidance for Offsite Consequence Analysis, the worst-case scenario was carried out based on a release of propane, a component of the mixture in the tank.  Meteorological conditions for the worst-case scenario are defined in 40 CFR ?68.22(b) as atmospheric stability class F (stable atmosphere) and wind speed of 1.5 m/s (3.4 mi/h).  The scenario involved a catastrophic release of the entire contents of the tank of 94,649 lbs.  \n\n\n\nb.    Alternative Case scenarios:\n\nAn alternative case scenario considered a release from one of the three Slug Catchers (V-1020, V-1025 and V-1030) resulting in a vapor cloud fire. Methane was selected as the predominant regulated component of the mixture, as it resulted in a greater distance to the lower flammable limit (LFL) endpoint.  ALOHA was used to predict a distance of 0.30 miles to the LFL endpoint, with a wind speed of 3 m/s and a stability class D with ambient air temperature (77?F).  Meteorological conditions were given in the ALOHA program and followed the methodology described in section 10 of the EPA Risk Management Program Guidance for Offsite Consequence Analysis.  The scenario involved a release of 5,058 lbs/min which continues until the slug catcher has depressured.\n\n \n\nD.    General accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\nThe facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements, which are set out under 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68 of the EPA.
