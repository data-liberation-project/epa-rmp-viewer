      "SummaryText": "Borton & Sons, Inc., based in Union Gap, WA packs and warehouses fresh fruit products obtained from multiple orchards in the\nPacific Northwest. Ammonia is used as a refrigerant in the cooling and storage process. Ammonia is a colorless gas with a\npungent odor that is an irritant to the eyes, nose and throat. Within the refrigeration process Ammonia is present as both a\nvapor and as a liquid under pressure. Please refer to onsite data for ammonia quantities.\n\nThe facility has two refrigeration systems, one with 4 cold storage rooms and 30 CA rooms, and a second high rise system with 6 shipping zones, 4 seg zones, and 8 packed fruit zones.  The systems are served by two separate machine rooms.  Typically, products are stored at +30\u00b0F and higher.  For the machine room serving the cold storage room and 30 CA rooms, the refrigeration system operates as a single stage (one pressure level) with three screw compressors.  In the machine room there are one (1) high-pressure receiver, one (1) suction accumulator, one (1) thermosyphon receiver, one (1) shell and tube heat exchanger, and one (1) liquid transfer system. High-pressure refrigerant liquid is fed out to the system vessels and refrigerating equipment from the high-pressure receiver.  All evaporators in the system are the flooded type and have surge drums that are associated with each particular air unit.  Liquid is gravity fed to the evaporators through the drop leg and liquid supply piping, where a portion is boiled off.  The resultant lighter mixture of liquid/vapor is pushed from the evaporator by solid liquid coming from the surge drum.  The mixture of liquid/vapor is pushed through the liquid vapor return piping to the surge drum where the vapor is separated from the liquid.  The vapor exits the surge drum and goes to the suction accumulator.  From the suction accumulator, vapor is drawn off to the compressors where its pressure is increased.  The compressors then discharge the vapor first through a shell and tub"

The discharged refrigerant vapor is cooled in the shell and tube heat exchanger and condenser, and changes back to a liquid, which then drains by gravity back to the thermosyphon receiver which then drains to the high-pressure receiver both located in the machine room.   The cycle then starts over.\n \nThe High Rise system is served by a machine room with 3 screw compressors, one high pressure receiver, one transfer system, one low pressure recirculatory, and two evaporative condensers.  High pressure liquid is first fed into the low pressure recirculator where the ammonia is allowed to flash and self refrigerate to saturation.  The saturated liquid is pumped out to the zones using semi-hermetic pumps at an overfeed rate of 3:1.  The excess liquid returns back to the low pressure recirculator to be repumped back to the zones as needed.\n\n\nIn order to protect its employees, the public and the environment, Borton & Sons, Inc. has an integrated safety management\nprogram to prevent ammonia releases and mitigate the consequences of a release, should one occur. This program is\ndesigned to comply with the OSHA PSM (29 CFR 1910.119) regulations, WISHA's Process Safety Management (PSM)\nstandards found in WAC 296-67 and EPA's Risk Management Plan (RMP) regulations found in 40 CFR Part 68.\nOff Site Consequence (OCA) data is available for review onsite at the Borton & Sons, Inc. processing plant.\nThe Union Gap facility has an emergency plan that addresses the response necessary for a release of ammonia from the\nrefrigeration system. Because of the pungent odor of ammonia, any leak is easily detected. The compressor rooms are\nprovided with ammonia detectors that sound an alarm if ammonia is detected. The plant maintains a group of trained\nrefrigeration operators and maintenance personnel who are trained and qualified to respond to leaks of ammonia. The\nrefrigeration sy"

In case of a release that\ncould travel off the plant property, calls would be made to the Yakima Fire Department and the Yakima County Office of\nEmergency Management to assist in the response. Other state and federal notifications would be made as required.\nThis facility has had no significant ammonia releases either within the facility or beyond the plant boundaries. There is no five\nyear history of reportable releases of ammonia.\nAmmonia sensing equipment is installed in key areas of the processing facility and auto alarms to refrigeration operators.\nWindsocks are installed at various locations so that they can be seen from any outdoor location at the plant. If a release\nshould occur, this will enable employees to quickly determine the wind direction during the release and to assemble in a predesignated\nassembly location. It will also provide a quick indication of whether the toxic cloud is traveling towards the area of\nlocal receptors (residential areas)."
