      "SummaryText": "The Ada WWTP is committed to minimizing the risk to employees and to the public of injury or death from an accidental release of chlorine. Chlorine gas is the only regulated substance at the Ada WWTP and is used for disinfection of the plant effluent prior to discharge into Grass Creek. The chlorine gas is dissolved in water to form the disinfection agent, liquid chlorine. The maximum amount of chlorine gas at the WWTP at any one time is 8,000 pounds. This represents a maximum of four total one-ton cylinders. This amount exceeds the threshold for EPA's Risk Management Planning of 2,500 pounds. There are possible offsite consequences from a chlorine release, and the facility is covered by OSHA's process safety management standard. Therefore, the Ada WWTP is subject to risk management program level 3.\n\nThe Ada WWTP maintains written operating procedures that provide clear instructions for the chlorine process. These operating procedures are instrumental in ensuring safe operation of the systems and preventing accidental releases. An equipment failure could also result in an accidental release. The WWTP has maintenance procedures that were developed to maintain the on-going mechanical integrity of the process equipment. The Superintendent ensures that all chlorine process safety information is kept up-to-date, and maintained in a format that provides easy access for employees.\n\nThe Superintendent is responsible to make sure that all operators have the required training to properly and safely operate the chlorine process. All new employees must complete initial training, which consists of chlorine specific safety and health hazards, process operations, and emergency operations including shutdown. Each employee must also complete refresher training every three years. The refresher training covers a review of all topics presented in the initial training, as well as any changes to the chlorine process or equipment. Employees are observed in operation to ensure proficiency "

      "SummaryText": "following the training sessions.\n\nProcess Hazard Analyses are conducted to identify, evaluate, and control the risk associated with process hazards and chlorine release scenarios. The overall purpose is to prevent or minimize the effects of a release. The Process Hazard Analysis is conducted on the entire chlorine system. The Superintendent updates the Process Hazard Analysis at least once every five years, or when a major change occurs in the process.\n\nA chlorine gas leak to the atmosphere is the primary hazard associated with this process. The worst case scenario would be represented by the complete failure (rupture) of a one-ton cylinder outside of the chlorine room, releasing 2000 pounds of chlorine into the air. Using EPA's guidance criteria, this release is calculated to take place over 10 minutes. At the evaluation wind speed of 3.4 mph, the chlorine gas would travel 3.0 miles before the concentration drops below the toxic endpoint, the level at which chlorine gas is no longer a hazard to the public. Depending upon the wind direction, such a release could affect a large area of the village and surrounding area. The population within a 3.0 mile radius of the WWTP was estimated to be 7,268 people, based on the 2010 census. This was determined using the \"MARPLOT\" computer software developed by the US EPA and NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration).\n\nVarious alternate release scenarios were considered. The alternate release scenario chosen represents a more plausible possibility than the loss of a complete cylinder. This situation involves the failure or damage of a fusible plug on the chlorine tank. This would allow chlorine gas to escape uncontrolled from the valve for an estimated time of one hour. This type of release would occur within the chlorine room of the wastewater plant, which would provide a reduction in the release rate to the atmosphere. Using EPA's guidance criteria, the total release would be 553 pounds. At a wind speed of 6.7 mph,"

      "SummaryText": " the chlorine gas would only travel 0.1 miles before the concentration drops below the toxic endpoint. Those affected by such a release would be the WWTP employees. The population within a 0.1 mile radius of the chlorine room was estimated to be zero, based on the 2010 census. This was determined using the \"MARPLOT\" computer software.\n\nDuring the past five years, there have been no accidental releases of chlorine from the Ada WWTP. There have been no threats posed to the public or the environment.\n\nIn the event of an accidental release, the WWTP emergency action plan contains the procedures for evacuation of the plant and immediate notification of the appropriate officials. The Hardin County Emergency Management Authority would coordinate the leak response. for control of the chlorine leak and evacuation of any affected residents. The Ada-Liberty fire department has received a copy of this Risk Management Plan to review plant operations, equipment and procedures.\n\n"
