FACILITY RMP PLAN\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY EPA ID# 1000 0004 7816\nLDEQ Facility # 22353\n\nCOMPANY OVERVIEW\n\nVan Waters & Rogers Inc. is a wholesale chemical distributor serving a number of U.S. industries.  Founded in 1924, VW&R supplies the food industry, chemical compounders, pharmaceuticals, mining, forest products, oil and gas producers, electronics, coatings and many other key industries with the chemical raw materials required to produce or refine products used in numerous end-use markets.\n\nVan Waters & Rogers Inc. is a member of the National Association of Chemical distributors (NACD) and complies with the Responsible Distribution Process (RDP), an environmental, health and safety improvement initiative.\n\nSome of the products stored and handled by VW&R are subject to EPA's Risk Management Program rule (40 CFR Part 68).  A key requirement of this rule is the preparation and submission of an RMP Plan, contained herein.  The contents of the RMP Plan are prescribed by EPA, including this Executive Summary.\n\nCORPORATE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE APPROACH\n\n1. Prevention Program for Program 2\n\n* Safety Information\n* Hazard reveiw\n* Operating Procedures\n* Training\n* Maintenance\n* Compliance Audits\n* Incident Investigation\n\n\n2. Emergency Response Approach\n\nVan Waters & Rogers Inc. has an Emergency Contingency Plan in place.  This Plan is shared with local emergency responders who have access to VW&R facility personnel (and up-to-date phone numbers).  VW&R responds to minor incidents but will call in professional emergency responders in the event of all other incidents.\n\nVW&R invites and encourages local emergency responders such as the fire department to visit and familiarize themselves with VW&R products and facilities.  Joint emergency exercises are conducted when possible.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Chemical Repackaging, Storage & Distribution.

The substance is Ammonia Aqueous 30%.\n \nListed below is the way the RMP regulated substance is stored/handled on site and the maximum inventory present at any one time.\n\n1. Ammonia Aqueous 30% is received in bulk by tank truck and off loaded into a 10,000 gal storage tank. The Ammonia Aqueous is then repackaged into 55 gal and 330 gal containers and moved into storage for distribution to our end use customers. In addition to the repackaging of smaller containers we also load tank trucks from our 10,000 gal storage tank for distribution to our end use customers. The estimated maximum inventory of Ammonia Aqueous 30% onsite at any one time will be 43440 lbs for bulk storage tank and warehouse container storage combined. \n\nWORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO & ALTERNATE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\n(including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario.)\n\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the look-up tables and equations provided by the EPA in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for the Program 2 substance as a class involves a catastrophic release from the RMP substances in inventory onsite. The RMP substance is assumed to be immediately released to form a pool of 1 cm height, from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated over 10 minutes. By using Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s wind speed.  Listed below are the maximum distances in miles and the corresponding toxic endpoint of mg/L for the RMP substance inventoried onsite using the above conditions.  RMP COMP software was used to model each scenario. \n\n1. Worse Case Scenario release of 22,440 lbs Ammonia Aqueous 30%, the maximum distance of 0.3 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of .14 mg/L.\n\n2. Alternate Ca"

This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1967 Edition.The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\n Safety Information\n\nVan Waters & Rogers Inc maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\n Hazard Review\n\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is the \"What-If\" technique. The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of five years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Van Waters & Rogers Inc maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\n\nVan Waters & Rogers Inc has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are compet"
