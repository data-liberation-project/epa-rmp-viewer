The natural gasoline liquids are stored in multiple pressure vessels, the largest being 80,000 gallons.  \n\u00b7\tCENTRAL RESOURCES, INC. maintains an emergency response plan in compliance with local emergency response agencies.  The South Coles Levee Gas Plant has a Hazardous Materials Business Plan on file with the Kern County Environmental Health Department and Certified Unified Program Agency.  \n\u00b7\tIn the event of an accidental release, the facility operators are trained to sound the alarm, contact 9-1-1, shut off the source from a safe location or activate one of the emergency shutdown devices, and secure the area.   The 9-1-1 system is used to notify the Fire Department.\n\u00b7\tBased on the criteria of 40 CFR 68.10 and 19 CCR 2735.4, this facility has not had an accidental release in the last 5 years.  This information was verified by the reviewing records from the Certified Unified Program Agency.\n\u00b7\tThe worst-case release scenario of 389,645 pounds of liquefied petroleum gasoline liquids is based on the Environmental Protection Agency model.  The scenario indicates a 1-psi overpressure distance of 0.6 miles.  This distance does not impact public receptors. \n\n\u00b7\tThis is a remote facility.

During the preliminary visits, it was believed that this facility would fall under a RMP/CalARP Program Level 3 due to the process safety management regulatory oversight.
