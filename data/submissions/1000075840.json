Airy, North Carolina.  As a result of the manufacturing process, the following regulated chemicals are present at the facility in quantities that exceed the threshold quantities specified by EPA regulations: toluene diisocyanate (TDI -10,000 pounds) and a pentane mixture (10,000 pounds).  The facility has two covered processes and meets the Program 1 requirements for TDI and Program 3 requirements for the pentane mixture of the Risk Management Program (RMP) regulations  \r\nTDI\r\nTDI is delivered to the facility via railcars, truck, drums and totes and is offloaded into storage tanks.  In the process, TDI is used in the production of polyurethane foam. The facility manufactures polyurethane foam by the vigorous mechanical mixing of polyols with TDI along with water, catalyst and surfactants.  The resultant polymeric network is expanded with carbon dioxide which is formed in the reaction between the water and TDI.\r\nPentane Mixture\r\nNCFI Polyurethanes uses two (2) different chemical components in the blending production of hydrocarbon based foam raw materials.  Polyol and a hydrocarbon blowing agent (the pentane mixture) are blended onsite to create the Poly Blend.    Three (3) different raw material polyols are transferred from the 3,000 gallon storage tanks located within the Pentane Operations Room into the adjacent Max Machinery Blending Unit to formulate the Polyol Blend.  \r\n \r\nB. Accidental Release Prevention & Emergency Response Policies \r\nNCFI Polyurethanes is committed to protecting facility personnel, the public and the environment from any workplace and accidental release hazards.  Appropriate responses to releases of TDI are documented in the Section 7 of the Risk Management Program document.  Safety, environmental protection and risk management programs are fully implemented and coordinated with commu"

NCFI Polyurethanes evaluated one worst-case release scenarios for TDI for inclusion in the Risk Management Plan (RMPlan).

The purpose of the IIP is to ensure the thorough investigation of any incident or \"near miss\" which results in, or could reasonably result in, any injury or unplanned/unanticipated release of chemicals in the workplace.  \r\nThrough the procedures outlined in this IIP, NCFI Polyurethanes will identify the underlying root cause of any incident or near miss in order to develop and implement steps to prevent similar events from occurring in the future. The overriding purpose of each incident investigation is to allow NCFI Polyurethanes to learn from its experiences and to prevent recurrences. NCFI Polyurethanes will make its best effort to obtain accurate factual information without assigning blame to any person or party.\r\nCompliance Audits\r\nIn accordance with the requirements of OSHA's PSM regulations and EPA's RMP regulations, NCFI Polyurethanes has implemented a compliance audit program to verify that the procedures and practices contained in its PSM/RMP Plans are adequate and are being followed.
