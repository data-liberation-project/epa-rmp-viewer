      "SummaryText": "FACILITY DESCRIPTION\n\n\n\nThe Phillips 66 Ferndale Refinery is located in Ferndale, Washington, in Whatcom County. It receives crude oil from multiple sources, which it processes into petroleum products, including gasoline, transportation fuels, LPG, and oils. In addition to the flammable materials associated with crude oil processing, the facility uses hydrofluoric acid in the Alkylation Unit, which is a standard refining application. The processing of the crude oil results in the generation of hydrogen sulfide. Sulfur Recovery Units process the hydrogen sulfide and sulfur dioxide to recover sulfur for sale and to limit SO2 and CO2 emissions to atmosphere at quantities below the allowable limits. \n\n\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\n\nThe federal Risk Management Program requires the Phillips 66 Ferndale Refinery to submit a Risk Management Plan (RMP) for any processes containing regulated substances above their threshold quantities (TQ) at the Ferndale Refinery. The Ferndale Refinery handles hazardous materials onsite, and recognizes a responsibility to safely operate the facility in order to protect its employees and contractors, the surrounding community, and the environment. The facility has taken a proactive stance to promote the overall safe operation of the processes, with programs to prevent accidents from occurring, to plan for emergencies, and to maintain the equipment needed if an emergency does occur. The RMP summarizes existing programs and procedures so that these programs may be reviewed more efficiently.\n\n\n\nThe Ferndale Refinery processes oil into gasoline and refining products. The facility receives oil from many sources via ship, pipeline, and rail, stores it in tanks onsite, and then processes the oil into products to be shipped elsewhere by pipeline, railcar, barge, or truck. The refining process separates the crude oil into five products: gasoline, diesel fuel, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), heavy fuel oil, and sulfur. All products are stored onsite prior to sh"

For regulated substances where emergency response planning guidelines (ERPG) values have been established, RMP requires that the ERPG-2 value be used as the toxic endpoint. RMP also requires an offsite consequence analysis for potential releases of flammable materials. In modeling flammable materials, the stationary source is required to present distances to endpoints resulting from any of the following:\n\n- Explosion: Overpressure of 1 psig.\n\n- Radiant Heat/Fire: Radiant heat of 5 kW/m2 for 40 seconds.\n\n- Lower Flammability Limit: a lower flammability limit as provided in NFPA documents or other generally recognized sources.\n\n\n\nThe facility has modeled alternative release scenarios (ARSs) to show release scenarios that may have a more realistic chance of occurrence. The alternative release scenarios allow the facility to present scenarios that assume the use of administrative and actual controls in place at the facility. Even the ARSs are rare events. The details of the process release conditions assumed for the hazard scenarios and assumptions made are provided in the Worst and Alternative Case Release Scenarios sections of the 2018 RMP Resubmission. \n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThe RMP rule requires facilities to compile a 5-Year Accident History for all RMP regulated substances in covered processes at the facility. As part of the ongoing PSM Program, the facility documents and tracks all incidents and near-misses that occur within the facility. This incident database serves as the basis for the five-year accident history.\n\n\n\nRMP requires facilities to report any incident from a covered process involving a regulated substance and resulting in any of the following:\n\n- Onsite deaths, injuries, or significant property damage\n\n- Offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, evacuations, sheltering-in-place, or environmental damage\n\n\n\nThe Facility had one RMP"

While rodding out low point bleeders in the Alkylation Unit, the tool became disconnected releasing a mixture of LPG hydrocarbons that had approximately 1% HF acid mixed within. Phillips 66 promptly initiated its emergency response procedures to minimize the impact of the release. The leak was isolated by an entry team. All Phillips 66 and contractor personnel potentially impacted by the release were transported to the hospital for medical evaluation and treatment as needed. Employees at an adjacent business were asked to shelter in place. Two members of the public who were driving in the vicinity of the Refinery sought medical evaluation at a local hospital. Both were seen and released that evening. One of these individuals was a Phillips 66 employee who was coming into work and did report for work later that evening. The other individual received medical treatment for a rash a few days later that she believed was caused by the incident. Following the incident, additional training was conducted, reference material for a safe work practice was updated, and a maintenance and an operating procedure were revised.\n\n\n\nPREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe Phillips 66 Ferndale Refinery is committed to the safety of its workers and the public. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources allocated to ensuring the safe design, installation, operation, inspection, and maintenance of our processes and associated equipment. Our approach is to implement reasonable controls to prevent and/or mitigate foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a loss of containment should occur, our emergency response organization will respond to control and contain the release.\n\n\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the refinery.

Contract employees are used throughout the refinery, especially in times of construction, turnaround, or startup, and they are required to adhere to the same safety standards as Phillips 66 employees. The contractor safety program is intended to help assure the refinery that its contractors and subcontractors are qualified and have an effective safety process that meets the requirements of the refinery. Contractors are the responsibility of the Health and Safety Team Lead.\n\n\n\nPP7. Pre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\n\n\nThe purpose of the Pre-Startup Safety Review procedure is to ensure that a new unit or a modification to an existing unit is ready to operate safely. This is a final review to ensure that all important considerations have been taken into account before a change is implemented in the process unit. This includes a check to ensure that all portions of the Management of Change program have been followed, including conducting a PHA, updating Process Safety Information, training personnel, and developing operating and emergency response procedures. It also provides field verification that the equipment is constructed and installed as designed. The PSM Lead is responsible for the PSSR program.\n\n\n\nPP8. Mechanical Integrity\n\n\n\nThe objective of the Mechanical Integrity Program is to assure that equipment used to process, store or handle hazardous chemicals is designed, constructed, installed, inspected, and maintained per good engineering practices. This will minimize the risk of relea"

The Maintenance Manager has overall responsibility for the Mechanical Integrity program. \n\n\n\nPP9. Safe Work Practices (including Hot Work Permit)\n\n\n\nThe refinery provides a safe and healthy work place for employees, contractors, visitors, and the community surrounding the facility. Safe work practices are in place to ensure that potentially hazardous activities are conducted safely. These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel and contractors, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely. Safe work practices are the responsibility of the Health and Safety Team Lead. Safe work practices, such as lock out/ tag out, hot work, etc., are available from the safe work practices manual. Examples of standard safe work practices at the refinery include: \n\n- A control of hazardous energy procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance (lock-out/tag-out)\n\n- A procedure for safe removal of hazardous materials before process piping or equipment is opened\n\n- A permit and procedure to control spark producing activities (hot work)\n\n- A permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space\n\n\n\nThe refinery security organization also tracks and co"

Management of Change\n\n\n\nThe intent of this program is to ensure changes are recognized, formally evaluated, documented, approved by qualified personnel, and communicated to affected employees prior to their implementation. This includes changes to equipment, process chemicals, processing conditions, procedures, facilities, etc., other than \"replacement in kind.\"  The management of change process includes a hazard evaluation of applicable changes using the appropriate methodology (Checklist, What-If, HAZOP, etc.). Management of Change is the responsibility of the PSM Lead and encompasses all prevention programs.\n\n\n\nPP11. Incident Investigation\n\n\n\nThe incident investigation program expands beyond what is required for the EPA RMP regulation. In addition to incidents that have the potential to result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance, it also covers all other incidents and near misses that occur at the refinery. Examples include, but are not limited to: process safety incidents, occupational injuries and illness, unit upsets, production loss, property damage or loss, and environmental incidents such as spills or releases. Incident investigation is the responsibility of the PSM Lead.\n\n\n\nThe intent is to ensure that investigations are conducted in a timely, organized, and objective manner. The purpose of an investigation is not to fix blame, but rather to determine the facts surrounding the incident, present the findings and conclusions, and make recommendations for corrective actions that will prevent a similar occurrence in the future. An incident investigation team will investigate all incidents as defined in Section 68.81 of the Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions.\n\n\n\nNear misses and incidents are reviewed "

The facility is a responsible member of the community by protecting the refinery and neighbors from damaging effects of emergency situations. The facility design, maintenance, operating procedures, and training provide for risk minimization should an accident occur. In spite of all these things, emergencies can arise, sometimes through forces beyond control. The emergency response plan known as the Integrated Contingency Plan (ICP), along with training and drills, is designed to prepare the facility to recognize emergency situations of various types and react promptly and correctly to minimize any ill effects. Local, state, and federal safety rules dictate that the facility study and understand the principles and specifics covered in this preplanning effort and fully understand all roles in the plan.
