Our employees have been trained in their respective emergency actions, including the emergency meeting place and each of their individual responsibilities regarding an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia. In addition, Senior Management reviews the status of each facility and institutes changes to make the facility safer. The Kansas Department of Agriculture (KDA) inspects our plant on a regular basis and we comply with their requests for improvement. In addition, our facilities are in the SHARP's program so this adds another layer of examinations.\n\n\n\nOur employees are trained in safety procedures, site-specific operating procedures, plant maintenance and employees are competency tested over the training material. Each employee uses ammonia proof goggles and gloves during ammonia operations as well as always providing plenty of emergency safety water during nurse tank and maintenance operations.\n\n\n\nWith the above-mentioned training in mind, it makes it very easy to report that absolutely no injury actions or property damage have occurred at this facility for the past 5 years.\n\n\n\nSkyland Grain, LLC.'s anhydrous ammonia program is designed to minimize risk to employees, any first responders, and the surrounding public.  In addition, our program is designed to consult and coordinate response needs with the local emergency planning and response organizations and make sure they are aware of the hazards of anhydrous ammonia.
