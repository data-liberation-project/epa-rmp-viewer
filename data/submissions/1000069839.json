      "SummaryText": "The Spears Road Regional Pump Station (facility) is a publicly owned water treatment facility in north Harris County. The facility receives treated surface water from the City of Houston, retreats the surface water, and distributes water to various municipal utility districts. North Harris County Regional Water Authority has the authority to make all policy and procedural decisions for the facility. A contract operations company operates the facility. The Facility utilizes one toxic chemical, chlorine, to treat surface water. This chemical maybe stored in quantities over the EPA threshold. The chemical feed equipment is used to measure and apply the chemicals to the treated effluent for disinfection. The chemical control system, piping and storage tanks are enclosed in a structure with an emergency standby scrubber system.\n\n\n\nAs part of the Risk Management Program, the Facility has established a prevention program to identify potential hazards and implement operational and maintenance procedures to reduce the risk of an accidental release. The equipment used at Spears Road Regional Pump Station are designed and constructed in accordance with applicable ANSI, ASTM, and ASME standards. The prevention program includes annual hazard reviews, on-going safety training for personnel, daily equipment inspection and annual preventative maintenance. A system has been established to investigate any hazardous incident related to the chemical storage and feed system. North Harris Regional Water Authority has also established a compliance audit team to review the on-going prevention program and update the program as necessary to provide continued protection to the facility\n\nemployees and the surrounding community.\n\n\n\nThe Facility has not had any accidental releases of a regulated toxic substance that caused any on-site or offsite effects within the past five years.\n\n\n\nAs part of the Risk Management Program, North Harris County Regional Water Authority has developed two scenarios "

      "SummaryText": "to evaluate the possible effects of an accidental release and assist emergency personnel to respond appropriately. The\n\n\"worst-case scenario\" and the \"alternative release scenario\" were developed using the EPA's \"RMP*Comp\"\n\n\n\nThe worst-case scenario for the facility is based on the release of an entire 2,000-pound cylinder of chlorine\n\nover a period of 10 minutes. This scenario could have hazardous effects up to 1.3 miles downwind of the\n\nvessel. Within 1.3 miles of the facility, there are homes, schools, businesses, recreation areas and day care\n\ncenters that could be affected by the worst-case release. No active or passive mitigation is considered for the worst-case scenario\n\n\n\nThe alternative scenario for a chlorine release is based on a 1/2-inch diameter rust hole on a chlorine storage\n\nvessel. This scenario considers both passive (enclosure) and active (scrubber system) mitigation measures present This scenario could have hazardous effects up to 0.3 miles downwind of the vessel. The Little York Volunteer Fire Department (LYVFD) is the local emergency responder responsible for handling an accidental chemical release at the Facility. The emergency contact number for this agency is 911. the North Harris County Regional Water Authority has coordinated and provided a copy of the Risk Management Program for the facility to the Little York VFD and the Harris County Office of Homeland Security & Emergency Management for Unincorporated Areas."
