This incident necessitated a facility evacuation and a shelter-in-place situation for the neighboring industrial facility. \r\nThere were no injuries or fatalities.  A thorough incident investigation identified several improvement opportunities. These items have been completed.  \r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM \r\nThe facility is considered a non-responding facility.  However, it maintains a written Emergency Response Plan. In the event of fire or explosion, or a release of a regulated substance from the process, entry within the distance to the specified endpoint may pose a danger to public emergency responders. Therefore, emergency responders should not enter the area except as arranged with the emergency contact indicated within the RMP. The undersigned certifies that to the best of my knowledge, information, and belief, the information submitted is true, accurate and complete. \r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY \r\nPowder Springs Logistics continually reviews its operations, procedures, equipment and risks for improvement opportunities.  As opportunities are identified, they will be evaluated by the owner (Powder Springs Logistics) and/or the operator (Magellan Midstream Partners, L.P.) and implemented if warranted."

The 40 CFR 68 regulated substance at this facility is butane. These activities require compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations as greater than 10,000 lbs are stored onsite. The equipment which handles butane includes two pressure vessels, ten injection pumps and associated piping. The butane pressure vessel and associated piping may contain as much as 27,821,556 lbs of butane. \r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES: \r\nPowder Springs Logistics has a strong commitment to worker and public safety, along with resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and contractors in design, installation, operations and maintenance procedures. If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the Cobb County Police and Fire (LEPC) and request that they respond to the emergency. \r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND MAINTENANCE PROGRAM: \r\nThe regulated butane storage/blending process in the facility is compliant with the fourteen (14) elements of Process Safety Management and other employee training programs, along with operating and maintenance procedures. The process controls listed in Section 7.4e were chosen based on whether or not they were used as safeguards in the last PHA for this facility or if they were recommended from the latest PHA and installed prior to the RMP submittal. There may be other process controls in this facility that were not identified as safeguards in the last PHA. The facility has no Trade Secrets. The facility complies with the Federal and State requirements for leak detection of valves, pumps, and flanges. Inspections are conducted and documented to ensure the integrity of the regulated equipment."
