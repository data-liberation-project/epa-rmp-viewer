Therefore, the Riverside Plant is subject to Program 3 requirements as stated in 40 CFR 68.10. OSHA's PSM standard closely parallels requirements outlined in USEPA's RMP Rule. All elements required by USEPA's 40 CFR 68 - Program 3 Prevention Program are also required by OSHA's PSM. \n\n \n\nWithin the last five (5) years, the Riverside Plant has not had an accidental release of a regulated substance where exposure to the substance, its reaction products, overpressure generated by an explosion involving the substance, or radiant heat generated by a fire involving the substance led to any off-site death, injury, or response or restoration activities for an exposure of an environmental receptor. \n\n \n\nThe Riverside Plant employs 21 full-time employees on-site who will ensure the proper operation and maintenance of the facility. \n\n \n\nEnLink Midstream (EnLink) last submitted an RMP to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) in January 2016. \n\n Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies  \n\n \n\nThe Riverside Plant maintains a policy of safe flammable material handling operations, reducing to the greates"

Furthermore, the Facility has coordinated the emergency response with the Ascension Parish Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and the Geismar Fire Department.  For these reasons, the Riverside Plant meets the exceptions listed in 40 CFR 68.90(b), and therefore the Facility is not required to have the Emergency Response Program as described in 40 CFR 68.95. \n\n \n\nA site map, SDSs, and a list of chemicals kept on-site are maintained at the Facility.  Complete details on the Emergency Response Program required under the PSM Rules are included in the Riverside Plant's PSM Plan, which is kept on-site as a separate document. \n\n \n\n \n\n Safety Improvements \n\nThe Riverside Plant resolves all findings from PHAs, some of which result in modifications to the process.\n\n\n\n          \n\n"
