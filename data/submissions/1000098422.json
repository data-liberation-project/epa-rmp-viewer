NGL is a regulated flammable mixture that is an aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbon mixture.  The regulated flammable chemicals contained in the NGL mixture above 1 percent include ethane, methane, propane, isobutane, Nbutane, isopentane, and pentane. Riverside Natural Gas Liquids Fractionation Facility (the Plant) separates mixed natural gas liquids (NGLs) into commercial products such as propane, isobutane, normal butane and gasoline (C5+). The Plant also receives natural gasoline, a finished product for future distribution in commerce, by tank trucks. \r\n    RGB (refinery grade butane is stored in 3 tanks (TK-101, TK-102 and TK-108). The maximum inventory of RGB at the Facility at any given time is 221,003 gallons (998,582 lbs). The largest RGB Tank is 73,668 gallons (332,861 lbs).

Furthermore, the Facility has coordinated the emergency response with the Ascension Parish Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and the Geismar Fire Department.
