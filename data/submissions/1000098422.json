Therefore, the Riverside Plant is subject to Program 3 requirements as stated in 40 CFR 68.10. OSHA's PSM standard closely parallels requirements outlined in USEPA's RMP Rule. All elements required by USEPA's 40 CFR 68 - Program 3 Prevention Program are also required by OSHA's PSM. \n\n \n\nWithin the last five (5) years, the Riverside Plant has not had an accidental release of a regulated substance where exposure to the substance, its reaction products, overpressure generated by an explosion involving the substance, or radiant heat generated by a fire involving the substance led to any off-site death, injury, or response or restoration activities for an exposure of an environmental receptor. \n\n \n\nThe Riverside Plant employs 21 full-time employees on-site who will ensure the proper operation and maintenance of the facility. \n\n \n\nEnLink Midstream (EnLink) last submitted an RMP to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) in January 2016. \n\n Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies  \n\n \n\nThe Riverside Plant maintains a policy of safe flammable material handling operations, reducing to the greates"

NGL is a regulated flammable mixture that is an aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbon mixture.  The regulated flammable chemicals contained in the NGL mixture above 1 percent include ethane, methane, propane, isobutane, Nbutane, isopentane, and pentane. Riverside Natural Gas Liquids Fractionation Facility (the Plant) separates mixed natural gas liquids (NGLs) into commercial products such as propane, isobutane, normal butane and gasoline (C5+). The Plant also receives natural gasoline, a finished product for future distribution in commerce, by tank trucks. \n\n    RGB (refinery grade butane is stored in 3 tanks (TK-101, TK-102 and TK-108). The maximum inventory of RGB at the Facility at any given time is 221,003 gallons (998,582 lbs). The largest RGB Tank is 73,668 gallons (332,861 lbs).
