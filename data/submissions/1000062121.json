There are two (2) 30,000 gallon propane tanks, one (1) 30,000 gallon propylene tank, one (1) 6,000 gallon propylene tank, and a maximum of two (2) 30,000 gallon propylene rail cars located on-site. Propane and propylene are listed as flammable substances under the Risk Management Plan regulations found at 40 CFR 68 and are managed as a Program Level 3 facility.  The storage quantities of propane is in excess of the threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds.  The facility added the storage of butane filled utility lighters that each contain a maximum of 5.5 ounces of liquid butane.  Aggregate total amount of butane-filled utility lighter storage on-site exceeds 10,000 pounds. \n\n\n\nWorthington manufactures small, flammable-gas filled, steel canisters.  The canisters are normally utilized as propylene or propane gas-operated, homeowner torches.  Bulk delivery, of the gases, occurs by either commercial truck or tanker rail car. The gases are transferred to bulk storage prior to the manufacturing bottle filling process.  Packaged bulk storage (after bottling, before shipping) occurs within an on-site warehouse.  Storage of butane-filled utility lighters also occurs on-site.  \n\n\n\nIt is necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling propane to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to the personal health of Worthington employees as well as to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is Worthington's policy to adhere to applicable federal and state rules and regulations.  Worthington handles propane and propylene in a safe manner utilizing;\n\n1.  Facility design,\n\n2.  Safety equipment and devices,\n\n3.  Safe handling procedures, and\n\n4.  Personnel training.\n\n\n\nIn the previous five years, there have been no propane or propylene releases that have resulted in any on-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damabe"

The plan includes procedures for notification of the local fire authority and evacuation of facility employees.  Worthington relies on the local emergency planning committee (LEPC) and fire department (FD) to respond to an accidental release of a flammable gas.  This response effort has been coordinated and verified by the LEPC.  The FD also coordinates emergency response and fire fighting measures at the location.\n\n\n\nThe facility practices a program of continued improvement for safety and environmental compliance.  These practices and procedures are reviewed, and recommended changes are implemented to improve safety and environmental compliance."
