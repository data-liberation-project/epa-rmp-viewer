Its accidental release policy is an integrated approach, involving employee participation, management practices, written procedures, and training.  Keyera has developed a comprehensive propane accident prevention program considering all aspects of process operation and maintenance.  If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the Shelton Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency. We also maintain incipient stage fire fighting equipment on site. This facility complies with NFPA-58 requirements for LP-Gas storage, and it is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  The facility came online in 2009. \n\nA description of our facility and the regulated substances handled: \nThis facility is a bulk terminal storing LPG for resale to retail propane dealers.  The facility consists of storage tanks, rail cars and piping.\nStorage Tanks*\nFour (4) 30,000-gallon aboveground storage tanks totaling 120,000 gallons or approximately 504,000 pounds.\n*Tanks are not filled beyond 85% capacity, which is 102,000 gallons or     428,400 pounds.\n\nRail Cars*\nSix (6) maximum unattached 33,000-gallon railcars may be on-site at a time for a maximum total of 198,000 gallons or 837,600 pounds.\n*Tanks are not filled beyond 85% capacity, which is 168,300 gallons or     706,800 pounds.\n\nPiping\nAll piping contents will be a portion of the initial railcar or storage tank capacity.\n\nTotal Maximum Inventory = 270,300 gallons or 1,135,368 pounds.\n\nThere are both manual and automatic emergency shutdown systems on all LPG equipment at the site.\n\nThe worst-case and alternative release scenarios:\nOur worst-case scenario is failure of the four 30,000-gallon storage tanks when the storage tanks are filled to the greatest amount allowed (85% at 60F), resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.

The resulting distance to the endpoint extends offsite to 0.6 miles, and public receptors are within the distance to the endpoint.  Keyera has multiple safeguards in place which make this scenario very unlikely.  Our alternative release scenario involves a propane release from a product line at the loading skid over a 2-minute period at a rate of 100 pounds per minute.  An excess flow check valve is the active mitigation system considered in this scenario.  A total of 200 pounds of propane is ignited, resulting is a vapor cloud fire.  This would extend and estimated 0.03 miles.  The resulting distance to the endpoint extends offsite.  The only  public receptors within the distance to the endpoint is the business to the east.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\nThis facility complies with EPAA?s accident prevention rule, the OSHA PSM standard, and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.  The propane system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with NFPA-58 and state law.\n\nFive-year accident history: \nKeyera Energy, Inc. acquired the facility in December 2009.  We have never had an accident involving propane that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or shelterings in-place.  To the best of our knowledge no such incident occurred prior to acquisition by Keyera Energy, Inc.\n\nThe emergency response program:\nKeyera Energy has developed a emergency action plan specific to this facility. In the event of an emergency involving our propane system, it is our policy to notify the Shelton Fire Department and request that they help respond to the emergency.  We also have trained employees in incipient stage fire fighting.  We have coordinated our response plans with the fire department; members of the fire department have been provided the opportunity to visit our facili"
