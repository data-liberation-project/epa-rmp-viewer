Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n\n     At the Ballinger Water Treatment Plant, we handle chlorine, which is one of the toxic chemicals listed\n     by the EPA.  Chlorine is valuable as a disinfectant in the treatment process for water.  By using chlorine\n     as a disinfectant, we are able to provide our customers with a safe drinking water supply.  Certain\n     saftey precautions must be observed when handling chlorine to prevent unnecessary human exposure.\n     It is of the upmost importance to  the City of Ballinger to reduce the threat of exposure to chlorine to our \n     employees and nearby members of the community.  It is the City of Ballinger's policy to adhere to all \n     saftey measures when handling chlorine and therefore, we are constantly in an ongoing saftey\n     program with our employees in regards to handling chlorine.  Included in these saftey programs are the\n     City of Ballinger voluntary fire department and City of Ballinger Police Department.\n\n2.  The stationary source and regulated substances handled:\n\n      The purpose of this facility is to supply safe drinking water to the community of Ballinger, the Rowena\n       Water Supply Corporation, and the North Runnels Water Supply Corporation.  Chlorine is used in our\n       water treatment process to disinfect water.  Chlorine is received by truck and stored at the Ballinger\n       water treatment plant.  We have the proper equipment on site to load and unload one ton containers \n       of chlorine.  Access to the Ballinger Water Treatment Plant is restricted to authorized facility \n       employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.\n\n       The regulated substance handled at this water treatment plant is CHLORINE.\n\nThe maximum amount of chlorine stored at this facility is 5800 lbs.\n\n3.
