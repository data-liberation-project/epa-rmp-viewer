The latest equipment inspections were conducted on November 13, 2020, and the latest review of maintenance procedures was conducted on September 11, 2020.\r\n\r\nRMP MANAGEMENT OF CHANGE:  Operation, safety, and environmental issues must be reviewed prior to initiation of a process change to ensure that they do not compromise the operational safety and integrity of the Anhydrous Ammonia Process, and to minimize adverse effects to worker safety and public health. The Facility RMP Management of Change (MOC) procedures are used to evaluate all changes to process materials, controls, equipment, and procedures. The MOC procedures were last modified on September 14, 2020.\r\n\r\nPRE START-UP SAFETY REVIEW:  The pre start-up safety review (PSSR) applies to additions or modifications to the Anhydrous Ammonia Process that require the safety information to be revised or updated. Whenever changes in affected processes are identified or planned, they must be evaluated as to the need for a pre start-up safety review. This assessment is undertaken in conjunction with the MOC review. Additionally, a pre start-up safety review is performed in conjunction with the MOC review when the proposed change requires modifications to the safety procedures. The most recent change that required a PSSR occurred in 2015, and the PSSR was completed on August 5, 2015.\r\n\r\nCOMPLIANCE AUDITS:  Periodic compliance audits to assess the effectiveness of the written plan must be conducted every three years. Records of the audits and follow-up documentation are maintained to indicate findings and resolution of findings. The most recent compliance audit was conducted on April 25, 2019.\r\n\r\nINCIDENT INVESTIGATION:  Although no incidents involving regulated substances have occurred at the Facility in the last five years, an incident investigation program is in place.
