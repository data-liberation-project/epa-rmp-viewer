The PSM Program includes a preventative maintenance plan which requires all ammonia refrigeration equipment to be periodically inspected and serviced.  This will ensure that the equipment remains in good operating condition and will minimize the probability of accidents due to faulty equipment.  In developing the PSM Program, Greenville Dairy also developed written operating procedures for the refrigeration processes.  These procedures cover all phases of operation and include information on safety devices.  These procedures will be used to train all operators and mechanics who work on the ammonia refrigeration processes to ensure consistency of operation and minimize human error.  In addition, all refrigeration mechanics receive training through the Refrigeration Engineers and Technicians Association (RETA) training course.  These measures ensure that all refrigeration operators and mechanics are properly trained.  Existing safe work practices such as Lockout/Tagout and Hot Work Permit, are reviewed and updated to ensure that all non-routine work can be performed safely.  Other components of the prevention program include collection and review of all equipment information, the development of updated Piping & Instrumentation Diagrams (P&IDs), and the correction of any equipment design deficiencies found.  These actions will ensure that the equipment meets all refrigeration industry standards and that accurate equipment information will be available when needed.  To ensure that the Greenville Dairy refrigeration staff has the skills necessary to identify unsafe conditions, Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) training was conducted.  The staff also performed a PHA of this process.  Other PSM procedures, including Management of Change, Pre-Startup Safety Review, Compliance Audits, and Incident Investigation are also part of the program to ensure continued safe operation and pro"

      "SummaryText": "1.  The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies\n\nThe Winn-Dixie Dairy located in Taylors, South Carolina is owned by Winn-Dixie Stores, Inc. (Winn-Dixie).  Winn-Dixie requires each facility to develop and maintain accident prevention programs and an emergency response plan appropriate to the site.  Each site is also responsible for regulatory compliance issues that apply to the site.  Winn-Dixie\u00bfs corporate and division environmental and safety personnel provide assistance in training for site employees and in budgeting and procurement of safety and training services.\n\n2. The facility and the regulated substance handled\n\nThe Greenville Dairy is located at 2819 Wade Hampton Blvd. in the city of Taylors, South Carolina.  The facility consists of areas for manufacturing and packaging of milk and ice cream, and freezer and cooler storage of perishable and non-perishable items for distribution to the Winn-Dixie Supermarkets.\n\nThe Greenville Dairy has an ammonia refrigeration system that exceeds the 10,000 lb. RMP threshold quantity.  The ammonia refrigeration system\u00bfs equipment is located in the compressor room in the southwest corner of the building and property.  All of the equipment for the system is located inside the building, except for the high pressure receiver (HPR).  The HPR is the largest capacity vessel in the ammonia refrigeration system capable of holding approximately 9,653 lbs. of ammonia. \n\n3. The general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps\n\nThis facility exceeds the ammonia threshold quantity in the ammonia refrigeration system for the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard, 1910.119, and is therefore subject to the PSM requirements. For RMP compliance purposes, this places the Greenville's Dairy facility\u00bfs refrigeration process in the Program 3 level. Greenville Dairy will use its PSM program as the required Program 3 Prevention Program for ammonia. \n\nThe Greenville Dairy facility ha"

Five-year accident History\n\nThe Greenville Dairy facility has had no accidental releases of ammonia in the past five years.\n\n5. Emergency Response Program\n\nThe Greenville Dairy facility has an Emergency Response Program in place.  The program complies with 29 CFR 1910.38.  The site also has some internal emergency response capability and is developing a program to comply with paragraph (q) of 29 CFR 1910.120.  The current plan has been coordinated with the County Fire Department and Hazardous Materials Response Team and the Regional Local Emergency Planning Committee.  Notification is made locally by dialing 911 and by notifying South Carolina Department of Environmental Management at 1(888)481-0125.\n\n6.   Planned changes to improve safety\n\nNo changes are specifically identified but regular training sessions and compliance audits will be conducted.  If shortfalls are noted in the compliance audits then an action plan will be developed and areas of improvement will be addressed in a timely manner."
