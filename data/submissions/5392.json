These programs provide for the implementation of detailed prevention and response procedures when storing and handling hazardous chemicals.  The program objectives are to ensure worker and public safety and provide environmental protection.\n\nOur Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nIt is the policy of the company to conduct all of its operations in a manner, which is consistent with protecting human health and the environment.  It is our policy to comply with all laws and regulations applicable to our operations, including, but not limited to all permitting, recordekeeping, and reporting requirements.  It is our policy that employees and contractors are properly trained and that they have access to information.  It is our policy to audit compliance with applicable laws and regulations and to promptly remedy any noncompliance.\n\nBecause there is absolutely no envisioned gain worth injury or loss of life, the company is committed to safety.  This commitment is demonstrated through our routine safety training sessions for  employees.  In addition, employees working directly with applicable hazardous chemicals receive annual 8-hour hazardous materials refresher training.\n\nEach year, the written emergency action plan is reviewed and/or updated for the facility.  Each year, the company reports the location and quantity of hazardous chemicals stored at their facility to the local fire department, the local emergency planning committee and the state emergency planning committee.  Each year, the company reports the amount of hazardous chemicals used and/or released to the environment to state and/or federal regulatory agencies.\n\nOur Facility and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThis facility is a meatpacking plant lo"

The facility utilizes various conveyors and manual and automated processing and packaging equipment.  Various sanitation chemicals are stored and used for cleaning the facility in strict accordance with USDA food safety regulations.\n\nAnhydrous ammonis is the only substance at the facility that is regulated under the PSM and RMP programs.  This is the same type of ammonia commonly sprayed on fields by farmers to fertilize crops.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is used as a refrigerant throughout the plant to maintain desired meat temperatures in coolers, freezers and working areas.  Expelling heat caused from altering the ammonia between a liquid and a gas state creates refrigeration in the facility.  The refrigeration system consists of a series of compressors, condensers, evaporators, vessels, piping and valves.  About 64,000 pounds of ammonia is in the refrigeration system throughout the plant.\n\nOur Worst-Case and Alternate Release Scenarios\n\nThe distance to the toxic endpoint (0.14 mg/L) of the worst-case release of ammonia extends 1.2 miles offsite.  This scenario assumes that the largest vessel of 11,000 pounds of liquid ammonia is released over 10 minutes with a wind speed of 1.5 m/s and an atmospheric stability class of F.  The EPA Model RMP for Ammonia Refrigeration Guidance, 6/98 was followed and no administrative or passive mitigation factors were assumed.\n\nThe distance to the toxic endpoint (0.14 mg/L) of the alternate-case release of ammonia extends 0.10 miles offsite.  This scenario assumes a pump seal leaks under pressure releasing 1,000 pounds of ammonia  over 10 minutes.  This alternative release was chosen because of its higher probability of occurrence compared to the less likely worst-case scenario.\n\nOur General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe following lists rules, regulations and standards that the company believes are important to"

This system helps provide quality control in making sure the right parts and materials are ordered and that the equipment is serviced in a timely manner.\n\nOur Five Year Accident History\n\nThe facility has experienced one accidental release over the past five years.  The accidental release occurred in 1996 and consisted of approximately 2 pounds of ammonia being released from an evaporator coil damaged by a faulty fan blade hub.  The facility was evacuated and the leak was quickly contained.  There were two minor injuries, and 10 people off site were evacuated.\n\nOur Emergency Response Program\n\nThe facility implements an emergency action plan that addresses various emergency response scenarios.  These scenarios include response procedures for various types of chemical releases, fires and other system failures and natural disasters.  This plan is reviewed annually and made available to the local fire department and the local emergency planning committee.\n\nOur Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nNo substantial projects are currently planned.  Our procedures are established to promote continuous improvement in our operations through inspection, training and auditiing."
