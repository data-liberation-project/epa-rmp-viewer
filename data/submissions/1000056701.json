(HOVENSA) and Limetree Bay Terminals, LLC (Limetree) are parties to an Asset Purchase Agreement (APA) dated January 4, 2016 conveying assets from HOVENSA to Limetree, including all terminal assets and all above-ground refinery assets. At the time of closing, Limetree assumed the compliance obligations with respect to the purchased assets. Limetree also adopted all of HOVENSA's policies and procedures. Limetree's ownership of the terminal and above-ground refinery assets, and the intended operation of those assets, renders Limetree subject to the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68.\r\n\r\nThis RMP will be revised as needed based on business plan changes that affect materials stored onsite or operation of idled refinery assets. \r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF FACILITY AND REGULATED PROCESS\r\n\r\nCurrently, the Facility has one regulated substance (propane) which is addressed in this RMP. At this time, Limetree's business plan includes operation of terminal assets (tanks and docks), the wastewater treatment unit, the power generation units, and the local sales rack (truck loading rack). \r\nThere are two covered propane processes at the Facility. Unit 3316 is the propane storage area for the facility.  Propane is currently stored in four pressurized spheres.  This unit also contains the butane storage spheres; however these spheres are not in service at this time.  Unit 1651 is a wholesale truck rack used to distribute petroleum products (several grades of gasoline, diesel, jet, and propane) to the local market.  The unit also contains four pressurized propane bullets.\r\n\r\nWORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO\r\n\r\nOne worst-case scenario involving flammable substances was identified. The worst case scenario is a failure of the west propane storage sphere containing approximately 1,920,000 pounds of liquid propane, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.

Although numerous controls are in place to prevent such releases and to manage the consequences, no administrative controls (including release prevention measures) or passive mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating these scenarios. Under certain circumstances, these scenarios could reach offsite public receptors. The vapor cloud explosion analysis was performed utilizing ALOHA.  Area beyond Limetree's property that would be affected by the worst-case scenario include commercial and industrial-zoned land, property owned by the Government of the United States Virgin Islands, land utilized for recreational use, residential land (approximately 170 houses) and a school. \r\n\r\nALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO\r\n\r\nOne alternative release scenario involving flammable substances was identified. The alternative scenario is a failure or rupture of the propane loading hose resulting in approximately 2,763 pounds of liquid propane, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion. The vapor cloud explosion analysis was performed utilizing DNV Technica's PHAST dispersion software, and Baker-Skehlow blast overpressure method as employed by Wilfred Baker Engineering, lnc.

The Facility provides routine employment for approximately 150 people (Limetree and Contractor employees). During periods of project work the number of Contractors at the site is expected to increase. The Facility has one regulated flammable: propane. No toxic material is stored here.\r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\r\n\r\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at Limetree. Facilities at the storage terminal, which are regulated by the EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) rule, are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.  This summary addresses each of the PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\n\r\nLimetree maintains a variety of technical documents used to ensure safe operation of each process. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. Documents are maintained in the Facility's LiveLink system and are accessible by all employees. Chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in safety data sheets (SDS) and HAZCOM lists. The Facility ensures that each process is maintained within acceptable operating limits, by usin"

These documents are accessible on-line through the LiveLink system. This information includes materials of construction, design pressures, temperature ratings, area electrical classification, etc. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provide a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\r\n\r\nLimetree has a comprehensive program to ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled. Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage such hazards.\r\nLimetree primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis, \"What-If\", or Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) checklist technique to perform these evaluations.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating, technical, maintenance, safety and engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates process hazards along with accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. \r\n\r\nResolution implementation of mitigation options, in response to PHA findings, is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This risk ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained."

These procedures are referenced by certified operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. These procedures are certified annually, or as often as necessary to ensure that they are current and accurate.\r\nIn addition, Limetree maintains key process parameter documents that provide guidance on how to respond to abnormal operating conditions. This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\n\r\nLimetree requires employees to participate in all facets of their PSM and accident prevention program.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents, developing operating procedures and chemical information, and participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team. Employees have access to all information created as part of the facility accident prevention program. Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the Facility and addresses each accident prevention program element.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\n\r\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, Limetree maintains a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.

This refresher training is conducted at least once every 3 years. All operator training is documented, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\r\n\r\nContractors\r\n\r\nLimetree uses Contractors to supplement its work force.  Some Contractors work on or near process equipment, therefore the Facility: (1) informs contractors of hazards known to the Facility which are related to the Contractor's work and the processes in the area of such work; (2) makes sure that the Contractor understands what to do in the event of an emergency; (3) develops and implements safe work practices, such as permit systems, to control Contractor entrance, presence and exit from the process areas; (4) provides the Contractor with site safety rules and applicable safe operating practice procedures; and (5) requires that Contractors inform site safety personnel of hazards they encounter. This is accomplished by providing Contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.  In addition, Limetree evaluates Contractor safety programs and performance as a part of the Contractor selection process.
