Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nThe MarkWest Liberty Midstream and Resources, L.L.C. (MarkWest) - Mobley facility located in near West Virginia is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers such areas as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is the policy of MarkWest to implement appropriate controls to prevent the possible release of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, MarkWest is completely coordinated with the Wetzel County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPCs) which provide emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substance Handled\n\n\n\nThe primary function of the MarkWest facility encompasses natural gas liquids (NGLs) extraction.  The NGL extracted is considered a Y-grade mixture.  This is the one substance present at the facility that is regulated by Risk Management Plan (RMP) regulations.  The flammable substance is a mixture comprised of ethane, propane, butane, isobutene, pentane, isopentane and C6+ components. \n\n\n\nThe Y-grade is extracted from a natural gas transmission pipeline and briefly held in a surge tank.  A pipeline transfers the liquids from the surge tank to a fractionation facility at another location for further processing.\n\n \n\nSurge tanks are located at each processing train at the Mobley facility.  Generally the surge tanks operate at about 50% of capacity.  The actual amount at any given time may fluctuate due to fluctuations in load to the processing plant.  \n\n\n\n\n\n3.

The worst case and alternative case radii of effect were determined utilizing RMP*Comp software provided by the EPA.\n\n\n\nThe worst-case scenario would be a release of the entire contents of a 53,500-gallon NGL Surge Tank. This would result in a release of 253,213 lbs and impact a radius of 0.5 miles in all directions.\n\n\n\nThere is no alternative-case scenario that would be more common than the worst-case scenario and that would have an impact in the off-site consequence analysis; therefore, one is not required per the RMP regulations.   However, the EPA CDX RMP software will not allow submission without completing an alternative case scenario.  The alternative case scenario will be classified as a process piping release of natural gas for 1 min before the hydrocarbon detection system could trigger an emergency shutdown. At a flow rate of 200 mmcf/d, using a density for methane of 0.042 lb/ft3 and a release duration of 1 minute would result in a total release of 5,833 lbs of methane gas and impact a radius of 0.2 miles in all directions.\n\n\n\nThe worst-case and alternative case radius of impact was determined using the EPA RMP-COMP model.  Populations within those radii were determined using the Circular Area Profiling System (CAPS), Version 10c using data from Summary File 1, 2010 Census and by inputing the coordinate points and the radius of influence.  \n\n\n\n4.    The General Accident Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention \n\n    Steps\n\n\n\nMarkWest has taken all the necessary steps to comply with accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA regulations.

The \"What If?\" methodology is used to carry out these analyses.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at regular intervals.  Any findings related to the hazard analyses are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nFor the purpose of safely conducting activities within covered processes, MarkWest maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial start up, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, normal shutdown, and startup after turn around.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved with the process.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\n\n\nMarkWest has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that the employees operating processes are completely competent in the operating procedures associated with the processes.  New employees receive basic training in process operations followed by on-the-job supervision until they are deemed competent to work independently.  Refresher training is provided as needed.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\n\n\nThe integrity of mechanical operations at MarkWest is ensured through documented maintenance checks on process equipment.

Process operators, maintenance personnel, or any other employees whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and are trained on the specifics of the modification.\n\n\n\nPre-Startup Reviews\n\n\n\nPre-startup safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as required.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating, and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\n\n\nMarkWest conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  These audits are carried out every three years as required by RMP regulations (40 CFR 68.58) and any corrections required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and timely manner.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\n\n\nMarkWest investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident, as well as any corrective actions needed to prevent the release from reoccurring.
