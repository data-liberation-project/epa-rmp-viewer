Facility Policy: \n\n   The owners, management and employees of Innovative Ag Services are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to \n\n   work with the local fire departments, Hardin County LEPC and/or other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the relase to people and the environment.   \n\n\n\n2. Facility information: \n\n   A primary activity at the facility is the storage of fertilizers for sale to farmers. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application as a nutrient for crop production. Anhydrous\n\n   ammonia is stored in tanks designed for this purpose.  \n\n\n\n3. Worst-case Scenario and Alternate Release Scenario: \n\n   An analysis of the potential off-site consequences of hypothetical worst-case and alternative-case accidental releases have been addressed in our Hazard Assessment and information is in our Risk Management \n\n   Program.  \n\n\n\n4. Accidental Release Prevention Program: \n\n   The facility is in compliance with the provisions of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia\" and our state regulations covering \n\n   anhydrous ammonia. The OSHA standard is referenced in this RMP Registration Form; see Section 8.3(b).\n\n\n\n5. Five year accident history:\n\n   There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries or property damage at this facility, nor to our knowledge have there been any accidental\n\n   releases resulting in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, property damage or environmental damage.\n\n\n\n6. Emergency Action Plan:\n\n   This facility has: \n\n   a. A written emergency action plan in accordance with OSHA stan"
