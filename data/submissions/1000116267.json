Schreiber sells its products - which include cream cheese, natural cheese, process cheese and yogurt - to leading retailers, restaurants, distributors and food manufacturers around the world. Schreiber has more than 30 manufacturing and distribution facilities globally.\n\nThe SFI \u0096 Carthage Plant employs approximately 438 people. The SFI plant uses anhydrous ammonia for refrigeration of the products in storage as well as for cooling of manufacturing process lines. Anhydrous ammonia is subject to EPA regulation under 40 CFR 68, Accidental Release Risk.\n\nManagement of Highly Hazardous Chemicals.\nPursuant to the RMP regulations (40 CFR 68) and the Process Safety Management (PSM)\nregulations, SFI has developed a comprehensive PSM written program to protect our employees and the surrounding community from exposure to the hazardous chemicals onsite. The facility completed an initial process hazards analyses (PHAs) for ammonia using the industry standard HAZOP Analysis developed through the International Institute for Ammonia Refrigeration. The most recent PHA revalidations were completed in 2022 using the HAZOP methodology. The original and revalidation PHAs were completed using technical and operations staff from the Carthage Plant as well as experienced facilitators.\nThe PHAs reviewed operational, human factors, and facility siting issues relative to the design of the refrigeration system, and recommendations were made, as appropriate, to address these concerns. SFI's implementation of the PSM program includes employee education in the hazards of ammonia and measures that can be used to reduce employee and community exposure to accidental releases of ammonia. The plans include preventive maintenance programs (mechanical integrity) for the ammonia system, and a program for both pre-startup safety reviews"

The program also includes specific requirements for safe work practices (such\nas safe approaches to welding and similar hot work) and safety requirements for contractors who may be hired to work on the system.\n\nThe program also has a procedure for conducting compliance audits to ensure the PSM program is being implemented at the Carthage facility.\nThe PSM written program incorporates the Plant's emergency response plan and places\nspecial emphasis on handling accidental releases of hazardous chemicals and coordination of\nemergency response with local fire departments and other emergency response organizations.\n\nMany of SFI's refrigeration and maintenance personnel have completed 24-hour HAZWOPER\nHAZMAT technician level training program. This training includes topics such as classification\nsystems and hazard identification; ammonia spill control and containment; respiratory protection; air monitoring instrumentation; proper personal protective equipment; medical monitoring; and proper termination procedures for emergency response activities. The facility conducts annual HAZWOPER refresher training to keep employees current and comfortable with their responsibilities under the plan using classroom discussion and response to mock emergency scenarios.\n\nAs part of the RMP requirements, SFI undertook a review of the potential offsite consequences of the accidental release of the largest vessel in the systems. Although such a release is highly unlikely, the regulation requires this review.\nSFI stores and uses anhydrous ammonia on site for refrigeration of products in storage as well as for cooling of manufacturing process lines. Ammonia is used for its excellent energy efficiency and flexibility, in addition to benefits to employee safety. Ammonia at the facility is kept entirely within the refrigeration system, much as the refrigerant in your car air-conditioner. The SFI - Carthage Plant has not experienced a reportable relea"

Management has committed to working with local agencies and the community to educate the public regarding the hazards of ammonia and to ensure a safe workplace and surrounding community."
