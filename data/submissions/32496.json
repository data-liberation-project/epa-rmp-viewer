An accidental release of a regulated substance would be detected by strategically-located Volatile Organic Chemical (VOC) monitors which would immediately alert production personnel as well as a central alarm station.  All containers are leakproof-tested before and after filling.  A security plan is in place, the facility has a perimeter fence, and all containers / equipment are stored in locked enclosures during off hours.  B.  An Emergency Response Plan has been prepared and submitted to the Orange County LEPC and the Slate Hill Fire Department as well as the State Police and Town of Wawayanda specifying a response and warning system in the event of an accidental release of a regulated substance.  The facility also conducts quarterly evacuation drills.  2. STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES.  A.  The primary activity involving a regulated substance is the repackaging of chemicals into smaller containers for medical sterilization businessand spice fumigation.  B.  The regulated substance is:  Ethylene Oxide.  3.  RELEASE SCENARIO.  A.  Worst Case - Toxic Gas.  Rupture of a pressure drum resulting in the release of 100% of capacity (400 lbs) of ethylene oxide in ten minutes.  B.  Alternative Release - Toxic Gas.  Complete failure of a liquid discharge hose with 100% of capacity (400 lbs) of ethylene oxice released in fifteen minutes.  4.  PREVENTION.  A.  The regulated substance at the Slate Hill plant is covered by the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard.  5.  FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY.  A.  There have been no catastrophic or potentially catastrophic releases of any regulated substance during the past five years.  6.  EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM.  A.  Evacuation drills are conducted quarterly.  An evaluation of each drill is completed and changes are made based on the findings.  B.  Periodic tours are provided to the local fire department.  C.  The plan is file with local response agencies.  7.  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY"
