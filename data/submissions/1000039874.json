The Plan includes an analysis of the potential offsite consequences of an accidental release, a five-year accident history, and a release prevention and emergency response program.  \n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nWilbur-Ellis has implemented release prevention and emergency response procedures to minimize the potential for accidental releases of hazardous materials.  Emergency response procedures including evacuation procedures and notification procedures have been implemented by Wilbur-Ellis.  In addition, Wilbur-Ellis has developed operating procedures and preventative maintenance activities to reduce the likelihood of accidental releases.\n\n\n\nThis Plan and the emergency response procedures document the accidental release prevention, safety, and emergency policies in place at Wilbur-Ellis.\n\n\n\nDescription of Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nWilbur-Ellis is located at 3325 Highway 54 in Dalhart, Texas (the \"facility\").  Wilbur-Ellis is a retailer of fertilizer.  There is one anhydrous ammonia tank located at the facility with a capacity of approximately 18,000 gallons.  The anhydrous ammonia is used by a mobile third party contractor in a reaction process for the production of ammonium polyphosphate.   \n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\n  \n\nWilbur-Ellis has developed and implemented this Plan with the objective of complying with the requirements and guidelines set forth by the Federal Risk Management Plan program.  The Plan's purpose is to enhance the facility's existing safety programs implemented at the site to reduce the possibility of accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia that could cause harm to employees, the public and the en"

The emergency response program, documented in the emergency response procedures, includes accidental release prevention and chemical specific prevention steps.\n\n\n\nWilbur-Ellis ensures that equipment meets the appropriate industry standards prior to use.  Wilbur-Ellis and the third party contractor implement operating procedures and maintenance procedures in accordance with manufacturer and industry specifications to prevent accidental releases at the facility.  Chemical specific prevention steps implemented at the site include pressure relief valves, emergency shut off valves and ammonia training for personnel.\n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThere have been no qualifying accidents involving ammonia in the five-year period prior to the completion of this Plan.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\n\nThe facility coordinates with the Dalhart Fire Department (\"fire department\") regarding specific actions to be taken in response to an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  The facility has established emergency evacuation procedures to evacuate the site and notify the appropriate agencies regarding a release.  The facility's emergency response program is documented in the facility's Emergency Response Procedures.  The emergency procedures contain the following key elements:\n\n\n\n1.    Procedures for informing local agencies responsible for responding to accidental releases.\n\n2.    Information on emergency health care.\n\n3.    Emergency response training for employees.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nPlans to improve safety at the facility were developed based on the results of the process hazard analysis (PHA) and a Risk Management Plan (RMP) site evaluation conducted by an outside contractor.  The Branch Manger is currently working on an implementation schedule for the recommended actions.  Recommended actions include the following:\n\n\n\n1.    Identify controls to prevent filling the storage tank beyond the 85% safe level.\n\n2.    Maintain personal protective equipment in"
