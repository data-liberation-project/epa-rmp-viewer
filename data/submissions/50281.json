Huntsman Port Arthur Base Chemicals (PABC) is committed to achieving excellence in environmental, health and safety.  This is exemplified by PABC having earned the Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) VPP Star Award for excellence in safety performance.  Huntsman PABC maintains a working Process Safety Management (PSM) program, which implements a series of steps to prevent potential hazards associated with the process and assures a well-trained work force.   The PSM program further implements its policies with onsite procedures and manuals.  Huntsman PABC participates with the Jefferson County Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC), Port Arthur Fire Department and the Sabine Neches Chiefs Association to develop emergency response plans and participates in cooperative training with these agencies.  Additionally, Huntsman PABC paticipates in the Southeast Texas Alerting Network, STAN, a public awareness system designed to communicate important information to the people of Southeast Texas.  During community emergencies, local emergency management and industrial officials can post information on the STAN line - (877-THE-STAN.)

The procedures address steps for all operating phases, safety systems, control measures and precautions to prevent exposures to process hazards.  The procedures are reviewed and revised periodically to ensure their accuracy and completeness.\n \nTraining\nHuntsman PABC provides initial training as well as refresher training to employees to assure that the required level of skills and knowledge are maintained.  The training emphasizes safety and health hazards, emergency operations, and safe work practices.  All operators receive periodic refresher training.  \n \nMechanical Integrity\nHuntsman PABC has developed written procedures for maintaining the operating components of the process (including pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown system controls, and pumps) through the mechanical integrity program.  The program is comprised of well-trained personnel who follow maintenance, testing and inspection procedures that ensure proper function of process equipment.\n \nManagement of Change\nHuntsman PABC has established and implemented written procedures to manage changes to process chemicals, technology, equipment, procedures, and any changes to the facility that affect a covered process.  The procedures assure that, prior to any change, the following issues are considered:  the technical basis for the proposed change, its impact on safety and health, any modification to operating procedures, the necessary time period for the change, and any authorization requirements.  Employees involved in operating a process, as well as maintenance and contract employees whose job will be affected, are informed of and trained in the change.  If necessary, the process safety information and operating procedures are updated.\n \nPre-Startup Review\nHuntsman PABC performs pre-startup safety reviews when the"

The pre-startup safety review confirms, prior to the introduction of highly hazardous chemicals, that construction and equipment is in accordance with design specifications; safety, operating, maintenance and emergency procedures are in place; and training of employees affected by modifications is complete.\n \nCompliance Audit\nHuntsman PABC performs audits of its compliance with the provisions of its Process Safety Management Program.  Teams comprised of employees, with appropriate knowledge of audit techniques, process safety and operating experience, conduct audits every three years to verify that the procedures and practices developed are adequate and being followed.  The findings of the audit team are reviewed and appropriate corrective actions are implemented and tracked until resolved.  \n \nIncident Investigation\nHuntsman PABC investigates any incidents that resulted in, or could reasonably have resulted in, a catastrophic release of covered chemicals.  The investigation is promptly conducted, commencing within 48 hours of any incident.  To perform the investigation, Huntsman PABC has established an incident investigation team consisting of persons with the appropriate knowledge and experience to thoroughly investigate and analyze the incident.  A report is prepared at the conclusion of the incident investigation that addresses the incident, the factors that contributed to it, and recommendations resulting from the incident investigation.  Huntsman PABC has established a system to promptly address and resolve the incident report findings and recommendations and to document their resolution.  Finally, incident reports are reviewed with all affected personnel.\n \nEmployee Participation\nHuntsman PABC has developed a written action plan for employee parti"

The emergency response plan is reviewed annually and updated as necessary.  Huntsman is actively involved with informing local stakeholders about hazardous substances stored and processed on site.  Huntsman  participates with the Jefferson County LEPC, Sabine Neches Chiefs Association and Port Arthur Fire Department  in assisting local officials in the development of emergency procedures to identify resources, chemicals, contacts and material safety data sheets for participating companies.  The Team Leader of Emergency Response is the emergency contact in the event of an emergency. The Emergency Response Coordinator for this plant is the designated alternate.  For Huntsman PABC Plant Port Arthur offsite tanks located at MOTIVA, MOTIVA will provide initial response.\n \n6.  Planned changes to improve safety.   There are several planned improvements at PABCt to reduce the on and offsite impacts.  PABC is planning to upgrade the Safety Instrumented Systems (SIS) to current ISA 84 Standards.  There is an ongoing commitment to implement changes, when identified, that will improve the safety of employees and neighbors of the PABC Plant as well as projects that enhance safety, environmental protection and protect neighbors from exposure to accidental releases."

This includes information pertaining to: \nHazards of regulated substances:  For each regulated substance, there is a Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) which discusses the physical properties of the chemicals, exposure hazards, the required personal protective equipment and the appropriate first aid and emergency treatment for exposure.\nThe technology of the process:  Includes a discussion of process chemistry, safe upper and lower limits of temperature and pressure, and analysis of consequences of deviation.\n\nEquipment in the process:  Includes such information as materials of construction, diagrams of the piping and instrumentation, safety systems and design codes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\nHuntsman PABC has performed process hazard analysis (PHA) on each process to identify the potential hazards, the adequacy of the engineering and administrative controls and the ways to minimize those hazards.  PABC utilizes the HAZOP methodology, a recognized and generally accepted method for identifying and evaluating hazards in the process.  PABC assigns employees to the HAZOP team who are knowledgeable in the HAZOP methodology and the specific process.  The HAZOP team develops recommendations to reduce the potential hazards which, if approved, are implemented within a reasonable period of time.  Hurricanes and inclement weather are not investigated in the PHAs; however, Huntsman does have a Hurricane Procedure for PABC and implements this procedure under the threat of a hurricane and inclement weather.\n \nOperating Procedures\nHuntsman PABC maintains written operating procedures that were"
