              "Description": "The Light Olefins Unit (LOU) Process has five units which are the Hot Side, Cold Side, GHU/PHU, PDU and LOU Offsites.  The Hot Side includes the furnaces up through the quench columns.  The Cold Side includes compression, refrigeration, and fractionation.  GHU/PHU are two stage gasoline and pyrolysis gasoline hydrogenation units.   The PDU is the propylene drying and transfer units.  LOU Offsites include tankage, waste water stripping unit, flare, custody transfer stations, and loading racks associated with the LOU.  The process controls, mitigations, monitors and detectors listed apply to all units except as follows:  the PDU and LOU Offsites do not have automatic shutoffs; the GHU/PHU and ColdSide are the only units with quench system process controls; only LOU Offsite unit tankage have dikes; the GHU and part of the PHU do not have process area detectors; and fire detectors are only at the PDU, LOU, Compressor Decks, and LOU Lube Oil Skids.  The flammable mixture mass noted below includes inventories of non RMP flammable chemicals and RMP flammable chemicals below the threshold quantity in the process.  RMP chemicals below the threshold quantity included in the flammable mixture are: Acetylene, Ethyl Acetylene, yclohexlamine, Vinylacetate, Hydrogen Sulfide, Carbon Disulfide, and Hydrogen.",
