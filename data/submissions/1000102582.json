During these meetings we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\n\nDelicato Family Wines Manteca has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the ammonia refrigeration processes. These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release. The results of the analyses are reported in PSMWriter and hard copy binders. \n\n1.3.2 Anhydrous Ammonia\nThe ammonia refrigeration process at the Delicato Family Wines Manteca facility is an integral part of the overall business and operates most of the year.  It is extremely important that this process is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner. Management is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.\n\nOur refrigeration personnel monitor the ammonia refrigeration process and keep an active log book of all procedures and transactions that pertain to ammonia. In addition, the process is checked frequently by one of the outside refrigeration contractors that we use. These contractors also assist in performing the annual mechanical integrity inspection of our ammonia equipment. \n\n1.4 Five Year Accident History\n1.4.1 Anhydrous Ammonia Accidental Releases\nDuring the last five years, there has not been an ammonia accident which caused injuries, or other known offsite/onsite deaths, property damage, environmental damage, sheltering in place or evacuations.\n\n1.5 Emergency Action and Response Plan\nDelicato Family Wines Manteca\u0092s emergency action and response program has been developed to satisfy the following requirements:\n\nCal/OSHA\u0092s Emergency Action Plan \u0096 Title 8 CCR \u00a73220\nU.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration\u0092s (OSHA) Emergency Action Plans - Title 29 CFR \u00a71910.38\nCal/OSHA\u0092s Process Safety M"

It is assumed that the policies and procedures of the responding agency would be consistent with the requirements of HAZWOPER regulations.\n\n1.6 Planned Changes to Improve Safety\nDelicato Family Wines Manteca has implemented many policies and procedures to promote overall plant, worker and public safety. Nevertheless, Delicato Family Wines Manteca continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.\n\nBy utilizing PSMWriter software, all necessary employees have access to every aspect of the RMP-PSM program.

Once the action item has been completed, the resolution can be documented using PSMWriter as well. A list of current or past due action items can be accessed at any time by those with access to PSMWriter.\n\nIn addition to utilizing PSMWriter to create, schedule, track, and document events, Delicato Family Wines Manteca has also entered into a contract with Resource Compliance to obtain help with RMP-PSM program implementation.\n\nFor the future, Delicato Family Wines Manteca now thinks of the RMP-PSM program as a \u0093living document\u0094. It is an interactive framework that guides safe action for Delicato Family Wines Manteca employees, but allows for feedback and continual improvement.
