Ethylene oxide is highly effective in killing bacteria, insects, and fungi.  It serves as an efficient means for sterilization in systems where heat cannot be used to kill such organisms.  The use of ethylene oxide as a sterilant has been the dominant disinfection method in the United States since it was first introduced.\n\nAs one might expect from its superior sterilization properties, ethylene oxide is a hazardous substance.  Thus, storing and handling ethylene oxide can present a risk to employees and the public without proper precautions.  The El Paso facility considers safe practices in storing and using ethylene oxide to be of primary importance and has an excellent safety record with ethylene oxide.\n\nThe El Paso facility ethylene oxide storage and usage is subject to the Environmental Protection Agency Risk Management Program regulation.  This regulation requires submission of a Risk Management Plan (RMP).  An integral part of the RMP is a summary of policies and procedures followed to safely operate the facility, including a description of the possible consequences in case of an accident and the actions, which will be taken by the facility in an emergency.\n\nThe following information is specifically required in the RMP Executive Summary: \n\n* Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies.\n* General facility and regulated substances information.\n* Summary of the accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps.\n* Five-year accident history summary.\n* Emergency response program summary.\n* Planned changes to improve safety.\n\nThe above information for the El Paso facility ethylene oxide sterilization system is provided below:\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe El Paso facility accidental release prevention policy for ethylene oxide involves a unified a"

The sterilizer vessels are contained in the EL and E2 Plant sterilizer rooms. The ethylene oxide supply drums are bonded, grounded and chained, and only non-sparking tools are used to make drum connections.  The lines are purged with nitrogen prior to change out of drums and empty drums receive a nitrogen over-blanket in accordance with Department of Transportation requirements.  Ethylene oxide from the drums is vaporized in a steam-heated vaporizer prior to its introduction into the vessels.  The nitrogen gas is also steam heated prior to its introduction into the vessels.  The vessels are computer controlled by a programmable logic control system.  A system of passwords ensures that only authorized personnel have access to the logic control system.\n    \nThe EL Plant is equipped with an EtO removal and destruction system, which consists of two units: (1) the Flare System, and (2) two Donaldson Abator Units.  EtO-laden air from the sterilization chambers is delivered to the flare system after the flare undergoes a readiness test, and air from the aeration rooms is delivered to the abator units to combust the gas mixture and convert EtO to carbon dioxide and water. \n\nThe E2 Plant is equipped with an EtO removal and reaction system, which consists of passive hydrolyzers followed by active, packed bed wet scrubbing hydrolyzers, all converting used EtO into ethylene glycol.  The EtO storage room at the E2 Plant is vented to one of the active packed bed wet scrubbers to convert any fugitive EtO releases into ethylene glycol.\n\nThe EL Plant EtO storage room is provided with three safe-cell systems.

The El Paso facility mechanical integrity program includes the following:\n\n* Written procedures for maintaining mechanical integrity through inspection and testing of process equipment, based on instructions of equipment vendors, industry codes and practice, and prior operating experience.\n\n* Implementation of the written procedures by performing inspections and tests on process equipment at specified intervals.\n\n* Training of maintenance personnel in preventive maintenance program procedures: safe work practices such as lockout/tagout, line or equipment opening, and avoidance and correction of unsafe conditions; and safe use and application of special equipment and/or unique tools.\n\nHot Work Permits and Management of Change \n\nThe El Paso facility requires employees and contractors to employ safe work practices when performing Hot Work in, on, or around the covered process.  The El Paso facility uses a permitting and training program to ensure that hot work is monitored and conducted safely on or near a process involving ethylene oxide.\n\nThe El Paso facility provides a system and approach to maintain and implement any management of change or modifications to equipment, procedures, chemicals, and processing conditions.  This system allows El Paso facility staff to identify and review safety hazards or provide additional safety, process, or chemical information to existing data before the proposed change would either compromise system safety or require training to be completed.\n\nInternal Compliance Audits\n\nInternal compliance audits will be conducted every three years to verify compliance with the programs and procedures contained in the RMP.  The El Paso facility will assemble an audit team that will include personnel knowledgeable in the Risk Management Program rule and in the process.  This team will evaluate whether the prevention program satisfies the requirements"

      "SummaryText": "of the Risk Management Program rule and whether the prevention program is sufficient to help ensure safe operation of the process.  The results of the audit will be documented, recommendations resolved, and appropriate enhancements to the prevention program will be implemented.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nThe El Paso facility investigates all incidents that could reasonably have resulted in a catastrophic release (serious injury to personnel, the public, or the environment) so that similar accidents can be prevented.  An investigation team is assembled and the investigation is initiated within 48 hours of the incident.  The results of the investigation are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate process enhancements are implemented.  Information found during the investigation is reviewed by affected staff and added or used to revise operating and maintenance procedures.  There have been no such incidents involving the El Paso facility ethylene oxide system.\n\nFive-Year Accident History Summary\n\nNo ethylene oxide releases that could have caused safety or health hazard (deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place) occurred at the El Paso facility during the last five years.\n\nEmergency Response Program Summary\n\nThe El Paso facility is a non-responding facility, which means that the facility employees will not respond to ethylene oxide accidental relaese.  Instead the facility has coordinated with the local response agency to respond to any ethylene oxide release that may occur at the facility.\n\nThe main elements of the emergency response plan are: (1) initial discovery equipment and procedure, (2) response to an emergency, including procedures for immediate action and internal notifications, and (3) procedures for external notifications, including coordination with local agencies. \n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nNumerous changes to improve safety (recommended actions) were identified for the ethylene oxide"
