Box 86.\n\n114 SR 16\n\nUrbana, IN  46990-0086\n\n\n\nFor Further Information Contact:       Roger DuMond,  consultant to Kova Ag Products (Compliance Manager)\n\n\n\nre:  Risk Management Plan for Anhydrous Ammonia-\n\n\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\n\n1.  The Facility Policy\n\n\n\n          The owners, management, and employees of Kova Ag Products @ Urbana are committed to the prevention of accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, Emergency Management Agency, LEPC, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n\n\n2.  Facility Information\n\n\n\n          -The primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to area farmers.\n\n          - Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed to area farmers as a vital crop \n\nproduction nutrient  (nitrogen).\n\n          -The maximum amount stored at this facility would be 600,000 pounds in our two 12,000 gallon, \n\nand one 30,000 gallon storage tanks & all nurse wagons.  Product is routinely loaded into        \n\n1000 gallon mobile tanks for delivery and pick-up by and sale to area farmers, but is rarely \n\nstored in the portable wagons on the property.\n\n\n\n3.  The Worst Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario\n\n\n\n      a. The worst case scenario for this facility would be the release of the total contents of the \n\n          30,000 gallon storage tank as a gas over a 10 minute time span.  The maximum quantity released \n\n          would be 140,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent \n\n          capacity as limited by design standards, industry recommendations, and company policy.  The \n\n          distance to endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) has been calculated for this community \n\n          as 1.68 miles using"

      "SummaryText": " the 'DEGADIS' modeling data charts for rural topography.\n\n      b. The alternative release scenario is based on the five-year accident history and/or \"most likely to \n\n           happen\" release information.  For this facility, we have made our calculation based on hose \n\n           rupture during load-out thru a 1 1/2 inch fill line and a simultaneous emergency excess flow valve          \n\n           fails  to close during rapid flow rate changes associated with the hose rupture.  The distance to     \n\n           endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .92 miles based on rural / agricultural topography \n\n           from the DEGADIS modeling charts.  Since this filling process is always supervised by an \n\n           employee, we calculate maximum time of escape to be two (2) minutes before a secondary shut-\n\n           off measure could be initiated.\n\n\n\n4.  The Accidental Release Prevention Program.\n\n\n\n           This facility has instituted the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of \n\n           Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., and \n\n           the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \n\n           \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".  All construction and major system repairs are   \n\n           conducted by trained and licensed anhyrdrous ammonia specialists.\n\n\n\n5.  The Five-Year Accident History\n\n\n\n          There has been no accidental releases or injuries resulting from anhydrous ammonia from this \n\n          facility in the past five years that:\n\n           - have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor\n\n           - to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, \n\n             property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n\n\n6.  The Emergency Response Program.\n\n\n\n        -The facility has:\n\n          a.   A written emergency"
