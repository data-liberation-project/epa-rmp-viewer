      "SummaryText": "FACILITY POLICY: The owner, management, and employees of Watseka Interstate LLC are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of  anhydrous ammonia by utilization of proper equipment, regular inspections, and maintenance and training of all persons that work with the material. Should an accidental release occur, the facility has oriented the fire department and the local emergancy planning committee so they can plan for response to any release and minimize the impact of a release to the people and the environment.\n\nFACILITY INFORMATION: The primary activity at the facility is the storage for sale to farmers. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop nutrient. The maximum quantity stored would be 196000 pounds in the facility's railroad tankcar.\n\nTHE WORST-CASE SCENARIO: The scenario would be the release of the total contents of the tank car over 10 minutes. The  maximum quantity released would be 140000 pounds, which represents the quantity to be unloaded in a tankcar. The distance to the endpoint of dispersion based upon the model used is 1.16 miles.\n       The alternative-case release scenario is assumed to be a release from the rupture of a 2 inch transfer hose, with 12000 pounds released over 2 minutes. The distance to the endpoint of dispersion is .56 miles.\n\nTHE ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PROGRAM:  The facility complies with the rules and regulations relating to the handling of anhydrous ammonia and low pressure nitrogen solutions, equipment, containers and storage facilities. These requlations administered by the Illinois Department of Agriculture are consistent with ANSI K61.1 and OSHA 29 cfr 1910.111 regarding storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.\n\nTHE FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY: There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia for the covered process in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site; nor to our knowledge, have any accidental"

      "SummaryText": " releases resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place property damage or environmental damage.\n\nTHE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM: The facility has a written emergency action plan in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38 and provide state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III of EPCRA. Our emergency response action plan has been reviewed with the local fire department an provided to the local emergency planning committee for coordination in the community response planning.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY: Safety improvements are an on-going process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe practices and operations. There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
