      "SummaryText": "This is a seasonal/operational facility-operating in the spring planting season and fall tillage season.  It is located south of the village of Sutton approximately 1/10 of a mile.  The plant site consists of one 30,000 gallon anhydrous ammonia storage vessel.  Customer's nurse tanks are filled on the premises.  It is not operational year round.  During the off season, the plant is locked and the power is off.  It is in both federal and state compliance.\n\nAll employees are required to attend an annual product safety handling and training school.  A written safety program is on file with the Griggs County Emergency Director and the rural Glenfield Fire Department.  Both have maps of the plant.\n\nA worse case scenario would occur if product were to be released into the atmosphere due to overfilling or overpressurization of the storage vessel.  Devices in place to prevent this from occurring include vents, relief valves, check valves, manual shutoffs, automatic shutoffs.  This storage vessel is never filled to full capacity-85% is the maximum.\n\nAn alternative case scenario would be if a customer were to pull away from the loading platform which could result in a ruptured hose.  Qualified, trained personnel are in place to prevent this from happening.\n\nThere have been no accidents at this site."
