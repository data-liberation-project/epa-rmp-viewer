Because police, fire and other public officials will be called if needed, each local Operating Manager shall cooperate with and maintain working relations with law enforcement, fire protection and public communication officials in his town or area.

Persons not actually working on the failure shall not be permitted within the area that could be affected should gas ignite.  When repairs cannot be safely made, all persons are to be kept at a safe distance until the affected section of line can be isolated and the gas blown down.\nIf the gas supply fails to any town or area, then that area shall be isolated and all meters turned off. The affected system will be repaired and any air purged form the lines.  Meters will then be turned on and pilot lights relighted.  If a large portion of the entire system should fail, Company officials, in conferring with the Public Service commission, might devise an alternate plan to restore service in view of possible risks or hazards to the public being out of heat for an extended period.\nOther important factors to be considered are the hazardous flow of leaking gas and its possible migration to an area which might involve secondary damage.  This would require monitoring the extent of the hazardous area and the possible ventilating of affected premises.  The resurvey of an area involved in a leak incident to locate any additional leaks should be made as a precaution.\nAs soon after the end of an emergency as possible, an investigation of the incident or failure should be made in acordance with Section 617.\nSavannah Electric will air television commercials aimed at educating the general public, customers, appropriate government organizations, and excavators on how to recognize and report a gas pipeline emerge"

Since the company was founded in 1882, we have provided clean, safe electric power, earning a reputation for sensitive environmental stewardship in the communities we serve.\nOur success comes from a set of strategic priorities that we use to develop and implement plans that ensure Savannah Electric's continued role as a recognized community leader in protecting and preserving the environment.\nSavannah Electric's impressive record of compliance with air and water quality regulation exemplifies our dedication to the environment.  We devote considerable time and resources to make sure that we meet, and in most cases exceed, the requirements of federal clean air laws and other regulations.\n\nNatural gas (methane)  at Plant McIntosh is used as a primary fuel for the 8 combustion turbines on site.
