Both training and inspections are documented.\n\nThe WWT Division has had no accidental releases of chlorine or sulfur dioxide gas in the last five years.\n\nIn the event of an accidental release,WWT plant personnel wll notify the Dothan Fire Department by either radio or land line.The Dothan Fire Department's hazardous material team will take charge of stopping or mitigating the release of gas.The City of Dothan HAZ-MAT Team conducts quarterly Emergencey Response Drills.  \n                                                                                         Perimeter motion sensors have been installed to detect the presences of unauthorized personnel entering the plant or the chemical storage area.\n\nThe WWT Division reviews SOP,conducts hazard analysis,and pe"
