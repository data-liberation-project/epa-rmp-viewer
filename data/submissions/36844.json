To keep the millions of pounds of products that are stored here frozen, we use Anhydrous Ammonia as a refrigerant. Since we have over 10,000 pounds (2000 gallons) of ammonia on site, we actively participate in two major government programs to control its use.  Their primary function deals with safety and emergency response. The first program is Processes Safety Management (PSM) from OSHA. It deals with how we handle ammonia inside our facility. The second program is Risk Management Program (RMP) from the EPA. In the event of an ammonia release, RMP is a tool that responding government agencies use to access information about our facility so that they can protect themselves and the surrounding community if required.\n\n\n\nSeafreeze Cold Storage and its three seafood processing tenants employ about 300 members of our community. Although they are our primary concern, they are not our only concern. We realize that Ammonia is a hazardous substance and must always be handled in such a way as to prevent any release to the building, environment or the surrounding community. We do not take this responsibility lightly. Seafreeze has invested (not just spent) over $150,000, $20,000 this year alone, to comply with PSM and RMP. They are not small programs. These programs are not set up and forgotten, but are constantly reviewed, updated and implemented. They are part of our day to day operation. It makes the quality of life better for all of us.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.2   WORST CASE SCENARIO\n\n\n\n\n\nThe worst case scenario does not deal with how a full release happens or with the likelihood that it may or may not happen. It deals only with the idea that it could and if it did, what is the affected area. \n\n\n\nSeafreeze Cold Storage has chosen not to include a description of our Worst Case Scenario as allowed by changes by the EPA in the Chemical Accident Prevention Rule for reasons of security.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
    },

      "FacilityID": 36844,
      "SummaryText": "\n\n\n\n\n1.3  ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO \n\n\n\nThe alternative release deals with the type of situation we would normally expect to cause a release, such as a broken pipe or valve. \n\n\n\nSeafreeze Cold Storage has chosen not to include a description of our Alternate Case Scenario as allowed by changes by the EPA in the Chemical Accident Prevention Rule for reasons of security.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.4  GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION\n\n\n\nIn order to prevent a worst case or alternate case scenario from happening, we have over 13 PSM prevention programs in operation. These range from doing a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) of the entire refrigeration system, looking for and correcting possible causes of a release, to obvious programs like Training and Lock-Out Tag-Out. Contractors doing work on our system even have their company?s safety programs reviewed, with welding and electrical certifications checked.  The City of Seattle licenses our 5 refrigeration maintenance employees for Ammonia. Training, testing, program reviews are done annually. As an added back up, an outside consultant is hired to do a complete audit every three years of all programs to ensure that we are doing it correctly. If over 100 pounds are released, required local and national authorities are immediately contacted.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.5  FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nIn the last five years (6-99 to 6-04), Seafreeze Cold Storage has had one reportable ammonia release, 8-14-01. It is the only one in our 25 year history. A reportable release is defined as causing any one of the following. Property damage, injury, death, evacuation, sheltering in place or environmental damage. In our case, the 8-01 release resulted in an evacuation of our employees, with no other consequences. \n\nNAICS Code / 311712\n\nChemical Name / Ammonia (Anhydrous)\n\nCAS Number / 7664-41-7\n\n\n\n\n\n1.6  EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\n\n\n\nOur Emergency Response Plan is activated by our ammonia detection system or first awareness of ammonia release by a Seafreeze employee"
    },
    {
      "ESSeqNum": 2,
      "FacilityID": 36844,
      "SummaryText": ". This awareness is communicated to the maintenance department by person, building phone, cell phone, or P.A. Using written and practiced procedures, an assessment is made as to the severity of the release. Above 250 Parts per Million (PPM) of ammonia and the building is evacuated along with calling 911 to alert the Fire Department and Hazardous Materials Team. Surrounding businesses can also be contacted to inform them of the release with instructions to evacuate or shelter in place. If the detector indicates below 250 PPM the area is ventilated and needed repairs are performed by Seafreeze refrigeration technicians.\n\n\n\nThe ammonia detectors are connected to our off-site 24-hour alarm monitoring company. The alarm monitoring computer for our ammonia detection systems, refrigeration equipment and fire systems are backed-up by battery power and an automatic standby generator. After normal business hours, the alarm company contacts one of 5 maintenance employees that are trained to operate the refrigeration system. This employee responds to the alarm to make the initial assessment as to what should happen next. \n\n\n\nSeafreeze conducts evacuation drills twice a year involving all personnel on site. The Seattle Fire Department conducts an annual inspection of our facility. The Seattle Fire Department Hazardous Materials Response Team has toured our facility. At the end of the tour, the team made recommendations that have since been implemented.  Seafreeze has traveled to the Fire Department Response Team to coordinate response activities. Seven days a week, a one and a half hour building wide inspection is made of the entire refrigeration system. Once a month we have a safety walk to identify and correct possible un-safe conditions. The Seafreeze Hazardous Material Technicians Team meets monthly to practice release responses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.7  PLANNED CHANGES\n\n\n\nSeafreeze does not have any major changes planned for the ammonia system, although of course we are alwa"
