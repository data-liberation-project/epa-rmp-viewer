OCA's are essential in identifying the potential hazards of an accidental release.

The scenario involves a liquid release involving 10,938,665 pounds of VAM from tank 9702. The entire inventory of this tank is assumed to release and evaporate, impacting an area with a 25-mile radius.\n\nThe ARS associated with the VAM tanks involves a piping failure between the tank and the closest valve.

Operations occurring at Advario include loading/unloading, storage, transportation, and distribution of chemicals.  U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations presented in Title 40 Code of Federal Regulations Part 68 (40 CFR 68), the Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions, require Advario to comply with the Risk Management Program (RMP) rule because the quantities of vinyl acetate monomer stored onsite exceed threshold quantities.\n\nThe RMP rule requires a facility to report the unit inventory for each RMP substance that exceeds threshold quantities, along with an EPA-approved chemical release prevention program. In addition, 40 CFR 68 requires all RMP covered facilities to update its Risk Management Program Plan (RMP Plan) within six (6) months of an RMP reportable incident or every five (5) years, whichever comes first.  In accordance with 40 CFR 68, Advario is submitting this initial RMP Plan within six (6) months of taking ownership of the site.\n\nPotential offsite consequences of a hypothetical Worst-Case Scenario (WCS) and Alternative Releases Scenario (ARS) were conducted using the EPA RMP Guidance for Offsite Consequence Analysis and the RMP*Comp program.  Although numerous controls are in place to prevent chemical releases and manage such consequences should an incident occur, no credit for active mitigation measures was taken into account in evaluating the worst case and alternative release scenarios.\n\nAs required by the RMP regulations, worst-case and alternative release scenarios were generated for toxic releases of the chemical (vinyl acetate monomer) that Advario stores on-site above threshold levels.  Details regarding the worst-case and alternative release scenarios f"
