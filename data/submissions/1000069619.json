This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  The North Little Rock Waste Water Utility's White Oak Bayou Treatment Plant implements reasonable controls, such as training of personnel and the safe design, installation, operation and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to make every effort to prevent the release of hazardous substance but in the event of a release, our trained personnel and local emergency response agencies will respond to control and contain the release in a manner that will be safe for workers and will help prevent injuries to the public or the environment.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.0\tDescription of the North Little Rock Waste Water Utility's White Oak Bayou Treatment Plant and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\n\r\nThe White Oak Bayou Treatment Plant is located within the city limits of North Little Rock, Arkansas.  The facility is part of the North Little Rock Waste Water Utility wastewater collection and treatment system which services an area with a population of over 60,000 people.  The White Oak Bayou Treatment Plant handles one substance regulated by the Risk Management Program Rule (RMP Rule) in quantities above the Threshold Quantity.  This substance is:\r\n\r\n* Chlorine - stored in 1 ton cylinders and used for the disinfection of the wastewater prior to releasing to the receiving stream.\r\n\r\n\r\n3.0\tHazard Assessment\r\n\r\n\r\nThe RMP Rule requires the White Oak Bayou Treatment Plant to perform a Hazard Assessment of the chlorine stored and used in the chlorination process at the facility.  This Hazard Assessment includes an offsite consequence analysis for the following scenarios:"
