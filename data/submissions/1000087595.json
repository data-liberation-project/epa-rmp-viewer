The facility is located on 4113 Four Mile Road.  This facility consists of two plants: a resin plant that was originally constructed in 1986 and a RCI process that can manufacture both formaldehyde and Urea Formaldehyde Concentrate (UFC). The RCI process was constructed in 1990.  Both of these processes contain a raw material tank farm, the process equipment itself and a finished product tank farm with product loading capabilities.  Overall, the facility employs 31 full-time employees.\n\n    \n\n    GP is committed to operating the plant in a manner that is safe for its workers, the public, and the environment.  As part of this commitment, GP has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility.  One component of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the plant and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMP Plan) describing the risk management program at the plant. This document is intended to satisfy the RMP Plan requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at the plant.\n\n    \n\n    The risk management program at the Plant consists of the following three elements:\n\n    \n\n    Hazard assessment to help understand (a) the potential offsite consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and (b) accidents that have occurred during the last five years associated with the use of substances regulated by the RMP rule (regulated substances).\n\n    \n\n    Prevention program"

In fact, the Plant has a comprehensive safety program in place establishing many levels of safeguards against release of a hazardous substance and injuries and damage from a release of a hazardous substance.\n\n    \n\n    GP limits the use of hazardous substances.  Before using a hazardous substance at the Plant, less hazardous alternatives are considered. When a hazardous substance is used at the Plant, GP considers the potential for this substance to adversely affect plant workers, the public, and the environment and takes steps to prevent any such effects.\n\n    \n\n    GP prevents releases of the hazardous substances used at the facility.  When a hazardous substance is used at the Plant, the equipment is carefully designed, built and operated to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release. Industry and government standards are closely adhered to in the design, construction, and operation of the equipment. \n\n    \n\n    GP limits damage from a release, if such a release would occur, by using good management practices and engineering controls.  GP trains its workers to respond to an accidental release, thus reducing the consequences of a release if it occurs.  In addition, GP works with the local fire department and with the Crawford County LEPC to help prevent injuries and/or environmental damage if a release does occur.\n\n    \n\n    The safety program at the Plant consists of a number of elements, only some of which are required by the RMP rule.

GP implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances.  These controls include training programs for personnel, programs to help ensure safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of processes at the Plant; and programs to evaluate the hazards at the plant.\n\n    \n\n    In the event of an accidental release, the Plant controls and contains the release in a manner that will be safe for workers and will prevent injury to the public and the environment.  GP provides response training to its personnel, designates an emergency response coordinator to oversee response activities, and coordinates response efforts with the local fire department.  Response activities have also been discussed with the LEPC.  In order to effectively implement these policies, GP established a management system headed by the Safety Manager to oversee safety-related activities.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n1.2      Regulated Substances\n\n\n\n    The plant handles two (2) regulated substances in sufficient quantity to be covered by the RMP rule; Formaldehyde Solution and Aqua Ammonia (Concentration 20% or greater).\n\n    \n\n    \n\n1.3      Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\n    Since 1986, the Plant has used a prevention program to help prevent accidental releases of hazardous substances.

The following paragraphs describe some of these features.\n\n    \n\n    Formaldehyde solution-Industry standards are followed at the plant to help ensure safe handling of formaldehyde.  Most of the formaldehyde stored in the plants storage vessels is piped directly from the RCI process.  However, to make-up for shortfalls in formaldehyde production, some formaldehyde is delivered to the plant by offsite vendors. The formaldehyde vendor supplies formaldehyde solution via a DOT approved tank truck or railcars and follows DOT standards when loading the formaldehyde storage tanks.  The storage tanks design and construction are consistent with ANSI standards.  Workers who perform operations involving formaldehyde receive training emphasizing safe handling procedures for formaldehyde developed by the plant.   The storage tanks are surrounded by a concrete dike which is large enough to contain 100% of the volume of the largest tank should its entire contents be spilled.  All air emissions from the storage tanks are directed to an oxidizer, which destroys in excess of 99% of the formaldehyde emissions.\n\n    \n\n    Aqueous ammonia-Industry standards are followed at the plant to help ensure safe handling of aqueous ammonia.  The aqueous ammonia vendor supplies aqueous ammonia via a Department of Transportation (DOT) approved tank truck and follows DOT standards when loading the aqueous ammonia storage tank.  The storage tank design and construction are consistent with American Petroleum Institute (API) standards.
