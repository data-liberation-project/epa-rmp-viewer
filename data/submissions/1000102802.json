The SCR process utilizes anhydrous ammonia to react with the NOx compounds, converting the NOx into nitrogen (an inert gas) and water vapor.  This process necessitates the storage of large quantities of ammonia (> 10,000 lbs) to support operation of the SCR.  The RMP program is initiated when a facility stores 10,000 lbs or more of anhydrous ammonia.  The Williams Station Power Plant is rated a Program 3 facility. \n\nAlthough the RMPlan helps ensure that Williams Station's RMP covered system is maintained and operated in a safe manner, it is only one component of the plant's overall safety program.  In fact, a comprehensive safety program exists that establishes many levels of safeguards against accidents.\n\nCONSIDERATIONS\n\nLimiting the use of substances regulated by the RMP rule:\n\nDESC did perform a thorough evaluation before selecting a pollution control technology that uses a hazardous substance regulated by the RMP rule (regulated substance).  The potential for the hazardous substance to affect individuals and the environment has been considered, and DESC has taken the appropriate steps to address the hazards.\n\nPreventing releases of the regulated substances used:\n\nWhen a regulated substance is used, the equipment that contains it is carefully designed, built, and operated to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release.  All applicable federal, state, corporate, and industry standards are strictly adhered to in the design, construction, and operation of the equipment.\n\nLimiting damage from a release, if such a release occurs:\n\nWilliams Station's main objective is to prevent the accidental release of anhydrous ammonia\nfrom occurring.  In the unlikely event of a release, employees are trained to recognize accidental\nreleases quickly, assess the severity of a release and respond to mitigate and stop the release. \nCoordina"

WILLIAMS STATION EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n                              \nOVERVIEW\n\nA.M. Williams Station is committed to operating in a manner that is safe for our employees, contractors, the surrounding community, and the environment.  To meet this commitment, we have established systems to ensure safe operation of plant processes, which includes the safe and proper handling of hazardous substances at the plant.  One component of these systems is a Risk Management Program (RMP), which manages the risks involved with using hazardous substances.  We have designed this program to control and reduce the risk of injury, death, environmental damage, or property damage as well as being a teaching aid for employees to learn how their job is an integral part of the RMP process.  The program protects employees, contractors and the public.  \n\nA.M. Williams Station's RMP complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR  68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements:  Risk Management Programs.  This regulation is also referred to as the RMP rule.  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit an executive summary in the Risk Management Plan (RMPlan) describing the RMP at Williams Station.  This document is intended to satisfy the executive summary requirement of the RMP rule and to provide a description of the RMP.  \n\nThe A.M. Williams Station Power Plant is located on the Cooper River in lower Berkeley County in the Bushy Park Industrial area near Charleston, SC.  The power plant generates 650 megawatts of electricity by burning pulverized coal in a single unit. The plant can use No. 2 fuel oil as a backup fuel to coal, during start-up only.  In addition, the plant can produce 50 megawatts of electricity from two No. 2 fuel oil or natural gas for combustio"
