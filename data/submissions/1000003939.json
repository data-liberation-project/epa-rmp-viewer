Further preventative measures are achieved through the implementation of OSHA's process safety management (PSM) program developed pursuant to Program 3 status and PSM regulations.\n\nThe emergency response planning and preparation procedure, required by ISO 14001, prescribes planning and preparation activities.  Building evacuation and severe weather procedures, which guide site responses to fire, explosion, chemical release, security emergency, and severe weather incidents, are part of the site emergency response plan and further supports the emergency re"

The regulated manufacturing process uses 1,3-Butadiene to manufacture a styrene/butadiene copolymer.  1,3-Butadiene is listed for its flammable properties only.  All other chemicals used at this facility are either below the concentration or threshold quantity values.\n\n3.Worst-Case Release Scenario and Alternative Release Scenario\nThe worst-case release scenario assumed storage vessel failure with release of the entire contents and a subsequent vapor cloud explosion.  Administrative controls limit the amount of 1,3-Butadiene, a flammable gas, stored in the vessel.  RMP*Comp, version 1.07, was used to model the distance to the endpoint of 1 psi overpressure.\n\nThe alternative release scenario evaluated the impact from loss of process control at the initial stages of the process.  If during the resin manufacturing process, control of the reaction is lost, the entire reactor contents are evacuated to a concrete bunker.  The alternative scenario assumed the release from evacuating the material results in a vapor cloud fire with the endpoint being the Lower Flammability Limit.  Passive or active mitigation measures were not considered in the impact modeling; however, passive mitigation measures include a concrete bunker containment and active mitigation measures include protecting the manufacturing plant with a deluge system, water curtain, and sprinkler system.\n\n4.General Accidental Release Prevention Program\nXerox OKC regulated operations are covered by a Title V air permit that includes compliance with Risk Management Plan requirements and NESHAP MACT Standard Subpart JJJ.  Under Subpart JJJ, the Leak Detection and Repair (LDAR) program is an important component it regularly inspecting and monitorin"

Further accidental release prevention activities include an extensive preventative maintenance program for the plant.  The PM program includes annual gamma scan with neutron backscatter scanning of the 1,3-Butadiene storage vessel and associated piping and annual pressure vessel recertification. \n\n5.Five-Year Accident History\nXerox OKC has not experienced any accidents in the past five (5) years that require reporting pursuant to \u00c2\u00a768.42(a).\n\n6.Emergency Response Program\nXerox OKC maintains a site emergency response plan that is reviewed annually and communicated with the Oklahoma City Fire Department's (OKCFD's) hazardous materials response station and local stations that would respond to an emergency.  In addition to the annual review the OKCFD is given a site tour during all three shifts and emergency response informational packets are provided and carried in each station engine.  Xerox OKC actively participates in the Oklahoma County and Canadian County Local Emergency Planning Committee's (LEPC's) routine meetings. The Oklahoma County LEPC meetings are monthly and the Canadian County LEPC meetings are quarterly. During these meetings Xerox OKC is able to keep the LEPCs informed on current activities and also communicate with the Oklahoma County and Canadian County Emergency Management Coordinators.  \n\nThe EH&S training plan includes giving employees training in the following areas:  40-hr HAZWOPER, Incident Investigation, Incident Command System, Confined Space Rescue, Medical First Responder, First Aid, and Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) and Automatic External Defibrillator (AED).  On-site Wellness Center coordinates and trains Medical Emergency Response Team members in the skills necessary to respond to medical emergencies.\n\nAt least one drill a year is executed with the site goal"

These drills cover fire evacuation, severe weather shelter-in-place, chemical evacuation, and evacuation to safe rooms for security or chemical release emergencies.  All employees participate in the drills and employees with additional training described above have expanded rolls in mock emergency scenarios and tabletop emergency exercises.\n\n7.Planned Changes to Improve Safety\nXerox OKC has an invested commitment to improving the environmental, health and safety program for the site, as evidenced by our ISO 14001 registration and participation in OSHA's Voluntary Protection Program as a Merit site.  A strategy has been developed to achieve Star status within a year.  These programs are covered by an environmental management system and safety management system, respectively.  Through these management systems Xerox OKC strives for continuous improvement in our environmental, health and safety program for all operations across the site. The OSHA Star status was achieved in 2006."
