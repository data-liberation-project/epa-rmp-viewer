Facility Policy.\n\n   The owners, management and employees of Floyd County Ag Center are committed to the\nprevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the\nfacility is prepared to work with Floyd County LEPC and  the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the people and the enviroment.\n\n2. Facility Information\n\n   The primary activity at the facility is the storage of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is\nreceived, stored and distributed as a nutrient for crop production.\nThe maximum quantity stored would be 330,000 pounds.\n\n3. Worst-Case Scenario and Alternate Release Scenario\n\na. The worst-case senario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as gas over a period of 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 130,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the end point (point of dispersion to 200 parts per million, or ppm) is 1.1 miles.\n\nb. The alternate release scenario,  is a release from a break in a 1-inch transfer hose followed by release of ammonia for 2 minutes before an automatic or manual shut-off intervenes and stops the flow of ammonia.  The maximum quantity released would be 2900 pounds.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200ppm) is .22 miles.\n\n4. Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n   The facility is in compliance with the U. S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA),  29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of anhydrous ammoia\" and the Iowa Administrative Code Part 21-Chapter 43-Rule 43.6 (200)-Standard for the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.  The OSHA standard is referenced in this R"

Five-Year Accident History.\n\n   There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that: have caused any deaths, injuries or significant property damage at the facility, nor to our knowledge, has there been any releases resulting in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations,  property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6. Emergency Action PLan.\n\n   The facility has:\n\na. a written action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\nb.  provided state and local authorities with the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title 111 (EPCRA);\n\nc.  If a large release of anhydrous ammonia take place at the facility, the required response action is to evacuate the area of the spill and call 911 and all applicable emegency response numbers.  With-in 15 minutes of determining the amount of the release would be over 100 pounds, the Emergency Coordinator will notify:\n\n           1.The National Emergency Response Center @ 800/424-8802\n           2.The State Spill Reporting Agency @ 515/281-8694\n\n\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety.\n\n  Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are preformed to assess the maintenance fo safe conditions.  There are no additional specific safety recommendations regarding storage or use of anhydrous ammonia for implementation at this time."
