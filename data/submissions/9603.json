Propane gas is also received, stored and distributed from this facility for the use in grain dryers\n        and home heat.  Propane is stored in three approved storage tanks with a total capacity of 200,000\n        pounds.\n\n3. The worst-case release scenario and alternative release scenario.  ( Ammonia and Propane)\n\n   a. The worst-case release scenario for Ammonia would be the release of the total contents of both tanks\n       released as a gas over ten minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 200,000 pounds.\n\n4. The accidental release prevention program:\n\n    a. Annual training of all full-time and part-time employees in emergengy response and worker protection\n        is just one way the facility prepares its self for a accidental release. The company also complies with:\n    b. The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration Standard- 29 CFR 1910.111 Storage and\n         and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.\n    c. The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration Standard- 29 CFR 1910.110 Storage and \n        Handling of Liquefied Petroleum Gases.\n\n5. The Five-Year Accident History:\n\n    There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammo"
