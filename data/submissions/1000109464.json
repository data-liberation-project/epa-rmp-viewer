Part of this program has also involved identifying and taking steps to avoid potential accidental chemical releases.\n\nFive-Year Accident History:\n\nNo incident resulting in onsite injuries, death or property damage or offsite impacts from a propane release has occurred at the UET Hermon Terminal Facility within the last five years. \n\nEmergency Response Program:\n\nThe facility has developed an emergency response plan, which will be coordinated with local emergency response groups such as the Hermon Fire Department. Also involved in emergency response for the facility would be the County Regional Planning Commission. The facility operator is responsible for coordinating the notifications required to initiate an emergency response. The Emergency Response Plan provides the essential planning for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations. Planned Changes to Improve Safety Compliance with the RMP Prevention Program coupled with the environmental, health and safety management systems, forms the framework for continuous safety improvement. \n\nSome of the key components of the safety program are:\n\n\u0095\tThe Management of Change provisions ensure that the potential safety and health impacts of any change made to the process chemicals, technology, equipment or procedures are considered.\n\u0095\tThe Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) provisions serve as a tool to ensure timely evaluation of potential hazards, thereby leading to continual improvements in safety standards.\n\u0095\tThe Mechanical Integrity provisions ensure that process equipment and instrumentation are designed, constructed, installed and maintained to minimize the risk of hazardous releases, thereby serving as an integral part of the safety program.\n\nSpecific actions that will be taken in the future to improve the level of safety at the facility include:\n\n\u0095\tCompli"
