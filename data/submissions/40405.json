The City of Hermiston provides extensive training for all employees who work on the chlorination process, including emphasis on stringent procedures for maintaining the integrity of the chlorination equipment. The WTP is continuously monitored for potential hazards that could affect the chlorination process. When a potential problem is identified, it is scheduled for immediate correction.

Also, updated equipment has been installed, and general improvements to the system have been made.  In-place safety plans will take every precaution necessary so that any future change deemed necessary will be correctly designed, constructed, and operated.\n\nThe City of Hermiston has created a focused Emergency Action Plan (EAP) that will be followed in the event of an accidental release of Chlorine at the WTP. Empoyees are trained in the procedures of this EAP to ensure its policies are quickly and effectively implemented in an emergency. Coordination with Hermiston Fire and Emergency Services and the regional Hazardous Materials Team (HAZMAT) constitutes significant elements of this EAP. The regional HAZMAT team for this area of Oregon is based out of Hermiston. \n\n We believe the outstanding safety record of the City of Hermiston and the WTP related to chlorine gas will continue. The City's focus will continue to be maintenance of a safe working environment for its employees and protection of the community."

We willingly observe the most stringent industry safety precautions to prevent hazards in the workplace. City management and water operations staff have instituted procedures to ensure a safe working enviroment is maintained which emphasizes proper handling and containment of hazardous materials The City's safety planning emphasizes prevention of the release of toxic substances to the environment. In the unlikely event of a release, the plan also indentifies in-house and community-based expertise which will be called upon to minimize the impact to community.                                                                                                                                                                                   The current Water Treatment Plant(WTP) is located a short distance southwest of the core of Hermiston along Feedville Rd. and OR Hwy 207 in Umatilla County, Oregon. Disinfection of water is accomplished through chlorination with chlorine gas. The WTP falls under EPA RMP and OSHA PSM regulations due to the storage and use of chlorine gas for disinfection. The WTP currently stores of chlorine in pressurized, one ton containers.

An extensive Off-Site Consequences Analysis (OCA) of the worst case release scenerio and alternative release scenerio has been performed  has been performed with the aid of the EPA's RMP*CompO and EPA guidance documentation.
