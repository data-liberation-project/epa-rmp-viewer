      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\n\nThis Process Safety Management (PSM) and Risk Management Plan (RMP) Program document (PSM/RMPr) was prepared on behalf of Land View, Inc. (LVI) pursuant to the requirements of the Clean Air Act ? 112(r) as codified by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) at 29 CFR ? 1910.119 and by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) at 40 CFR ?68.  The OSHA PSM and EPA Subpart D RMP standards are applicable to operations in Minidoka, ID.  At this Facility, LVI engages in the formulation, distribution and sale of chemicals (i.e. retail) to customers, most of who use LVI's products to support agricultural operations (See Section 3.0 of the PSM/RMPr).  \n\n\n\nThis electronic submittal provides conservative estimates of the offsite consequences of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia from the Minidoka Facility located approximately 0.5 miles west-southwest of Minidoka at 925 N. Highway 24, Rupert, ID 83350.  The electronic RMP summarizes the policies and procedures implemented by the Minidoka Facility to minimize the likelihood of an accident.  The electronic RMP also summarizes the actions that the Minidoka Facility has taken to ensure that a response to a release (even though a release is unlikely) will be implemented in a proper and timely manner.\n\n\n\nPURPOSE FOR UPDATING RMP\n\n\n\nLVI is submitting this as a 5-year update.\n\n\n\nFACILITY\n\n\n\nThe Minidoka Facility is a retail agricultural chemical facility and operates five covered processes that include (1) Covered Process 1: Railcar Storage; (2) Covered Process 2: APP Blending; (3) Covered Process 3: Storage and Handling and Aqua Blending; and (4) Covered Process 4: Storage and Handling (Aqua Ammonia).  Anhydrous ammonia is transported to the Facility via 34,000-gallon railcars (Covered Process 1) or a 9,600-gallon commercial tanker truck.  As related to Covered Process 2, the anhydrous ammonia is transferred from the railcars and to a mobile pipe reactor to manufacture APP fertilizer"

    {
      "ESSeqNum": 1,
      "FacilityID": 1000063117,
      "SummaryText": ".  As related to Covered Process 3, the anhydrous ammonia is transferred from the railcars to two 18,000-gallon stationary storage tanks and from the storage tanks to the stationary aqua ammonia reactor or bubbling process.  As related to Covered Process 4, aqua ammonia is transferred from the stationary aqua ammonia reactor or from commercial tanker trucks into the storage tanks, or from the storage tanks to commercial tanker trucks for transportation and delivery to the client.\n\n\n\nThe Minidoka Facility owns and operates Covered Processes 3 and 4 in accordance with this PSM/RMPr.  As related to Covered Process 1, Minidoka does not own or operate the railcars but does conduct inspections in accordance with the PSM/RMPr Operating Procedures.  As related to Covered Process 2, Minidoka Contracts an Independent Fertilizer Reacting Contractor (IFRC) to manufacture the APP Fertilizer.  Minidoka requires that the IFRC have in place and operates its mobile pipe reactor equipment in accordance with an OSHA PSM.    \n\n\n\nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\n\n\n\nWorst case and alternative case consequence analyses were completed for both covered processes. The worst case scenario release assumed that all the contents in the largest single storage tank were released.  The release was modeled as if the ammonia tank was punctured on the side at the ground level. The resulting release of ammonia was modeled as a ground level horizontal jet.\n\n\n\nThe alternative (or more likely to occur) scenario for the railcar assumes that a vapor valve is not completely closed after a transfer operation and anhydrous vapor is released for a 60 minute period before the valve is closed.  The alternative scenario for processes 2, 3 and 4 assumes a rupture of a transfer hose caused by an impact from a vehicle or some other source on the liquid ammonia transfer line during a major loading or unloading operation.  \n\n\n\nAll elements of the off-site consequence analysis have been addressed and updated.\n\n\n\nACCIDENT P"

      "SummaryText": "REVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe Magic Valley Manager implements the PSM/RMPr at this Facility.  The Magic Valley Manager is assisted by other LVI staff, as directed.  The Magic Valley Manager is responsible for ensuring that LVI Staff are properly trained in the implementation of the Program 3 Accident Prevention Program elements: Management System, Employee Participation, Safety Information, Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Contractor, Pre-Startup Review, Maintenance, Hot Work Permit, Management of Change, Incident Investigation, Compliance Audits, Emergency Response, and Compliance Audits.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nLVI's Minidoka Facility is a non-responding facility. LVI has coordinated emergency response activities with its local emergency response agency and local fire department.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThere have been no on-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage; or off-site deaths, injuries, property damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place, in the past five (5) years because of the ammonia operations at the Minidoka Facility.\n\n\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n\n\nThe Risk Management Plan implemented by LVI at the Minidoka Facility complies with the requirements of the Clean Air Act, Section 112(r). The PSM/RMPr will be updated as the Minidoka Facility adds, deletes, or changes processes. The Emergency Response Program has been coordinated with the Minidoka County LEPC.\n\n\n\nNOTE: Sections 4, 5, 6, and 8 of the standard RMP produced by EPA's RMP Submit Program are not applicable to the Minidoka Facility.\n\n"
