The employees were hospitalized as a precaution.  No other deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuation, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage have resulted from a release of any of the regulated chemicals currently at the Belle Plant from the covered processes under 40 CFR Part 68.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\n     Plant personnel are trained and equipped to respond to releases of the regulated substances.  The program is summarized as follows:\n\n\n\n  *  Plant personnel receive emergency response training.\n\n  *  Plant emergency responders are trained.\n\n  *  Emergency response plans are in place\n\n  *  Plant participates in emergency drills.\n\n  *  Critiques are held on drills and actual events.\n\n  *  The Belle Plant is a member of the local emergency planning committee.\n\n  *  The sites Emergency Response Team trains local fire departments and agencies in response techniques and methodolgies.\n\n\n\nIf a Major Re"
