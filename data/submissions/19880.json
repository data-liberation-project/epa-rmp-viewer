      "SummaryText": "The New Salem Water Treatment Plant facility uses Chlorine, which is considered hazardous by EPA.  The same properties that make Chlorine valuable as a water treatment chemical also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling the material.\n\nThe prevention of unnecessary human exposure reduces the threat to the health and safety of employees as well as nearby members of the community.  The primary goal of this Risk Management Plan is to ensure the safety of the employees of this facility and any residents that may be impacted by a release from this facility.\n\nIt is the policy of the City of New Salem to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which Chlorine is handled, the safety devices inherent in the design of the facility, and the training of the personnel.\n\nThe Risk Management Program was developed with the assistance ALTEC Environmental Consultants, Inc. and Hart Engineering Company.  \n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is to produce treated water by utilizing the regulated chemical Chlorine.  The maximum amount of Chlorine stored at this plant is 450 pounds.  Chlorine is received in individual 150-pound cylinders and stored until needed.  Chlorine is injected into the water system by automatic feeders.  The feed uses a vacuum \"shut-off\" system which is designed to automatically shut the system down if a leak occurs.\n\nAccess to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees and authorized contractors.\n\nA worst-case scenario for this facility involves the failure of and total release from the largest storage tank when filled to capacity, resulting in a release of 150 pounds of Chlorine.  When Chlorine is released into the air, it creates a hazard.  Therefore, the worst-case scenario has been used.  Active mitigation has been considered for this scenario.  The Chlorine storage tanks are located in the Chlorine Cylinder Shed which is constructed of wood walls on four s"

      "SummaryText": "ides with one side having a single locked door.  It is assumed that the entire contents are released as a vapor.  The distance to the endpoint of 0.0087 mg/l for the worst-case scenario is 0.36 miles.\n\nAn alternative scenario has been developed for this facility.  The alternative scenario is based on the type of prevention system in place, and the release should be minimal.  A bad connection and failure of the valve to close results in the release of gas through a 1/16-inch-diameter hole.  Estimations based on this valve release would result in 17.1 pounds released into the air over a 60-minute duration.  The amount of Chlorine vapor released would result in a distance to endpoint of approximately 0.03 of a mile.\n\nThe water treatment plant complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable State of Texas codes and regulations.\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of Chlorine in the last five years.\n\nThe Emergency Response Program was developed for the County of Rusk and the surrounding areas with the assistance of Hart Engineering Corporation.  This program has been discussed wtih the Texas Office of Emergency Preparedness and the Henderson Fire Department.  A representative of ALTEC Environmental Consultants, Inc. visited this plant on August 30, 1999.\n\nThe Chlorine Feed System was constructed at this facility in 1999 and meets all design requirements for and complies with all applicable regulations for water treatment facilities."
