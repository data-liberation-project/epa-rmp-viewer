These procedures identify potential sources of release and equipment corrections required to prevent these releases. The equipment is reviewed by on-site personnel, mechanical engineers, and refrigeration contractors as required.\n\nOn-site personnel provide initial emergency response. On-site personnel will make a preliminary assessment in the event of a release and will provide first response. First response may include emergency equipment shutdown, system isolation, or controlled operation such as pump down to prevent or reduce and off-site release. Emergency response for a major release event will be provided by local fire and police departments.\n\nEmergency response training will be conducted yearly and as required for new employees. Records will be kept of all training performed at the site for minimum of (5) years.\n\nTraining and familiarity with the company's Safety and Operating Procedures and Emergency Response Plan are required by all persons responsible for Ammonia refrigeration maintenance and operations. Maintenance and operations personnel will also be required to become familiar with this RMP.\n\nb) Description of Source and Substance Handled:\n\nThe Cooling Facility utilizes anhydrous ammonia as the refrigerant in their cooling and cold storage operations.\n\nThe refrigeration equipment consists of a cold room with (20) evaporators and high side refrigeration system as a stationary source, (3) Pressure Coolers in the Cold Room, (3) Portable vacuum tube Systems, (4) Portable Hydro-Vac Tube Systems, (4) Portable Ice Generator trailer skids.\n\nc) Worst case and Alternative Release Scenarios:\n\nThe worst case and alternative release scenarios were evaluated using the methodol"

The atmospheric conditions used are as specified in this guidance and the regulations.\n\nThe worst case release considers the complete release of the maximum charge in any individual system within a 10 minute period. The alternative release considers the release of low-pressure liquid ammonia from a flange or connection leak on the piping system outside the building. No mitigation measures are considered for each release. Administrative controls limit the maximum amount of refrigerant in the system.\n\nThe results of the worst case and alternative case release scenarios are presented in Section 4, Off-site Consequence Analysis.\n\nd) Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nAs described above, the program consists of pre-startup inspection, emergency response, and regular training. A thorough review of the system including a Hazard and Operability Study (HazOp) was performed prior to start-up for the\n1999 season.origional submittal was reviewed along with any equipment since added  up to June 20,2005. Corrections and updates were made for those items determined to have the highest potential for off-site releases. Safety and equipment operational training will be conducted annually and will include equipment operational procedures, emergency response procedures, review of Business Response Plan procedures, and evacuation procedures. Those items requiring further review, correction, and or updating are listed under Section 4, Correction items.\n\ne) Five year Accident History:\n\nNo reportable releases or accidents relating to the release of ammonia have occurred at the facility in the last five (5) years.\n\nf) Emergency Response Program:\n\nThe facility has implemented the State and County ma"
