Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nDyno Nobel is committed to the protection of the safety, health and environment in all our operations and emergency responses.  Our prevention and emergency response practices are developed to protect the public as well as our own employees.  It is our policy to comply with applicable laws, and to support and work with local emergency response agencies.\n\n\n\n2.   Description of Facility and Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nDyno Nobel's Carthage Plant has operated at its current location under various owners since the 1890's.  The plant manufactures a number of explosive products for commercial uses such as mining and construction.  Products include dynamite, seismic and emulsion explosives, and cast boosters.  Some ingredients for these products are made at the plant and require the handling of regulated substances at levels above the threshold of applicability of Risk Management Planning Requirements.  Those substances include:\n\n\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia, NH3\n\nNitric Acid, (HNO3), in strengths over 80%, and\n\nOleum, which is a mixture of sulfuric acid (H2SO4)and sulfur trioxide, (SO3)\n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is stored at one location.  It is used as a feedstock in a process which converts reclaimed nitric acid from explosives manufacture into ammonium nitrate.  The ammonium nitrate is then used as an ingredient in explosives.\n\n\n\nNitric acid over 80% strength is stored in two locations.  It is blended with oleum to produce nitrating acids for the synthesis of  nitrate ester explosives such as nitroglycerine.  Nitric acid  is also used  directly in the  synthesis of one  ingredient of cast explosives boosters.\n\n\n\nOleum is stored at one location.  It is blended with nitric acid to produce nitrating acids for the synthesis of  nitrate ester explosives such as nitroglycerine.\n\n\n\n3.

      "SummaryText": " is subject to OSHA standards, including Process Safety Management, which requires systematic documentation  and periodic review of processes.  Additionally, processes with the potential for off site impacts per EPA's Risk Management Planning rule are subjected to additional hazard assessment related to potential off site effects.  These hazard assessments have resulted in such protective steps as containment walls around tanks, improved controls and alarms, and more intensive periodic process safety reviews.\n\n\n\n4.    Five Year Accident History\n\n\n\nIn the previous five years, Dyno Nobel has experienced one accidental release reportable under Risk Management rules from the covered processes.\n\n\n\nThe release occurred on May 24, 2000 and involved the release of Ammonia, Nitric Acid, Nitric Oxide, and Oleum to the soil and air.  The release was initiated by the explosion of a facility building that caused the rupture of piping transferring regulated chemicals.  The release caused no on-site or off-site injuries; however significant on-site and off-site property damage was incurred.\n\n\n\n5.   Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\nDyno Nobel maintains a written Emergency Plan to help assure timely, safe, compliant responses in the event of an emergency.  Drills are conducted, including some with outside agencies.  The Carthage Fire Department visits the plant regularly to maintain familiarity with the facility.  \n\n\n\nIn addition, Dyno Nobel is a member of the 911 Citizen Notification Partnership.  Our membership allows us to utilize the Citizen Notification Program at the Jasper County Emergency Control Board Dispatch Center.  The program has the ability to identify an area and call all phone numbers within this area allowing Dyno Nobel to keep neighbors apprised of emergencies.\n\n\n\nThe notification program also allows Dyno Nobel to simultaneously notify all plant management of an emergency and instruct them to report to the plant.\n\n\n\n6.

      "SummaryText": "on to programs required by law, Dyno Nobel undertakes other initiatives to improve safety.  \n\n\n\nDyno Nobel has a company-wide policy of documenting and reporting near misses where a potential for a more serious incident exists.  This allows us to identify potential problem areas for correction before an accident actually occurs.  We continually improve our techniques for analyzing and responding to near misses.\n\n\n\nDyno Nobel is upgrading process instrumentation and controls to modern systems, including some computer controls to provide more positive control of processes. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
