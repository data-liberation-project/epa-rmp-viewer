However, the site has reported minor incidents or near misses which warranted internal incident investigation. Each incident was investigated and detailed accounts are recorded within incident investigation forms maintained at the facility. In each release scenario, less than 1 pound of chlorine was released and there were no injuries resulting from any of the incidents. \r\n\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\n\r\nIf a release of chlorine or aqueous ammonia were to occur, the City of Poway - Water Treatment Plant's response plan is to call 911 in order to reach the Fire Department's HAZMAT team.  Employees will evacuate the facility to a point that is upwind of the hazard.  Evacuation drills are performed annually.
