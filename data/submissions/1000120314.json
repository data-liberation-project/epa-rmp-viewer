The initial RMP for BCO-Plaq was submitted on March 29, 2016.  BCO-Plaq consists of four operating units that were previously owned and operated by The Dow Chemical Company at their Louisiana Operations Site (Dow-LAO). On October 5, 2015, BCO-Plaq became a subsidiary of Olin Corporation. The RMP covered processes were previously included in DOW-LAO Site RMP.\n\n1.  Accident Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nBlue Cube Operations LLC Plaquemine Site (BCO-Plaq) continues to be strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety, as demonstrated by BCO-Plaq's comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at the facility. It is BCO-Plaq's policy to implement the necessary and appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. If such a release does occur, BCO-Plaq plant personnel, along with contracted services of the Dow Chemical Company Louisiana Operations, provide staffing of well-trained emergency response personnel that are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release. BCO-Plaq is also completely coordinated with the Iberville Parish Office of Emergency Preparedness (LEPC) which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nBCO-Plaq contains 4 process units previously part of Dow-LAO. Of the 4 process units, only 2 units are RMP covered processes: Chlorine and Solvents/EDC. There are 8 regulated substances present at the facility that are above the threshold limits: Chloroform [Methane, trichlo"

Chlorine is a reactive element found naturally in sodium chloride (table salt). It is used to purify 98% of our nation's drinking water, is in 85% of all medicines, is used in hospital sanitation. It is a product of the Chlorine Unit and is the basic building block in the production of many of Solvent/EDC's products as well as other costumers. Some of these consumer products are laundry bleach, garden and lawn herbicides, vinyl siding for homes, and PVC piping and fittings. \n2-chloropropane (isopropyl chloride), 1-chloropropylene (1-Propene, 1-chloro-), 2-chloropropylene, and propylene are used as a feed for Solvent/EDC process. \nChloroform [Methane, trichloro-] and Methyl chloride [Methane, chloro-] are not produced onsite. They are offloaded from railcar/ barges into storage tanks and then routed to customers.\n3. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nBCO-Plaq has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA. This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with BCO Loss Prevention Principles and BCO Engineering Standards. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at the BCO-Plaq stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nBCO-Plaq maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes. Some of this documentation includes Material Safety Data Sheets, equipment spec sheets, and reactive chem"

The PHA method used was an \u0093appropriate equivalent methodology,\u0094 using the Reactive Chemical-Process Hazard Analysis (RC-PHA) Questionnaire and following the RC-PHA protocol used by Blue Cube Operations, L.L.C.  This PHA methodology is the prior Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) deemed appropriate for the hazards of the process.  During the revalidation, the process hazards are assessed using the PHA-LOPA methodology, the standard method for Olin Corporation.  The PHA-LOPA methodology identifies the Independent Protection Layers (IPLs) that comprise the engineering and administrative controls applicable to the hazards of the process, reviews the consequence of failures of these controls, and conducts a consequence analysis of the failure of these controls.\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within the covered processes, BCO-Plaq maintains and periodically updates written standard operating procedures (SOPs). These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nBCO-Plaq has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes. All new employees are provided the applicable training (initial class-room training and on-the-job mentoring), depending on the nature and location of their assignments, before they are allowed to perform on their own. Refresher training is provided as needed, but at least every 3 years for covered processes.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nBCO-Plaq carries out and documents periodic maintenance checks on process and safety equipment"

Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices. Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed. Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at BCO-Plaq to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures. Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are made aware of and provided training prior to operating under the modification.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at BCO-Plaq. These reviews are conducted to confirm that required design components,  construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures, and training are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nBCO-Plaq conducts audits on a regular basis to verify that the provisions and requirements of the RMP rule are complied with. These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\nBCO-Plaq promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.

In addition, all BCO-Plaq employees have access to the process safety information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses in particular.\n\nContractors\nBCO-Plaq hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance, construction and various other activities. Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out. BCO-Plaq has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related to the contractor's work and the processes involved. Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur. Contractors are also required to inform BCO of any hazards they may introduce at the site.\n\n4.Five-year Accident History\nThere have been 2 RMP-reportable accidental releases as defined by the RMP rule of regulated substances from our facility within the last 5 years. \n\n-A release of Chlorine occurred on 4/18/22.
