Lawson Products, Inc. maintains a Safety Data Sheet (SDS) listing in the warehouse for use by facility employees. Annual fire safety inspections are performed by the Shambaugh & Son, L.P. In addition, Lawson Products, Inc. coordinates emergency response measures with McCook Fire Department. Lawson Products contracts FM Global for Risk Assessment and underwriting. At least annually, FM audits the facility with a team of engineers for the purpose of minimizing potential risk of catastrophic events. Lawson Products utilizes the following: Emergency Response Plan (ERP), Hazardous Communication Program and Process Safety Management Program (PSM).\n\nYour facility and the regulated substances handled:\n\nLawson Products, Inc. is an industrial distributor of maintenance and repair supplies, distributing products from our 200,000 square-foot facility in Suwanee, Georgia. The Suwanee distribution center consists of administration offices, warehouse storages, and shipping areas. The facility warehouses and distributes approximately 300,000 products under different brand names, some of which are regulated chemical aerosol products. The Suwanee distribution center operates 5 days a week, 19 hours per day, and employs 48 people.\n\nThe operations affected by the risk management plan (RMP) involve the receipt and storage of aerosol products. Product is moved within the warehouse via forklift trucks. The individual containers are typically packaged in corrugated shippers. The shippers are typically stacked on a pallet, on which there may be 1,000-2,000 individual containers. The palletized "

Per EPA Helpline, the worst case scenario was clarified as the release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a single aerosol can. The worst case scenario was based on one 18 oz. aerosol can containing 15% of propane and 15% of butane. The quantity released in a vapor cloud explosion would not affect any residential population or public receptor or have any off-site consequences.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\nLawson's Suwanee facility is subject to OSHA PSM rule.
