The worst case scenario was based on one 18 oz. aerosol can containing 15% of propane and 15% of butane. The quantity released in a vapor cloud explosion would not affect any residential population or public receptor or have any off-site consequences.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\nLawson's Suwanee facility is subject to OSHA PSM rule.
