Employees and contractors who work around ammonia should take the extra precautions of reviewing Material Safety Data Sheets and Standard Operating Procedures, as well as wearing appropriate clothing and personal protective gear.\n\nSafety Improvement Process:\nSafety improvement is a company wide philosophy.  Tyburn Railroad continuously searches for ways to improve safety performance.  Safety is discussed at employee meetings to determine safety concerns at the site.\n\nPrevention Policy Statement:\nTyburn Railroad uses a variety of safety equipment and procedures to prevent accidental releases of aqua ammonia.  In support of the policy, following is a typical list of systems employed at this facility:\n1) Risk Management\n2) Compliance Review and Training\n3) Material Handling \n4) Job Procedures and Training\n5) Emergency Response and Public Preparedness\n6) Product Stewardship\n\nTyburn Railroad uses a variety of safety equipment and specialized procedures to prevent accidental releases of aqua ammonia.\na) Excess flow shut off devices are incorporated throughout the process as prescribed by federal regulation.  These valves are designed to stop the flow of liquid material any time their rated flow capacity is exceeded, as well as prevent the catastrophic release attributed to a transfer line or valve break.\nb) Regular facility and equipment inspections ensure safe and proper operating conditions.\nc) Employees are trained in start-up, operation, shutdown, and maintenance of all equipment.  The facility has a copy of the written Standard Operating procedures that are required to perform these tasks, and employees are required to follow these procedures and encouraged to reference them as needed\nd) Employees and contractors receive safety and health training \ne) Investigation of any accident or injury with the development and impl"

The release event results from the entire contents of railcar emptying in 10 minutes.  The release would accumulate in a containment area large enough to hold the release.  The area impacted by the release could experience ammonia concentrations of 200 parts per million (ppm) or greater for a distance of 1.1 miles.  If a circle were to be drawn around the facility using this distance, this would produce a potential receptor population of about 5700 people.\n\nAlternate Case Release Scenario\nTyburn Railroad considered a conservative alternate release scenario, in which 10,000 pounds of aqua ammonia is released though a hose or hose connection failure.  This is equivalent to emptying a quarter full trailer load of aqua ammonia in 10 minutes.  The area impacted by the release could experience ammonia concentrations of 200 ppm or greater for a distance of 0.1 miles.  If a circle were drawn around the facility using this distance, this would produce a potential receptor population of about 50 people, and does not extend to any residential units.\n\nFive-Year Accident History:\nThe Tyburn Railroad facility has had no reportable incidents involving aqua ammonia for the past five years.\n\nEmergency Response Procedure"

Tyburn has operated this facility for the past 20 years, prior to which the facility was a Conrail operation.  Transloading operations allow regional customers to have materials shipped long distances by rail, transfer the material into trailers, and delivered to local destinations without rail access.  Both non-hazardous and hazardous materials are handled at this site, including anhydrous ammonia.  Anhydrous Ammonia is covered under a separate RMP submitted by Tanner Industries.  Aqua Ammonia (also known as ammonium hydroxide) will be a new product handled at the railyard beginning summer 2008\n\nTyburn Railroad is firmly committed to a fully effective implementation of the Risk Management Plan (RMP) as it applies to the safe handling and distribution of aqua ammonia.  Tyburn Railroad is neither a manufacturer nor distributor of aqua ammonia, but rather facilitates the safe handling of aqua ammonia for its customers who do distribute the material.  The material is transported to the facility by rail car and safely transloaded into appropriate trailers for hauling to our customers' pre-determined locations.\n\nBenefits and Uses of Ammonia:\nAmmonia is a basic chemical that has many common manufacturing and practical uses. The largest users of ammonia are agricultural industries. Ammonia is also used in pharmaceutical processes, in household cleaners, and for SC"

There is a procedure for the notification of local emergency response agencies and the public. Training is provided to all employees on the Emergency Response Plan and the emergency equipment available at the facility. This Emergency Response Plan is updated as often as necessary, but not less than once every three years.\n\nEmergency Response Policy Statement:\nThe owners, management and employees of Tyburn Railroad Company are prepared to cooperate with local emergency responders and other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of any release to the community, the environment, and our employees. To be prepared for any potential chemical accidents, our company communicates regularly with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and local fire departments.\n\nThe facility has a written emergency action plan in accordance with US Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) standard 29 CFR 1910.38. We have provided state and local authorities the Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know (EPCRA) information as required by the US Environmental Protection Agency's SARA Title III standard. Also, the company has an Emergency Response Program, in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.120 (q), including pre-emergency planning and employee, customer and, public emergency responder training programs that are specific to aqua ammonia.\n\nSheltering in place is considered to be a proven method for protecting people in the event of an accidental release. To Shelter-In-Place do the following:\n1) Move inside immediately (building or vehicle).\n2) Close all windows and doors.\n3) Turn off ventilation systems.\n4) Go into and seal a room (use tape, towels etc. to seal doors and windows if possible).\n5) Use radio, phone, etc. for communications.\n\nConclusions\nTyburn Railroad operates a well-managed facility with ample maintenance, training and emergenc"
