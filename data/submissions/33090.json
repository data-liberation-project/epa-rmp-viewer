      "SummaryText": "    Georgia-Pacific Resins, Inc. (GPRI), a wholly owned subsidiary of Georgia-Pacific Corporation, owns and operates a synthetic resin manufacturing facility in Columbus, Ohio which is referenced as the ?plant? throughout the remainder of the document. The facility is located on Watkins Road. The resin facility consists of a plant that was originally constructed in 1970.  Overall, the facility employs 49 full-time employees.\n    \n    GPRI is committed to operating the plant in a manner that is safe for its workers, the public, and the environment.  As part of this commitment, GPRI has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility.  One component of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the plant and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency?s (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMP Plan) describing the risk management program at the plant. This document is intended to satisfy the RMP Plan requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at the plant.\n    \n    The risk management program at the Plant consists of the following three elements:\n    \n?    a hazard assessment to help understand (a) the potential offsite consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and (b) accidents that have occurred during the last five years associated with the use of substances regulated by the RMP rule (regulated substances).\n    \n?    a prevention program to help maintain and safely operate the processes containing more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance (covered processes).\n    \n?    an emergency response program to help respond to accidental releases of regulated substances from covered processes\n    \n    Information further describing these elements is provided in this RMP Pla"

      "SummaryText": "n.\n    \n    Although the risk management program at the Plant helps provide assurance that the facility is maintained and operated in a safe manner, it is only one component of the safety program at the Plant.  In fact, the Plant has a comprehensive safety program in place establishing many levels of safeguards against release of a hazardous substance and injuries and damage from a release of a hazardous substance.\n    \n    GPRI limits the use of hazardous substances.  Before using a hazardous substance at the Plant, less hazardous alternatives are considered. When a hazardous substance is used at the Plant, GPRI considers the potential for this substance to adversely affect plant workers, the public, and the environment and takes steps to prevent any such effects.\n    \n    GPRI prevents releases of the hazardous substances used at the facility.  When a hazardous substance is used at the Plant, the equipment is carefully designed, built and operated to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release. Industry and government standards are closely adhered to in the design, construction, and operation of the equipment. \n    \n    GPRI limits damage from a release, if such a release occurs.  GPRI trains its workers to respond to an accidental release, reducing the consequences of a release if it occurs.  In addition, GPRI works with the Columbus Fire Department to help prevent injuries and/or environmental damage if a release does occur.\n    \n    The safety program at the Plant consists of a number of elements, only some of which are required by the RMP rule. This RMP Plan is primarily intended to describe those parts of the safety program at the Plant that are required by the RMP rule.\n    \n    \n1.1      Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n    GPRI is committed to the safety of workers and the public, and the preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.
