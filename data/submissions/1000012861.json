FRUIT CO., REEDLEY FACILITY, RISK & PROCESS SAFETY MANAGEMENT PROGRAM\nThe Giumarra Co. has prepared a Risk & Process Safety Management Program to comply with California's Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program (in California CCR Title 19, Chapter 4.5, Program Level 3 Elements, and Federally Title 40 CFR Part 68) and California OSHA's \"Process Safety Management (PSM) of Acutely Hazardous Materials\" standard (in California CCR Title 8, Section 5189, \"Process Safety Management of Acutely Hazardous Materials\" and Federally Title 29 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 1910.119).  The program addresses  risks involved with the presence of anhydrous ammonia in with excess of 10,000 lbs which is contained in our refrigeration system. \n\nOur program will promotes overall plant, worker, and public safety. The program enables the facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of anhydrous ammonia. Overall, the program is designed to prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid physical and/or property damage.\n\nOur company has an exemplary safety record, one that we are quite proud of.  Our program incorporates and brings together several existing safety programs which already set forth rules, procedures and practices which help our employees protect themselves and our neighbors.\n\n2. DESCRIPTION OF AMMONIA SYSTEM\nWe operate a Commercial Cold Storage of deciduous tree fruit - apricots, nectarines, peaches, plums, grapes, persimmons and kiwi fruit.  We store all of our packed product in cold storage.  Our facility has an ammonia system that provides refrigeration capacity to multiple cold rooms, some equipped with blast tunnels for cooling fruit.  Each cold room is equipped with \"bunker style\" evaporator coils that contain chilled liquid ammonia.  High pressure liquid from our main receiver is piped to each cold room, where it passes through a liquid feed valve to the low pressure refriger"

The high pressure discharge from the compressor is sent to a evaporative heat exchanger where the high pressure gas ammonia is liquified and returned to our receiver. \n\nThe ammonia system at our facility consists of vessels which are interconnected, or which are co-located such that a release of ammonia could impact the ability to operate vessels which are not directly connected.  Therefore, we are treating our facility as a single process.\n\n3. GENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE & AMMONIA SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\nThe ammonia refrigeration system at the Giumarra Co. is an integral part of the overall business.  It has a system charge of approximately 58,000 lbs. It is extremely important that it is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner.  Management is committed to making sure that all employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system/process is constantly being monitored by a refrigeration control system. The system consists of a computer which monitors many process variables, and allows remote control.  In the event of a system upset the computer actuates a dialing program that alerts key personnel and responders.  We have ammonia detectors which also trigger alerts.  The detectors are inspected weekly and serviced annually.  Our evaporator coils are also equipped with water defrost, which can be used to absorb released ammonia.  Water containing ammonia would be held in an onsite holding pond. In addition, the system/process is checked frequently by an outside highly qualified refrigeration contractor, who also performs annual pre-season preventative maintenance review of our system/process equipment.  \n\nWe inform employees of dangers associated with an accidental release of ammonia through employee orientation and employee safety meetings.  During these meetings we also discu"

These valves limit the operating pressures of the entire system, and prevent failures due to overpressurization.  Our program also includes a Five Year Relief Valve Replacement Program to ensure that we adhere to good industry standards.  \n\n4. FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThe Giumarra Co. facility at Reedley has not had any reportable accidents within the last five years.\n\n5. EMERGENCY ACTION PLAN\nOur facility subscribes to an Emergency Action Plan.  Employees are instructed to evacuate the building if an ammonia alarm is triggered and meet at either of the Designated Assembly Areas for a head count.  We have (2) two Assembly areas in the event the primary assembly area is affected by ammonia being released, the employees respond to the secondary assembly area.  Also the employees are instructed to consider environmental conditions when evacuating. At the beginning of the season when new employees have arrived and have received orientation, we review with all employees the evacuation procedures in the event of an emergency, including an ammonia release.  We have two (2) windsocks at our facility that employees can use to determine the \"upwind\" side of any point of release.  \n\n6. SAFETY\nGiumarra Bros. considers safety paramount and central to the core of our business.
