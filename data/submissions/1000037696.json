This Risk Management Plan (RMP) covers the Butane Blending System, including the associated piping and one 60,000 gallon butane storage vessels.  KMST owns the real property associated with the Butane Blending System.  Sunoco Partners Butane Blending, LLC (Sunoco) owns all the equipment associated with the Butane Blending System.  Sunoco and KMST each have operational responsibilities for the Butane Blending System.   Sunoco controls and monitors all butane blending operations remotely from its control center located near Houston, Texas, conducts all maintenance activities, and schedules the delivery of butane trucks.  KMST oversees the unloading of butane trucks into the storage vessel and conducts routine visual inspections.\r\n\r\nSunoco constructed the Butane Blending System in accordance with the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA Code) No. 58 (2011 Edition) for Liquefied Petroleum Gas Storage.  Sunoco designed, constructed, and maintains the Butane Blending System, in accordance with NFPA No. 58 and the manufacturer's instructions and recommendations.\r\n\r\nIt is the Parties' policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws/codes.  If an emergency were to occur, it is the Parties' policy to notify the Roanoke City Fire Department as well as the Virginia Department of Emergency Management.  Medical emergencies will require notification of the local Emergency Management Services and the Carilion Roanoke Memorial Hospital, Roanoke, Virginia, which is the nearest full service hospital/emergency department.\r\n\r\nThe Roanoke #1 Butane Blending System's worst case scenario is the failure of the system's 60,000 gallon butane storage vessel which equates to 3194 pounds of butane resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  The system's alternate (potential off-site impact) release scenario is a"

      "SummaryText": "BLEVE accident and associated fireball.\r\n\r\nThe Parties comply with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Accident Prevention Rules (40 CFR Part 68 Subpart D), the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard and associated 14 elements (29 CFR Part 1910.119), and all applicable state and local laws and regulations.  This facility has not had an accident involving butane which has resulted in deaths, injuries, property/environmental damage, evacuations or sheltering in place.\r\nIn the event of an emergency involving the Butane Blending System, it is the Parties' policy to initially contact the owner of the equipment - Sunoco and the local fire department.  The facility emergency response plans are coordinated with the local fire department.  The Roanoke City Fire Department personnel have participated in the initial RMP/PSM training session for this system.\r\n\r\nProcess safety controls include excess flow valves, low-melting point pneumatic valve feeds to pneumatic valves (fail closed), 85% fill shut-off (80% alarm and 90% ESD actuation) on the vessels, emergency shut-off devices on the system and video display terminal, line thermal/hydrostatic reliefs, and grounding interlock devices.  Additional vessel protection includes an intumescent coating.  Note: In contrast to the PSM requirements, this stationary source as defined under 40 CFR Part 68 is bounded by the off-load station and the points of injection. \r\n\r\nThe Parties actively seek employee input on process safety improvements.  Additionally, the Roanoke City Fire Department is contacted regarding participation in site emergency response drills. Additional actions include consolidating separate system inspection checklists for ease of completion."
