It is also our policy to work with the surrounding community and local emergency response agencies, and promote a spirit of cooperation and teamwork, to orchestrate an effective contingency plan in the unlikely event that a process incident occurs at one of our plants.\nPrimary Activity\nThe primary activity at the San Felipe Springs East Pump Station is municipal drinking water production.\nUse of Regulated Substances\nChlorine is used primarily as a disinfectant to ensure a safe drinking water supply.\nQuantities Handled or Stored\nChlorine: 8,000 pounds\nWorst-Case Release Scenario\nFailure of a ton container of  2,000 pounds of chlorine; 10 minute release mitigated by a factor of 0.55 because the process is sheltered by a building.  Under worst case weather, chlorine could travel 1.55 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public.\nAlternative Release Scenarios (ARS)\nFailure of a vacuum regulator check unit in the open position.  The release would be mitigated by an enclosure, resulting in a release rate of 5.8 pounds per minute, and an offsite distance of 0.26 miles.  This is about the most realistic release that would ever be expected to occur.  \nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nThe San Felipe Springs East Pump Station is in compliance with the RMP Rule, 40 CFR 68.  The San Felipe Springs East Pump Station has conducted a comprehensive review of all systems, as well as administrative, technical, operating and maintenance procedures, in addition to the other required program elements of the Rule. As a result of a Hazard Review at this plant, recommendations were developed to install or upgrade some "

Some of the recommendations are currently being implemented. Others are being prioritized and budgeted accordingly.\n? We will install a windsock at the plant facility.\n? We will formalize our Buddy System for hazardous substance work at the plant and update operator SOP training.\n? We will evaluate chlorine disinfection alternatives at the planned water treatment plant and ensure state and local fire codes (e.g. emergency scrubbing) are in place should gaseous chlorine remain the preferred alternative. \n? We will implement a more restrictive access to the facility.\n? We will obtain B-kits and train employees recurrently on B-kits and SCBAs. \n? We will update the plant security system by incorporating motion detectors into the SCADA system.\n\n"
