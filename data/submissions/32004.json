DWWTP is subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard and uses many elements of the PSM in its RMP accidental release prevention program. The primary safeguard for the chlorine and sulfur dioxide process is the on-duty operator. An operator is on-duty at DWWTP eight hours a day, seven days a week.\n\nThe DWWTP also has several programs in place to prevent accidental chlorine or sulfur dioxide releases. Specifically, the facility trains operators on the proper operation of the chlorination process, uses state-of-the-art safety equipment, and implements a preventive maintenance program to ensure the process equipment is operating properly.\n\nThe DWWTP has developed and implemented an Emergency Action Plan and an Emergency Operations Plan that contain provisions for trained employees to respond to incidental chlorine or sulfur dioxide releases. However, in the event that the release is beyond the control of the operators, personnel have a mechanism in place to notify the Fire Department for assistance. Equipment available for handling chlorine or sulfur dioxide leaks at the DWWTP includes Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA).

      "SummaryText": "RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nDeepwater Wastewater Treatment Plant\nPasadena, Texas\n\n\nThe Deepwater Wastewater Treatment Plant (DWWTP) has prepared and implemented a Risk Management Program in accordance with the Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions of 40 Code of Federal Regulation (CFR) Part 68 to prevent chlorine or sulfur dioxide exposure to DWWTP personnel and members of the community, as well as to the environment. The Risk Management Plan (RMP) encompasses all the elements of the Risk Management Program. Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the DWWTP emphasize safety, training, and maintenance.\n\nThe DWWTP is located in Pasadena, Texas, 10 miles east of Houston. Chlorine is used to disinfect wastewater and sulfur dioxide neutralizes the chlorine before discharge to the Houston Ship Channel. The facility treats an average flow of 2.4 million gallons per day (MGD) of wastewater and has the capacity to store approximately 10,000 pounds (lbs) each of chlorine and sulfur dioxide on-site at any one time. Both chlorine and sulfur dioxide at the facility are contained in five 1-ton containers that are on a standby/on-line basis to ensure the chlorination/neutralization process is continuous. Chlorine and sulfur dioxide is drawn from the 1-ton containers in a gaseous state.\n\nThe DWWTP preventive maintenance program maintains equipment related to chlorine and sulfur dioxide process to ensure it is fully operational.\n\nA worst-case scenario was estimated, per the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) guidance, to provide the greatest distance in any direction to the established toxic endpoint. The worst-case release quantity, established by the regulations, is the greatest amount of chlorine or sulfur dioxide held in a single vessel. The worst-case quantity of chlorine or sulfur dioxide at DWWTP was determined to be a 1-ton container. In accordance with 40 CFR Part 68.25, it is assumed that the gas is released over a"
