      "SummaryText": "Dyno Nobel, Inc. - Cheyenne Plant\n\nExecutive Summary\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe Dyno Nobel, Inc.- Cheyenne Plant (DNI) has been in continuous operation since 1965 with a commitment to safe operation and protection of workers and the general public.  The facility has actively implemented all of the elements of the OSHA Process Safety Management System to review the safety of processes that could pose a hazard to employees and the public.  These PSM policies define the manner in which the processes are maintained and inspected, operated, and modified.  The PSM policies also define the manner in which the processes are evaluated for safe operation and the training of the personnel employed to operate and maintain the facility.  Safe Work Procedures are in place for hot work, lock-out/tagout, line break, and hot tap work to prevent accidental releases and maintain the integrity of the equipment.\n\nIn the event that an accidental release were to occur, DNI has established an Emergency Response Plan which is used to guide the response.  The facility has a well-trained emergency services team comprised of fire fighters, medical personnel, hazardous materials technicians, and rescue personnel.

      "SummaryText": "c Action Steps\n\nA multi-faceted approach is used in the prevention of accidental releases in the facility. Equipment integrity is maintained by following proper design, fabrication, and installation, and maintenance practices and design codes.  Solid, well written operating procedures and training programs for personnel in the facility are used to prevent process upsets and equipment damage.   Continuous monitoring of the facility's processes is accomplished by both process operators and computer control to operate within equipment and process limitation.  Advisory alarms and emergency shutdown systems are designed and tested to automatically limit the potential for a release.  Incident investigations are used to learn the cause of both near misses and incidents so those corrective action steps may be implemented to prevent the future incidents.\n\nFollowing is a partial listing of chemical specific programs in the facility to prevent releases.   The use of portable ammonia specific detection equipment to detect and repair minor leaks in the facility.   Continuous monitoring of ammonia rail car unloading and truck loading by video cameras and personnel.  Spare ammonia refrigeration compressors capacity.  Chlorinators for delivery of chlorine to cooling water systems, which automatically stop the flow of chlorine in the event of a break in the delivery tubing.\n\nFive-year Accident History\n\nDNI has not experienced any releases with on or off-site consequences during the past five years.  \n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nDNI maintains a written emergency response program with procedures to address both large and small incidents.
