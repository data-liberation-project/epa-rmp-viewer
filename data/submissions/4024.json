One of the major chemical ingredients used in the pu foam manufacturing process is Toluene diisocyante (mixed isomers) (TDI), CAS #  26471-62-5. Our TDI inventory is maintained above 10,000 lbs.  In accordance with the provisions of 40 CFR 68 (Risk Management Program Regulations - RMP), the worst case scenario was defined as the rupture of, and the immediate spillage of, the contents of a TDI railcar into a concrete containment area.  The impact of this spill was evaluated using the ALOHA model and resulted in the area of concern being confined within the facility's property boundary with no public receptors being affected.  The release rate, calculated by the ALHOA model, was 0.0163 lbs./min.  This facility has a hazmat team, which will provide initial response to any and all spills, despite the substance or size.  This facility also has contracted professional emergency responders as back-up.  If required, the assistance of the Tupelo fire department hazmat team will be requested.  This facility's emergency response and contingency plan has been coordinated with the LEPC, local fire department and the local fire department hazmat commander.  All employees responsible for the handling and control of hazardous substances are provided initial and refresher training in proper procedures as required by EPA, OSHA and DOT standards and regul"
