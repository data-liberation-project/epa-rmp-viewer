This facility is known as the Delaware City Plant and is located on River Road, State Route 9.  The chlor-alkali facility consists of a plant which manufactures chlorine, caustic soda, caustic potash and hydrogen along with facilities to store,  load and ship chlorine.  The facility was originally constructed in 1965 and employs 135 full-time employees.\n\n1.  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at the Stationary Source  (' 68.155(a)):\n\nOxyChem is committed to operating the Delaware City Plant in a manner that is safe for its workers, the public and the environment.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal, State and local rules and regulations, industry standards and best practices.  As part of this commitment, OxyChem has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility, which includes the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  One component of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the Delaware City Plant and complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirement Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule), OSHA 1910.119,  and the State of Delaware Extremely Hazardous Substance Risk Management Act requirements (EHS rule).  This document is intended to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at the Delaware City Plant, while satisfying the RMP plan requirements of the RMP rule and the Delaware EHS rule.\n\nThe RMP at the Delaware City Plant consists of the following three elements:\n \n7 A hazard assessment to help understand (a) the potential off-site consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and (b) accidents t"

In fact, the Delaware City Plant has a comprehensive safety and environmental program in place, establishing many levels of safeguards against release of a hazardous substance as well as injuries and damage from such a release.\n\nOxyChem's policy on the use of hazardous substances:  Before using a hazardous substance at the Delaware City Plant, less hazardous alternatives are always considered.  When a hazardous substance is used at the plant, OxyChem reviews the potential for an accidental release of this substance which could adversely affect plant workers, the public and the environment, and takes steps to prevent any such effects.  This is accomplished through the facility's Management of Change (MOC) and Process Hazard Review (PHR) procedures which are followed for all new installations or modifications of existing processes.\n\nOxyChem strives to prevent accidental releases of the hazardous substances used at the facility:  OxyChem implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances. When a hazardous substance is used at the Delaware City Plant, the equipment is carefully designed, installed, operated and maintained to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release.  Industry and government standards are closely adhered to in"

OxyChem also uses the Corporate Fire, Safety and Environmental (FS&E) Guidelines when designing new or modifying existing processes.  Each project is thoroughly reviewed before approval. In addition, OxyChem requires the documentation of standard operating procedures and training of affected employees with regard to these procedures as part of the MOC procedure. OxyChem's mechanical integrity program provides an ongoing process to verify the mechanical integrity of the equipment, piping and instruments to prevent the release of hazardous substances.\n\nOxyChem's goal is to minimize impacts from an accidental release:  In the event of an accidental release, the Delaware City Plant controls and contains the release in a manner that will be safe for workers and will prevent impact to the public and the environment.  OxyChem utilizes emergency response plans as required by government regulation.  OxyChem trains its workers to respond to an accidental release, reducing the consequences of a release if it occurs.  The facility also maintains an active Chlorine Emergency Response Team which is on call 24-hours a day to respond to an accidental chlorine release.  OxyChem also has established a Special Situations Center in the Dallas corporate office to assist in all emergencies. In addition, the OxyChem Delaware City Plant works with the local fire department and local emergency planning committee (LEPC) to help prevent injuries and/or environmental damage if a release does occur.  The OxyChem Delaware City Plant has assisted the LEPC in writing and implementing the Delaware City Community Awareness and Emergency Response Plan (DC-CAER).\n\nThe Delaware City Plant's emergency response plan has been developed to meet the emergency planning, response and notification requirements of the Federal, OSHA, Delaware and EPA regulations.

The facility has implemented a Voluntary Protection Program (VPP) in which employee participation at all levels is required in designing, implementing and maintaining safety programs.  Safety is a primary concern in our facility and is demonstrated by our selection by OSHA in June, 1996 as the first and only OSHA Star facility within Delaware under OSHA's Voluntary Protection Program (VPP).\n\nOxyChem is an industry leader in the implementation of the Chemical Manufacturers Association's Responsible Care. Initiative. As part of OxyChem's Responsible Care. efforts, the Delaware City plant has voluntarily been involved in a Community Advisory Panel (CAP) since 1991. The purpose of this group is to share information about plant operations with members of the community and to discuss their concerns.  The group meets periodically and covers topics of interest to the members including plant safety and environmental performance, emergency response programs, health issues and process safety performance.  Through this outreach effort, as well as other community involvement, the plant stays abreast of community concerns and works to address them.\n\nIn order to effectively implement these policies, OxyChem established a management system headed by the Health, Environmental and Safety (HES) Department to oversee safety and environmental-related activities. \n\n\n2.

      "SummaryText": "ment.  The RMP rule requires the off-site consequence analysis to evaluate a \"worst-case release scenario \" and an \"alternative release scenario.\" Because a \"worst case scenario\" requires that all safety systems fail simultaneously, it is highly unlikely that such a worst-case release scenario would ever occur.  The alternative release scenarios are developed to help the LEPC improve the community emergency response plan.  \n\nThe RMP*COMP (TM) system was used to calculate the distance to the toxic endpoint (range of effect).  The meteorological data used for the modeling was the EPA default for the worst case and EPA suggested values for the alternative release scenario.  EPA's recommended Landview program was utilized to estimate the number of people living within this distance from the location of the storage tank.  USGS maps were utilized to identify the public and environmental receptors located within this distance.\n\nThe following information summarizes the off-site consequence analysis performed by the Delaware City Plant:\n\n3.1 Toxic Substances - Chlorine\n\nThe \"worst-case release scenario\" for chlorine is the failure of one of the largest chlorine storage tanks which would release 400,000 pounds of liquid chlorine in a 10-minute period as mandated by EPA.  It is assumed that the liquid chlorine vaporizes within the 10-minute time period.  The worst case release scenario was evaluated using RMP*COMP (TM) Ver. 1.06.  Under the EPA default worst weather conditions, the chlorine gas cloud would travel a distance of 20 miles before the concentration of chlorine was reduced to below 3 parts per million (ppm) (which is the 'endpoint' Emergency Response Planning Guideline value established in the RMP rule). The U.S. Census indicates that 585,780 people live within this distance from the chlorine storage tank.  Several public and environmental  receptors are also located within this distance. \n\nThe \"alternative case release scenario\" is the failure of a 1-inch loading h"

The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Specific Prevention Steps (' 68.155(d) ):\n\nSince 1990, the Delaware City Plant has used a prevention program to help prevent accidental releases of hazardous substances in compliance with the State of Delaware's Extremely Hazardous Substance Regulations.  Beginning in 1994, the plant revised this prevention program for the chlorine manufacturing and storage processes to comply with the 14 elements of the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) prevention program.  In 1996, the EPA RMP rule established two levels of prevention requirements:\n\nProgram 3 is essentially the same as OSHA PSM, except that the program also focuses on protecting the public and the environment outside the plant's fenceline;\n\nThe following sections briefly describe the elements of the Delaware City Plant's Program 3 prevention program that address EPA's RMP rule prevention program requirements.\n\n4.1 Program 3 Prevention Program\n\nThe Delaware City Plant's Program 3 prevention program consists of the following 12 elements:\n\n4.1.1  Process Safety"
