In fulfilling this commitment KRO will provide and maintain a safe and healthy work environment as indicated by acceptable business practices and compliance with legislative requirements and will strive to eliminate any foreseeable hazards that could result in fires, security losses, damage to property and personal injuries or illnesses.  All management functions including business, line and associated management will comply with Kettle River Operations' loss prevention requirements as they apply to the design operation and maintenance of facilities and equipment.  All employees will perform their jobs properly in accordance with established procedures and operating philosophy.\n\nThe KRO facility's primary activity is gold mining, concentrating and refining.  Two regulated substances, sulfur dioxide and propane are present at the facility above 40 CFR 68 threshold quantities.  Sulfur dioxide is used in a patented process to transform cyanide into various non-toxic nitrogen compounds before the treated mill effluent is stored in a tailings facility.  The maximum inventory of our sulfur dioxide storage process is 150,000 pounds. \n\nAdministrative controls and mitigation measures that limit the extent of such a release include tank-filling procedures and training, automatic shutoff valves, release monitors and alarms, transfer-line handling procedures, and tank-level and pressure restrictions. Administrative controls for sulfur dioxide include a safety-based tank-level restriction such that the tank is never filled beyond 87 percent of its total capacity.  \n\nKRO has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention and emergency response requirements set out under 40 CFR 68.  A hazard review was conducted to identify hazards associated with Sulfur Dioxide storage and handling, opportunities for equipment malfunc"

KRO uses standard operating procedures that provide clear instructions for safely conducting activities associated with the Sulfur Dioxide process, including initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdowns, normal shutdowns, startup following a normal or emergency shutdown, consequences of deviations and steps to correct or avoid deviations, and equipment inspections.  KRO also provides training and competency testing for all employees assigned to this process.  Written maintenance procedures are designed to ensure the ongoing mechanical integrity of the Sulfur Dioxide process equipment, and maintenance personnel are provided with training in the hazards of the process and how to avoid or correct unsafe conditions.  The process equipment is inspected and tested in accordance with the manufacturer's specifications.  Regular compliance audits are conducted to ensure Kinross Gold Co. A? Kettle River Operations remains in compliance with the RMP Rule prevention program requirements. \n\nDue to the stringent release prevention policies, there has been no accidental release during the past five years.\n\nKettle River's emergency response plan addresses accidental releases of hazardous materials, as well as other concerns such as first aid and emergency medical treatment, evacuations, and notification of local emergency response agencies.  Procedures for the use and inspection of emergency response equipment are outlined by various state and federal agencies such as the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA).  MSHA also requires training for all employees in emergency response procedures and other safety issues.  KRO holds monthly safety meetings for all employees plus an additional 40 minutes of area-specific safety training for thei"
