Staff, support all the activities and prper actions required in order to comply with the regulationsand Health Administration, the  Department of Transportation  and the Local Fire Department.  Our preention program was develop mostly with information gathered from the differente chlorine Institute pamphlets and from our suppliers of Chlorine (Jones Chemical), and Caustic Soda (PPG).  Our emergency response plan includes the participation of the Plant opertors, the Engieer in Charge, the Fire Department and the Local Civil Defense Ofice.  All safety, heath, prevention and emergency information is available to the public in the Fire Department, Civil Defense Office and the Local Health Department.  We consider that the most imprtant element related to the accident prevention  program and the emergency response plan, is the people knowledge of the, product-process-equipment (operational & safety), involved in theis oepration.  We expect to accopmplish this thru continuous training and practice.   II- The sodium hypoclorite manufacturing facility at our site, stated in July 1997.  Our products is registered and regulated by the EPA and the Agricultural Dept.  As a pesticied.  Recently was certified by the National Standard Foundation for drinking water desinfection and can be used also for waste water disifection.  The location is outside-north (Road # 185) the urban zone of the city of Junocs, PR  The manufacturing process combine the use of tanks, pumps, pipelines, valves, heat aexchangers, chiller and process control devices.  Raw materials used are:  Caustic Soda 50% liguied, Chlorine (liquified gas) in 2000 lbs. Containers.  We store some 150 lbs. Chlorine for resales.  Chlorine is a toxic gas that acan cause demage to human, animal and vegatation.  There are always two person in the plant when in operation.  The process of manufacturing "

      "SummaryText": "sodium hypoclrite is by the injection of chlorine to diluted casutics soda, ata the required level.  We stored aproximately 50 tons containers and 22, 150 lbs. Cylinders.  There is a Chlorine alarm detector and the proper safety equipment available in the plant.  Plant operators are well trained in the use of both, process and safety equipment.  III - We used the RMP* Comp version 1.06 to determine the distance endpoint for both, Worst Case and Alternative Release Scenarios.  The WCS assumes the ocmplete failure of the largest  vessel at the faility, int he case a 2,000 punds cylinder, in  10 minutes.  The release rate of 200 punds per min.  With no mitigation measures in a  rural zone was used.  Estimated distance to endpoint is 3.0 miles for toxic level of 0.0087 mg/L (ERPG-2).   Other assumptions were: wing speed of 1.5 meters/sec., stability class -  F and temperature  of 77 egress F. The estimated residential  population to toxic endpoint obtaied was 24,400, using the 1990 US Census.  Public receptors includes, schools, residences, hospitals, correctionals facilities, recreation, commercial, office and industiral areas.  The ARS assumes a break in a 1/2 in. Pipeline.  Relase duration of 10 sec., for a flow rate of 30 punds/min.  With no migratin measures in a rural zone was used.  Estimated distance to toxic endpoint is 0.8 miles for 0.0087 mg/l (ERPG-2).  Other assumptions were speed of 3 meter/sec., stability class D and a temperature of 77 degress  F.  The estimated residential population to toxic endpoint obtain was 1,100 using the 1990 US Census.  Public receptors in both cases, environmental receptors includes National Forests and Wilderness areas.  IV - The most important practices in our accident release prevention program are as follow:  We will always use containers, hose, clamps, adapters, valves, pipies, emergency kits, wrenches, SCBA and other related equipment to handle Chlorine, that are approved by the DOT, OSHA and the Chlorine Institute.   - O"

      "SummaryText": "pereators will be continuously trained in the use of above equipment.  There will always be two operators when chlorinating.  We will keep periodic inspections and corrective actions to our containers, process control devices and operational and safety equipment.  Unauthorized personell will be restricted to the plant.  Hot works forbidden in the presence of cylinders, areas will be cleared of chlorine cylinders previous to work.  No more than one ton container connected at a time.  Chlorine injection rated of no more than 30 pounds per minute.  Safety equipment like SCBA and Emergency Kits will be in working conditins and available at any time.  We will work in accordance with the recommendations of the Chlorine Institute.  Chlorine alarm detector to be in working conditions all the time.  We monitor vessel conditions and hydrostatic compliance.   V - No accidental release of chlorine have occurred since the start up of the operation 1997.   VI - We have an emergency response program in place since July 1997 that includes the support from  various local agencies like the Fire Dept. And the Civil Defense.  We review it every year and include trainings on the use of SCBA and Chlorine Institute Emergency Kits \"A\" and \"B\".  We perform drills with our own operators.  We will conduct a drill every year in coordination with the local agencies starting in June 1999."
