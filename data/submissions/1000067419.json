The material is used to produce water treatment chemicals and is stored in a protected area and isolated from combustion sources.\r\n\r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the program is to define steps that are taken to identify, evaluate and prevent or mitigate releases of hazardous chemicals that could occur as a result of failures in processes, procedures or equipment.  The prevention program includes elements that include:  1) compilation of process safety information related to the process; 2) performance of process hazard review to identify and evaluate potential release scenarios; 3) development and use of operating procedures and safety procedures; 4) processes for ensuring training of employees who are involved in handling hazardous chemicals; 5) preventive maintenance for key equipment to limit the potential for failures that could cause releases; 6) processes for managing changes in the process; 7) conducting incident investigations for any release events that may occur, and 8) compliance audits of the implementation of the prevention program.\r\n\r\nThe Five-Year Accident History:\r\n\r\nThe Suez WTS New Philadelphia plant has had no accidental"
