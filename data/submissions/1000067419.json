Similarly, our raw materials which we receive from suppliers come in various containers depending on customer demand for the product and the amount necessary to meet supply limitations and production demand.\n\n\n\nThe Suez WTS New Philadelphia plant covers 14.7 acres of property, or which 3.1 acres is used for offices, warehouse(s), production facilities and outdoor material storage.  The balance is used for access roads, parking lot and open lawn or idle areas.  The regulated substance at the facility is Cyclohexylamine, and it is a raw material stored onsite as a liquid in a bulk storage tank.  The material is used to produce water treatment chemicals and is stored in a protected area and isolated from combustion sources.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:\n\n\n\nThe purpose of the program is to define steps that are taken to identify, evaluate and prevent or mitigate releases of hazardous chemicals that could occur as a result of failures in processes, procedures or equipment.  The prevention program includes elements that include:  1) compilation of process safety information related to the process; 2) performance of process hazard review to identify and evaluate potential release scenarios; 3) development and use of operating procedures and safety procedures; 4) processes for ensuring training of employees who are involved in handling hazardous chemicals; 5) preventive maintenance for key equipment to limit the potential for failures that could cause releases; 6) processes for managing changes in the process; 7) conducting incident investigations for any release events that may occur, and 8) compliance audits of the implementation of the prevention program.\n\n\n\nThe Five-Year Accident History:\n\n\n\nThe Suez WTS New Philadelphia plant has had no accidental "
