These documents are considered a minimum standard by Sorrento Management.  In addition, the facility personnel utilize the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) standards for equipment inspections and operation.\n\n\n\nThe emergency action procedures for the Sorrento Lactalis facility are documented in an emergency action plan that integrates requirements of 29 CFR 1910.38(a) \"Emergency Action Plan\", 40 CFR Part 355 \"Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know\", and the standards referenced above.  The integration of these programs increases the usefulness of the emergency preparedness activities by decreasing the burden associated with maintaining multiple programs.  In general, Sorrento performs incidental release mitigation with properly trained in-house personnel; however, local emergency response agencies handle all major emergencies including community notification procedures when needed.  Sorrento conducts on-site training with the local emergency responders to assure their ability to safely respond to an emergency at the Sorrento Facility.\n\n\n\nThe regulatory stationary source is considered to be the entire Sorrento Lactalis, Inc. facility located at 4912 E. Franklin Road in Nampa, Idaho.   The stationary source manufactures various dairy products and utilizes anhydrous ammonia in a refrigeration process in quantities exceeding the threshold quantity under 40 CFR Part 68. The ammonia refrigeration processes for the Nampa Sorrento Lactalis facility utilizes 54,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia to function as the heat transfer medium.  This is split between the Cheese Plant and the Whey Plant. The Cheese Plant's refrigeration process has 37,000 pounds and the Whey Plant has 17,00"
