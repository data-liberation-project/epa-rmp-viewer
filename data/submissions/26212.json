This update is designed to reflect changes to equipment and process in the LAR since the last RMP submission and include changes scheduled for implementation up through January/February 2003.  These changes are being implemented to comply with the new California Reformulated Fuels Gasoline regulations.  This RMP document complies with the requirements of the following regulations:\n\n                U.S. EPA in 40CFR 68 for Risk Management Programs.\n\nThe refinery is required to meet the requirements Program Level 3 for this regulation because the covered processes in the refinery\n\na) do not meet the eligibility requirements for Program Level 1 as defined,\nb) have a NAICS which is listed for Program Level 3, and \nc) are subject to the OSHA PSM standard in 29CFR1910.119.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe Shell Oil Products U.S., Los Angeles Refinery has a long-standing commitment to worker, public, and environmental safety.  Resources invested in accident prevention, such as the training of personnel and the consideration of safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes, demonstrate this commitment.  The LAR mission statement is \u00bfto lead the industry in safety, environmental and financial performance through the development and participation of all employees\u00bf.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent potential releases of regulated substances.  However, should a release occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release to the greatest extent possible.\n\nThe LAR process units and physical systems including the tank farm are divided into four areas referred to \u00bfasset areas\u00bf.

In addition to the asset areas, there are five technical departments at LAR.  The overall RMP Program responsibility resides with the LAR Refinery Manager.  The specific responsibility for the development and implementation of each RMP element is with the various asset area and technical department managers. The refinery has also designated the PSM/RMP Coordinator as the qualified person, who is responsible for coordinating the Process Safety Management and Risk Management Program activities.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE REFINERY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Los Angeles Refinery is located in an area that is zoned for heavy industrial use.  The 299-acre refinery is divided by Pacific Coast Highway with most of the facility located to the north of the highway.  Sepulveda Boulevard and the GATX Petroleum Company bound the northern portion of the refinery with Alameda Street and the Southern Pacific railroad tracks to the west and the Dominguez Channel to the east.  The area south of Pacific Coast Highway is a triangle-shaped parcel that approaches Anaheim Boulevard to the south and is bounded by Dominguez Channel to the east, and by the Shell LPG Marketing Sales Terminal to the west.\n\nThe refinery processes approximately 100,000 barrels of crude oil per day, through a variety of operations, including hydrocracking, hydrotreating, fluid catalytic cracking, delayed coking, and alkylation.  The products of the refinery include various petroleum products, such as liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), gasoline, jet fuel, and diesel fuel.   \n\nFor the purposes of the RMP, we have divided the refinery into four geographical areas based on the proximity of the covered processes to the various public receptors.  These areas and their covered processes are presented in Table 1. \n\nBased on threshold quantities listed for regulated toxic substances in the RMP Rule, LAR handles two r"

Included was an examination of all the vessels and storage tanks within the processes to determine those with largest quantities of regulated substances.  Calculations were made of the inventories in all of the largest vessels in the covered processes with the vessels with the largest inventories of regulated toxic and flammable materials being selected.  \n\nIn selecting hypothetical worst-case release scenarios, additional consideration was given to high-pressure and high-temperature process vessels and those located near the refinery fence lines.  This approach takes into consideration smaller inventories that may result in greater distances from the refinery fence line for the specified toxic endpoint.  Also, consideration was given to those vessels that contain relatively high concentrations of hydrogen sulfide mixed with hydrocarbons. \n\nOnce these vessels were identified, the EPA\u00bfs RMP*CompTM was used to determine the distance to the endpoints for the worst-case release scenarios.  Vulnerability zones were drawn from the endpoint distances calculated.  A vulnerability zone is defined as a circle whose center is the point of release and its radius is the length of the endpoint plume, which is predicted by the dispersion model (e.g., RMP*CompTM).  Cases were selected that resulted in the largest vulnerability zones from the refinery areas into the vicinities of the public sectors around the refinery.  \n\nSeveral possible consequences from the release of flammable substances were considered, including flash fire, pool fire, BLEVE, and vapor cloud explosion.  All these possibilities were analyzed, and it was concluded that a vapor cloud explosion was the most appropriate consequence for the worst-case analysis of the flammable releases.  \n\nFour hypothetical worst-case release scenarios have been sel"

In this update, the toxic worst case scenarios have not changed from the previous RMP submission.  The worst-case scenario for flammable substances has been changed due to the construction of a new pentane sphere whose vulnerability zone exceeds the boundaries of the prior flammability scenario. Although completely within the bounds of the new flammable worst-case scenario's vulnerability zone, the previous flammable worst case scenario is being retained due to its breadth of exposure.\n\nALTERNATIVE RELEASE ANALYSIS\n\nAlternative scenarios are potential release cases that may result in vulnerability zones that extend beyond the refinery boundary.  The process of alternative release scenario identification was initiated with the review of the worst-case release cases.  Other vessels containing various quantities of regulated substances were then reviewed.  These were considered to have a higher likelihood of release.  In this process, all covered processes were reviewed and candidate cases for the alternative release scenario analysis were subsequently selected.  \n\nOnce the list of candidate scenarios was developed, computer dispersion analysis programs were used to model the selected scenarios.  (RMP*Comp was the primary model used; PHAST 5.2 was also used in 1999 to assess more complicated release scenarios such as combined hydrocarbon and toxic substance release.)  A review of the vulnerability zones resulting from the analysis of the alternative release scenarios then conducted.  In the alternative release scenario analysis, site-specific meteorological data were used.  The size of release was estimated from a hole-size that would result from equipment or pipe failure.

In general, 20 minutes was a reasonable response time to stop most releases at the refinery.  In some cases, the duration of the release was shorter, which was dictated by the inventory of the material in the vessel(s) connected to the equipment.  The concept was to include at least one scenario for each toxic (ammonia and hydrogen sulfide) and one for the flammable materials for the refinery as a single stationary source.  On the other hand, because the size of the refinery makes it adjacent to several communities, the refinery wanted to include scenarios that could potentially impact those communities.  As a result, we selected four alternative release scenarios for toxic substances and six cases for flammable.  \n\nIn this update, none of the toxic or the flammable alternate release scenarios has changed from the previous RMP submission.  Additional alternate release scenarios are being added due to modifications at the refinery where vulnerability zones extend into regions previously unaffected by the previous alternate release scenarios.  \n\nACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe LAR plant has experienced three incidents during the last five years that meet the RMP requirements for the five-year accident history:\n\n- Delayed Coking Unit (DCU) Fire in 2000.  This incident resulted in one serious contractor injury and minor equipment damage.  There were no offsite damages or injuries reported.\n\n- Catalytic Reforming Unit 3 (CRU-3) Fire in 2000.

Special groups, committees and individuals have been identified as having PSM responsibilities at the refinery. Nevertheless, all employees are encouraged to raise specific suggestions or concerns related to process safety management by contacting their immediate supervisor or the PSM coordinator.  The LAR Employee Participation Program is described in Standing Instruction PSM-1.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nAt the LAR, we have compiled process safety information for all processes containing hazardous or regulated materials as required by state and federal regulations, such as PSM, RMP, and CalARP.  This information has to do with process chemicals, technology, and equipment used in the handling, storage, and processing of regulated hazardous substances. Additionally, this compiled process safety information is used in the LAR PSM program as a resource for the teams performing process hazard analyses.  The information can also be helpful for the trainers who develop the training programs and the operating procedures, for the contractors whose employees will be working with the refinery processes, and for emergency responders in preparing for response should a release occur.  Standing Instruction PSM-2 that describes the Management of Change procedure also contains a roadmap to assist the user in finding the process safety information.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nA primary element of the LAR Prevention Program is the Process Hazard Analysis, or PHA.  The PHA is performed to identify hazards in a process. Through this process, information is obtained that will help impro"

Because of the size and complexity of many of the refinery processes, the HAZOP methodology has been selected as the most appropriate PHA method in conducting the PHA for each process.  A HAZOP team at LAR typically consists of a process engineer, an experienced operator, an instrument & electrical engineer/technician, a mechanical engineer, and other part-time team members.  The team leader (a.k.a. the HAZOP facilitator) is fully knowledgeable in the proper implementation of the HAZOP methodology.  Part-time team members typically provide specialized expertise in areas such as safety and health, and equipment inspection/metallurgy/corrosion.  Standing Instruction PSM-3 summarizes the LAR procedure for conducting PHAs.\n\nOperating Procedures\nThe LAR provides written operating procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as: process startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, normal shutdown, and initial startup of a new process.  The operating procedures describe tasks to be performed, data to be recorded, operating conditions to be maintained, samples to be collected, and safety and health precautions to be taken.  The LAR takes steps to update the procedures to reflect current operations and the procedures are certified annually by the operating staff.  In addition, operating procedures are updated when there are any changes in the process as a result of the management of change procedures.  \n\nTraining\nAnother primary element of the LAR Prevention Program is Training.  The training program consists of both job skill (qualification) and safety training.  The qualification training programs are described in the Standing Instructions of O-43 (Operation Training Policy) and M-41 (Maintenance Training Policy), which clearly establish the goals and objectives that the refinery wishes to ach"

The job skill training is presented in various forms and degrees and is dependent on the skills required for the employee's job or position.  The purpose of this training is to elevate the aptitude and knowledge of the operation and maintenance personnel of the process control and technology used and the equipment operated in the refinery.  All employees, including maintenance and contractor employees, involved with highly hazardous chemicals and regulated substances are provided with safety training.  The goal of the safety training is to provide information to the workers so they will understand the recognized hazards of the processes and chemicals that they work with and around.   \n\nContractors\nThe Los Angeles Refinery has established the Contractor Safety Program (Standing Instruction SAF-30) as a screening process that helps identify and select contractors who will perform work in and around processes that involve hazardous chemicals.  Such contractors must have the appropriate skills, knowledge, and certifications for the job tasks which they are being employed.  For contractors whose safety performance on the job is not known, the LAR obtains information on injury and illness rates and references regarding the contractor.  An evaluation is also conducted of contractor work methods and experiences.  Thus, contractors without safety programs or with unacceptable safety records will not be invited to perform works at the LAR.\n\nManagement of Change\nThe LAR has implemented a Management of Change (MOC) procedure (Standing Instruction PSM-2) to manage changes to the refinery units.  Changes are defined as modifications to equipment, procedures, raw materials, or processing conditions other than replacement in kind\u00bf.  \nPSM-2 includes modifications in the operating procedures that contain operating parameters such as pressure limits, tem"

The Management of Change procedure also covers changes in process technology and changes to equipment and instrumentation.  Changes in process technology can result from changes in production rates, raw materials, experimentation, equipment unavailability, new equipment, new product development, change in catalyst and changes in operating conditions to improve yield or quality.  Equipment changes include, among others, change in materials of construction, equipment specifications, capacity, piping pre-arrangements, experimental equipment, computer program revisions, and changes in alarms and interlocks.  \nTemporary changes are also subject to the management of change provisions in PSM-2 and the procedure also insures that the equipment and operating procedures are returned to their original or designed conditions at the end of the temporary change.\n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews\nA pre-startup safety review (PSSR) is carried out in conjunction with an MOC or a new project or construction.  The PSSR is conducted before implementing a modification to a process, or commissioning a new project.  \nAs it is LAR practice to conduct a PHA for various types of changes and for all new projects, there could be some recommendations resulting from the PHA that are required to be addressed before implementation.  A PSSR is carried out in the form of a checklist to comply with requirements of the applicable regulations.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nA mechanical integrity program is in place for the continued integrity of process equipment at LAR.  Equipment used to process, transfer or store hazardous chemicals have been designed, constructed, installed, and maintained to reduce the likelihood of accidental releases.

Elements of the mechanical integrity program are as follows: (1) categorization of equipment and instrumentation, (2) inspection and testing program, (3) maintenance program, (4) documentation, and (5) quality assurance program.\n\nHot Work Permit\nAll non-routine work, and some routine work, conducted in process areas at the refinery are controlled using specific company instructions, described in the Standing Instructions SAF-4 (Hot Work Permits), SAF-3 (Safe Work Permits), and SAF-5 (Entry Work Permit). Although the three permit programs are mutually dependent, the regulations only specify the Hot Work Permit which is discussed below.\nA hot work permit describes the steps that operating, maintenance and contractor personnel must follow to obtain the necessary clearance to perform different types of work involving hot surfaces, flame, or energized equipment.  The hazards identified for the work being performed are communicated to those personnel performing the work and also to those personnel who may be affected by the work being performed, especially when the work being performed could affect the safety of the process.  The hot work permit procedures refer to and coordinate the following procedures and authorizations, as applicable: lockout/tagout, line breaking, and confined space entry.\n\nIncident Investigation\nStanding Instruction SAF-11 outlines the LAR incident investigation procedure.  It applies to the investigation of different types of incidents that may occur in the facility.

The incident report, its findings and recommendations are entered in the incident investigation tracking system, which can be accessed by all employees, and also distributed to others who can benefit from the information.\n\nCompliance Audits\nIn compliance with Shell's corporate policies, the refinery has implemented an Environmental, Health, and Safety Compliance Assurance Program.  The program helps to verify that LAR's programs and practices comply with applicable laws and regulations. Every three years, the refinery undergoes an Environmental Audit, a Health and Safety Compliance Audit, and PSM/RMP Compliance Audits  conducted by Shell Corporate staff.  The audit approach includes the following steps: (1) pre-audit preparation, (2) on-site field review, and (3) post-audit follow-up.  The audit team is composed of qualified staff from whom a leader will be assigned to be responsible for these steps.\n\nCHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe accident prevention programs summarized previously apply to all the covered processes and their related hazards.  These programs help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures or human errors.  In addition to the accident prevention program activities, LAR has safety features on many units to help contain or control potential releases, quickly detect a release, and reduce (mitigate) the potential consequences of a release.

For example, the refinery phased out chlorine used for cooling water treatment and replaced it with bleach.  Also, a hydrogen production process has been shut down thereby eliminating the presence of a dilute gas (a mixture of hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide) in an underground line.  This project also resulted in the reduction of anhydrous ammonia consumption by over 30%.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\n\nThe Los Angeles Refinery has implemented an emergency response program (ERP) to prepare for potential incidents, respond to them effectively, and recover from their impacts.
