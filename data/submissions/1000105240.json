This program follows the requirements set forth in 29 CFR 1910.119:\n1) Employees participate in the elements of this safety and release prevention program wherever possible;\n2) Adequate training is provided for operators and maintenance personnel;\n3) Process Safety Information (PSI) including P&IDs, operating procedures, safe operating limits are maintained on the ethylene system and associated hazards;\n4) A Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) of the ethylene system was conducted using HAZOP/What-if methodology and are periodically reviewed to ensure adequacy of controls; \n5) The Mechanical Integrity program ensures the system continues to operate as designed;\n6) Operating and Maintenance procedures provide operators and maintenance staff the information necessary to safely operate and maintain the system;\n7) Contractors working on or near the ethylene system are selected for safety performance, and are briefed on the hazards and safety requirements of the job;\n8) Hot Work Permits are required whenever welding, cutting, grinding or other activities are conducted that could generate sparks and start a fire;\n9) The Management of Change (MOC) program is implemented to manage and document changes to the ethylene system and approved prior to the work being conducted;\n10) Pre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSR) are conducted prior to restart of the system after modifications to ensure that impacts of the change are addressed;\n11) Incident investigations are conducted for incidents involving ethylene releases and near misses that endanger employees or the public, if such an incident were to occur;\n12) Compliance Audits will be conducted every three years to ensure that the prevention program is meeting its objectives;\n13) Emergency Planning and Respo"

Ethylene is being used in the manufacture of an ethylene/maleic anhydride (EMA) co-polymer product that is used in the glass fiber industry. The ethylene is stored under pressure in two (2) transport tube trailers, each capable of holding approximately 14,000 pounds of ethylene. The ethylene is connected directly from the transport trailer to the manufacturing operation through a piping manifold located in the EMA facility.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program:\nAs part of the compliance effort with OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard (29 CFR 1910.119) and Michigan's Department of Labor (R325.18302) regulations, the Zeeland facility has completed detailed reviews of critical plant operations in order to assess their inherent safety readiness. These programs are specifically aimed at minimizing and/or eliminating the consequences of catastrophic releases. This is done by stating the policies and procedures for the management of process hazards in design, construction, start-up, operation, inspection, maintenance, employee training, and emergency response.\n\nKey to the success of these programs is the active involvement and participation of the employees in the completion of the process hazard analyses. The facility\u0092s commitment to the use of the latest process hazard analysis techniques, detailed and accurate procedures and regular employee training, ensures that each critical safety component of ch"

Employees are trained to evacuate their respective areas in accordance with OSHA 1930.38(a). The facility has capability to communicate with appropriate organizations in the event of an emergency. This provides a means for notifying of an incident and facilitating quick response. \n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\nThe facility plans to implement safety improvements driven by the most recent PHA and compliance audit. These changes include additional instrumentation, improvements in mechanical integrity procedures, revisions to the emergency response plan, and additional employee training."
