Chlorine and sulfur dioxide cylinders are received, stored, and shipped to public and private water and wastewater treatment facilities. Two chemicals, chlorine, and sulfur dioxide are stored at the facility in sufficient quantities to be subject to the\n\nrequirements of 40 CFR Part 68. The facility stores 150-pound and 2,000-pound cylinders of chlorine, and 150-pound and 2,000-pound cylinders of sulfur dioxide. Chlorine and sulfur dioxide detection systems are present at the facility.\n\n\n\nFive-Year Release History\n\nNo incidents to report.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nCertain abnormal situations require rapid and correct response to limit the potential for personnel injury, damage to plant equipment or the environment. The emergency response program is intended to provide a description of necessary responses and assigned duties for designated personnel to minimize effects of\n\nthe emergency incident. This response plan is specific to a chemical release, which would have the potential to cause risk to the public or the environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n"
